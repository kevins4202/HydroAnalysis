11160,hai he basin is located in the densely populated north china plain that is providing food to more than 100 million people the fast developing agriculture and urbanization in hai he basin have resulted in discharging nutrient rich wastewater into lakes and reservoirs leading to eutrophication and water scarcity such as in guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in this study we analyzed future trends in nutrient inputs into guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake by applying the marina model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas model we analyzed trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business as usual scenario ssp3 and a scenario based on current environmental policies cep in addition we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients the 2022 olympic winter games in the guanting basin oly scenario and the development of xiong an in the baiyangdian basin urb scenario finally we assumed implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers oly and urb our study has five main findings first nutrients in guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake were mainly from agriculture in 2012 second nutrient export doubles between 2012 and 2050 in ssp3 third effective implementation of current environmental policies could reduce the future pollution to levels below that in 2012 fourth improved sewage systems associated with the 2022 winter olympic games could not reduce nutrient pollution effectively in guanting reservoir indicating that reducing nutrient losses from agriculture may be more effective to improve water quality than urban waste water treatment fifth urbanization in the baiyangdian basin may increase river export of nutrients to the lake by 28 43 compared to the cep scenario urb scenario highly effective waste treatment is needed not only in xiong an but also in surrounding areas to ensure the availability of clean water urb scenario our results could improve our understanding of nutrient management for specific lakes and reservoirs and highly relevant for policy making for effective environmental policies keywords water pollution agriculture marina model scenarios guanting reservoir baiyangdian lake 1 introduction the basin of the hai he river located in north china plain is densely populated and provides food to more than 100 million people in china the hai he basin is one of three grain production areas of china with 0 1 million km2 of arable land sun et al 2017 the basin has been developing in recent years with a fast economic growth and a rapid urbanization hao et al 2007 as a result waste water discharge from urban households to surface waters via sewage systems is large in addition the increasing food demand intensified agricultural production in hai he basin nitrogen n and phosphorus p use increased in crop and animal production however these nutrients are not used efficiently because of poor nutrient management leading to overuse of synthetic fertilizers and discharge of animal manure as a waste product strokal et al 2016 this led to large n and p losses from agriculture to rivers lakes and reservoirs causing water pollution many models exist to quantify nutrient flows to aquatic systems ranging from the field to the basin and to the global scale beusen et al 2016 fink et al 2018 mayorga et al 2010 strokal and vries 2012 unep 2016 some models have been applied in the individual basins of china such as global news 2 mayorga et al 2010 marina strokal et al 2016 image gnm beusen et al 2016 several models have been used to estimate nutrient inputs to lakes and reservoirs in china such as miyun reservoir doting lake and dianchi lake ceng and wang 2017 dong et al 2018 hou et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 the models used in lakes and reservoirs focus on nutrient losses from diffuse sources especially agriculture such as the export coefficient model zhang et al 2018 swat gassman et al 2014 hspf chen et al 2013 and agnps shen et al 2012 however no models exist that can calculate river export of n and p in different forms to chinese lakes or reservoirs by source and by sub basin the marina model quantifies river export of nutrients by sources and by sub basin but for the large six rivers in china and not for lakes and reservoirs and studies are lacking to predict nutrient losses from land to lakes and reservoirs under future scenarios which assess possible future climate regimes representative concentration pathways rcps and also socio economic changes shared socio economic pathways ssps a better understanding of river export to lakes and reservoirs and nutrient source attribution in sub basin scale is needed for effective region specific environmental policies it can help the government and water managers to implement more precise policies in specific water systems and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies under future climate and socio economic changes since 1949 the environmental policy system in china has developed from general principles to specific guidance documents shmeleva and wang 2011 in recent years the concept of environmental protection in china has changed from separated pollution control to integrated watershed management the chinese government has published series of practical policies to protect water systems and demonstrates willingness to a more sustainable future however whether these policies will be effective in improving nutrient use efficiencies and reducing nutrient losses to surface water systems in future is not well understood thus it is necessary to analyze pollution of water systems in the hai he basin especially for such new district i e xiong an and to assess how effective current environmental policies are to reduce this pollution guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in hai he basin are important sources of water for human needs a new urban area xiong an will be developed soon this new urban area is located in one of the sub basins draining into the baiyangdian lake urbanization may increase population density and human waste production another important event is the 2022 olympic winter games that will be conducted in one of the sub basins draining into guanting reservoir it is important to consider these events in future water quality analysis our study aims to analyze future trends in nutrient inputs into guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in hai he basin first we analyzed current characteristics of human impacts on the river export of n and p into the guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake second we applied the marina model model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas to analyze trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business as usual ssp3 and a scenario based on current environmental policies cep scenario the marina model is developed for china and runs at the sub basin scale strokal et al 2016 in addition we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients the 2022 olympic winter games in one of the sub basins draining into guanting reservoir oly scenario and the development of xiong an a new urban area in parts of sub basins draining into baiyangdian lake urb scenario finally we explored futures assuming implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers draining into the reservoir and lake oly and urb scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 study area we quantified nutrient export by rivers to a reservoir guanting and a shallow lake baiyangdian in hai he basin fig 1 2 1 1 guanting source of water for beijing in the mountains and home to the olympic games in 2022 guanting reservoir is located in the mountainous area of hai he basin fig 1 the watershed area draining into guanting reservoir is 43 889 km2 the reservoir is a source of drinking water for beijing during water shortage periods with a storage capacity of 4 16 billion m3 water in addition to this this drainage basin has some other functions upstream is an ecological protection area a mid stream there is an intensive livestock farming county in 2022 the winter olympic games will be held in a county chongli located upstream in the basin to prepare for these games efforts will be taken to ensure that guanting reservoir is in a good environmental condition in 2017 guanting reservoir was included in a list of a national lakes protection project and received 257 million rmb funding to promote the implementation of an ecological environment protection plan this plan will last until 2020 2 1 2 baiyangdian located in the plain and rapidly urbanizing baiyangdian lake is located in the plain area and the whole basin covers around 31 200 km2 fig 1 the lake is the largest shallow lake in hai he basin and plays an important role in water supply flood regulation fisheries and biodiversity conservation according to the water quality reports bdmepb 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 the water quality class iv or v observed at fixed monitoring sites in baiyangdian lake failed to reach to the level class iii required by the government today most of the drainage basin consists of rural area with agriculture and villages but large changes are anticipated a new urban area called xiong an will be established close to baiyangdian lake in three counties xiongxian rongcheng and anxin this xiong an new area will be part of the beijing tianjin hebei jing jin ji region covering around 100 km2 initially by 2020 and 200 km2 after 10 more years of expansion by 2030 and about 2000 km2 in the long term by 2050 thus rapid urbanization is expected in this new area in near future this has major consequences for the land use in the drainage basin of baiyangdian lake it will turn from a predominantly rural area in to a predominantly urban basin 2 1 3 sub basin delineation following the marina model approach we divided the drainage basins of guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake into sub basins fig 1 the guanting basin was divided into five sub basins sub basin 1 covers 14 556 km2 around 33 of the whole basin sub basin 2 covers 23 808 km2 around 54 of the whole basin sub basin 3 covers 3186 km2 around 7 of the whole basin sub basins 4 and 5 cover around 2 and 3 respectively the baiyangdian basin has eight rivers which are divided into eight sub basins most of these eight rivers dried up many years ago only the rivers in sub basins 1 5 and 7 have an inflow into baiyangdian lake bai gou yin he river in sub basin 1 is a water regulation channel which means it only has discharge during several months of a year the other two rivers have water inflow all year round 2 2 model description we applied the marina model model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas to quantify dissolved inorganic and organic n and p export to guanting and baiyangdian by source for 2012 and 2050 the original marina model is described by strokal et al 2016 and has been applied to six large river basins in china the yellow huang in chinese liao hai yangtze changjiang in chinese huai and pearl zhujiang in chinese rivers the model quantifies river export of dissolved inorganic din dip and dissolved organic don dop n and p river export of total dissolved tdn tdp n and p is the sum of dissolved inorganic and organic forms we are the first to apply the marina model to a lake and reservoir in hai he basin we modified the model to make it applicable to guanting and baiyangdian in three ways 1 we updated the marina model inputs to reflect the local conditions the model inputs for diffuse sources of nutrient inputs to land e g synthetic fertilizer animal manure atmospheric n deposition were derived from the nufer nutrient flows in food chains environment and resource use model for china wang et al 2018 the model inputs for point sources of nutrients to rivers e g nutrients in human waste nutrient removal by sewage systems and population with a sewage connection were updated based on a list of sewage plants in china mep 2013 gross domestic product gdp and population densities from statistical year books bdmsb 2013 bjmsb 2013 dtmsb 2013 immsb 2013 sjzmsb 2013 szmsb 2013 zjkmsb 2013 we also updated the hydrology for the study area mwr 2000 2015 appendix b gives details on the model inputs 2 we accounted for human waste from centralized sewage systems in rural areas these are not explicitly modeled in the original marina model 3 we accounted for river retention of dissolved organic n and p in the model this was missing in the original marina model all input databases and the model framework are shown in figs a1 and b1 below we describe the model for the reservoir and lake and the model inputs the marina model distinguishes between diffuse and point sources of nutrients in rivers eq 1 is the overall equation to quantify river export

inputs for n and p synthetic fertilizers animal manure and human waste were derived from a county database wang et al 2018a b we aggregated the county data to sub basins of our study area in arcgis model inputs for atmospheric n deposition over agricultural and non agricultural areas and biological n2 fixation by crops and natural vegetation were based on the marina model strokal et al 2016 marina also provided the required parameters to quantify weathering of p contained minerals and leaching of organic matters to rivers e g ecf the annual runoff was calculated using natural water discharges from the outlets of sub basins details on the sources of the model inputs and parameters are in fig b1 tables b1 b6 and b7 in the supplementary material 2 2 2 point sources rspntf y j kg

urban areas see box a2 direct inputs of n and p to rivers from animal manure were calculated as n and p in animal excretion was multiplied with the fraction of n and p in animal excretion that is

see box a2 model inputs for direct discharges of animal manure were based on the county database and aggregated to sub basins in arcgis details are in fig b1 and table b1 sources for model inputs to quantify the other point source inputs of nutrients to rivers were summarized in fig b1 and table b1 we calculated nutrient removal in sewage systems and population with or without a sewage connection fig b1 and table b1 retentions of nutrients within the river networks feriv f outlet j and feriv f mouth j the nutrient retention within the river networks is calculated by two parameters feriv f outlet j see box a 3 and feriv f mouth j see box a 4 feriv f outlet j is the fraction of nutrients in rivers reaching the outlets of sub basins j it accounts for nutrient losses from and retentions in the river of sub basin j these are for example denitrification for din and sedimentation for dip lf j 0 1 nutrient retention caused by dammed reservoirs df j 0 1 and nutrient losses via water consumption for different human activities such as irrigation fqremj 0 1 lf j for din was estimated as a function of the sub basin area following global news 2 mayorga et al 2010 lf j for dip was derived from the marina model for the hai he basin strokal et al 2016 in this study we also considered river retentions of don and dop e g by sedimentation processes details in table b9 df j for din and dip was derived from strokal et al 2016 the fqremj generic for din dip don and dop is the fraction of nutrients removed from sub basins for water consumption 0 1 this fraction is the ratio between the actual water discharge qact after water is removed from river systems km3 year 1 and the natural water discharge qnat before water is removed from river systems km3 year 1 see box a3 for guanting basin fqremj was estimated based on literature rong et al 2016 for baiyangdian basin we estimated it based on the measured hydrological data and literature details in tables b6 and b7 feriv f mouth j is the fraction of nutrients that reach the river mouth the point where nutrients enter lake or reservoir from the sub basin outlets it accounts for retentions and losses of nutrients lf j df j fqremj during traveling towards the river mouth strokal et al 2016 feriv f mouth j differs for sub basins we distinguished between upstream and downstream sub basins in our study by following the approach of strokal et al 2016 see details in box a4 for guanting reservoir sub basins 1 and 2 are upstream and sub basins 3 and 4 are downstream all sub basins of baiyangdian lake are downstream see fig 1 nutrients from activities in upstream sub basins generally travel longer towards the reservoir compared to nutrients in downstream during this travel nutrients may retain or be lost lf j df j fqremj nutrients from outlets of downstream sub basins discharge directly into the reservoir or lake box a3 provides details on the equations 2 3 model performance the marina model was validated for chinese rivers including the yangtze huai pearl yellow liao and hai he strokal et al 2016 the results confirm an acceptable performance of the model to quantify river export of din and dip in this paper we used available observations for water quality to evaluate model performance for guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake we used the pearson s coefficient of determination rp 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency r nse 2 and the root mean observations standard deviation ratio rsr according to the method from moriasi et al 2007 the pearson s coefficient of determination rp 2 is the square of the correlation coefficient rx y and it indicates the percentage of the variance in measured data explained by the model the closer rp 2 is to 1 the better the fit between measured and modeled values the nash sutcliffe efficiency rnse 2 determines how well the plots of the measured and modeled values fit 1 1 line values between 0 and 1 are acceptable levels of performance the lower rsr the better the model performance is we calculated an rp 2 of 0 91 r nse 2 of 0 80 and rsr of 0 33 for din total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp export to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake fig 2 these results give us trust in using the model to analyze river export of nutrients to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in the hai he basin 2 4 future scenarios we developed a scenario for 2050 taking ssp3 shared socio economic pathways 3 as a business as usual scenario next we developed a scenario based on the current environmental policies in china cep scenario in addition we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients the 2022 olympic winter games in the guanting basin oly scenario and the development of xiong an a new urban area in the baiyangdian basin urb scenario finally we explored optimistic futures assuming implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers oly and urb scenarios the ssp3 scenario is developed based on one of the five ssps o neill et al 2015 ssps are meant to assess possible future climate regimes and socio economic developments worldwide wang et al 2017 developed ssp storylines for china and interpreted these storylines for china s food system in 2030 and 2050 we choose ssp3 in 2050 as a starting point of this study to represent a business as usual scenario for the environment in china in the ssp3 scenario a fast population growth and an increasing preference for meat in the human diet is assumed for china tables 1a and 1b crop and animal production will be intensified to produce enough food ssp3 assumes that environmental policies are not effective and technologies for better nutrient management e g animal manure and crop residues recycling improved sewage systems are not implemented tables 1a and 1b the cep scenario reflects current environmental policies and assumes that population urbanization and the economy grow as in ssp3 the main difference from ssp3 is that cep assumes full implementation of recent environmental policies in china tables 1a and 1b zero growth in synthetic fertilizers after 2020 moa 2015a refers to a policy aimed at zero growth in the use of synthetic fertilizers from the year 2020 and 60 recycling of available manure on land national agricultural sustainable development plan 2015 2030 moa 2015b implies that 90 of the available manure will be recycled on land or biogas production in 2030 national urban sewage treatment and recycling planning in 13th five year 2015 2020 mdrc and mohurd 2016 prescribes that the percentage of people connected to centralized sewage systems will reach to 95 and 85 in cities and centers of counties respectively in 2020 the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year implies that the 60 of the people will be connected to centralized sewage systems in one third of the counties of china in 2020 mep and mof 2017 the action plan for prevention and control of water pollution gov 2015 states that in 2020 the water outflow of all sewage plants should meet the cn ia defined environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 mep 2002 based on these policies we assumed that the growth in synthetic fertilizer use will be zero from the year 2020 more manure 60 is assumed to be recycled and applied to cropland in 2050 tables 1a and 1b only 10 of animal manure will be discharged into water systems directly tables 1a and 1b around 90 of urban and 20 of rural population will be connected to sewage systems nutrient removal rates will reach to 80 for n and 90 for p in urban 35 for n and 45 for rural areas tables 1a and 1b the oly scenario explores the possible consequences of the winter olympic games in guanting basin in 2022 we assume that to ensure environmental quality sewage systems in sub basin 1 will be improved in this scenario by increasing the number of people connected to centralized sewage systems and advanced technologies for waste water treatment with high nutrient removal rates table 1a the ratio of population connected to sewage systems will increase to 100 in urban and 60 in rural areas table 1a nutrient removal rates are high 80 for n and 90 for p table 1a in sub basin 1 in the oly scenario we assume that such technologies for high nutrient removal from sewage are implemented in the whole guanting basin table 1a the urb scenario assumes that there will be a fast urbanization and city expansion in the baiyangdian basin in line with the establishment of xiong an new area especially in the xiongxian rongcheng and anxin counties this urbanization will increase sewage inputs to rivers and change the land use in the basin table 1b agricultural land will be converted to urban areas as a result agriculture activities will be reduced compared to the ssp3 and cep scenarios this will lead to less animal manure discharge to rivers in the urb scenario we assume that improved sewage systems will be constructed the percentage of the population connected to centralized sewage systems will increase to 100 for the urban and 60 for the rural population table 1b nutrient removal rates will reach to 80 for n and 90 for p table 1b in the new urban area xiong an 3 results 3 1 guanting reservoir 3 1 1 nutrient inputs to guanting basin agriculture is an important driver of nutrient inputs to the basin draining into guanting reservoir around 67 75 of n and more than 90 of p inputs are from agriculture fig 3 including synthetic fertilizer and animal excretion in 2012 farmers used 138 kton of n synthetic fertilizer and 30 kton of p fig c1 c in supplementary material appendix c approximately 100 kton of n and 19 kton of p were excreted by animals in guanting basin 30 of n and 45 of p in animal excretion was applied to crop land while 40 of n and 55 of p in animal excretion was discharged into water directly fig c1 b in supplementary material appendix c by 2050 in the ssp3 scenario the amount of synthetic fertilizer use will increase by 30 fig c1 in supplementary material appendix c and n and p in animal excretion will double compared with the amounts in 2012 in the cep scenario synthetic fertilizer will reduce to the level in 2012 because of the zero growth in synthetic fertilizers after 2020 policy almost 90 of animal manure will be recycled in different ways such as manure application to land and biogas production according to national agricultural sustainable development plan fig c1 b in supplementary material appendix c the guanting basin is largely a rural area urban sources contribute less than 10 to total n and p inputs to the whole basin in 2012 fig 3 our results show that 34 kton of n and 5 7 kton of p in human excretion were produced in guanting basin about 30 of this n and p is from urban people that are connected to centralized sewage systems and about 60 from rural unconnected people fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c we assume that the total population will keep stable from 2012 to 2050 in ssp3 but the fraction of urban population will increase which is line with the abovementioned ssps study for china wang et al 2017 the share of nutrients from urban connected sewage and rural unconnected sewage will change a little 32 for urban and 54 for rural fig c1 in supplementary material appendix c because of higher sewage connection rates in urban areas we accounted for the implementation of the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year mep and mof 2017 and national urban sewage treatment and recycling planning in 13th five year 2015 2020 policies mdrc and mohurd 2016 in the cep scenario in cep the population without sewage connection in urban and rural areas will decrease however human waste from urban areas that is collected by sewage systems and human waste from rural areas without sewage systems may remain the main contributors in 2050 fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c in oly and oly scenarios the results indicate more population may become connected to sewage systems than in other scenarios especially in sub basins 1 and 2 fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c 3 1 2 river export of nutrients by source to guanting reservoir in 2012 rivers transported 1478 ton year 1 of tdn and 56 ton year 1 of tdp to guanting reservoir fig 4 these exports vary among sub basins ranging from 115 to 614 ton year 1 for tdn and from 8 to 19 ton year 1 for tdp sub basins 1 2 and 3 contribute around 90 of tdn and tdp inputs to the reservoir fig 4 sub basin 3 yellow bar in fig 4 is the dominant source of din and dip and sub basin 2 blue bar in fig 4 of don and dop in the reservoir more than 80 of nutrients are from agriculture virtually all don dip and dop in guanting reservoir are from point sources manure and human waste fig 5 in sub basins 1 2 and 4 point sources contributed more than 90 to din including direct discharge of animal manure and human waste water that is not connected to centralized sewage systems fig 5 whilst in sub basin 3 diffuse sources fertilizer human and animal manure applied on the crop land and point sources have an equal share in din export 45 and 43 fig 5 the ssp3 scenario projects a doubling in tdn and tdp inputs to guanting reservoir with the same dominant sources as in 2012 direct discharges of manure will remain a major source of pollution because livestock production is assumed to continue to industrialize without sufficient manure management fig 5 the contribution of synthetic fertilizer use to din export will increase especially in sub basin 4 the share of human waste is projected to decrease slightly due to urbanization the number of people in urban areas with sewage systems connection is increasing fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c effective implementation of current policies cep scenario is calculated to reduce nutrient pollution the cep scenario assumes that many recent policies will be implemented gov 2015 mdrc and mohurd 2016 mep and mof 2017 moa 2015b this implies that 90 of animal manure will be recycled and only 10 will be discharge into water system it also implies that sewage systems will be improved in urban and rural areas table 1a and fig c1 a in the cep scenario the river export of nutrients to guanting reservoir is decreasing sharply to levels below that in 2012 this holds for all forms of n and p and most obviously for don and p fig 5 this illustrates that recycling of manure is an effective way to reduce don and p export to guanting reservoir the relative share of human waste in don and p export increases but these are not dominant sources diffuse sources such as synthetic fertilizers and manure applied to crop will become more important than point sources for din fig 5 in the oly scenario improved waste water treatment may affect water quality however this effect is smaller compared to the cep scenario see above for example only a slight decrease in nutrient export to guanting reservoir is projected according to the oly scenario even if we assume that in all sub basins advanced waste water treatment systems are applied oly scenario nutrient pollution in the reservoir will not reduce to a large extent for example 8 13 of tdn and tdp decrease in nutrient export by 2050 in the oly scenario relative to the cep scenario this is because most of the nutrients in the reservoir are not from sewage but from agriculture thus to improve water quality in guanting reservoir effective nutrient management in agriculture is needed to reduce don and p manure discharge point source needs to be reduced for din it is more effective to reduce diffuse sources 3 2 baiyangdian lake 3 2 1 nutrient inputs to baiyangdian basin agriculture is also the main driver of nutrient inputs to baiyangdian basin around 75 82 of n and 66 88 of p are from agricultural sources fig 6 including synthetic fertilizer and animal manure in 2012 farmers used 364 kton of synthetic n fertilizers and 60 kton of p fig c2 c in supplementary material appendix c approximately 229 kton of n and 46 kton of p in animal excretion were produced in baiyangdian basin fig c2 b in the ssp3 scenario the amount of synthetic fertilizer used will increase by 30 fig c2 c n and p in animal excretion will double compared with the amounts in 2012 about 40 of n and 60 of p in animal manure will be discharged to surface waters directly in the cep scenario less animal manure will be discharged to surface water and less fertilizer will be used in crop production this is a result of assumed implementation of the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year and zero growth in synthetic fertilizers after 2020 policies fig c2 c and c2 b urban sources contribute 9 14 to n and 12 34 to p inputs to baiyangdian basin fig 6 this is more than that in guanting basin indicating that the baiyangdian basin is more urbanized our results indicate that 63 kton of n and 10 kton of p in human excretion were produced in baiyangdian basin fig c2 a in supplementary material appendix c in 2012 in 2012 and the ssp3 scenario 50 90 of n and p in human excretion is from rural population that is not connected to centralized sewage systems except for sub basin 5 where the connected urban population is the dominant contributor 60 100 fig c2 a in the cep scenario the number of people in rural areas with no connection to centralized sewage systems will decrease by 10 due to the implementation of the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year mep and mof 2017 however unconnected rural population will still be the main source of human excretion except for sub basin 5 in the urb scenario sewage inputs to the basin will double as a result of the assumed increasing total and urban population in this scenario there is a large difference among sub basins in terms of sewage inputs in sub basins 2 and 5 most human waste is collected in centralized sewage systems draining into rivers and the lake 73 for sub basin 2 and 90 for sub basin 5 this is due to the establishment of xiong an in the other sub basins most human waste entering the river and lake is from the rural population unconnected to centralized sewage system the differences between urb and urb are small indicating that advanced technologies should be applied in sub basins 2 and 5 where majority of people have connection with sewage systems for other sub basins how to manage sewage systems construction and choose proper technologies of nutrient removal should be considered for the clean water in rural area 3 2 2 river export of nutrients by source to baiyangdian lake three out of eight rivers discharge to baiyangdian lake these three rivers transported around 4243 ton year 1 of tdn and 194 ton year 1 of tdp in 2012 fig 7 these exports vary among sub basins ranging from 1111 to 1946 ton year 1 for tdn and from 38 to 95 ton year 1 for tdp sub basins 5 and 7 blue and yellow bar in fig 7 were the dominant source of din and dip and sub basin 1 pink bar in fig 7 of don and dop to the lake in sub basins 1 and 7 more than 80 of n and p were from point sources which include direct discharge of animal manure and human wastewater fig 8 in sub basin 5 the main sources were same as in sub basins 1 and 7 for don and p but the share of synthetic fertilizers diffuse source manure and human waste point source for din was one third each in the business as usual scenario ssp3 nutrient export by rivers was predicted to increasing by a factor of 1 5 2 for tdn and tdp fig 7 with the same dominant sources as in 2012 the cep scenario shows the effectiveness of current policies to reduce nutrient pollution all forms of n and p will reduce to below 2012 levels the reductions are largest for don and p fig 7 point sources animal manure and human waste will remain major sources of nutrient pollution except din fig 8 but the pollution from human waste exceeds that of animal manure in sub basins 1 and 7 the share of synthetic fertilizers will increase to 33 for din with the implementation of recycling of manure in sub basin 5 next we show that the establishment of xiong an new area may lead to an increase in nutrient pollution in baiyangdian lake scenario urb we also show that this can be avoided by efficient waste water treatment strategies urb compared scenario urb with cep we calculate an obvious increase in nutrients export to baiyangdian lake by 28 43 tdp and tdn resulting from an increasing urban population as a result of this urbanization there will be a reduction in livestock around xiong an new area this explains why the dominant source of nutrients in scenario urb is no longer animal manure but human waste except for dop in the urb scenario we assume that the percentage of the population connected to centralized sewage systems will reach to 100 and 60 in urban and rural areas of xiong an respectively and we assume that these centralized sewage systems will implement the best available technologies to treat human waste with relatively high efficiencies of nutrient removal tertiary treatment van drecht et al 2009 this reduces nutrient pollution however not to the level in the cep scenario these results indicate that to limit the pollution from urbanization effective waste treatment is needed not only in xiong an but also in surrounding areas 4 discussion 4 1 this is the first study implementing the marina model to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake at the sub basin scale considering both point and diffuse sources other studies focused more on nutrient losses from diffuse sources especially agriculture to lakes and reservoirs gassman et al 2014 shen et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 thus sub basin and all nutrient sources analyses were limited but needed for effective management of water quality in the basins furthermore causes of water pollution with nutrients at the sub basin scale were not analyzed before for these two water systems our study is the first to provide insights in the effects of nutrient losses from agriculture and urbanization to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake we identified the causes of nutrient pollution in the reservoir and lake this information is relevant to formulate effective management options to reduce water pollution we analyzed the consequences of the olympic games 2022 on the quality of the reservoir and of the rural urban intervention on the quality of the lake the strengths of our study are threefold first the marina model allows to quantify dissolved forms of nutrients that are exported to reservoirs and lakes by source and by sub basin figs 3 8 this offers the possibility to look at nutrient yields and their sources attribution point and diffuse source at the sub basin scale while other studies chen 2005 cui 2011 hao et al 2002 shi 2012 sun and hao 2004 wu et al 2017 zhao 2013 zhu 2011 only focus on nutrient outputs to the basin outlets from diffuse source table d1 our results show that managing point sources of animal manure is important for water quality improvement this is in line with the ongoing discussion in china on strengthening prevention and control of n and p pollution from point sources mee 2018 results of our study may support policies developments second our scenario analysis provides new insights how future climate socio economic changes and current environmental policies may influence water quality in the lake and reservoir this was not done before it can help policy makers and other stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of current environmental policies in improving nutrient management on agriculture and urbanization third we explored alternative future scenarios to reduce river export of nutrients to the reservoir and the lake we believe our results improve our understanding of nutrient management for specific lakes and reservoirs the results of our study are highly relevant for policy making for effective environmental policies it can help to evaluate the effectiveness of current environmental policies in improving nutrient management in agriculture and urbanization to reduce water pollution as any model our model has uncertainties we realize that our assumptions for the scenarios might be simplified generating uncertainties in model results however we believe that these uncertainties will not change our main messages we adjusted the model to the local situation by modifying some of the model inputs county scale data from nufer model and parameters e g ldon ldop popcon rur j see tables a1 and a2 for the description of the abbreviations in addition we used local information as much as possible for model inputs e g sewage plants list qnat qact see tables a3 and b1 for details and validated the model against measured data see section 2 4 we believe our model is appropriate for studying trends in nutrient exports to lakes and reservoirs by source and sub basin 4 2 agriculture is the dominant source of nutrients in guanting basin and baiyangdian basin large synthetic fertilizer use in crop production is the main source of n inputs to these two basins figs 3 and 6 the share of synthetic fertilizers in the total inputs to land are higher for baiyangdian basin 53 than for guanting basin 44 fig 3 this is because the drainage basin of baiyangdian reservoir has more arable land table b2 except for synthetic fertilizer p from intensive livestock industries are also important inputs of p to land and to rivers in both basins 40 in guanting basin and 33 in baiyangdian basin the shares of biological n2 fixation and atmospheric n deposition on land of guanting basin are higher than that of baiyangdian basin nutrient inputs to rivers from sewage systems contributes more in baiyangdian basin 9 34 than in guanting basin less than 10 figs 3 and 6 4 3 hydrology differs in guanting basin and baiyangdian basin hydrology is crucial for nutrient export from land to water systems important factors are geography precipitation and river networks human activities such as dam construction and consumption also could affect natural hydrology processes guanting is a reservoir in the mountains while baiyangdian is in the plain the mountainous guanting basin has a different hydrology than the baiyangdian basin in the plain area in guanting basin serious soil erosion associated with extreme rainfall results in diffuse source pollution more easily hao et al 2002 xia and xue 2010 because of the changing precipitation and human water consumption land runoff and water discharge are decreasing in both study areas liu et al 2017 2016 lu et al 2014 wang and qin 2017 this holds in particular for baiyangdian lake where hydrology is affected by human activities more strongly and water discharge is extremely low to zero in some rivers tables b6 and b7 less water discharge can decrease export of nutrients from diffuse sources to surface water systems but may increase pollution of groundwater by nutrient leaching in baiyangdian basin wang 2012 4 4 sources of nutrients differ for guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake nutrient inputs and hydrology affect nutrients transformation from land to water in different ways and lead to water pollution at different extents in guanting reservoir din is mainly from diffuse sources while point sources especially animal manure contribute most to dip don and dop these results show that agriculture strongly affects nutrient export by rivers to guanting reservoir this can be explained as follows guanting basin is developing towards a water conservation area with more rural areas as a result agricultural activities may contribute more nutrients in rivers from these activities also the reservoir receives more water and thus rivers transport more nutrients compared to the lake li et al 2008 in baiyangdian lake this may not be the case in the future our scenarios project a shift in the dominant source from agriculture diffuse sources and animal manure to urbanization human wastewater for din dip and don urbanization will be a main factor resulting in water pollution in baiyangdian lake in the future these results could be explained by the faster urbanization contributing to decrease in surface water quantity in baiyangdian 4 5 implication for future water quality management in this study we analyzed two water bodies in hai he basin as a case study the guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake we calculated increasing water pollution in the future if the current environmental policies in china could be implemented effectively nutrients exports to the lake and the reservoir could be reduced to the level of 2012 in 2050 according to the national ecological functional zoning mep 2008 guanting basin is an important water conservation area including reservoir and its upstream while baiyangdian basin belongs to the urbanizing jing jin ji area also xiong an new area these differences in functional zonings imply that guanting and baiyangdian will have different developing aims in future guanting will be more rural than the fast urbanizing baiyangdian region as a result specific environmental policies need to be considered that acknowledge differences between the two basins with respect to functions nutrient inputs and losses hydrology in guanting basin pollution control could follow from changes in agriculture improved nutrient management can reduce the n and p losses from agriculture without damaging food security for example we could adapt more scientific methods to feed animals and reduce the nutrient excretion bai et al 2014 oenema and tamminga 2005 wang et al 2014 animal manure can be processed and applied on cropland to replace synthetic fertilizer before discharging to surface waters treatment of animal manure such as anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery could be applied to produce biogas and reduce nutrient pollution nasir et al 2012 in baiyangdian basin pollution control is more effective through effective urban development planning and advanced technologies for nutrient removal from urban waste streams in addition intensive livestock production tends to cluster around xiong an where insufficient land is available for recycling animal manure this may pose a risk of water pollution in surrounding sub basins in order to coordinate food provision and environmental impacts a specific strategy is needed for effective manure use and mitigation of nutrient losses in the whole baiyangdian basin 5 conclusions this study is the first to analyze future trends in nutrient inputs into guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake by applying the marina model we analyzed trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business as usual scenario ssp3 and a scenario based on current environmental policies cep in addition we assessed future impacts of 2022 olympic winter games and the establishment of xiong an new area we also explored futures for these two areas assuming implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers the main findings are as follows water pollution caused by nutrient losses in guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake was contributing to water scarcity in 2012 most nutrient pollution in 2012 was from agriculture for both reservoir and lake in guanting reservoir sub basins 1 2 and 3 contribute around 90 of tdn and tdp inputs to the reservoir more than half of din and dip were from sub basin 3 but sub basins 1 and 2 contributed over two thirds of don and dop in baiyangdian lake sub basins 5 and 7 were the dominant source of din and dip and sub basin 1 of don and dop to the lake between 2012 and 2050 n and p inputs to these two water bodies may double as indicated in the ssp3 scenario which we consider business as usual in this scenario most nutrients are from point sources including direct discharge of manure into rivers the cep scenario shows that current environmental policies may reduce pollution to below 2012 levels in the oly scenario for guanting reservoir the effect of improved waste water treatment on reducing nutrient pollution will not be to a large extent even if in the oly scenario applied advanced waste water treatment systems in all sub basins only 8 13 of nutrients export tdn and tdp decrease by 2050 relative to the cep scenario to improve water quality further in guanting pollution from agriculture needs to be reduced in the urb scenario the planned urbanization may increase in nutrients export to baiyangdian lake by 28 43 tdp and tdn as a result of increased point source sewage systems emissions in the urb scenario the high percentage of the population connected to centralized sewage systems and relatively high efficiencies of nutrient removal tertiary treatment in xiong an will reduce nutrient pollution but not to the level in the cep scenario therefore effective waste treatment is needed not only in xiong an but also in surrounding areas to ensure good water quality in this

11160,hai he basin is located in the densely populated north china plain that is providing food to more than 100 million people the fast developing agriculture and urbanization in hai he basin have resulted in discharging nutrient rich wastewater into lakes and reservoirs leading to eutrophication and water scarcity such as in guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in this study we analyzed future trends in nutrient inputs into guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake by applying the marina model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas model we analyzed trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business as usual scenario ssp3 and a scenario based on current environmental policies cep in addition we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients the 2022 olympic winter games in the guanting basin oly scenario and the development of xiong an in the baiyangdian basin urb scenario finally we assumed implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers oly and urb our study has five main findings first nutrients in guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake were mainly from agriculture in 2012 second nutrient export doubles between 2012 and 2050 in ssp3 third effective implementation of current environmental policies could reduce the future pollution to levels below that in 2012 fourth improved sewage systems associated with the 2022 winter olympic games could not reduce nutrient pollution effectively in guanting reservoir indicating that reducing nutrient losses from agriculture may be more effective to improve water quality than urban waste water treatment fifth urbanization in the baiyangdian basin may increase river export of nutrients to the lake by 28 43 compared to the cep scenario urb scenario highly effective waste treatment is needed not only in xiong an but also in surrounding areas to ensure the availability of clean water urb scenario our results could improve our understanding of nutrient management for specific lakes and reservoirs and highly relevant for policy making for effective environmental policies keywords water pollution agriculture marina model scenarios guanting reservoir baiyangdian lake 1 introduction the basin of the hai he river located in north china plain is densely populated and provides food to more than 100 million people in china the hai he basin is one of three grain production areas of china with 0 1 million km2 of arable land sun et al 2017 the basin has been developing in recent years with a fast economic growth and a rapid urbanization hao et al 2007 as a result waste water discharge from urban households to surface waters via sewage systems is large in addition the increasing food demand intensified agricultural production in hai he basin nitrogen n and phosphorus p use increased in crop and animal production however these nutrients are not used efficiently because of poor nutrient management leading to overuse of synthetic fertilizers and discharge of animal manure as a waste product strokal et al 2016 this led to large n and p losses from agriculture to rivers lakes and reservoirs causing water pollution many models exist to quantify nutrient flows to aquatic systems ranging from the field to the basin and to the global scale beusen et al 2016 fink et al 2018 mayorga et al 2010 strokal and vries 2012 unep 2016 some models have been applied in the individual basins of china such as global news 2 mayorga et al 2010 marina strokal et al 2016 image gnm beusen et al 2016 several models have been used to estimate nutrient inputs to lakes and reservoirs in china such as miyun reservoir doting lake and dianchi lake ceng and wang 2017 dong et al 2018 hou et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 the models used in lakes and reservoirs focus on nutrient losses from diffuse sources especially agriculture such as the export coefficient model zhang et al 2018 swat gassman et al 2014 hspf chen et al 2013 and agnps shen et al 2012 however no models exist that can calculate river export of n and p in different forms to chinese lakes or reservoirs by source and by sub basin the marina model quantifies river export of nutrients by sources and by sub basin but for the large six rivers in china and not for lakes and reservoirs and studies are lacking to predict nutrient losses from land to lakes and reservoirs under future scenarios which assess possible future climate regimes representative concentration pathways rcps and also socio economic changes shared socio economic pathways ssps a better understanding of river export to lakes and reservoirs and nutrient source attribution in sub basin scale is needed for effective region specific environmental policies it can help the government and water managers to implement more precise policies in specific water systems and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies under future climate and socio economic changes since 1949 the environmental policy system in china has developed from general principles to specific guidance documents shmeleva and wang 2011 in recent years the concept of environmental protection in china has changed from separated pollution control to integrated watershed management the chinese government has published series of practical policies to protect water systems and demonstrates willingness to a more sustainable future however whether these policies will be effective in improving nutrient use efficiencies and reducing nutrient losses to surface water systems in future is not well understood thus it is necessary to analyze pollution of water systems in the hai he basin especially for such new district i e xiong an and to assess how effective current environmental policies are to reduce this pollution guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in hai he basin are important sources of water for human needs a new urban area xiong an will be developed soon this new urban area is located in one of the sub basins draining into the baiyangdian lake urbanization may increase population density and human waste production another important event is the 2022 olympic winter games that will be conducted in one of the sub basins draining into guanting reservoir it is important to consider these events in future water quality analysis our study aims to analyze future trends in nutrient inputs into guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in hai he basin first we analyzed current characteristics of human impacts on the river export of n and p into the guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake second we applied the marina model model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas to analyze trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business as usual ssp3 and a scenario based on current environmental policies cep scenario the marina model is developed for china and runs at the sub basin scale strokal et al 2016 in addition we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients the 2022 olympic winter games in one of the sub basins draining into guanting reservoir oly scenario and the development of xiong an a new urban area in parts of sub basins draining into baiyangdian lake urb scenario finally we explored futures assuming implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers draining into the reservoir and lake oly and urb scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 study area we quantified nutrient export by rivers to a reservoir guanting and a shallow lake baiyangdian in hai he basin fig 1 2 1 1 guanting source of water for beijing in the mountains and home to the olympic games in 2022 guanting reservoir is located in the mountainous area of hai he basin fig 1 the watershed area draining into guanting reservoir is 43 889 km2 the reservoir is a source of drinking water for beijing during water shortage periods with a storage capacity of 4 16 billion m3 water in addition to this this drainage basin has some other functions upstream is an ecological protection area a mid stream there is an intensive livestock farming county in 2022 the winter olympic games will be held in a county chongli located upstream in the basin to prepare for these games efforts will be taken to ensure that guanting reservoir is in a good environmental condition in 2017 guanting reservoir was included in a list of a national lakes protection project and received 257 million rmb funding to promote the implementation of an ecological environment protection plan this plan will last until 2020 2 1 2 baiyangdian located in the plain and rapidly urbanizing baiyangdian lake is located in the plain area and the whole basin covers around 31 200 km2 fig 1 the lake is the largest shallow lake in hai he basin and plays an important role in water supply flood regulation fisheries and biodiversity conservation according to the water quality reports bdmepb 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 the water quality class iv or v observed at fixed monitoring sites in baiyangdian lake failed to reach to the level class iii required by the government today most of the drainage basin consists of rural area with agriculture and villages but large changes are anticipated a new urban area called xiong an will be established close to baiyangdian lake in three counties xiongxian rongcheng and anxin this xiong an new area will be part of the beijing tianjin hebei jing jin ji region covering around 100 km2 initially by 2020 and 200 km2 after 10 more years of expansion by 2030 and about 2000 km2 in the long term by 2050 thus rapid urbanization is expected in this new area in near future this has major consequences for the land use in the drainage basin of baiyangdian lake it will turn from a predominantly rural area in to a predominantly urban basin 2 1 3 sub basin delineation following the marina model approach we divided the drainage basins of guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake into sub basins fig 1 the guanting basin was divided into five sub basins sub basin 1 covers 14 556 km2 around 33 of the whole basin sub basin 2 covers 23 808 km2 around 54 of the whole basin sub basin 3 covers 3186 km2 around 7 of the whole basin sub basins 4 and 5 cover around 2 and 3 respectively the baiyangdian basin has eight rivers which are divided into eight sub basins most of these eight rivers dried up many years ago only the rivers in sub basins 1 5 and 7 have an inflow into baiyangdian lake bai gou yin he river in sub basin 1 is a water regulation channel which means it only has discharge during several months of a year the other two rivers have water inflow all year round 2 2 model description we applied the marina model model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas to quantify dissolved inorganic and organic n and p export to guanting and baiyangdian by source for 2012 and 2050 the original marina model is described by strokal et al 2016 and has been applied to six large river basins in china the yellow huang in chinese liao hai yangtze changjiang in chinese huai and pearl zhujiang in chinese rivers the model quantifies river export of dissolved inorganic din dip and dissolved organic don dop n and p river export of total dissolved tdn tdp n and p is the sum of dissolved inorganic and organic forms we are the first to apply the marina model to a lake and reservoir in hai he basin we modified the model to make it applicable to guanting and baiyangdian in three ways 1 we updated the marina model inputs to reflect the local conditions the model inputs for diffuse sources of nutrient inputs to land e g synthetic fertilizer animal manure atmospheric n deposition were derived from the nufer nutrient flows in food chains environment and resource use model for china wang et al 2018 the model inputs for point sources of nutrients to

appendix b gives details on the model inputs 2 we accounted for human waste from centralized sewage systems in rural areas these are not explicitly modeled in the original marina model 3 we accounted for river retention of dissolved organic n and p in the model this was missing in the original marina model all input databases and the model framework are shown in figs a1 and b1 below we describe the model for the reservoir and lake and the model inputs the marina model distinguishes between diffuse and point sources of nutrients in rivers eq 1 is the overall equation to quantify river export

inputs for n and p synthetic fertilizers animal manure and human waste were derived from a county database wang et al 2018a b we aggregated the county data to sub basins of our study area in arcgis

marina also provided the required parameters to quantify weathering of p contained minerals and leaching of organic matters to rivers e g ecf the annual runoff was calculated using natural water discharges from the outlets of sub basins details on the sources of the model inputs and parameters are in fig b1 tables b1 b6 and b7 in the supplementary material 2 2 2 point sources rspntf y j kg

fig b1 and table b1 retentions of nutrients within the river networks feriv f outlet j and feriv f mouth j the nutrient retention within the river networks is calculated by two parameters feriv f outlet j see box a 3 and feriv f mouth j see box a 4 feriv f outlet j is the fraction of nutrients in rivers reaching the outlets of sub basins j it accounts for nutrient losses from and retentions in the river of sub basin j these are for example denitrification for din and sedimentation for dip lf j 0 1 nutrient retention caused by dammed reservoirs df j 0 1 and nutrient losses via water consumption for different human activities such as irrigation fqremj 0 1 lf j for din was estimated as a function of the sub basin area following global news 2 mayorga et al 2010 lf j for dip was derived from the marina model for the hai he basin strokal et al 2016 in this study we also considered river retentions of don and dop e g by sedimentation processes details in table b9 df j for din and dip was derived from strokal et al 2016 the fqremj generic for din dip don and dop is the fraction of nutrients removed from sub basins for water consumption 0 1 this fraction is the ratio between the actual water discharge qact after water is removed from river systems km3 year 1 and the natural water discharge qnat before water is removed from river systems km3 year 1 see box a3 for guanting basin fqremj was estimated based on literature rong et al 2016 for baiyangdian basin we estimated it based on the measured hydrological data and literature details in tables b6 and b7 feriv f mouth j is the fraction of nutrients that reach the river mouth the point where nutrients enter lake or reservoir from the sub basin outlets it accounts for retentions and losses of nutrients lf j df j fqremj during traveling towards the river mouth strokal et al 2016 feriv f mouth j differs for sub basins we distinguished between upstream and downstream sub basins in our study by following the approach of strokal et al 2016 see details in box a4 for guanting reservoir sub basins 1 and 2 are upstream and sub basins 3 and 4 are downstream all sub basins of baiyangdian lake are downstream see fig 1 nutrients from activities in upstream sub basins generally travel longer towards the reservoir compared to nutrients in downstream during this travel nutrients may retain or be lost lf j df j fqremj nutrients from outlets of downstream sub basins discharge directly into the reservoir or lake box a3 provides details on the equations 2 3 model performance the marina model was validated for chinese rivers including the yangtze huai pearl yellow liao and hai he strokal et al 2016 the results confirm an acceptable performance of the model to quantify river export of din and dip in this paper we used available observations for water quality to evaluate model performance for guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake we used the pearson s coefficient of determination rp 2 the nash sutcliffe

results give us trust in using the model to analyze river export of nutrients to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake in the hai he basin 2 4 future scenarios we developed a scenario for 2050 taking ssp3 shared socio economic pathways 3 as a business as usual scenario next we developed a scenario based on the current environmental policies in china cep scenario in addition we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients the 2022 olympic winter games in the guanting basin oly scenario and the development of xiong an a new urban area in the baiyangdian basin urb scenario finally we explored optimistic futures assuming implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers oly and urb scenarios the ssp3 scenario is developed based on one of the five ssps o neill et al 2015 ssps are meant to assess possible future climate regimes and socio economic developments worldwide wang et al 2017 developed ssp storylines for china and interpreted these storylines for china s food system in 2030 and 2050 we choose ssp3 in 2050 as a starting point of this study to represent a business as usual scenario for the environment in china in the ssp3 scenario a fast population growth and an increasing preference for meat in the human diet is assumed for china tables 1a and 1b crop and animal production will be intensified to produce enough food ssp3 assumes that environmental policies are not effective and technologies for better nutrient management e g animal manure and crop residues recycling improved sewage systems are not implemented tables 1a and 1b the cep scenario reflects current environmental policies and assumes that population urbanization and the economy grow as in ssp3 the main difference from ssp3 is that cep assumes full implementation of recent environmental policies in china tables 1a and 1b zero growth in synthetic fertilizers after 2020 moa 2015a refers to a policy aimed at zero growth in the use of synthetic fertilizers from the year 2020 and 60 recycling of available manure on land national agricultural sustainable development plan 2015 2030 moa 2015b implies that 90 of the available manure will be recycled on land or biogas production in 2030 national urban sewage treatment and recycling planning in 13th five year 2015 2020 mdrc and mohurd 2016 prescribes that the percentage of people connected to centralized sewage systems will reach to 95 and 85 in cities and centers of counties respectively in 2020 the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year implies that the 60 of the people will be connected to centralized sewage systems in one third of the counties of china in 2020 mep and mof 2017 the action plan for prevention and control of water pollution gov 2015 states that in 2020 the water outflow of all sewage plants should meet the cn ia defined environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 mep 2002 based on these policies we assumed that the growth in synthetic fertilizer use will be zero from the year 2020 more manure 60 is assumed to be recycled and applied to cropland in 2050 tables 1a and 1b only 10 of animal manure will be discharged into water systems directly tables 1a and 1b around 90 of urban and 20 of rural population will be connected to sewage systems nutrient removal rates will reach to 80 for n and 90 for p in urban 35 for n and 45 for rural areas tables 1a and 1b the oly scenario explores the possible consequences of the winter olympic games in guanting basin in 2022 we assume that to ensure environmental quality sewage systems in sub basin 1 will be improved in this scenario by increasing the number of people connected to centralized sewage systems and advanced technologies for waste water treatment with high nutrient removal rates table 1a the ratio of population connected to sewage systems will increase to 100 in urban and 60 in rural areas table 1a nutrient removal rates are high 80 for n and 90 for p table 1a in sub basin 1 in the oly scenario we assume that such technologies for high nutrient removal from sewage are implemented in the whole guanting basin table 1a the urb scenario assumes that there will be a fast urbanization and city expansion in the baiyangdian basin in line with the establishment of xiong an new area especially in the xiongxian rongcheng and anxin counties this urbanization will increase sewage inputs to rivers and change the land use in the basin table 1b agricultural land will be converted to urban areas as a result agriculture activities will be reduced compared to the ssp3 and cep scenarios this will lead to less animal manure discharge to rivers in the urb scenario we assume that improved sewage systems will be constructed the percentage of the population connected to centralized sewage systems will increase to 100 for the urban and 60 for the rural population table 1b nutrient removal rates will reach to 80 for n and 90 for p table 1b in the new urban area xiong an 3 results 3 1 guanting reservoir 3 1 1 nutrient inputs to guanting basin agriculture is an important driver of nutrient inputs to the basin draining into guanting reservoir around 67 75 of n and more than 90 of p inputs are from agriculture fig 3 including synthetic fertilizer and animal excretion in 2012 farmers used 138 kton of n synthetic fertilizer and 30 kton of p fig c1 c in supplementary material appendix c approximately 100 kton of n and 19 kton of p were excreted by animals in guanting basin 30 of n and 45 of p in animal excretion was applied to crop land while 40 of n and 55 of p in animal excretion was discharged into water directly fig c1 b in supplementary material appendix c by 2050 in the ssp3 scenario the amount of synthetic fertilizer use will increase by 30 fig c1 in supplementary material appendix c and n and p in animal excretion will double compared with the amounts in 2012 in the cep scenario synthetic fertilizer will reduce to the level in 2012 because of the zero growth in synthetic fertilizers after 2020 policy almost 90 of animal manure will be recycled in different ways such as manure application to land and biogas production according to national agricultural sustainable development plan fig c1 b in supplementary material appendix c the guanting basin is largely a rural area urban sources contribute less than 10 to total n and p inputs to the whole basin in 2012 fig 3 our results show that 34 kton of n and 5 7 kton of p in human excretion were produced in guanting basin about 30 of this n and p is from urban people that are connected to centralized sewage systems and about 60 from rural unconnected people fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c we assume that the total population will keep stable from 2012 to 2050 in ssp3 but the fraction of urban population will increase which is line with the abovementioned ssps study for china wang et al 2017 the share of nutrients from urban connected sewage and rural unconnected sewage will change a little 32 for urban and 54 for rural fig c1 in supplementary material appendix c because of higher sewage connection rates in urban areas we accounted for the implementation of the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year mep and mof 2017 and national urban sewage treatment and recycling planning in 13th five year 2015 2020 policies mdrc and mohurd 2016 in the cep scenario in cep the population without sewage connection in urban and rural areas will decrease however human waste from urban areas that is collected by sewage systems and human waste from rural areas without sewage systems may remain the main contributors in 2050 fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c in oly and oly scenarios the results indicate more population may become connected to sewage systems than in other scenarios especially in sub basins 1 and 2 fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c 3 1 2 river export of nutrients by source to guanting reservoir in 2012 rivers transported 1478 ton year 1 of tdn and 56 ton year 1 of tdp to guanting reservoir fig 4 these exports vary among sub basins ranging from 115 to 614 ton year 1 for tdn and from 8 to 19 ton year 1 for tdp sub basins 1 2 and 3 contribute around 90 of tdn and tdp inputs to the reservoir fig 4 sub basin 3 yellow bar in fig 4 is the dominant source of din and dip and sub basin 2 blue bar in fig 4 of don and dop in the reservoir more than 80 of nutrients are from agriculture virtually all don dip and dop in guanting reservoir are from point sources manure and human waste fig 5 in sub basins 1 2 and 4 point sources contributed more than 90 to din including direct discharge of animal manure and human waste water that is not connected to centralized sewage systems fig 5 whilst in sub basin 3 diffuse sources fertilizer human and animal manure applied on the crop land and point sources have an equal share in din export 45 and 43 fig 5 the ssp3 scenario projects a doubling in tdn and tdp inputs to guanting reservoir with the same dominant sources as in 2012 direct discharges of manure will remain a major source of pollution because livestock production is assumed to continue to industrialize without sufficient manure management fig 5 the contribution of synthetic fertilizer use to din export will increase especially in sub basin 4 the share of human waste is projected to decrease slightly due to urbanization the number of people in urban areas with sewage systems connection is increasing fig c1 a in supplementary material appendix c effective implementation of current policies cep scenario is calculated to reduce nutrient pollution the cep scenario assumes that many recent policies will be implemented gov 2015 mdrc and mohurd 2016 mep and mof 2017 moa 2015b this implies that 90 of animal manure will be recycled and only 10 will be discharge into water system it also implies that sewage systems will be improved in urban and rural areas table 1a and fig c1 a in the cep scenario the river export of nutrients to guanting reservoir is decreasing sharply to levels below that in 2012 this holds for all forms of n and p and most obviously for don and p fig 5 this illustrates that recycling of manure is an effective way to reduce don and p export to guanting reservoir the relative share of human waste in don and p export increases but these are not dominant sources diffuse sources such as synthetic fertilizers and manure applied to crop will become more important than point sources for din fig 5 in the oly scenario improved waste water treatment may affect water quality however this effect is smaller compared to the cep scenario see above for example only a slight decrease in nutrient export to guanting reservoir is projected according to the oly scenario even if we assume that in all sub basins advanced waste water treatment systems are applied oly scenario nutrient pollution in the reservoir will not reduce to a large extent for example 8 13 of tdn and tdp decrease in nutrient export by 2050 in the oly scenario relative to the cep scenario this is because most of the nutrients in the reservoir are not from sewage but from agriculture thus to improve water quality in guanting reservoir effective nutrient management in agriculture is needed to reduce don and p manure discharge point source needs to be reduced for din it is more effective to reduce diffuse sources 3 2 baiyangdian lake 3 2 1 nutrient inputs to baiyangdian basin agriculture is also the main driver of nutrient inputs to baiyangdian basin around 75 82 of n and 66 88 of p are from agricultural sources fig 6 including synthetic fertilizer and animal manure in 2012 farmers used 364 kton of synthetic n fertilizers and 60 kton of p fig c2 c in supplementary material appendix c approximately 229 kton of n and 46 kton of p in animal excretion were produced in baiyangdian basin fig c2 b in the ssp3 scenario the amount of synthetic fertilizer used will increase by 30 fig c2 c n and p in animal excretion will double compared with the amounts in 2012 about 40 of n and 60 of p in animal manure will be discharged to surface waters directly in the cep scenario less animal manure will be discharged to surface water and less fertilizer will be used in crop production this is a result of assumed implementation of the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year and zero growth in synthetic fertilizers after 2020 policies fig c2 c and c2 b urban sources contribute 9 14 to n and 12 34 to p inputs to baiyangdian basin fig 6 this is more than that in guanting basin indicating that the baiyangdian basin is more urbanized our results indicate that 63 kton of n and 10 kton of p in human excretion were produced in baiyangdian basin fig c2 a in supplementary material appendix c in 2012 in 2012 and the ssp3 scenario 50 90 of n and p in human excretion is from rural population that is not connected to centralized sewage systems except for sub basin 5 where the connected urban population is the dominant contributor 60 100 fig c2 a in the cep scenario the number of people in rural areas with no connection to centralized sewage systems will decrease by 10 due to the implementation of the comprehensive improvement of the national rural environmental planning of 13th five year mep and mof 2017 however unconnected rural population will still be the main source of human excretion except for sub basin 5 in the urb scenario sewage inputs to the basin will double as a result of the assumed increasing total and urban population in this scenario there is a large difference among sub basins in terms of sewage inputs in sub basins 2 and 5 most human waste is collected in centralized sewage systems draining into rivers and the lake 73 for sub basin 2 and 90 for sub basin 5 this is due to the establishment of xiong an in the other sub basins most human waste entering the river and lake is from the rural population unconnected to centralized sewage system the differences between urb and urb are small indicating that advanced technologies should be applied in sub basins 2 and 5 where majority of people have connection with sewage systems for other sub basins how to manage sewage systems construction and choose proper technologies of nutrient removal should be considered for the clean water in rural area 3 2 2 river export of nutrients by source to baiyangdian lake three out of eight rivers discharge to baiyangdian lake these three rivers transported around 4243 ton year 1 of tdn and 194 ton year 1 of tdp in 2012 fig 7 these exports vary among sub basins ranging from 1111 to 1946 ton year 1 for tdn and from 38 to 95 ton year 1 for tdp sub basins 5 and 7 blue and yellow bar in fig 7 were the dominant source of din and dip and sub basin 1 pink bar in fig 7 of don and dop to the lake in sub basins 1 and 7 more than 80 of n and p were from point sources which include direct discharge of animal manure and human wastewater fig 8 in sub basin 5 the main sources were same as in sub basins 1 and 7 for don and p but the share of synthetic fertilizers diffuse source manure and human waste point source for din was one third each in the business as usual scenario ssp3 nutrient export by rivers was predicted to increasing by a factor of 1 5 2 for tdn and tdp fig 7 with the same dominant sources as in 2012 the cep scenario shows the effectiveness of current policies to reduce nutrient pollution all forms of n and p will reduce to below 2012 levels the reductions are largest for don and p fig 7 point sources animal manure and human waste will remain major sources of nutrient pollution except din fig 8 but the pollution from human waste exceeds that of animal manure in sub basins 1 and 7 the share of synthetic fertilizers will increase to 33 for din with the implementation of recycling of manure in sub basin 5 next we show that the establishment of xiong an new area may lead to an increase in nutrient pollution in baiyangdian lake scenario urb we also show that this can be avoided by efficient waste water treatment strategies urb compared scenario urb with cep we calculate an obvious increase in nutrients export to baiyangdian lake by 28 43 tdp and tdn resulting from an increasing urban population as a result of this urbanization there will be a reduction in livestock around xiong an new area this explains why the dominant source of nutrients in scenario urb is no longer animal manure but human waste except for dop in the urb scenario we assume that the percentage of the population connected to centralized sewage systems will reach to 100 and 60 in urban and rural areas of xiong an respectively and we assume that these centralized sewage systems will implement the best available technologies to treat human waste with relatively high efficiencies of nutrient removal tertiary treatment van drecht et al 2009 this reduces nutrient pollution however not to the level in the cep scenario these results indicate that to limit the pollution from urbanization effective waste treatment is needed not only in xiong an but also in surrounding areas 4 discussion 4 1 this is the first study implementing the marina model to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake at the sub basin scale considering both point and diffuse sources other studies focused more on nutrient losses from diffuse sources especially agriculture to lakes and reservoirs gassman et al 2014 shen et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 thus sub basin and all nutrient sources analyses were limited but needed for effective management of water quality in the basins furthermore causes of water pollution with nutrients at the sub basin scale were not analyzed before for these two water systems our study is the first to provide insights in the effects of nutrient losses from agriculture and urbanization to guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake we identified the causes of nutrient pollution in the reservoir and lake this information is relevant to formulate effective management options to reduce water pollution we analyzed the consequences of the olympic games 2022 on the quality of the reservoir and of the rural urban intervention on the quality of the lake the strengths of our study are threefold first the marina model allows to quantify dissolved forms of nutrients that are exported to reservoirs and lakes by source and by sub basin figs 3 8 this offers the possibility to look at nutrient yields and their sources attribution point and diffuse source at the sub basin scale while other studies chen 2005 cui 2011 hao et al 2002 shi 2012 sun and hao 2004 wu et al 2017 zhao 2013 zhu 2011 only focus on nutrient outputs to the basin outlets from diffuse source table d1 our results show that managing point sources of animal manure is important for water quality improvement this is in line with the ongoing discussion in china on strengthening prevention and control of n and p pollution from point sources mee 2018 results of our study may support policies developments second our scenario analysis provides new insights how future climate socio economic changes and current environmental policies may influence water quality in the lake and reservoir this was not done before it can help policy makers and other stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of current environmental policies in improving nutrient management on agriculture and urbanization third we explored alternative future scenarios to reduce river export of nutrients to the reservoir and the lake we believe our results improve our understanding of nutrient management for specific lakes and reservoirs the results of our study are highly relevant for policy making for effective environmental policies it can help to evaluate the effectiveness of current environmental policies in improving nutrient management in agriculture and urbanization to reduce water pollution as any model our model has uncertainties we realize that our assumptions for the scenarios might be simplified generating uncertainties in model results however we believe that these uncertainties will not change our main messages we adjusted the model to the local situation by modifying some of the model inputs county scale data from nufer model and parameters e g ldon ldop popcon rur j see tables a1 and a2 for the description of the abbreviations in addition we used local information as much as possible for model inputs e g sewage plants list qnat qact see tables a3 and b1 for details and validated the model against measured data see section 2 4 we believe our model is appropriate for studying trends in nutrient exports to lakes and reservoirs by source and sub basin 4 2 agriculture is the dominant source of nutrients in guanting basin and baiyangdian basin large synthetic fertilizer use in crop production is the main source of n inputs to these two basins figs 3 and 6 the share of synthetic fertilizers in the total inputs to land are higher for baiyangdian basin 53 than for guanting basin 44 fig 3 this is because the drainage basin of baiyangdian reservoir has more arable land table b2 except for synthetic fertilizer p from intensive livestock industries are also important inputs of p to land and to rivers in both basins 40 in guanting basin and 33 in baiyangdian basin the shares of biological n2 fixation and atmospheric n deposition on land of guanting basin are higher than that of baiyangdian basin nutrient inputs to rivers from sewage systems contributes more in baiyangdian basin 9 34 than in guanting basin less than 10 figs 3 and 6 4 3 hydrology differs in guanting basin and baiyangdian basin hydrology is crucial for nutrient export from land to water systems important factors are geography precipitation and river networks human activities such as dam construction and consumption also could affect natural hydrology processes guanting is a reservoir in the mountains while baiyangdian is in the plain the mountainous guanting basin has a different hydrology than the baiyangdian basin in the plain area in guanting basin serious soil erosion associated with extreme rainfall results in diffuse source pollution more easily hao et al 2002 xia and xue 2010 because of the changing precipitation and human water consumption land runoff and water discharge are decreasing in both study areas liu et al 2017 2016 lu et al 2014 wang and qin 2017 this holds in particular for baiyangdian lake where hydrology is affected by human activities more strongly and water discharge is extremely low to zero in some rivers tables b6 and b7 less water discharge can decrease export of nutrients from diffuse sources to surface water systems but may increase pollution of groundwater by nutrient leaching in baiyangdian basin wang 2012 4 4 sources of nutrients differ for guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake nutrient inputs and hydrology affect nutrients transformation from land to water in different ways and lead to water pollution at different extents in guanting reservoir din is mainly from diffuse sources while point sources especially animal manure contribute most to dip don and dop these results show that agriculture strongly affects nutrient export by rivers to guanting reservoir this can be explained as follows guanting basin is developing towards a water conservation area with more rural areas as a result agricultural activities may contribute more nutrients in rivers from these activities also the reservoir receives more water and thus rivers transport more nutrients compared to the lake li et al 2008 in baiyangdian lake this may not be the case in the future our scenarios project a shift in the dominant source from agriculture diffuse sources and animal manure to urbanization human wastewater for din dip and don urbanization will be a main factor resulting in water pollution in baiyangdian lake in the future these results could be explained by the faster urbanization contributing to decrease in surface water quantity in baiyangdian 4 5 implication for future water quality management in this study we analyzed two water bodies in hai he basin as a case study the guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake we calculated increasing water pollution in the future if the current environmental policies in china could be implemented effectively nutrients exports to the lake and the reservoir could be reduced to the level of 2012 in 2050 according to the national ecological functional zoning mep 2008 guanting basin is an important water conservation area including reservoir and its upstream while baiyangdian basin belongs to the urbanizing jing jin ji area also xiong an new area these differences in functional zonings imply that guanting and baiyangdian will have different developing aims in future guanting will be more rural than the fast urbanizing baiyangdian region as a result specific environmental policies need to be considered that acknowledge differences between the two basins with respect to functions nutrient inputs and losses hydrology in guanting basin pollution control could follow from changes in agriculture improved nutrient management can reduce the n and p losses from agriculture without damaging food security for example we could adapt more scientific methods to feed animals and reduce the nutrient excretion bai et al 2014 oenema and tamminga 2005 wang et al 2014 animal manure can be processed and applied on cropland to replace synthetic fertilizer before discharging to surface waters treatment of animal manure such as anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery could be applied to produce biogas and reduce nutrient pollution nasir et al 2012 in baiyangdian basin pollution control is more effective through effective urban development planning and advanced technologies for nutrient removal from urban waste streams in addition intensive livestock production tends to cluster around xiong an where insufficient land is available for recycling animal manure this may pose a risk of water pollution in surrounding sub basins in order to coordinate food provision and environmental impacts a specific strategy is needed for effective manure use and mitigation of nutrient losses in the whole baiyangdian basin 5 conclusions this study is the first to analyze future trends in nutrient inputs into guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake by applying the marina model we analyzed trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business as usual scenario ssp3 and a scenario based on current environmental policies cep in addition we assessed future impacts of 2022 olympic winter games and the establishment of xiong an new area we also explored futures for these two areas assuming implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers the main findings are as follows water pollution caused by nutrient losses in guanting reservoir and baiyangdian lake was contributing to water scarcity in 2012 most nutrient pollution in 2012 was from agriculture for both reservoir and lake in guanting reservoir sub basins 1 2 and 3 contribute around 90 of tdn and tdp inputs to the reservoir more than half of din and dip were from sub basin 3 but sub basins 1 and 2 contributed over two thirds of don and dop in baiyangdian lake sub basins 5 and 7 were the dominant source of din and dip and sub basin 1 of don and dop to the lake between 2012 and 2050 n and p inputs to these two water bodies may double as indicated in the ssp3 scenario which we consider business as usual in this scenario most nutrients are from point sources including direct discharge of manure into rivers the cep scenario shows that current environmental policies may reduce pollution to below 2012 levels in the oly scenario for guanting reservoir the effect of improved waste water treatment on reducing nutrient pollution will not be to a large extent even if in the oly scenario applied advanced waste water treatment systems in all sub basins only 8 13 of nutrients export tdn and tdp decrease by 2050 relative to the cep scenario to improve water quality further in guanting pollution from agriculture needs to be reduced in the urb scenario the planned urbanization may increase in nutrients export to baiyangdian lake by 28 43 tdp and tdn as a result of increased point source sewage systems emissions in the urb scenario the high percentage of the population connected to centralized sewage systems and relatively high efficiencies of nutrient removal tertiary treatment in xiong an will reduce nutrient pollution but not to the level in the cep scenario therefore effective waste treatment is needed not only in xiong an but also in surrounding areas to ensure good water quality in this

11161,agricultural productivity in semi arid regions of china relies on the ridge furrow rf micro rainfall harvesting system and supplemental irrigation reduces damage caused by drought stress however the extent to which the interactive effects of supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall conditions can further improve winter wheat production and radiation use efficiency rue remains unknown therefore a mobile rainproof shelter was used to explore the potential benefit of the rf system under four supplemental irrigation 150 75 37 0 mm levels and three simulated rainfall 275 200 125 mm

grain yield with earlier development and rapid plant growth during each growth stage of winter wheat at each supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall level the results suggest that in semi arid

matter accumulation grain yield semi arid regions 1 introduction water shortage is a main factor limiting winter wheat productivity in semi arid regions of china and drought occurs frequently due to a low and often unpredictable pattern of rainfall patrizia et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 approximately 400 500 mm of evapotranspiration is required for the winter wheat crop growing season but rainfall does not exceed 200 mm therefore deficit irrigation is essential for sustainable wheat production payero et al 2008 over utilization of groundwater resources for irrigation in these areas has caused the water table to fall which has generated several serious ecological issues ali et al 2017 the ridge furrow rf micro rainwater harvesting method with plastic film is one of the most effective methods to conserve rainwater in the root zone and to enhance wheat production and radiation use efficiency rue in semi arid areas tian et al 2003 wang et al 2016a b changes in precipitation in the future due to climate change are likely to decrease rainfall in this area decreasing wheat production and raising risks to the food supply thompson et al 2009 as the worldwide population increases and water scarcity conditions worsen continued improvement of water saving management practices is a key priority to assuring food security and sustainability lobell et al 2008 in this study we begin to address these challenges by examining the effects of different levels of simulated rainfall and supplemental irrigation on winter wheat production and rue in a commonly used rf system numerous studies have shown that use of the rf system can increase the ipar and capture of solar radiation as well as maximize use of light and rainwater particularly with increased supplemental irrigation ren et al

capacity of light to penetrate the lower canopy liu et al 2016 resulting in early senescence of the lower leaves borrás et al 2003 and reducing the rue lai and winter wheat production liu et al 2016 wheat growth is dependent on interception of incoming radiation by the canopy while lai and canopy structure serve to convert this into dry matter plénet et al 2000 the conversion efficiency of

of solar radiation and of soil nutrients muurinen et al 2006 water stress gradually reduces rue by inhibiting effective net photosynthetic rate due to lower intercepted par previous studies reported that drought stress that occurred during the reproductive stage of wheat crop had several consequences for photosynthesis and considerably increased the senescence of leaves resulting in decreased values of lai and rue yang et al 2000 luo et al 2011 senescence of wheat leaves due to drought stress may decrease pre and post flowering dry matter accumulation and wheat production qiu et al 2008 another study reported that water scarcity could also reduce the rate of photosynthesis resulting in lower rue torres et al 2016 the objectives of this study were to determine the following i whether the rf system combined with supplemental irrigation improves the canopy characteristics responsible for the interception of incoming radiation and rue ii the lai and crop growth of winter wheat and par capture ration and iii the photosynthesis efficient conversion of intercepted solar radiation by apical dominance and winter wheat productivity resolving these questions will provide a theoretical basis and practical support for the development of water saving farming systems in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the field study was performed from 2015 to2017

moisture is generally affected by rainfall which is the most essential water resource for winter wheat productivity du et al 2015 high sunlight intensity with high average annual soil evaporation 1753 mm yr is the main causes of water loss in semi arid regions kang et al 2000 liu et al 2010 water loss is tightly linked with soil evaporation due to poor canopy development allowing direct sunlight on the soil surface zhou et al 2009 ridge furrow rf rainwater harvesting system with supplemental irrigation strategies can be used to improve canopy structure and lai for each plant liu et al 2016 this reduces radiation from the sun reaching the soil surface thus inhibiting evaporation and increasing soil water content the rf system reduces soil evaporation and prolongs the period of water availability to critical growth stages zhou et al 2012 the ridges covered with plastic film together with supplemental irrigation can develop the soil water content and reduce loss of water from soil evaporation and increase canopy transpiration and total seasonal et rate as compared with a flat planting without plastic film oweis and hachum 2006 previous studies have shown that an rf system with limited irrigation can maintain soil temperature and increase moisture content thereby significant increasing crop growth and lai duan et al 2006 li et al 2016 in our study we found that varying precipitation concentrations had a significant effect on lai under different supplemental irrigation strategies the difference between supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall was significant at all growth stages except at the tillering and re wintering stages at the grain filling stage treatments with 125 mm simulated rainfall showed a significant decline in lai from than that of the 200 275 mm rainfall levels which indicate that an insufficient water supply can lead to early leaf senescence and reduced lai similar results have been reported by others zhang et al 2011 sabooni et al 2013 intercepted radiation efficiency is only affected by lai and angle of crop leaves mu et al 2010 the rue is affected by cultivation patterns with different irrigation amounts because sink size differs accordingly which affects the rue and the demand for photosynthesis at the grain filling stage reynolds et al 2005 according to ren et al 2008 and gan et al 2013 wheat crop grown under an rf system with different simulated rainfall conditions may affect the lai and expose crops to different amounts of available soil water contents and solar radiation which would cause differences in the rue and pn values our study also demonstrated that significant variations in the rue of winter wheat crop began at the jointing stage achieving a peak rue value at the later grain filling stage the highest rue 1 33 g mj 1 was obtained under the rf1150 treatment which resulted in an increase of 24 2 compared to that of the rf3150 treatment water stress reduces the efficiency of absorbed par used to produce dry matter accumulation stone et al 2000 in other words rue decreases our results are similar to those reported by payero et al 2008 who showed that the decreasing pn value of winter wheat flag leaves leads to a decrease in rue li et al 2001 also found that the pn value is closely related to rue and that its decline greatly reduces the rue which is in line with the results of our study our study found that the pn value and rue were significantly increased with increasing rainfall concentrations and supplemental irrigation under the rf system at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages the pn value and rue under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments was significantly higher than in the rest of all treatments at those three growth stages a 275 mm simulated rainfall level produced a significantly higher value for pn and rue at different supplemental irrigation levels during the grain filling stage than did the 200 mm and 125 mm rainfall levels however during the grain filling stage the rue was independent of pn value which shows that other variables were the key factors in the determination of the rue performance such as lai and dry matter accumulation sauer et al 2007 xie et al 2005 o connell et al 2004 and mahbod et al 2013 revealed that par interception ipar and par capture ratio were the key factors determining crop growth and thus improving grain yield we found that the peak in ipar and par capture ratio were recorded under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at the flowering stage while from the flowering to the grain filling stage the in ipar and par capture ratio gradually declined compared to all other treatments simulated rainfall applications had significant effects on the in ipar and par capture ratio of wheat crop at each supplemental irrigation level during flowering stage compared to the jointing and grain filling growth stages li et al 2007 reported that supplemental irrigation has a greater impact on canopy structure and function compared to cultivation patterns which is in line with the results of our study our study found that the under simulated rainfall of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm and with supplemental irrigation held constant at 150 mm in increased by 11 0 32 2 and 16 3 ipar by 22 2 56 3 and 35 2 and par capture ratio by 15 8 82 7 53 6 respectively over those of rf10 rf20 and rf30 treatments previous studies have hypothesized that a 50 increase in the in ipar and par capture ratio in the upper layers of the crop canopy would contribute to achieving maximum production fang et al 2006 in line with our findings another study showed that soil moisture significantly affects in ipar and par capture ratio stone et al 2000 wajid et al 2007 revealed that increasing irrigation with plastic film mulching had significantly enhanced the in ipar and par capture ratio in wheat crop borrás et al 2003 found that increased irrigation under an rf system could significantly decrease the par reflection ratio lt

is closely related to winter wheat production payero et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that a rf system can increase soil moisture li et al 2001 kang et al 200 zhou et al 2012 thereby increasing the grain yield our study also found that the grain yield of wheat significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall but beyond 200 mm simulated rainfall had no significant effect on grain yield at each supplemental irrigation level grain yield in crops could significantly improve under the rf system which increased the pn values and ensuring prolonged photosynthetic duration zhang et al 2011 tian et al 2003 the radiation related parameters ipar cr in rue of winter wheat were significantly positively correlated with the pn total chl lai and grain

simulated rainfall was significant at all growth stages except at the tillering and re wintering stages although the rf1150 treatment increased the lai at all growth stages the differences were non significant between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at the grain filling stage the 125 mm simulated precipitation treatment showed reduced lai regardless of supplemental irrigation level as compared to that of the 275 200 mm rainfall treatments indicating that an insufficient water supply can lead to early leaf senescence and reduced lai the pn value significantly increased with increasing rainfall concentrations and supplemental irrigation at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages fig 4 from the jointing to the flowering stage the pn value of winter wheat flag leaves significantly increased while from the flowering to the grain filling stage the pn value significantly declined two year averages revealed that the rf system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation and

significantly higher than all other treatments at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages there were no significant differences in the rue at various growth stages of wheat crop when supplied 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels with 150 mm supplemental irrigation significant variations in the rue of winter wheat crop began at the jointing stage and achieved a peak rue value at the grain

treatments 3 3 par interception efficiency in interception of par accumulation ipar and par capture ratio the par interception efficiency in interception of par accumulation ipar and par capture ratio at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages of winter wheat crop were significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and precipitation tables 3 and 4 the peak in ipar and par capture ratio were recorded under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at the flowering stage while from the flowering to the grain filling stage the in ipar and par capture ratio gradually declined compared to the remaining treatments however the variation between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments was non significant at each supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall level table 3 and 4 the in ipar and par capture ratio were significantly increased from the jointing flowering stage and then gradually reduced from the flowering grain filling growth stage the simulated rainfall

that of rf30 treatment 3 5 total chlorophyll ab contents and chlorophyll stability index csi the interactive effect of simulated rainfall in combination of supplemental irrigation under the rf system significantly increased the total chl ab content and chlorophyll stability index csi of winter wheat flag leaves under different simulated rainfall conditions the chl ab content and csi of winter wheat flag leaves increased with increasing precipitation levels while csi significantly decreased with increasing irrigation levels under different simulated rainfall concentrations table 6 however when precipitation increased from 200 to 275 mm there was no significant difference recorded in total chl ab content and csi under different irrigation levels the mean of two years data indicated that under the rf system with 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm rainfall concentrations and 150 mm irrigation level had significantly increased the mean total chl ab content by 151 142 and 85 more than those of the rf30 treatment at each simulated rainfall levels the csi was significantly greater under rf system table 6 however the two years of data revealed that the rf137 and rf237 treatments had significantly higher mean csi values by 8 7 and 4 5 respectively than the values of the rf337 treatment 3 6 winter wheat production the grain yield of wheat crop was significantly affected by the different levels

3 5 2 7 and 1 5 t ha 1 respectively over that of the rf10 treatment the average grain yield of the rf2150 rf275 and rf237 treatments was significantly increased by 4 3 3 1 and 1 5 t ha 1 respectively compared with the rf20 treatment the mean grain yield was significantly increased by 2 8 t ha 1 in the rf3150 treatment 1 6 t ha 1 in the rf375 treatment and 0 9 t ha 1 in the rf337 treatment when compared with that of the rf30 treatment 4 discussion water shortage is an important limiting factor for winter wheat productivity in the semi arid areas of china gan et al 2013 in these areas soil moisture is generally affected by rainfall which is the most essential water resource for winter wheat productivity du et al 2015 high sunlight intensity with high average annual soil evaporation 1753 mm yr is the main causes of water loss in semi arid regions kang et al 2000 liu et al 2010 water loss is tightly linked with soil evaporation due to poor canopy development allowing direct sunlight on the soil surface zhou et al 2009 ridge furrow rf rainwater harvesting system with supplemental irrigation strategies can be used to improve canopy structure and lai for each plant liu et al 2016 this reduces radiation from the sun reaching the soil surface thus inhibiting evaporation and increasing soil water content the rf system reduces soil evaporation and prolongs the period of water availability to critical growth stages zhou et al 2012 the ridges covered with plastic film together with supplemental irrigation can develop the soil water content and reduce loss of water from soil evaporation and increase canopy transpiration and total seasonal et rate as compared with a flat planting without plastic film oweis and hachum 2006 previous studies have shown that an rf system with limited irrigation can maintain soil temperature and increase moisture content thereby significant increasing crop growth and lai duan et al 2006 li et al 2016 in our study we found that varying precipitation concentrations had a significant effect on lai under different supplemental irrigation strategies the difference between supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall was significant at all growth stages except at the tillering and re wintering stages at the grain filling stage treatments with 125 mm simulated rainfall showed a significant decline in lai from than that of the 200 275 mm rainfall levels which indicate that an insufficient water supply can lead to early leaf senescence and reduced lai similar results have been reported by others zhang et al 2011 sabooni et al 2013 intercepted radiation efficiency is only affected by lai and angle of crop leaves mu et al 2010 the rue is affected by cultivation patterns with different irrigation amounts because sink size differs accordingly which affects the rue and the demand for photosynthesis at the grain filling stage reynolds et al 2005 according to ren et al 2008 and gan et al 2013 wheat crop grown under an rf system with different simulated rainfall conditions may affect the lai and expose crops to different amounts of available soil water contents and solar radiation which would cause differences in the rue and pn values our study also demonstrated that significant variations in the rue of winter wheat crop began at the jointing stage achieving a peak rue value at the later grain filling stage the highest rue 1 33 g mj 1 was obtained under the rf1150 treatment which resulted in an increase of 24 2 compared to that of the rf3150 treatment water stress reduces the efficiency of absorbed par used to produce dry matter accumulation stone et al 2000 in other words rue decreases our results are similar to those reported by payero et al 2008 who showed that the decreasing pn value of winter wheat flag leaves leads to a decrease in rue li et al 2001 also found that the pn value is closely related to rue and that its decline greatly reduces the rue which is in line with the results of our study our study found that the pn value and rue were significantly increased with increasing rainfall concentrations and supplemental irrigation under the rf system at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages the pn value and rue under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments was significantly higher than in the rest of all treatments at those three growth stages a 275 mm simulated rainfall level produced a significantly higher value for pn and rue at different supplemental irrigation levels during the grain filling stage than did the 200 mm and 125 mm rainfall levels however during the grain filling stage the rue was independent of pn value which shows that other variables were the key factors in the determination of the rue performance such as lai and dry matter accumulation sauer et al 2007 xie et al 2005 o connell et al 2004 and mahbod et al 2013 revealed that par interception ipar and par capture ratio were the key factors determining crop growth and thus improving grain yield we found that the peak in ipar and par capture ratio were recorded under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at the flowering stage while from the flowering to the grain filling stage the in ipar and par capture ratio gradually declined compared to all other treatments simulated rainfall applications had significant effects on the in ipar and par capture ratio of wheat crop at each supplemental irrigation level during flowering stage compared to the jointing and grain filling growth stages li et al 2007 reported that supplemental irrigation has a greater impact on canopy structure and function compared to cultivation patterns which is in line with the results of our study our study found that the under simulated rainfall of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm and with supplemental irrigation held constant at 150 mm in increased by 11 0 32 2 and 16 3 ipar by 22 2 56 3 and 35 2 and par capture ratio by 15 8 82 7 53 6 respectively over those of rf10 rf20 and rf30 treatments previous studies have hypothesized that a 50 increase in the in ipar and par capture ratio in the upper layers of the crop canopy would contribute to achieving maximum production fang et al 2006 in line with our findings another study showed that soil moisture significantly affects in ipar and par capture ratio stone et al 2000 wajid et al 2007 revealed that increasing irrigation with plastic film mulching had significantly enhanced the in ipar and par capture ratio in wheat crop borrás et al 2003 found that increased irrigation under an rf system could significantly decrease the par reflection ratio lt and par penetration ratio to the lower parts of the winter wheat canopy causing significantly improved soil water content lai pre and post flowering dma and grain yield wang et al 2016a b also reported that the inhibition of par reflection ratio lt and par penetration ratio significantly decreased with increasing irrigation under the plastic film mulch our study also found that the par reflection ratio lt and par penetration ratio of the wheat crop at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were significantly decreased with increasing supplemental irrigation and simulated precipitation under the rf2150 treatment at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were significantly decreased the par reflection ratio by 23 7 69 3 76 1 lt 19 9 81 3 84 9 and par penetration ratio 33 0 83 7 89 1 compared with the rf20 treatment water stress conditions significantly increased the par reflection ratio lt and par penetration ratio chen et al 2003 b water stress encourages stomatal closure which affects the diffusion of co2 from the air to the cell is the major cause for decrease of pn value reddy et al 2014 reddy et al 2004 during drought conditions supplemental irrigation encourages the plant tissue develop leading to a significant improve the pn value cui et al 2015 the pn value and total chl ab decrease due to start leaves senesce and the photosynthetic machine quickly disassemble and decline the photosynthetic capacity of flag leaves ding et al 2004 wang et al 2008 the csi is directly affected by total chl ab which significantly reduced due to water scarcity and turning yellowish of flag leaves as a resulted decline photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2016a in the present study at each simulated rainfall levels the csi significantly increased under rf system water stress leads to the production of ros such as h2o2 and o2 contents which lead to damaged total chl ab and decrease csi irada 2012 crop water consumption is closely related to winter wheat production payero et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that a rf system can increase soil moisture li et al 2001 kang et al 200 zhou et al 2012 thereby increasing the grain yield our study also found that the grain yield of wheat significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall but beyond 200 mm simulated rainfall had no significant effect on grain yield at each supplemental irrigation level grain yield in crops could significantly improve under the rf system which increased the pn values and ensuring prolonged photosynthetic duration zhang et al 2011 tian et al 2003 the radiation related parameters ipar cr in rue of winter wheat were significantly positively correlated with the pn total chl lai and grain yield while pr rr and lt have significantly negative correlation with pn total chl lai and grain yield of winter wheat table 7 taken together our results suggest that in semi arid regions of china

11162,due to the uneven spatio temporal distribution of water resources and increasing water demands driven by urbanization making effective water allocation is a critical and challenging issue nowadays this study proposes an intelligent water allocation system iwas to reduce the water pressure of multiple sectors and enhance the resilience of the water allocation system under urbanization during droughts we first make forecasts on future water demands in response to urbanization for taoyuan city in taiwan by using system dynamics sd based on historical agricultural and industrial data as well as population statistics we next design six water supply scenarios formed by a combination of ten day inflow data collected from the shihmen reservoir in two drought years and three initial reservoir storages the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is then used to search the minimal modified shortage index msi and the maximal ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity rws subject to future water demand forecasts under six designed drought scenarios m 5 rule curves take care of water shortage simulation and serve as a benchmark the results of the nsga ii indicate that the improvement rates of msi and rws can reach up to 24 and 9 6 respectively as compared to those of m 5 rule curves furthermore when we incorporate a great number of irrigation ponds spreading over the study area into the nsga ii model the improvement rates of msi and rws can increase by at most 35 5 and 1 5 respectively as compared to those of the nsga ii without incorporating irrigation ponds the results demonstrate that the proposed iwas can greatly improve the effectiveness and advantages of water allocation especially when irrigation ponds are considered as a water supply source in response to future urban water demands under drought scenarios and therefore provide decision makers with apt reference guidelines for sustainable water resources management keywords intelligent water allocation system iwas water allocation urbanization system dynamics sd non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii irrigation ponds 1 introduction taiwan is situated in the subtropics and receives abundant rainfall however its uneven rainfall distribution and high mountains with rivers of steep slopes and short lengths inevitably cause most of river flow rushes into the ocean making effective use of water resources to meet the growing water demands is a great challenge therefore building an intelligent water resources allocation system is essential and beneficial to decision makers for utilizing water resources aptly in the last decades the economic development in metropolitan areas has greatly increased the demands for various natural resources like water many studies showed that urbanization was a key factor affecting water scarcity e g bao and fang 2012 kanta and zechman 2013 song et al 2016 wu and tan 2012 which created serious problems in environmental social and economic realms recent water resources planning and management methods have more focused on the interactions and feedbacks inside urban systems e g giacomoni et al 2013 system dynamics sd is an approach to studying and managing complex feedback systems for building a model to give insight into the interactions among different components of the system simulate dynamic system behaviors evaluate alternative policies and consequently choose a better management policy forrester 2007 with the great capability of modeling the complex interrelation and dynamic features of nonlinear systems the sd has been used in assessing resources consumption and city management e g ahmad and simonovic 2004 bajracharya and bhattarai 2016 eshtawi et al 2016 feng et al 2013 giordano et al 2015 jeong and adamowski 2016 karami et al 2017 winz et al 2009 xi and poh 2013 however there are limited attempts to take into account the dynamic natures of water resources together with economic and environmental effects as an important aspect of sustainability urbanization with growing population in the last decades has greatly raised the pressure on water management and irrigation water has usually been the first target to reduce when a drought condition had occurred facing the rigorous situation it is desirable to make sustainable water resources management that optimizes multi objective reservoir operation for balancing water demand and supply to deal with multi objective reservoir operation many optimization approaches were proposed in the last decades such as linear

produce many satisfactory results in water resources management e g cheng et al 2008 hassan esfahani et al 2015 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2014 being a modified version of the ga the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 is a branch of artificial intelligence ai and produces wide spread frontiers with fast convergence speed owing to the ability of visually presenting trade offs between objectives the nsga ii has also been widely used in the field of water resources management e g ahmad et al 2014 chang and chang 2009 chang et al 2016 farhadi et al 2016 makaremi et al 2017 tabari and soltani 2013 tsai et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 in order to overcome the water scarcity problems driven by urbanization this study proposes an intelligent water allocation system iwas for reducing the water pressures of various sectors and improving the resilience of the water allocation system during drought periods fig 1 we implement the sd not only to highlight the complex interrelations and dynamic characteristics of a metropolis but to simulate social impacts and forecast future water demands under urbanization we then adopt the nsga ii to optimize the multi objective reservoir operation and search the non dominated frontiers of the optimal water allocation we also evaluate the benefit of incorporating a large number of irrigation ponds spreading over the study area into the multi objective reservoir operation for improving water allocation during paddy farming periods the novelty of this research lies in adopting a system dynamics approach to simulating future water demands in response to urbanization and exploring the optimal strategies of future water allocation based on two water supply sources i e a reservoir and a large number of irrigation ponds through ai techniques for city sustainability management 2 study area and water supply system 2 1 study area in recent years taoyuan city in taiwan serves as a transportation hub and the accompanying career opportunities attract more and more people to reside in taoyuan city therefore the transportation hub has brought rapid growth in population and economic development such that the structure of economic development has transformed from agricultural production to industrial and commercial one as shown in fig 2 a and b the trends of population growth and industrial revenue are increasing since 2005 the shihmen reservoir located in the middle region of the dahan river basin is the pivotal reservoir in northern taiwan with an effective storage capacity of 202 3 million cubic meters mcm and a drainage area of 763 4 km2 the shihmen reservoir operates to meet the municipal industrial and agricultural water demands of both taoyuan city and a part of taipei metropolitan area owing to the shihmen reservoir and the comprehensive irrigation system taoyuan city once flourished in agriculture development and played a major role in rice productivity in taiwan however urban development and the transformation of the economic structure in taoyuan city in recent decades has caused a fact that newly built factories have encroached on irrigation farming lands where a decrease in irrigation area from 38 778 ha to 32 498 ha has occurred during 2005 and 2014 as shown in fig 2 c as a result agricultural productivity has shrunk year by year in taoyuan city due to the smooth slope 1 40 1 120 of the terrain taoyuan city has the topographic advantage for harvesting rainwater in irrigation ponds such that pond water can be conveyed by gravity to irrigate the farms in downstream regions there are a great number 683 of irrigation ponds spreading over the shihmen and the taoyuan irrigation areas with total storage capacities of 10 mcm and 46 mcm respectively however more and more irrigation ponds have been abandoned or transferred into industrial use because of urbanization development in taoyuan city therefore this study also aims at analyzing the potential water availability derived from the joint operation of the multi objective reservoir and irrigation ponds to tackle possible drought situations in the future 2 2 water supply system the shihmen reservoir is a hydraulic facility that supplies water for the multiple purposes of irrigation industrial and municipal uses hydropower generation and flood control in taipei and taoyuan districts fig 3 in the sector of public water supply southern taoyuan is supplied by the shihmen reservoir while northern taoyuan is supplied jointly by the shihmen reservoir together with the houchih weir zhong zhuang weir and yuan shan weir respectively the water supplied to irrigation areas supervised by the shihmen and the taoyuan irrigation associations is conveyed mainly through the shihmen and taoyuan canals respectively the historical inflow of the shihmen reservoir and the historical water shortages in the study area during 1976 and 2008 are illustrated in fig 4 due to the complexity of multi objective reservoir operation the designed rule curves of reservoir operation should be able to meliorate the effect of water supply for each objective fig 5 shows the current operation rule curves m 5 of the shihmen reservoir based on 36 ten day periods during the process of reservoir operation the rule curves will be the guideline to judge droughts and flooding for dispatching water following different countermeasures 3 methodology in this study we propose an intelligent water allocation system iwas that embraces modern techniques of the sd and the nsga ii and incorporates irrigation pond water as a new water supply source for mitigating the tense condition of water management during drought periods under urbanization we first use the sd to analyze the dynamic water consumption in consideration of the urban development in the study area and then construct a model to simulate the sequential changes of water demands in response to urbanization during 2015 and 2030 we next build an optimization model to minimize the water shortages of various sectors by using the nsga ii for dealing with drought events where future water demands are projected by the sd and the drought events are formed by two serious drought years in the past decades finally we assess the benefit of the optimal multi objective operation of the reservoir incorporating a large number of irrigation ponds as another water source especially for water intensive periods i e paddy farming periods in this study the flow chart of the proposed iwas for achieving apt water resources management under urbanization is shown in fig 1 and the brief introduction of the sd and the nsga ii is given as follows 3 1 system dynamics sd sd models are causal mathematical models to deal with the uncertainty and complexity problems and they aspire to explore the understanding and improvement of systems barlas 1996 forrester 1994 the sd is one of the contemporary models that enjoy flexibility to construct a system of interest and simulate the trends of the complex linkages among factors it has been widely used in different applications for understanding social economic agricultural and environmental systems e g dace et al 2015 kotir et al 2016 marzouk and azab 2014 once the initial conditions inputs are set sd models are capable of synthesizing component level knowledge into system behaviors and well simulating the system condition within the preset time interval 3 1 1 forecast future water demands under urbanization by using the sd in this study the sd is used to simulate forecast future water demands under urbanization based on key factors including population growth industrial revenue and land use where three water demanding sectors irrigation industrial and municipal are investigated fig 6 the basic components of the sd consist of flows stocks and connectors as shown in fig 6 a and b the stock box denotes physical and non physical accumulations the flow curve denotes an action in a stock which transport quantities into or out of a stock over time the connector blue arrow is used to connect two variables on a sketch all the parameters and data used to build the sd model were extracted from the open access sources of governmental statistics and corporate annual reports table 1 these credible data sources provided the verification of the future prediction and have significantly enhanced the validity of the sd model the industrial and municipal water demands are formulated mainly by eqs 1 and 2 1 dind wind rind d where dind wind rind and d are the industrial water demand per year the industrial water quota per year the industrial revenue per year and working days per year respectively 2 ddom n pr wdom r where ddom n pr wdom and r are the municipal water demand per year the number of population per year the water supply penetration rate the municipal water quota per year and the percentage of actual meter readings respectively the agricultural water demand is formulated mainly by eq 3 3 d i r a i r r i r 100 100 r l o s s where dir air rir and r loss are the agricultural water demand per year agricultural area size irrigation rate and the rate of water conveyance loss respectively after defining the key factors of each water demanding sector all the factors are configured and fused into the sd model the adjustment value of each factor is presented in green color at the sd simulation stages in fig 6 with the proposed sd methodology we can construct an intricate water demand model to clearly express the interactions among factors without implementing complicated computer programming 3 2 optimize multi objective reservoir operation by using the nsga ii the nsga ii an evolutionary algorithm is one of the commonly used methods for the optimization of multi objective systems and is widely applied in many engineering fields e g dong et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2016 li et al 2017 there are three main features of the nsga ii elitist principle non dominated solutions and explicit diversity preserving mechanism in this study the nsga ii is used to optimize the water allocation in response to future hydrological conditions coupled with growing water demands for figuring out adaptive water allocation strategies more details of the nsga ii can be found in chang and chang 2000 and chang et al 2016 4 case study water shortage has been a critical problem in taoyuan city for many years and furthermore urbanization has further enlarged industrial and municipal water demands under the condition of hydrological uncertainty and urbanization aptly and jointly utilizing local hydraulic facilities such as the reservoir and irrigation ponds will be an important means to tackle droughts in the future we develop three models to simulate and or optimize the water allocation in the study area introduced as follows 4 1 simulation model of future water demands constructed by m 5 rule curves we develop a simulation model of future water demands that are projected by the sd based on agricultural and industrial data as well as population statistics collected during 2005 and 2014 the relationships between the water release r and storage capacity of the shihmen reservoir can be presented by the following equations 4 r ir t d ir t α ir s 5 r pub t d pub t α pub s 6 r total t r ir t r pub t e t 7 s t 1 s t i t r total t 8 s min s t s max where rir t rpub t and rtotal t are the water release of the reservoir for irrigation and public sectors and the total water release of the reservoir in the tth ten day period respectively d ir t and d pub t are the water demands of irrigation and public sectors in the tth ten day period respectively α i r s and α p u b s are the ratios of water releasing from the reservoir to irrigation and public sectors respectively which will be determined by the m 5 rule curves e t is the basic ecoflow of the dahan river in the tth ten day period and s t and i t are the storage and inflow of the reservoir in the tth ten day period respectively the operation strategies of the shihmen reservoir based on m 5 rule curves are shown below a the water allocation system will fully meet water demands if reservoir storage capacity exceeds the lower limit curve b α i r s and α p u b s are set as 0 75 0 9 respectively if reservoir storage capacity falls between the lower limit curve and the critical lower limit curve and c α i r s and α p u b s are set as 0 5 0 8 respectively if reservoir storage capacity falls below the critical lower limit curve 4 2 optimization model of multi objective reservoir operation constructed by the nsga ii in the study area public water demands always gain high priority than irrigation ones in order to make suitable water supply regulations in consideration of a flexible transfer of water from irrigation sectors to industrial and municipal sectors we use the nsga ii to search the optimal ratios α i r o p t s and α p u b o p t s of water release to water demand every ten days for irritation and public sectors respectively for alleviating water shortages and enhancing the resilience of the water allocation system the water supply reliability i e 1 the modified shortage index msi tsai et al 2015 and the ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity rws are adopted as the criteria for evaluating the performance of reservoir operation as a result the objectives of the nsga ii are to maximize the water supply reliability 1 msi and rws for implementation purpose 9 m a x i m i z e 1 msi 1 10000 n t 1 n st t dt t 2 m i n i m i z e msi 10 m a x i m i z e rws 100 n t 1 n s t v where st t is the total water shortage in the tth ten day period dt t is the total water demand in the tth ten day period n is the number of ten day periods investigated i e 36 ten day periods in this study s t is the reservoir storage in the ith ten day period and v is the maximum reservoir capacity i e 209 7 million tons two drought years 1977 and 2002 are selected for operation purpose the constraints of the nsga ii follow those mentioned in section 4 1 4 3 optimization model incorporated with irrigation ponds the purposes of incorporating irrigation ponds into the optimization model are to alleviate the irrigation water shortage and enhance the resilience of the water allocation system especially during water intensive periods e g paddy farming periods in our case two simple guiding rules are set to facilitate the effectual use of irrigation pond water 1 when the ratio of water releasing from the shihmen reservoir to the water demands in irrigation sectors is less than 50 irrigation ponds will fulfill the unsatisfied water demand of irrigation sectors and the operation policy of irrigation ponds will follow eq 12 and 2 if such ratio exceeds 50 irrigation ponds will only meet half of the unsatisfied water demand of irrigation sectors so as not to quickly consume pond water and the operation policy of irrigation ponds will follow eq 13 the water allocation equations of irrigation ponds are shown below 11 p t 1 p t pr t 1 if the ratio of water releasing from the shihmen reservoir to the water demands in irrigation sectors is lower than 50 12 pr t d ir t d ir t α ir opt s 2 if the ratio of water released from the shihmen reservoir to the water demands in irrigation sectors exceeds 50 13 pr t d ir t d ir t α ir opt s 0 5 14 3 t 10 15 pr t p t 0 where p t and pr t are the total impoundments of irrigation ponds and the water supply of irrigation ponds in the tth ten day period respectively eq 14 indicates the joint operation of the reservoir with irrigation ponds will focus on the paddy farming period starting from february to march i e 6 ten day periods 5 results to systematically build up an intelligent water allocation system a meaningful and sequential research conception is essential this study first uses the sd to explore future water demands under urbanization and then uses the nsga ii to optimize the water allocation in response to future hydrological conditions coupled with growing water demands for figuring out adaptive water allocation strategies the results are divided into three parts the first part makes forecasts on the water demands of taoyuan city for the period between 2015 and 2030 by using the sd theory the second part searches for the optimal water allocation strategy by using the nsga ii based on the obtained future water demands and the optimal outcomes are compared with those simulated by m 5 rule curves the third part integrates irrigation ponds into reservoir operation to alleviate the irrigation water intensive conditions during paddy farming periods the results are summarized as follows 5 1 future water demand forecasts the trends of population growth the total industrial revenue and the total irrigation area during 2005 and 2014 are shown in fig 2 respectively we notice that the trends of population growth and the total industrial revenue are almost linearly increasing while the trend of the total irrigation is linearly decreasing these results point out the impacts of urbanization on water allocation i e people migrate to main cities and pursue industries with high economic profits abandon industries with low economic profits such as agriculture these impacts also result in water demand alteration according to the statistical data of water supply allocated by the shihmen reservoir from 2009 to 2013 irrigation sectors consumed 490 million tons of water per year in average while the industrial and municipal sectors consumed 400 million tons of water per year in average a total of 10 year data 2005 2014 were used to build the model in this study where 6 year data 2005 2010 were for model training 2 year data 2011 and 2012 were for model validation and 2 year data 2013 and 2014 were for model testing respectively in terms of the values of relative absolute error rae indicator it is noted that the sd model has a good fitting in accuracy between predicted or simulated and historical water demands in all the three training validation and verification stages fig 6 the results demonstrate that the constructed sd model can well fit the water demands in all three cases i e training validation and testing stages according to the sd results shown in fig 6 the future water demands of municipal and industrial sectors will be 486 million tons per year in average which increases 21 5 as compared with historical one the output stage of fig 6 a on the other hand the future irrigation water demand will be 410 million tons per year in average which is less than the historical one by 10 42 the output stage of fig 6 b the sd results indicate that even though the future irrigation water demand decreases under urbanization the total water demand of the study area still increases with population growth thus it is essential to build a reliable and intelligent water allocation system for mitigating the impacts of urbanization on water shortages in various sectors 5 2 optimal water allocation strategies for optimizing water allocation in response to water deficit we set up six scenarios as hydrological conditions which are a combination of three initial reservoir storages i e 50 40 and 30 with daily reservoir flow series of two most drought years 1977 and 2002 in the past 30 years the nsga ii is implemented to search the optimal pareto front for water supply reliability 1 msi and rws under the six designed scenarios respectively table 2 shows the parameter setting of the nsga ii model and table 3 illustrates the optimal results of the nsga ii as shown in table 3 it is easy to identify that the nsga ii produces much better performances smaller msi and larger rws than the m 5 rule curves in all six scenarios which demonstrates the solutions searched by the nsga ii can efficiently ameliorate water shortage situations it appears that the nsga ii can greatly improve the msi by as high as 35 5 we also notice that a higher ratio of initial reservoir storage will lead to higher improvement rates in both objectives subject to the same water demands fig 7 presents the nsga ii results under the scenario of reservoir inflow of year 2002 initial reservoir storage capacity 50 s50 where the optimal pareto front converged at the 300th generation the results show that the conflicts of the two objectives occur where higher rws is accompanied with lower water supply reliability 1 msi and vice versa it explicitly indicates that high reservoir water release will lead to high water supply reliability the results also point out the best rws 44 7 the best water supply reliability 0 9 and compromise solutions which can help decision makers to choose the most suitable strategy reservoir operation from the diverse solutions for better tackling the concerns about water allocation in brief water shortages in public sectors can be mitigated through transferring water from irrigation sectors to public sectors and a flexible dispatch of irrigation water to replenish public water demands can greatly improve the efficiency of traditional water supply strategies made by m 5 rule curves 5 3 results of the optimal water allocation strategy in consideration of irrigation ponds as shown above the nsga ii indeed provides the optimal solutions to solve the problem of water deficit however we should keep seeking for as many water resources as possible to keep reducing the impacts of urbanization on water allocation in this study we consider the geographical conditions of taoyuan city and regard irrigation ponds spreading over taoyuan city as a potential water supply source table 3 shows the comparative results between two nsga ii models i e integrated w or w o irrigation ponds under six scenarios owing to the potential water volume supplied by the great number of irrigation ponds the results show that obvious improvements in msi can be made for most of the scenarios as irrigation ponds are incorporated into reservoir operation this is especially obvious for the scenarios of 1977 where the improvement rates over the original optimization models can increase by 13 3 23 9 and 35 5 when the initial reservoirs storages are 30 40 and 50 respectively the results demonstrate that irrigation ponds do make a significant and satisfactory contribution to water shortage mitigation especially for paddy farming periods february march in fig 8 the orange line presents the water supplied only from the shihmen reservoir i e no irrigation ponds involved while the blue line presents the water supplied from both the shihmen reservoir and irrigation ponds that is to say the difference between orange and blue lines demonstrates that the joint operation of the reservoir with irrigation ponds could significantly mitigate irrigation water shortage in general and this is especially obvious during the 4th and the 9th ten day periods i e paddy farming period ranging from feb 1 to march 30 under the scenario of 1997 reservoir inflow of year 1977 initial reservoir storage capacity 50 s50 as known water shortage could result in a decrease in agricultural production the water shortage rates of irrigation sectors would significantly decrease in general only slightly increase in the 11th and the 12th ten day periods in a very drought year i e 1977 in this study case if irrigation ponds cold be incorporated into reservoir operation the analyzed results demonstrate that the nsga ii could efficiently ameliorate water shortage situations and keep water supply sufficient in the consequent irrigation periods this again provides a clear evidence that the large number of irrigation ponds in the study area could be a valuable facility for promoting the effective use of water resources and have the merit of significant mitigation on water deficit during drought periods from the perspective of practice in reality the realization of incorporating irrigation ponds into reservoir operation still lies on the minor engineering approaches to keeping the connection between the shihmen reservoir and each pond such as through irrigation channels open channels and underdrains besides irrigation ponds should store water as much as possible before dry seasons according to the joint operation rules of the shihmen reservoir and irrigation ponds if water shortage occurs the shihmen reservoir will focus on supplying water to industrial and municipal sectors while irrigation ponds can afford to meet the water demands of irrigation use or local areas flexibly in this way the impact of water shortages on both public and agricultural demands could be mitigated the proposed approach could benefit both irrigation associations the authority responsible for irrigation sectors and the water resource agency wra in taiwan authority responsible for public and industry water supply 6 conclusions the fast development of urbanization and industrialization in recent years has brought huge impacts on water demands following the direction of environmental protection and sustainable city development this study demonstrates how to use the existing water resources efficiently in an adaptive manner for water allocation and how to overcome water deficit under urbanization we propose the iwas which consists of three major modules 1 projecting the future water demands in response to urbanization by using the sd method 2 optimizing water allocation by using the nsga ii method based on the projected future water demands and 3 mitigating water shortages through an incorporation of a great number of irrigation ponds into the water allocation system the results of the sd models show that urbanization may change the water demands of different sectors whereas it still cannot change the fact that water resource shortage remains critical in the future previous studies indicated that the nsga ii could be a powerful and flexible tool to effectively build complex and dynamic water allocation systems in an adaptive manner for obtaining satisfactorily counterbalanced solutions for the nsga ii optimization model we consider two objectives maximizing water supply reliability and the ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity for assessing the impacts of urbanization on irrigation water supply when irrigation water is dispatched to replenish public water demands the results indicate that the iwas can significantly decrease public water shortages but just slightly affect irrigation water shortages during drought periods in response to urbanization the improvement rates of the msi and the rws can reach up to 24 and 9 6 respectively as compared to those of m 5 rule curves moreover on account of a great number of irrigation ponds located in taoyuan city we consider them as another viable water source that bears great potential in enhancing water supply reliability and decreasing water pressure the results show that water shortage conditions can be effectively alleviated as the iwas is integrated with irrigation ponds especially during paddy farming periods the improvement rates of the msi and the rws can enhance by up to 35 5 and 1 5 respectively as compared to those of the nsga ii without incorporating irrigation ponds our results show that even though the optimal strategy of water supply is to dispatch irrigation water to satisfy public water demands we still can satisfy irrigation water demands to ensure food security through iwas coupled with irrigation ponds we conclude that the flexibility on water resources management is the sticking point for drought mitigation especially at the moment of rapid urbanization and growing water demands the water transfer strategies and the idea of incorporating irrigation ponds into reservoir operation could provide a nice alternative for decision makers to make better water management

11162,due to the uneven spatio temporal distribution of water resources and increasing water demands driven by urbanization making effective water allocation is a critical and challenging issue nowadays this study proposes an intelligent water allocation system iwas to reduce the water pressure of multiple sectors and enhance the resilience of the water allocation system under urbanization during droughts we first make forecasts on future water demands in response to urbanization for taoyuan city in taiwan by using system dynamics sd based on historical agricultural and industrial data as well as population statistics we next design six water supply scenarios formed by a combination of ten day inflow data collected from the shihmen reservoir in two drought years and three initial reservoir storages the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is then used to search the minimal modified shortage index msi and the maximal ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity rws subject to future water demand forecasts under six designed drought scenarios m 5 rule curves take care of water shortage simulation and serve as a benchmark the results of the nsga ii indicate that the improvement rates of msi and rws can reach up to 24 and 9 6 respectively as compared to those of m 5 rule curves furthermore when we incorporate a great number of irrigation ponds spreading over the study area into the nsga ii model the improvement rates of msi and rws can increase by at most 35 5 and 1 5 respectively as compared to those of the nsga ii without incorporating irrigation ponds the results demonstrate that the proposed iwas can greatly improve the effectiveness and advantages of water allocation especially when irrigation ponds are considered as a water supply source in response to future urban water demands under drought scenarios and therefore provide decision makers with apt reference guidelines for sustainable water resources management keywords intelligent water allocation system iwas water allocation urbanization system dynamics sd non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii irrigation ponds 1 introduction taiwan is situated in the subtropics and receives abundant rainfall however its uneven rainfall distribution and high mountains with rivers of steep slopes and short lengths inevitably cause most of river flow rushes into the ocean making effective use of water resources to meet the growing water demands is a great challenge therefore building an intelligent water resources allocation system is essential and beneficial to decision makers for utilizing water resources aptly in the last decades the economic development in metropolitan areas has greatly increased the demands for various natural resources like water many studies showed that urbanization was a key factor affecting water scarcity e g bao and fang 2012 kanta and zechman 2013 song et al 2016 wu and tan 2012 which created serious problems in environmental social and economic realms recent water resources planning and management methods have more focused on the interactions and feedbacks inside urban systems e g giacomoni et al 2013 system dynamics sd is an approach to studying and managing complex feedback systems for building a model to give insight into the interactions among different components of the system simulate dynamic system behaviors evaluate alternative policies and consequently choose a better management policy forrester 2007 with the great capability of modeling the complex interrelation and dynamic features of nonlinear systems the sd has been used in assessing resources consumption and city management e g ahmad and simonovic 2004 bajracharya and bhattarai 2016 eshtawi et al 2016 feng et al 2013 giordano et al 2015 jeong and adamowski 2016 karami et al 2017 winz et al 2009 xi and poh 2013 however there are limited attempts to take into account the dynamic natures of water resources together with economic and environmental effects as an important aspect of sustainability urbanization with growing population in the last decades has greatly raised the pressure on water management and irrigation water has usually been the first target to reduce when a drought condition had occurred facing the rigorous situation it is desirable to make sustainable water resources management that optimizes multi objective reservoir operation for balancing water demand and supply to deal with multi objective reservoir operation many optimization approaches were proposed in the last decades such as linear programming lp non linear programming np dynamic programming dp and genetic algorithm ga e g ahmad et al 2014 bai et al 2015 chang and chang 2001 chang and wang 2013 chaves et al 2004 jones et al 2002 yang et al 2009 yeh 1985 among these approaches the ga embedded with an adaptive heuristic search algorithm for simulating the evolution process in nature is one of the most promising methods that produce many satisfactory results in water resources management e g cheng et al 2008 hassan esfahani et al 2015 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2014 being a modified version of the ga the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 is a branch of artificial intelligence ai and produces wide spread frontiers with fast convergence speed owing to the ability of visually presenting trade offs between objectives the nsga ii has also been widely used in the field of water resources management e g ahmad et al 2014 chang and chang 2009 chang et al 2016 farhadi et al 2016 makaremi et al 2017 tabari and soltani 2013 tsai et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 in order to overcome the water scarcity problems driven by urbanization this study proposes an intelligent water allocation system iwas for reducing the water pressures of various sectors and improving the resilience of the water allocation system during drought periods fig 1 we implement the sd not only to highlight the complex interrelations and dynamic characteristics of a metropolis but to simulate social impacts and forecast future water demands under urbanization we then adopt the nsga ii to optimize the multi objective reservoir operation and search the non dominated frontiers of the optimal water allocation we also evaluate the benefit of incorporating a large number of irrigation ponds spreading over the study area into the multi objective reservoir operation for improving water allocation during paddy farming periods the novelty of this research lies in adopting a system dynamics approach to simulating future water demands in response to urbanization and exploring the optimal strategies of future water allocation based on two water supply sources i e a reservoir and a large number of irrigation ponds through ai techniques for city sustainability management 2 study area and water supply system 2 1 study area in recent years taoyuan city in taiwan serves as a transportation hub and the accompanying career opportunities attract more and more people to reside in taoyuan city therefore the transportation hub has brought rapid growth in population and economic development such that the structure of economic development has transformed from agricultural production to industrial and commercial one as shown in fig 2 a and b the trends of population growth and industrial revenue are increasing since 2005 the shihmen reservoir located in the middle region of the dahan river basin is the pivotal reservoir in northern taiwan with an effective storage capacity of 202 3 million cubic meters mcm and a drainage area of 763 4 km2 the shihmen reservoir operates to meet the municipal industrial and agricultural water demands of both taoyuan city and a part of taipei metropolitan area owing to the shihmen reservoir and the comprehensive irrigation system taoyuan city once flourished in agriculture development and played a major role in rice productivity in taiwan however urban development and the transformation of the economic structure in taoyuan city in recent decades has caused a fact that newly built factories have encroached on irrigation farming lands where a decrease in irrigation area from 38 778 ha to 32 498 ha has occurred during 2005 and 2014 as shown in fig 2 c as a result agricultural productivity has shrunk year by year in taoyuan city due to the smooth slope 1 40 1 120 of the terrain taoyuan city has the topographic advantage for harvesting rainwater in irrigation ponds such that pond water can be conveyed by gravity to irrigate the farms in downstream regions there are a great number 683 of irrigation ponds spreading over the shihmen and the taoyuan irrigation areas with total storage capacities of 10 mcm and 46 mcm respectively however more and more irrigation ponds have been abandoned or transferred into industrial use because of urbanization development in taoyuan city therefore this study also aims at analyzing the potential water availability derived from the joint operation of the multi objective reservoir and irrigation ponds to tackle possible drought situations in the future 2 2 water supply system the shihmen reservoir is a hydraulic facility that supplies water for the multiple purposes of irrigation industrial and municipal uses hydropower generation and flood control in taipei and taoyuan districts fig 3 in the sector of public water supply southern taoyuan is supplied by the shihmen reservoir while northern taoyuan is supplied jointly by the shihmen reservoir together with the houchih weir zhong zhuang weir and yuan shan weir respectively the water supplied to irrigation areas supervised by the shihmen and the taoyuan irrigation associations is conveyed mainly through the shihmen and taoyuan canals respectively the historical inflow of the shihmen reservoir and the historical water shortages in the study area during 1976 and 2008 are illustrated in fig 4 due to the complexity of multi objective reservoir operation the designed rule curves of reservoir operation should be able to meliorate the effect of water supply for each objective fig 5 shows the current operation rule curves m 5 of the shihmen reservoir based on 36 ten day periods during the process of reservoir operation the rule curves will be the guideline to judge droughts and flooding for dispatching water following different countermeasures 3 methodology in this study we propose an intelligent water allocation system iwas that embraces modern techniques of the sd and the nsga ii and incorporates irrigation pond water as a new water supply source for mitigating the tense condition of water management during drought periods under urbanization we first use the sd to analyze the dynamic water consumption in consideration of the urban development in the study area and then construct a model to simulate the sequential changes of water demands in response to urbanization during 2015 and 2030 we next build an optimization model to minimize the water shortages of various sectors by using the nsga ii for dealing with drought events where future water demands are projected by the sd and the drought events are formed by two serious drought years in the past decades finally we assess the benefit of the optimal multi objective operation of the reservoir incorporating a large number of irrigation ponds as another water source especially for water intensive periods i e paddy farming periods in this study the flow chart of the proposed iwas for achieving apt water resources management under urbanization is shown in fig 1 and the brief introduction of the sd and the nsga ii is given as follows 3 1 system dynamics sd sd models are causal mathematical models to deal with the uncertainty and complexity problems and they aspire to explore the understanding and improvement of systems barlas 1996 forrester 1994 the sd is one of the contemporary models that enjoy flexibility to construct a system of

simulating the system condition within the preset time interval 3 1 1 forecast future water demands under urbanization by using the sd in this study the sd is used to simulate forecast future water demands under urbanization based on key factors including population growth industrial revenue and land use where three water demanding sectors irrigation industrial and municipal are investigated fig

stock which transport quantities into or out of a stock over time the connector blue arrow is used to connect two variables on a sketch all the parameters and data used to build the sd model were extracted from the open access sources of governmental statistics and corporate annual reports table 1 these credible data sources provided the verification of the future prediction and have significantly enhanced the validity of the sd model the industrial and municipal water demands are formulated mainly by eqs 1 and 2 1 dind wind rind d where dind wind rind and d are the industrial water demand per year the industrial water quota per year the industrial revenue per year and working days per year respectively 2 ddom n pr wdom r where ddom n pr wdom and r are the municipal water demand per year the number of population per year the water supply penetration rate the municipal water quota per year and the percentage of actual meter readings respectively the agricultural water demand is formulated mainly by eq 3 3 d i r a i r r i r 100 100 r l o s s where dir air rir and r loss are the agricultural water demand per year agricultural area size irrigation rate and the rate of water conveyance loss respectively after defining the key factors of each water demanding sector all the factors are configured and fused into the sd model the adjustment value of each factor is presented in green color at the sd simulation stages in fig 6 with the proposed sd methodology we can construct an intricate water demand model to clearly express the interactions among factors without implementing complicated computer programming 3 2 optimize multi objective reservoir operation by using the nsga ii the nsga ii an evolutionary algorithm is one of the commonly used methods for the optimization of multi objective systems and is widely applied in many engineering fields e g dong et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2016 li et al 2017 there are three main features of the nsga ii elitist principle non dominated solutions and explicit diversity preserving mechanism in this study the nsga ii is used to optimize the water allocation in response to future hydrological conditions coupled with growing water demands for figuring out adaptive water allocation strategies more details of the nsga ii can be found in chang and chang 2000 and chang et al 2016 4 case study water shortage has been a critical problem in taoyuan city for many years and furthermore urbanization has further enlarged industrial and municipal water demands under the condition of hydrological uncertainty and urbanization aptly and jointly utilizing local hydraulic facilities such as the reservoir and irrigation ponds will be an important means to tackle droughts in the future we develop three models to simulate and or optimize the water allocation in the study area introduced as follows 4 1 simulation model of future water demands constructed by m 5 rule curves we develop a simulation model of future water demands that are projected by the sd based on agricultural and industrial data as well as population statistics collected during 2005 and 2014 the relationships between the water release r and storage capacity of the shihmen reservoir can be presented by the following equations 4 r ir t d ir t α ir s 5 r pub t d pub t α pub s 6 r total t r ir t r pub t e t 7 s t 1 s t i t r total t 8 s min s t s max where rir t rpub t and rtotal t are the water release of the reservoir for irrigation and public sectors and the total water release of the reservoir in the tth ten day period respectively d ir t and d pub t are the water demands of irrigation and public sectors in the tth ten day period respectively α i r s and α p u b s are the ratios of water releasing from the reservoir to irrigation and public sectors respectively which will be determined by the m 5 rule curves e t is the basic ecoflow of the dahan river in the tth ten day period and s t and i t are the storage and inflow of the reservoir in the tth ten day period respectively the operation strategies of the shihmen reservoir based on m 5 rule curves are shown below a the water allocation system will fully meet water demands if reservoir storage capacity exceeds the lower limit curve b α i r s and α p u b s are set as 0 75 0 9 respectively if reservoir storage capacity falls between the lower limit curve and the critical lower limit curve and c α i r s and α p u b s are set as 0 5 0 8 respectively if reservoir storage capacity falls below the critical lower limit curve 4 2 optimization model of multi objective reservoir operation constructed by the nsga ii in the study area public water demands always gain high priority than irrigation ones in order to make suitable water supply regulations in consideration of a flexible transfer of water from irrigation sectors to industrial and municipal sectors we use the nsga ii to search the optimal ratios α i r o p t s and α p u b o p t s of water release to water demand every ten days for irritation and public sectors respectively for alleviating water shortages and enhancing the resilience of the water allocation system the water supply reliability i e 1 the modified shortage index msi tsai et al 2015 and the ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity rws are adopted as the criteria for evaluating the performance of reservoir operation as a result the objectives of the nsga ii are to maximize the water supply reliability 1 msi and rws for implementation purpose 9 m a x i m i z e 1 msi 1 10000 n t 1

two drought years 1977 and 2002 are selected for operation purpose the constraints of the nsga ii follow those mentioned in section 4 1 4 3 optimization model incorporated with irrigation ponds the purposes of incorporating irrigation ponds into the optimization model are to alleviate the irrigation water shortage and enhance the resilience of the water allocation system especially during water intensive periods e g paddy farming periods in our case two simple guiding rules are set to facilitate the effectual use of irrigation pond water 1 when the ratio of water releasing from the shihmen reservoir to the water demands in irrigation sectors is less than 50 irrigation ponds will fulfill the unsatisfied water demand of irrigation sectors and the operation policy of irrigation ponds will follow eq 12 and 2 if such ratio exceeds 50 irrigation ponds will only meet half of the unsatisfied water demand of irrigation sectors so as not to quickly consume pond water and the operation policy of irrigation ponds will follow eq 13 the water allocation equations of irrigation ponds are shown below 11 p t 1 p t pr t 1 if the ratio of water releasing from the shihmen reservoir to the water demands in irrigation sectors is lower than 50 12 pr t d ir t d ir t α ir opt s 2 if the ratio of water released from the shihmen reservoir to the water demands in irrigation sectors exceeds 50 13 pr

eq 14 indicates the joint operation of the reservoir with irrigation ponds will focus on the paddy farming period starting from february to march i e 6 ten day periods 5 results to systematically build up an intelligent water allocation system a meaningful and sequential research conception is essential this study first uses the sd to explore future water demands under urbanization and then uses the nsga ii to optimize the water allocation in response to future hydrological conditions coupled with growing water demands for figuring out adaptive water allocation strategies the results are divided into three parts the first part makes forecasts on the water demands of taoyuan city for the period between 2015 and 2030 by using the sd theory the second part searches for the optimal water allocation strategy by using the nsga ii based on the obtained future water demands and the optimal outcomes are compared with those simulated by m 5 rule curves the third part integrates irrigation ponds into reservoir operation to alleviate the irrigation water intensive conditions during paddy farming periods the results are summarized as follows 5 1 future water demand forecasts the trends of population growth the total industrial revenue and the total irrigation area during 2005 and 2014 are shown in fig 2 respectively we notice that the trends of population growth and the total industrial revenue are almost linearly increasing while the trend of the total irrigation is linearly decreasing these results point out the impacts of urbanization on water allocation i e people migrate to main cities and pursue industries with high economic profits abandon industries with low economic profits such as agriculture these impacts also result in water demand alteration according to the statistical data of water supply allocated by the shihmen reservoir from 2009 to 2013 irrigation sectors consumed 490 million tons of water per year in average while the industrial and municipal sectors consumed 400 million tons of water per year in average a total of 10 year data 2005 2014 were used to build the model in this study where 6 year data 2005 2010 were for model training 2 year data 2011 and 2012 were for model validation and 2 year data 2013 and 2014 were for model testing respectively in terms of the values of relative absolute error rae indicator it is noted that the sd model has a good fitting in accuracy between predicted or simulated and historical water demands in all the three training validation and verification stages fig 6 the results demonstrate that the constructed sd model can well fit the water demands in all three cases i e training validation and testing stages according to the sd results shown in fig 6 the future water demands of municipal and industrial sectors will be 486 million tons per year in average which increases 21 5 as compared with historical one the output stage of fig 6 a on the other hand the future irrigation water demand will be 410 million tons per year in average which is less than the historical one by 10 42 the output stage of fig 6 b the sd results indicate that even though the future irrigation water demand decreases under urbanization the total water demand of the study area still increases with population growth thus it is essential to build a reliable and intelligent water allocation system for mitigating the impacts of urbanization on water shortages in various sectors 5 2 optimal water allocation strategies for optimizing water allocation in response to water deficit we set up six scenarios as hydrological conditions which are a combination of three initial reservoir storages i e 50 40 and 30 with daily reservoir flow series of two most drought years 1977 and 2002 in the past 30 years the nsga ii is implemented to search the optimal pareto front for water supply reliability 1 msi and rws under the six designed scenarios respectively table 2 shows the parameter setting of the nsga ii model and table 3 illustrates the optimal results of the nsga ii as shown in table 3 it is easy to identify that the nsga ii produces much better performances smaller msi and larger rws than the m 5 rule curves in all six scenarios which demonstrates the solutions searched by the nsga ii can efficiently ameliorate water shortage situations it appears that the nsga ii can greatly improve the msi by as high as 35 5 we also notice that a higher ratio of initial reservoir storage will lead to higher improvement rates in both objectives subject to the same water demands fig 7 presents the nsga ii results under the scenario of reservoir inflow of year 2002 initial reservoir storage capacity 50 s50 where the optimal pareto front converged at the 300th generation the results show that the conflicts of the two objectives occur where higher rws is accompanied with lower water supply reliability 1 msi and vice versa it explicitly indicates that high reservoir water release will lead to high water supply reliability the results also point out the best rws 44 7 the best water supply reliability 0 9 and compromise solutions which can help decision makers to choose the most suitable strategy reservoir operation from the diverse solutions for better tackling the concerns about water allocation in brief water shortages in public sectors can be mitigated through transferring water from irrigation sectors to public sectors and a flexible dispatch of irrigation water to replenish public water demands can greatly improve the efficiency of traditional water supply strategies made by m 5 rule curves 5 3 results of the optimal water allocation strategy in consideration of irrigation ponds as shown above the nsga ii indeed provides the optimal solutions to solve the problem of water deficit however we should keep seeking for as many water resources as possible to keep reducing the impacts of urbanization on water allocation in this study we consider the geographical conditions of taoyuan city and regard irrigation ponds spreading over taoyuan city as a potential water supply source table 3 shows the comparative results between two nsga ii models i e integrated w or w o irrigation ponds under six scenarios owing to the potential water volume supplied by the great number of irrigation ponds the results show that obvious improvements in msi can be made for most of the scenarios as irrigation ponds are incorporated into reservoir operation this is especially obvious for the scenarios of 1977 where the improvement rates over the original optimization models can increase by 13 3 23 9 and 35 5 when the initial reservoirs storages are 30 40 and 50 respectively the results demonstrate that irrigation ponds do make a significant and satisfactory contribution to water shortage mitigation especially for paddy farming periods february march in fig 8 the orange line presents the water supplied only from the shihmen reservoir i e no irrigation ponds involved while the blue line presents the water supplied from both the shihmen reservoir and irrigation ponds that is to say the difference between orange and blue lines demonstrates that the joint operation of the reservoir with irrigation ponds could significantly mitigate irrigation water shortage in general and this is especially obvious during the 4th and the 9th ten day periods i e paddy farming period ranging from feb 1 to march 30 under the scenario of 1997 reservoir inflow of year 1977 initial reservoir storage capacity 50 s50 as known water shortage could result in a decrease in agricultural production the water shortage rates of irrigation sectors would significantly decrease in general only slightly increase in the 11th and the 12th ten day periods in a very drought year i e 1977 in this study case if irrigation ponds cold be incorporated into reservoir operation the analyzed results demonstrate that the nsga ii could efficiently ameliorate water shortage situations and keep water supply sufficient in the consequent irrigation periods this again provides a clear evidence that the large number of irrigation ponds in the study area could be a valuable facility for promoting the effective use of water resources and have the merit of significant mitigation on water deficit during drought periods from the perspective of practice in reality the realization of incorporating irrigation ponds into reservoir operation still lies on the minor engineering approaches to keeping the connection between the shihmen reservoir and each pond such as through irrigation channels open channels and underdrains besides irrigation ponds should store water as much as possible before dry seasons according to the joint operation rules of the shihmen reservoir and irrigation ponds if water shortage occurs the shihmen reservoir will focus on supplying water to industrial and municipal sectors while irrigation ponds can afford to meet the water demands of irrigation use or local areas flexibly in this way the impact of water shortages on both public and agricultural demands could be mitigated the proposed approach could benefit both irrigation associations the authority responsible for irrigation sectors and the water resource agency wra in taiwan authority responsible for public and industry water supply 6 conclusions the fast development of urbanization and industrialization in recent years has brought huge impacts on water demands following the direction of environmental protection and sustainable city development this study demonstrates how to use the existing water resources efficiently in an adaptive manner for water allocation and how to overcome water deficit under urbanization we propose the iwas which consists of three major modules 1 projecting the future water demands in response to urbanization by using the sd method 2 optimizing water allocation by using the nsga ii method based on the projected future water demands and 3 mitigating water shortages through an incorporation of a great number of irrigation ponds into the water allocation system the results of the sd models show that urbanization may change the water demands of different sectors whereas it still cannot change the fact that water resource shortage remains critical in the future previous studies indicated that the nsga ii could be a powerful and flexible tool to effectively build complex and dynamic water allocation systems in an adaptive manner for obtaining satisfactorily counterbalanced solutions for the nsga ii optimization model we consider two objectives maximizing water supply reliability and the ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity for assessing the impacts of urbanization on irrigation water supply when irrigation water is dispatched to replenish public water demands the results indicate that the iwas can significantly decrease public water shortages but just slightly affect irrigation water shortages during drought periods in response to urbanization the improvement rates of the msi and the rws can reach up to 24 and 9 6 respectively as compared to those of m 5 rule curves moreover on account of a great number of irrigation ponds located in taoyuan city we consider them as another viable water source that bears great potential in enhancing water supply reliability and decreasing water pressure the results show that water shortage conditions can be effectively alleviated as the iwas is integrated with irrigation ponds especially during paddy farming periods the improvement rates of the msi and the rws can enhance by up to 35 5 and 1 5 respectively as compared to those of the nsga ii without incorporating irrigation ponds our results show that even though the optimal strategy of water supply is to dispatch irrigation water to satisfy public water demands we still can satisfy irrigation water demands to ensure food security through iwas coupled with irrigation ponds we conclude that the flexibility on water resources management is the sticking point for drought mitigation especially at the moment of rapid urbanization and growing water demands the water transfer strategies and the idea of incorporating irrigation ponds into reservoir operation could provide a nice alternative for decision makers to make better water management

11163,irrigation water requirement is influenced by climatic fluctuations which can be simulated using agro meteorological models this study investigates fluctuating irrigation water requirements for rice as affected by drought occurrences irrigation requirements were simulated by the aquacrop model in paddy fields of guilan in northern iran model validation was done based on field measurements during two consecutive years of 2012 and 2013 in the study area the reconnaissance drought index rdi based on cumulative values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was used for drought monitoring for 1982 2014 in two time scales of 3 and 6 month also irrigation water requirements iwr were calculated for this period the normalized root mean square error nrmse for simulating canopy cover biomass rice evapotranspiration and deep percolation by aquacrop were obtained 7 0 8 8 18 45 and 26 6 respectively the contributions of crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation in iwr were 70 5 and 22 9 respectively there are more drought occurrences after 1994 a good correlation was obtained between simulated rice iwr and rdi of july calculated with 3 month time scale r 0 89 maximum amounts of required irrigation water in wet normal and dry years were 6750 8050 and 8760 m³ ha 1 respectively obtained relationship between rice iwr and rdi of july with a 3 month time scale can be used to allocate paddies irrigation water of the studied area at transplanting time based on seasonal forecasts of drought keywords irrigation prediction reconnaissance drought index rice et 1 introduction trying to make optimal use of agricultural inputs is an inevitable way to promote the next generation food production due to scarcity of water and soil resources for decades irrigation has also been used as a form of insurance on yield reductions due to dry spells and to control the uniform quality of high value export crops irrigated lands cover 16 of the agricultural area while producing 40 of all crops bos et al 2009 hence irrigation plays a major role in feeding the world awareness of irrigation water requirement iwr could help to modify consumption patterns and reduce water demand and increase water productivity iwr depends on local weather conditions soil type and farm management practices annual iwr varies due to climatic fluctuations and resulting changes in the irrigation scheduling determining iwr exclusively based on the field researches is difficult and time consuming simulation models are an important tool for studying the present and future effects of climatic fluctuations on agriculture mei et al 2011 crop simulation models have been applied to show the responses of yield production to changes in temperature bachelet and gay 1993 aggarwal and mall

bachelet and gay 1993 the effects of environmental factors such as drought occurrence on iwr can be investigated using crop growth simulation models bray 1997 accurate modelling of iwr can improve irrigation management relating iwr more closely to drought occurrence popova and pereira 2008 wriedt et al 2009 smith et al 2012 crop simulation models need to be calibrated and parameterized to local conditions before they can be used as predictive tools the algorithm of these models usually estimates the production rate of biomass from the captured resources such as carbon dioxide solar radiation and water azam et al 1994 steduto 2003 the water driven crop growth models assume a linear relationship between biomass growth rate and transpiration through a water productivity parameter tanner and sinclair 1983 steduto and albrizio 2005 aquacrop is a water driven growth model presented by fao steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 a major advantage of water driven models over radiation driven models is the opportunity to normalize the water productivity wp parameter for climate making these models widely applicable in different locations under varying climatic and spatio temporal settings steduto and albrizio 2005 steduto et al 2007 guilan province is located at the northern part of iran fig 1 rice as the most important crop is produced from about 230 000 ha in guilan ministry of jahad e keshvarzi 2015 sefidrood dam is located on sefidrood river upstream of guilan plain and supplies irrigation water for 189 000 ha of rice cultivated area the rest of the paddy fields are irrigated by local river or groundwater resources in recent years various water storage and adjustments dams have been built in basins upstream of sefidrood dam resulting in less water entering the sefidrood dam reservoir and a water supply crisis in the guilan province now in the operation of sefidrood irrigation and drainage network iwr is estimated for normal condition based on the average of a climatic period and does not consider the effects of wet or dry conditions on iwr crop yield or water productivity it is necessary to account for climatic fluctuations particular drought in a more realistic estimation of iwr drought indices are important tools for monitoring and assessing drought for planners designers and water resources managers richard and heim 2002 hayes 2004 irrigation requirements vary by climatic fluctuations that are monitored by drought indices therefore drought monitoring can be used to predict irrigation requirements before the start of the growing season one of the most widely used indices for assessing the severity of the drought is reconnaissance drought index rdi calculated on the basis of monthly amounts of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration water scarcity could be better expressed using rdi with regard to evapotranspiration as compared to indices that are only based on precipitation rdi can be more effectively associated with hydrological and agricultural drought also it is an ideal index to study the effects of climate instability tsakiris and vangelis 2005 this study was conducted to estimate iwr of paddy rice in guilan as affected by climatic fluctuations using the fao aquacrop model and relate the simulated iwr to the corresponding rdi the aim was to find a relationship between rdi and irrigation water requirements in order to be able to predict irrigation water requirements before the start of the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area location guilan province is located at south of the caspian sea and bounded to talesh mountains westward and alborz mountain range southward the plain regions of thisprovince are located between the sea and the mountains guilan s climate is known as moderate caspian which is under the influence of weather from both alborz mountains and caspian sea the sefidrood irrigation and drainage network consist of three districts east central

for the period 1982 2014 are shown in table 1 2 2 field measurements field measurements were conducted during two years 2012 and 2013 equipment to measure evapotranspiration et and deep percolation dp were installed in 10 paddy fields at first the measurements were continued over the two years only for seven fields and the measured data are the means for the seven fields the geographical positions of the studied paddy fields and that of the meteorological station are shown in fig 2 before cultivation soil samples were taken from each field at depth of 0 30 and 30 60 cm subsamples were randomly collected from 12 points of each field and provided as a composite sample soil particles size distribution was determined using the hydrometer method klute 1986 the volumetric water content at field capacity 33 kpa matric suction fc and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa matric suction pwp were measured using a pressure cell soil characteristic data are shown in table 2 the fields were flooded and covered by 5 10 cm water depth and puddled before transplanting a local cultivar named hashemi was transplanted on may 4 in both years and harvested on july 29 2012 and on august 4 2013 fertilizers were applied as 100 50 50 25 kg ha 1 of n p k zn in the form of urea triple super phosphate potassium sulfate and zinc sulfate respectively according to recommendations by rice research institute of iran the irrigation was controlled by a reference mark in each field and the water level was regulated at 3 to 7 cm in each irrigation event due to spatial variations in plot leveling regular field control and measurements were carried out between 7 to 8 30 am from field 1 to field 7 fig 2 respectively based on recorded dates and daily temperature data the duration of a process or the time required to reach a particular stage was computed in growing degree day gdd c day instead of number of days raes et al 2012 a closed bottom cylindrical mini lysimeter with a diameter of 56 cm and depth of 60 cm was installed in each field to measure the crop evapotranspiration etc the mini lysimeters set in the underground farming operations such as transplanting date and density 6 plants at 20 20 cm spacing in mini lysimeter in mini lysimeters were the same as the surrounding field also an open bottom cylinder with a diameter of 20 cm and depth of 50 cm 30 cm below the soil on the hard pan layer was used to measure deep percolation in each field a lid was placed on each cylinder to prevent evaporation from it etc and dp were measured at 2 or 3 day intervals at the start water level in the mini lysimeters and cylinders were adjusted to be the same as outside this level was marked as the reference level in subsequent measurements in the absence of rain water level in the mini lysimeter or cylinder dropped due to etc or dp water was then added to reach the reference level and the volume added was taken as the amount of etc or dp during that period in the event of rain etc was calculated as the sum of rain and the added water when water was added to reach the reference level or as the amount of rain minus the removed water when water was removed to reach the reference level during growing season the reference level inside the mini lysimeters and cylinders were also the same as outside and water level was adjusted at 3 to 7 cm in each irrigation event in cylinders water level after adjusting to the reference level would be partially higher than the outside because of et in each field and at each sampling time an area of 1 m2 was harvested every 10 days for measuring leaf area index lai and biomass plants were removed with roots and transported to the laboratory with the roots immersed in water in pots in order to maintain plants freshness then the leaves stems and panicles of plants were separated and leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter model li 3100 area meter lai was calculated based on 1 m2 planted area to calculate the canopy

raes et al 2009a steduto et al 2009 aquacrop calculates separately crop transpiration and soil evaporation using an approach based essentially on crop coefficients and a daily water balance

previous period from 1982 to 2014 reference et for those 33 years were calculated the same way as already described aquacrop features a way to calculate iwr but not for flooded cultivation it was necessary to generate an irrigation schedule to approximate intermittent flooding using the generation of irrigation schedule feature of the model first the start of simulation was set at 1 day before transplanting with initial condition of soil water set at 50 total available water taw according to regional soil water condition in may to account for water needed for pre transplanting flooding the irrigation schedule in aquacrop can be generated based on time and depth of irrigation under time criterion in the model the allowable depletion of readily available water raw was set to zero under depth criterion the amount of water applied was set at back to fc 50 mm to keep the soil saturated and flooded from transplanting to 10 days before harvesting at 10 days before harvesting time criterion was set to deplete raw 100 and depth criterion was set as back to fc 100 mm to simulate drying of paddy fields for harvesting bund height in field management menu was set at 0 25 m and water depth between soil bunds in initial condition menu set as zero the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was taken to be the measured values table 2 2 6 drought assessment rdi as a drought characterization index is proposed by tsakiris and vangelis 2005 rdi is based on the ratio of cumulative precipitation to cumulative potential evapotranspiration ak over the same time interval and is denoted by ak with k indicating a certain month during a year the standardized rdi rdist is computed by eq 6 6 r d i s t k y k y k σ ˆ k where yk is the ln ak of a given year ȳk and σ ˆ k are the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation of ln ak for all the years of the climate record data it is advisable to use periods of 3 6 9 and 12 months in calculating rdi as a general indicator of meteorological drought tsakiris and vangelis 2005 the mentioned time scales mean that ak is for a period ending at the end of month k plus including the time of 2 5 8 or 11 months preceding the month k with total coverage of 3 6 9 or 12 months in this study potential evapotranspiration was taken to be the reference et calculated based on fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the rdi was calculated for the period 1982 2014 in two time scales of 3 and 6 month regarding the period of agricultural activities on the paddy fields then the best month and time scale for rdi to estimate iwr is obtained based on the correlation between rdi and estimated iwr from aquacrop also the rdi and corresponding iwr were classified for drought severity with rdi 0 5 being considered as wet 0 5 rdi 0 5 as normal and rdi 0 5 as dry the standardized rdi rdist behaves in a generally similar way to the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and therefor the interpretation of the results is similar since the same threshold as spi can be used tsakiris and vangelis 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation the occurred rainfall and simulated and observed etc as well as dp in the paddy fields during growing season 2012 and 2013 are shown in fig 3 as expected there was an increasing of dp and a decreasing of etc with occurrence of rainfall the simulated and observed cc and bm are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively for each parameter the standard deviation across measurements on 7 fields per day were calculated in excel software and are shown as the error bars in the figures there is quite a good fit between observed and simulated data measured etc varied between 2 4 to 6 9 mm d 1 for both years measured dp ranged between 0 7 2 3 mm d 1 in the paddy fields according to fukuda and tsutsui 1979 dp in paddy fields in japan was 1 to 3 mm d 1 for clay loam pirmoradian et al 2004 obtained 3 5 mm d 1 of dp in continuous flooding irrigation of a paddy field with a silty clay soil in southern iran in guilan province the amount of dp reported by herve 1996 was 1 9 to 4 2 mm d 1 in foumanat district for continuous flooding irrigation in this study soil textures of paddy fields were clay table 2 and water depth in irrigation events of the fields regulated between 3 and 7 cm therefore the measured dp were lower than those obtained maximum measured lai during growing season were 4 29 and 4 06 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the observed yield and bm at harvest were obtained 4 52 0 3 and 10 86 0 49 t ha 1 in 2012 and 4 76 0 31 and 11 56 0 33 t ha 1 in 2013 respectively grain yield was estimated with an absolute error of 6 0 the statistical indications of model performance in simulating etc dp cc and bm are shown in table 4 based on the average of nrmse there was an excellent performance nrmse 10 in simulating cc bm and yield also simulation results of etc and dp by aquacrop were good 10 nrmse 20 and fair 20 nrmse 30 respectively there was an overestimate of dp according to a mean of relative error as 0 165 water level in the cylinder during days after that regulation would be partially higher than the outside because of et this difference in hydraulic head would probably cause the measured dp to be only very slightly higher than the actual dp in addition the lower accuracy in simulating dp can be due to spatial variations of soil characteristics as shown in table 2 that the standard deviation of soil particles percent were 6 4 on average also regarding observed data of seven fields the coefficients of variation of the measured dp ranged between 0 10 0 91 and 0 08 0 41 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the ef coefficient determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of the observations nash and sutcliffe 1970 an ef close to 1 indicates a perfect match between the model and the observations an ef of 0 means that the model predictions are as accurate as the average of the observed data and a negative ef occurs when the mean of the observations is a better prediction than the model therefore there are indication of perfect match between observed and simulated cc and bm for etc the value of ef 0 6 is not perfect but shows a good simulation since the measurements in the fields have some complicacy and uncertain factors that result in the errors for dp the value of ef is negative and shows the mean of the observations 1 4 mm d 1 is a better prediction than the model a d represents the ratio between the mean square error and the potential error which is defined as the sum of the squared absolute values of the distances from the predicted values to the mean observed value and the distances from observed values to the mean observed value willmott 1982 therefore values of d 0 87 indicate the perfect agreement between observed etc dp cc and bm and those simulated by aquacrop in case of rice growth simulation saadati et al 2011 reported that the rmse was 0 7 t ha 1 for simulating grain yield 4 3 6 1 t ha 1 in the validation process shrestha et al 2013 calibrated and validated the aquacrop model to local field data of the lowland rice in nepal and reported ef of 0 92 for grain yield simulation maniruzzamana et al 2015 for lowland rice in bangladesh presented cc simulation statistics as 7 6 nrmse 14 3 0 9 ef 0 99 and 0 97 d 1 00 and bm simulation statistics as 10 0 nrmse 14 7 0 93 ef 1 00 and 0 97 d 1 00 in their validation season those results are similar to this study in the cases of ef and d but the lower values of nrmse were obtained in this study 3 2 simulation of iwr simulated iwr and total occurred rainfall during rice growing season for the studied years 1982 2014 are shown in fig 6 total rainfall during rice growing season ranged between 22 mm 1989 to 302 mm 2004 with an average of 121 mm the amount of iwr varied from 240 mm 2004 to 515 mm 2014 with a mean of 418 mm a correlation coefficient of 0 91 was obtained between iwr and total rainfall during rice growing season the other 9 variation could be caused by variations of no effective rainfall for studied years simulated transpiration evaporation and deep percolation mm during rice growing season for the studied years are shown in fig 7 averaging 249 131 and 123 mm respectively for the studied years the amount of moisture left stored in the soil averaged 36 mm at harvest based on soil water balance typical et rates of rice in asia range from 4 to 7 mm d 1 de datta 1981 tuong 1999 maniruzzamana et al 2015 reported the irrigation requirements of 749 and 843 mm to meet continuous irrigation of rice that was cultivated in a silty clay soil in bangladesh with the measured percolations of 468 and 509 during two consecutive years respectively in east coast malaysia hayes 2004observed that the average seasonal consumptive use of water for rice cultivation was 795 mm out of which 572 mm 72 was accounted by et and 223 mm 28 by percolation in this study the contributions of etc and dp in iwr were 70 5 and 22 9 respectively the other 6 6 was moisture left stored in the soil variations of paddy iwr could be depended on climate soil and field management so different results are expected for different regions 3 3 drought analysis variations of the calculated rdi during 1982 2014 in 3 and 6 month time scales are shown in fig 8 in general with increasing in time scale the drought duration and severity as rdi values tend to increase the periods of droughts in fig 8 were often interrupted by normal rainfall which slightly relieved the drought as shown there are more drought occurrences after 1994 the percentages of wet normal and dry conditions during 1982 2014 and separately for 1982 1994 and 1995 2014 periods are presented in table 5 the frequency of drought had more than doubled during 1995 2014 compared to 1982 1994 this is the consequence of 3 month decreased precipitation and increased eto for 1982 1994 p 363 mm eto 208 mm compared to 1995 2014 p 317 mm eto 230 mm 3 4 rdi and iwr relationship to drought assessment rdi was calculated for every month in two time scales now as a question which of rdi time scale and month is according to iwr of rice therefore correlation coefficients between iwr of rice and rdi in 3 6 month time scales are shown in table 6 with respect to duration of rice growing season in the studied area 15 may to 15 august about 90 days the highest correlations are obtained for the months of june july and august and those correlation coefficients are decreased with increasing time scale the best correlation r 0 89 is for rdi of july with 3 month time scale that rdi during 1982 2014 is shown in fig 9 during the 33 year studied the frequencies of wet normal and dry years for rice cultivation were 11 33 13 40 and 9 27 respectively also the mean values of simulated iwr of rice for wet normal and dry conditions were 333 435 and 495 mm respectively the relationship between rdi for july with 3 month time scale and iwr of rice for the studied area is shown in fig 10 iwr indicates a lower sensitivity to rdi in the negative range its variation is 74 mm in the negative range compared to 171 mm in the positive range based on the relationship maximum value of iwr was obtained 511 mm 4 conclusion considering efficiencies of water conveyance 95 distribution 93 and operation 66 pirmoradian 2016 there should be allocated 4550 6750 6750 8050 and 8050 to 8760 m 3 ha 1 of irrigation water in wet normal and dry years respectively for the 3293 ha of rice cultivated in eastern f1 this relationship can be used to allocate the paddies irrigation water of the studied area based on drought prediction studies rdi is calculated from measured weather data in monthly time scale on the other hand water allocation is usually made ahead of planting time for the crop so rdi must be predicted for the future then iwr can be estimated based on rdi with 3 month time scale and used by water resources planners they can decide to apply water allocation policies in drought conditions such as water supply turnaround or the management of transplanting date in the study area drought forecasting is generally based on drought indicators computed using dynamic or statistical model simulations of drought related variables aghakouchak 2014 chhinh and millington 2015 focused on relationships between drought occurrences in cambodia and i damage to the annual rice harvest and ii the niño 3 4 index there was achieved a statistically significant correlation r 0 455 between niño 3 4 and 12 month spi standard precipitation index values lagged by three months that indicated the importance of enso linkages in explaining drought in that region prediction of rdi can be made based on the probability of rdi values derived from past weather records or on weather forecasted for the full growing season the validity of the seasonal forecasts depends on the ability to model processes on the scale of months for example wetterhall et al 2015 used a probabilistic seasonal forecasting system and investigated how well seasonal forecasts predict dry spells over a basin during the rainy season with lead times from 0 to 4 months the forecasts showed skill in predicting dry spells in comparison with a climatological ensemble based on previous years also aghakouchak 2014 used a probabilistic framework for drought forecasting based on the persistence property of accumulated soil moisture and showed that the us drought of summer 2012 was predictable several months in advance therefore rdi can be predicted based on seasonal forecasts that provide information on the development of the climate up to 3 months then water allocation can be planned at transplanting time for paddy fields

11163,irrigation water requirement is influenced by climatic fluctuations which can be simulated using agro meteorological models this study investigates fluctuating irrigation water requirements for rice as affected by drought occurrences irrigation requirements were simulated by the aquacrop model in paddy fields of guilan in northern iran model validation was done based on field measurements during two consecutive years of 2012 and 2013 in the study area the reconnaissance drought index rdi based on cumulative values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was used for drought monitoring for 1982 2014 in two time scales of 3 and 6 month also irrigation water requirements iwr were calculated for this period the normalized root mean square error nrmse for simulating canopy cover biomass rice evapotranspiration and deep percolation by aquacrop were obtained 7 0 8 8 18 45 and 26 6 respectively the contributions of crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation in iwr were 70 5 and 22 9 respectively there are more drought occurrences after 1994 a good correlation was obtained between simulated rice iwr and rdi of july calculated with 3 month time scale r 0 89 maximum amounts of required irrigation water in wet normal and dry years were 6750 8050 and 8760 m³ ha 1 respectively obtained relationship between rice iwr and rdi of july with a 3 month time scale can be used to allocate paddies irrigation water of the studied area at transplanting time based on seasonal forecasts of drought keywords irrigation prediction reconnaissance drought index rice et 1 introduction trying to make optimal use of agricultural inputs is an inevitable way to promote the next generation food production due to scarcity of water and soil resources for decades irrigation has also been used as a form of insurance on yield reductions due to dry spells and to control the uniform quality of high value export crops irrigated lands cover 16 of the agricultural area while producing 40 of all crops bos et al 2009 hence irrigation plays a major role in feeding the world awareness of irrigation water requirement iwr could help to modify consumption patterns and reduce water demand and increase water productivity iwr depends on local weather conditions soil type and farm management practices annual iwr varies due to climatic fluctuations and resulting changes in the irrigation scheduling determining iwr exclusively based on the field researches is difficult and time consuming simulation models are an important tool for studying the present and future effects of climatic fluctuations on agriculture mei et al 2011 crop simulation models have been applied to show the responses of yield production to changes in temperature bachelet and gay 1993 aggarwal and mall

bachelet and gay 1993 the effects of environmental factors such as drought occurrence on iwr can be investigated using crop growth simulation models bray 1997 accurate modelling of iwr can improve irrigation management relating iwr more closely to drought occurrence popova and pereira 2008 wriedt et al 2009 smith et al 2012 crop simulation models need to be calibrated and parameterized to local conditions before they can be used as predictive tools the algorithm of these models usually estimates the production rate of biomass from the captured resources such as carbon dioxide solar radiation and water azam et al 1994 steduto 2003 the water driven crop growth models assume a linear relationship between biomass growth rate and transpiration through a water productivity parameter tanner and sinclair 1983 steduto and albrizio 2005 aquacrop is a water driven growth model presented by fao steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 a major advantage of water driven models over radiation driven models is the opportunity to normalize the water productivity wp parameter for climate making these models widely applicable in different locations under varying climatic and spatio temporal settings steduto and albrizio 2005 steduto et al 2007 guilan province is located at the northern part of iran fig 1 rice as the most important crop is produced from about 230 000 ha in guilan ministry of jahad e keshvarzi 2015 sefidrood dam is located on sefidrood river upstream of guilan plain and supplies irrigation water for 189 000 ha of rice cultivated area the rest of the paddy fields are irrigated by local river or groundwater resources in recent years various water storage and adjustments dams have been built in basins upstream of sefidrood dam resulting in less water entering the sefidrood dam reservoir and a water supply crisis in the guilan province now in the operation of sefidrood irrigation and drainage network iwr is estimated for normal condition based on the average of a climatic period and does not consider the effects of wet or dry conditions on iwr crop yield or water productivity it is necessary to account for climatic fluctuations particular drought in a more realistic estimation of iwr drought indices are important tools for monitoring and assessing drought for planners designers and water resources managers richard and heim 2002 hayes 2004 irrigation requirements vary by climatic fluctuations that are monitored by drought indices therefore drought monitoring can be used to predict irrigation requirements before the start of the growing season one of the most widely used indices for assessing the severity of the drought is reconnaissance drought index rdi calculated on the basis of monthly amounts of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration water scarcity could be better expressed using rdi with regard to evapotranspiration as compared to indices that are only based on precipitation rdi can be more effectively associated with hydrological and agricultural drought also it is an ideal index to study the effects of climate instability tsakiris and vangelis 2005 this study was conducted to estimate iwr of paddy rice in guilan as affected by climatic fluctuations using the fao aquacrop model and relate the simulated iwr to the corresponding rdi the aim was to find a relationship between rdi and irrigation water requirements in order to be able to predict irrigation water requirements before the start of the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area location guilan province is located at south of the caspian sea and bounded to talesh mountains westward and alborz mountain range southward the plain regions of thisprovince are located between the sea and the mountains guilan s climate is known as moderate caspian which is under the influence of weather from both alborz mountains and caspian sea the sefidrood irrigation and drainage network consist of three districts east central

for the period 1982 2014 are shown in table 1 2 2 field measurements field measurements were conducted during two years 2012 and 2013 equipment to measure evapotranspiration et and deep percolation dp were installed in 10 paddy fields at first the measurements were continued over the two years only for seven fields and the measured data are the means for the seven fields the geographical positions of the studied paddy fields and that of the meteorological station are shown in fig 2 before cultivation soil samples were taken from each field at depth of 0 30 and 30 60 cm subsamples were randomly collected from 12 points of each field and provided as a composite sample soil particles size distribution was determined using the hydrometer method klute 1986 the volumetric water content at field capacity 33 kpa matric suction fc and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa matric suction pwp were measured using a pressure cell soil characteristic data are shown in table 2 the fields were flooded and covered by 5 10 cm water depth and puddled before transplanting a local cultivar named hashemi was transplanted on may 4 in both years and harvested on july 29 2012 and on august 4 2013 fertilizers were applied as 100 50 50 25 kg ha 1 of n p k zn in the form of urea triple super phosphate potassium sulfate and zinc sulfate respectively according to recommendations by rice research institute of iran the irrigation was controlled by a reference mark in each field and the water level was regulated at 3 to 7 cm in each irrigation event due to spatial variations in plot leveling regular field control and measurements were carried out between 7 to 8 30 am from field 1 to field 7 fig 2 respectively based on recorded dates and daily temperature data the duration of a process or the time required to reach a particular stage was computed in growing degree day gdd c day instead of number of days raes et al 2012 a closed bottom cylindrical mini lysimeter with a diameter of 56 cm and depth of 60 cm was installed in each field to measure the crop evapotranspiration etc the mini lysimeters set in the underground farming operations such as transplanting date and density 6 plants at 20 20 cm spacing in mini lysimeter in mini lysimeters were the same as the surrounding field also an open bottom cylinder with a diameter of 20 cm and depth of 50 cm 30 cm below the soil on the hard pan layer was used to measure deep percolation in each field a lid was placed on each cylinder to prevent evaporation from it etc and dp were measured at 2 or 3 day intervals at the start water level in the mini lysimeters and cylinders were adjusted to be the same as outside this level was marked as the reference level in subsequent measurements in the absence of rain water level in the mini lysimeter or cylinder dropped due to etc or dp water was then added to reach the reference level and the volume added was taken as the amount of etc or dp during that period in the event of rain etc was calculated as the sum of rain and the added water when water was added to reach the reference level or as the amount of rain minus the removed water when water was removed to reach the reference level during growing season the reference level inside the mini lysimeters and cylinders were also the same as outside and water level was adjusted at 3 to 7 cm in each irrigation event in cylinders water level after adjusting to the reference level would be partially higher than the outside because of et in each field and at each sampling time an area of 1 m2 was harvested every 10 days for measuring leaf area index lai and biomass plants were removed with roots and transported to the laboratory with the roots immersed in water in pots in order to maintain plants freshness then the leaves stems and panicles of plants were separated and leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter model li 3100 area meter lai was calculated based on 1 m2 planted area to calculate the canopy

raes et al 2009a steduto et al 2009 aquacrop calculates separately crop transpiration and soil evaporation using an approach based essentially on crop coefficients and a daily water balance

conducted by using the default conservative parameters hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009b calibrated by fao for rice along with local management dependent parameters and phonological stages for the

and 2013 seasons after preparing the other input data simulation was run with aquacrop version 6 0 for mentioned period 2 5 model estimation of iwr the validated model was used to estimate iwr for a previous period from 1982 to 2014 reference et for those 33 years were calculated the same way as already described aquacrop features a way to calculate iwr but not for flooded cultivation it was necessary to generate an irrigation schedule to approximate intermittent flooding using the generation of irrigation schedule feature of the model first the start of simulation was set at 1 day before transplanting with initial condition of soil water set at 50 total available water taw according to regional soil water condition in may to account for water needed for pre transplanting flooding the irrigation schedule in aquacrop can be generated based on time and depth of irrigation under time criterion in the model the allowable depletion of readily available water raw was set to zero under depth criterion the amount of water applied was set at back to fc 50 mm to keep the soil saturated and flooded from transplanting to 10 days before harvesting at 10 days before harvesting time criterion was set to deplete raw 100 and depth criterion was set as back to fc 100 mm to simulate drying of paddy fields for harvesting bund height in field management menu was set at 0 25 m and water depth between soil bunds in initial condition menu set as zero the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was taken to be the measured values table 2 2 6 drought assessment rdi as a drought characterization index is proposed by tsakiris and vangelis 2005 rdi is based on the ratio of cumulative precipitation to cumulative potential evapotranspiration ak over the same time interval and is denoted by ak with k indicating a certain month during a year the standardized rdi rdist is computed by eq 6 6 r d i s t k y k y k σ ˆ k where yk is the ln ak of a given year ȳk and σ ˆ k are the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation of ln ak for all the years of the climate record data it is advisable to use periods of 3 6 9 and 12 months in calculating rdi as a general indicator of meteorological drought tsakiris and vangelis 2005 the mentioned time scales mean that ak is for a period ending at the end of month k plus including the time of 2 5 8 or 11 months preceding the month k with total coverage of 3 6 9 or 12 months in this study potential evapotranspiration was taken to be the reference et calculated based on fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the rdi was calculated for the period 1982 2014 in two time scales of 3 and 6 month regarding the period of agricultural activities on the paddy fields then the best month and time scale for rdi to estimate iwr is obtained based on the correlation between rdi and estimated iwr from aquacrop also the rdi and corresponding iwr were classified for drought severity with rdi 0 5 being considered as wet 0 5 rdi 0 5 as normal and rdi 0 5 as dry the standardized rdi rdist behaves in a generally similar way to the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and therefor the interpretation of the results is similar since the same threshold as spi can be used tsakiris and vangelis 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation the occurred rainfall and simulated and observed etc as well as dp in the paddy fields during growing season 2012 and 2013 are shown in fig 3 as expected there was an increasing of dp and a decreasing of etc with occurrence of rainfall the simulated and observed cc and bm are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively for each parameter the standard deviation across measurements on 7 fields per day were calculated in excel software and are shown as the error bars in the figures there is quite a good fit between observed and simulated data measured etc varied between 2 4 to 6 9 mm d 1 for both years measured dp ranged between 0 7 2 3 mm d 1 in the paddy fields according to fukuda and tsutsui 1979 dp in paddy fields in japan was 1 to 3 mm d 1 for clay loam pirmoradian et al 2004 obtained 3 5 mm d 1 of dp in continuous flooding irrigation of a paddy field with a silty clay soil in southern iran in guilan province the amount of dp reported by herve 1996 was 1 9 to 4 2 mm d 1 in foumanat district for continuous flooding irrigation in this study soil textures of paddy fields were clay table 2 and water depth in irrigation events of the fields regulated between 3 and 7 cm therefore the measured dp were lower than those obtained maximum measured lai during growing season were 4 29 and 4 06 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the observed yield and bm at harvest were obtained 4 52 0 3 and 10 86 0 49 t ha 1 in 2012 and 4 76 0 31 and 11 56 0 33 t ha 1 in 2013 respectively grain yield was estimated with an absolute error of 6 0 the statistical indications of model performance in simulating etc dp cc and bm are shown in table 4 based on the average of nrmse there was an excellent performance nrmse 10 in simulating cc bm and yield also simulation results of etc and dp by aquacrop were good 10 nrmse 20 and fair 20 nrmse 30 respectively there was an overestimate of dp according to a mean of relative error as 0 165 water level in the cylinder during days after that regulation would be partially higher than the outside because of et this difference in hydraulic head would probably cause the measured dp to be only very slightly higher than the actual dp in addition the lower accuracy in simulating dp can be due to spatial variations of soil characteristics as shown in table 2 that the standard deviation of soil particles percent were 6 4 on average also regarding observed data of seven fields the coefficients of variation of the measured dp ranged between 0 10 0 91 and 0 08 0 41 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the ef coefficient determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of the observations nash and sutcliffe 1970 an ef close to 1 indicates a perfect match between the model and the observations an ef of 0 means that the model predictions are as accurate as the average of the observed data and a negative ef occurs when the mean of the observations is a better prediction than the model therefore there are indication of perfect match between observed and simulated cc and bm for etc the value of ef 0 6 is not perfect but shows a good simulation since the measurements in the fields have some complicacy and uncertain factors that result in the errors for dp the value of ef is negative and shows the mean of the observations 1 4 mm d 1 is a better prediction than the model a d represents the ratio between the mean square error and the potential error which is defined as the sum of the squared absolute values of the distances from the predicted values to the mean observed value and the distances from observed values to the mean observed value willmott 1982 therefore values of d 0 87 indicate the perfect agreement between observed etc dp cc and bm and those simulated by aquacrop in case of rice growth simulation saadati et al 2011 reported that the rmse was 0 7 t ha 1 for simulating grain yield 4 3 6 1 t ha 1 in the validation process shrestha et al 2013 calibrated and validated the aquacrop model to local field data of the lowland rice in nepal and reported ef of 0 92 for grain yield simulation maniruzzamana et al 2015 for lowland rice in bangladesh presented cc simulation statistics as 7 6 nrmse 14 3 0 9 ef 0 99 and 0 97 d 1 00 and bm simulation statistics as 10 0 nrmse 14 7 0 93 ef 1 00 and 0 97 d 1 00 in their validation season those results are similar to this study in the cases of ef and d but the lower values of nrmse were obtained in this study 3 2 simulation of iwr simulated iwr and total occurred rainfall during rice growing season for the studied years 1982 2014 are shown in fig 6 total rainfall during rice growing season ranged between 22 mm 1989 to 302 mm 2004 with an average of 121 mm the amount of iwr varied from 240 mm 2004 to 515 mm 2014 with a mean of 418 mm a correlation coefficient of 0 91 was obtained between iwr and total rainfall during rice growing season the other 9 variation could be caused by variations of no effective rainfall for studied years simulated transpiration evaporation and deep percolation mm during rice growing season for the studied years are shown in fig 7 averaging 249 131 and 123 mm respectively for the studied years the amount of moisture left stored in the soil averaged 36 mm at harvest based on soil water balance typical et rates of rice in asia range from 4 to 7 mm d 1 de datta 1981 tuong 1999 maniruzzamana et al 2015 reported the irrigation requirements of 749 and 843 mm to meet continuous irrigation of rice that was cultivated in a silty clay soil in bangladesh with the measured percolations of 468 and 509 during two consecutive years respectively in east coast malaysia hayes 2004observed that the average seasonal consumptive use of water for rice cultivation was 795 mm out of which 572 mm 72 was accounted by et and 223 mm 28 by percolation in this study the contributions of etc and dp in iwr were 70 5 and 22 9 respectively the other 6 6 was moisture left stored in the soil variations of paddy iwr could be depended on climate soil and field management so different results are expected for different regions 3 3 drought analysis variations of the calculated rdi during 1982 2014 in 3 and 6 month time scales are shown in fig 8 in general with increasing in time scale the drought duration and severity as rdi values tend to increase the periods of droughts in fig 8 were often interrupted by normal rainfall which slightly relieved the drought as shown there are more drought occurrences after 1994 the percentages of wet normal and dry conditions during 1982 2014 and separately for 1982 1994 and 1995 2014 periods are presented in table 5 the frequency of drought had more than doubled during 1995 2014 compared to 1982 1994 this is the consequence of 3 month decreased precipitation and increased eto for 1982 1994 p 363 mm eto 208 mm compared to 1995 2014 p 317 mm eto 230 mm 3 4 rdi and iwr relationship to drought assessment rdi was calculated for every month in two time scales now as a question which of rdi time scale and month is according to iwr of rice therefore correlation coefficients between iwr of rice and rdi in 3 6 month time scales are shown in table 6 with respect to duration of rice growing season in the studied area 15 may to 15 august about 90 days the highest correlations are obtained for the months of june july and august and those correlation coefficients are decreased with increasing time scale the best correlation r 0 89 is for rdi of july with 3 month time scale that rdi during 1982 2014 is shown in fig 9 during the 33 year studied the frequencies of wet normal and dry years for rice cultivation were 11 33 13 40 and 9 27 respectively also the mean values of simulated iwr of rice for wet normal and dry conditions were 333 435 and 495 mm respectively the relationship between rdi for july with 3 month time scale and iwr of rice for the studied area is shown in fig 10 iwr indicates a lower sensitivity to rdi in the negative range its variation is 74 mm in the negative range compared to 171 mm in the positive range based on the relationship maximum value of iwr was obtained 511 mm 4 conclusion considering efficiencies of water conveyance 95 distribution 93 and operation 66 pirmoradian 2016 there should be allocated 4550 6750 6750 8050 and 8050 to 8760 m 3 ha 1 of irrigation water in wet normal and dry years respectively for the 3293 ha of rice cultivated in eastern f1 this relationship can be used to allocate the paddies irrigation water of the studied area based on drought prediction studies rdi is calculated from measured weather data in monthly time scale on the other hand water allocation is usually made ahead of planting time for the crop so rdi must be predicted for the future then iwr can be estimated based on rdi with 3 month time scale and used by water resources planners they can decide to apply water allocation policies in drought conditions such as water supply turnaround or the management of transplanting date in the study area drought forecasting is generally based on drought indicators computed using dynamic or statistical model simulations of drought related variables aghakouchak 2014 chhinh and millington 2015 focused on relationships between drought occurrences in cambodia and i damage to the annual rice harvest and ii the niño 3 4 index there was achieved a statistically significant correlation r 0 455 between niño 3 4 and 12 month spi standard precipitation index values lagged by three months that indicated the importance of enso linkages in explaining drought in that region prediction of rdi can be made based on the probability of rdi values derived from past weather records or on weather forecasted for the full growing season the validity of the seasonal forecasts depends on the ability to model processes on the scale of months for example wetterhall et al 2015 used a probabilistic seasonal forecasting system and investigated how well seasonal forecasts predict dry spells over a basin during the rainy season with lead times from 0 to 4 months the forecasts showed skill in predicting dry spells in comparison with a climatological ensemble based on previous years also aghakouchak 2014 used a probabilistic framework for drought forecasting based on the persistence property of accumulated soil moisture and showed that the us drought of summer 2012 was predictable several months in advance therefore rdi can be predicted based on seasonal forecasts that provide information on the development of the climate up to 3 months then water allocation can be planned at transplanting time for paddy fields

11164,owing to the severe shortages of fresh water in arid and semi arid areas growers are forced to apply deficit irrigation with fresh or saline water to quantify the impacts of water deficit and salt stress individually and the interaction on tomato yield and quality three pot experiments were conducted from spring 2016 to autumn 2017 the epic growth model was also used to simulate fruit growth process three irrigation treatments used were full irrigation 2 3 and 1 2 of the full irrigation salt stress varied with the season 0 3 6 9 for 2016 season 0 3 for 2016 2017 season and 0 2 3 4 for 2017 season decreases in single fruit weights were associated with increasing soil salt content however fruit quality parameters including ci color index tss total soluble solids and tssc total soluble sugar content improved significantly with increasing salt content of soil in the absence of salt stress the application of 2 3 of full irrigation showed a 18 9 and 1 0 increase of yield per plant respectively in 2016 and 2017 seasons with comparison to full irrigation mainly owing to the increase of fruits number per plant fruit quality also improved with increasing fn fruit firmness ci tss and tssc by 7 9 43 8 9 8 and 3 8 in 2016 season and by 4 7 0 7 20 9 and 34 2 in 2017 season respectively fruit quality parameters were more affected by salt stress than drought the interactive impact of water and salt on fruit quality parameters was not significant at mild water stress 2 3 of full irrigation with moderate salt stress salt content of 3 although yield showed a decline of 20 3 32 0 fruit quality parameters of fn ci tss and tssc increased by 4 9 43 4 through 2016 and 2017 seasons two of van genuchten and hoffman models i e non linear and exponential reduction model were used to evaluate the relations of relative yield and soil salt content with acceptable accuracy r2 of 0 989 and 0 971 respectively soil salt content at which yield decreased by 50 is 4 0 and 4 7 respectively in the non linear reduction model and the exponential reduction model the epic growth model simulated fruit growth process with acceptable accuracy for no stress water stress and salt stress with r2 of 0 863 0 839 and 0 895 respectively the two yield reduction models and the relationship between fruit quality parameters and soil salt content showed that there are tradeoffs between tomato yield and fruit quality in saline soils keywords tomato quality parameters water use efficiency simulation deficit irrigation saline soil 1 introduction abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity severely restrict crop productivity and quality worldwide and the areas affected by these two stresses continue to expand wang et al 2003 owing to the shortages of fresh water in arid and semi arid areas farmers are forced to decide among the following strategies applying deficit irrigation using fresh water irrigation with available saline water or combination of insufficient fresh water and saline water even applying alternant fresh water and saline water in some large irrigation districts thus crops are subjected to water stress salt stress or both ors and suarez 2017 the cultivable land in china is affected by varying degrees of salinity of which about 60 is in the arid areas of northwest china where light and heat resources are rich enough to support corn and fruit production over the past decade drip irrigation under mulch was generalized across these regions coupled with the high evaporation and low precipitation spatial extent of saline area is increasing over time only in xinjiang province of northwest china about 32 of the cultivated land is salt affected the effective approaches to counter drought and salinity stress include application of optimal field irrigation management and development of tolerant cultivars it is thus necessary to assess the impacts of drought and salt stress on crop production and quality tomato is a water demanding crop peet 2005 and is moderately tolerant to salinity maggio et al 2004 the individual effects of water and salt stress on tomato yield and fruit quality are well documented in general the deficit irrigation can adversely affect tomato plant growth physiological characteristics and yield yang et al 2017 in contrast the fruit quality could improve due to suitable deficit irrigation chen et al 2013 2014 tomato fruits were found to be sweeter and less acidic under deficit irrigation ripoll et al 2016 applications of 1 3 to 2 3 of full irrigation at flowering fruit development and maturation stages significantly increased the total soluble solids reduced sugars vitamin c contents and fruit firmness sugar to acid ratio and fruit color index chen et al 2013 salt stress reduced tomato yield but improved total soluble solids and sugar content in the fruits cantore et al 2012 de pascale et al 2015 van de wal et al 2017 fruit shelf life and firmness were unchanged or slightly lowered cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 the high salinity inhibited crop leaf area index and root density seed germination and stomatal conductance radiation use efficiency and above ground dry weight maggio et al 2004 koushafar et al 2011 shahbaz and ashraf 2013 galli et al 2016 albaladejo et al 2017 nutrient imbalance and increases in leaf na and cl concentrations resulted in plant being stunted or dead de pascale et al 2007 cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 although drought and salinity affect the plant in a similar way to some extent it is still unclear whether the plants responses of yield and quality to an increase of 1 cm of osmotic potential are the same as their responses to a decrease 1 cm of matric potential katerji et al 2004 several researches investigated the interactive effect of water and salt stress as related to crop yield and physiological responses on spinach barley cotton maize ors and suarez 2017 ahmed et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 unfortunately only few studies were conducted to investigate the interactive effects of these two abiotic stresses on tomato growth yield and quality gawad et al 2005 mitchell et al 1991b most of the reported experiments were conducted under simulated conditions of using either salinity water by mixing natural river water with fresh water bahazadeh et al 2016 aguilar et al 2017 or fresh water by adding different amounts of nacl cuarter et al 1999 koushafar et al 2011 galli et al 2016 ahmed et al 2013 or nacl and cacl2 katerji et al 2009 2011 plants in many of these experiments were grown in hydroponic culture with different levels of hoagland nutritive solution hoagland and arnon 1950 to simulate different salinity gradients de pascale et al 2007 albaladejo et al 2017 unfortunately none of these experiments were conducted in the saline soils because the uptake and transport rates of saline ions from root to the shoot in nutritive solution were faster and higher than in soil cultivation conditions the leaf symptoms caused by salinity were much earlier under this growth condition albaladejo et al 2017 moreover salinity induced changes in nutrient availability uptake and transport may lead to nutritional imbalances hussain et al 2016 increase in ions of na and cl in rhizosphere induced intense competition with other crucial minerals e g k ca2 no3 and inhibited their uptake hu and schmidhalter 2005 toxic ions in saline soils are usually na cl and so4 2 munns and tester 2008 therefore only multiple salts affected soil can reflect the actual plant response under saline soil condition total radiation and the plant efficiency to utilize it for dry biomass production were estimated to describe the physiological crop growth monteith 1977 this theory was used in crop growth module of epic to simulate crop dry biomass accumulation williams et al 1989 steduto et al 1995 potential plant growth in epic model was restrained by stress factors including water temperature aeration nitrogen and phosphorus williams et al 1989 thus various studies have been conducted to analyze crop response under different climatic conditions and water regimes steduto et al 1995 han et al 2015 bao et al 2017 wang et al 2017a b wang et al 2015a b candido et al 2015 lovelli et al 2017 although the original epic growth model has many components of an agronomic system it did not consider the soil salt stress component tayfur et al 1995 to the best of our knowledge water and salt stresses inhibit the root water uptake in a similar way due to osmotic regulation munns 2002 farooq et al 2015 thus we extended epic to model crop growth in saline soil although crop morphological indexes such as plant height leaf area and biomass were rigorously described using epic growth model under different water treatments the simulation of tomato fruit growth process and how the fruit growth is influenced by water and salt stress are still unsearchable the fruit growth modeling involved two parts the first part was to model crop leaf area due to water and salt stress the second part was to simulate fruit weight as a dependent variable which can be calculated using heat unit accumulation maximum value of single fruit weight and crop stress as independent variables the aims of this research were to i investigate the impacts of simultaneous water and salt stresses on tomato yield and fruit quality parameters ii establish quantitative relationship between fruit quality and soil salt content for the whole growth season as well as for different irrigation treatments iii evaluate epic growth model prediction for tomato fruit growth under various stress scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site three pot experiments were done at the shiyanghe experimental

meteorological data and lai data collected from experiment 3 2017 season when there was no stress i e w1s0 treatment water stress only i e w1 2s0 treatment and salt stress only i e w1s3 treatment were chosen to calibrate the epic crop model the leaf area index measured from the experiment 2 2016 2017 season were used to verify the results simulated by the model under no stress water stress only and salt stress only conditions the growth process of fruit weight collected from both experiments 2 and 3 i e w1s0 treatment w1 2s0 treatment and w1s3 treatment were collected for the validation the output of epic against observed measurements were assessed using the determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the normalized root mean square error nrmse the coefficient of regression b0 and

ones the simulation is labeled excellent good fair and poor when the value of nrmse is smaller than 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 respectively bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 2 7 data analysis to investigate the impacts of water and salt treatment on total yield and fruit quality parameters two way analysis of variance anova were analyzed in each growth season using spss software differences between mean values were assessed for significance using the duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 relative values adopted in the regression analysis were calculated as the values for each treatment dividing that of maximum treatment 3 results 3 1 effect of drought and salt stress on tomato yield and wue tomato yield decreased with increasing salt stress table 3 compared to s0 yield declined by 32 9 72 9 and 89 1 for s3 s6 and s9 respectively under w2 3 treatments in the 2016 season and by 20 7 61 6 and 82 4 respectively under well watered w1 treatments the yield decline was significant at soil salt content ssc of 3 but it became sharp at ssc of 6 and 9 suggesting that tomato was moderately sensitive to salt stress thus we adjusted salt gradients during the following growth seasons in the absence of water stress yield loss in s3 during 2016 2017 season was 26 6 compared to s0 table 3 during 2017 season yield decreased by 23 6 32 7 and 50 9 for s2 s3 and s4 respectively under w2 3 treatments and by 26 7 35 4 and 49 1 respectively under w1 treatments moreover yield reduction caused by water and salinity stresses were different compared to w1 treatments yield increased 18 9 and 1 0 for w2 3 treatments in the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively in the absence of salt stress but at moderate salt stress s3 yields under two water treatments had no significant difference for 2016 season yield for w1 2s0 decreased by 22 7 in comparison to w2 3s4 during 2017 season which showed that tomato yield decline was more under the application of 1 2 of full irrigation than under soil salt content of 4 to compare the two yield reduction models eq 4 and eq 5 their parameters were first determined by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations between measured yield and predicted yield by the two models respectively the results indicated that both models performed well in simulating yield response to ssc with r2 of 0 989 and 0 971 respectively fig 2 table 6 moreover the non linear reduction model eq 4 with rmse of 30 6 g and nrmse of 5 18 conformed better to the measured data than the exponential model eq 5 with rmse of 53 8 g and nrmse of 9 10 respectively in van genuchten and hoffman 1984 eq 4 and eq 5 the ssc at which yield decreased by 50 is 4 0 and 4 7 respectively wue decreased significantly with the increasing salt stress under both w2 3 and w1 treatments during 2016 and 2017 seasons wue for w2 3s3 was higher by 5 84 compared to w1s0 treatment in 2016 season while wue for w2 3s2 improved by 1 13 compared to w1s0 in 2017 season table 3 in 2016 and 2017 season wue for w1 2s0 was slightly higher than w1s3 but the yield decreased significantly 3 2 effect of drought and salt stress on tomato fruit quality table 4 shows the fruit quality parameters of tomato under different water and salt stress treatments during 2016 and 2017 growth seasons fn firstly increased at moderate salinity levels s3 and then began to decrease under w2 3 and w1 treatments during both seasons except w2 3 in 2017 season fwc was significantly low for w2 3s9 in 2016 season and w1 2s0 in 2017 season respectively compared to w1s0 fw for w2 3s0 was not significantly lower but decreased by 32 6 52 8 and 64 2 respectively in 2016 season the fw decrease became significant at ssc of 4 under both w2 3 and w1 treatments in 2017 season si varied from 0 714 to 0 838 in 2016 season for fruits of w2 3s2 w2 3s3 and w1s4 in 2017 season si values were 1 054 1 006 and 1 004 respectively ci increased with the salt and water stresses the highest ci of 46 59 was obtained for w1 2s0 and the lowest were in both w1s0 treatments during 2016 and 2017 seasons tss and tssc significantly increased with the salt stress in both seasons tss and tssc for w2 3s9 increased by 48 7 and 31 1 of w2 3s0 respectively during the 2016 season and those for w1s9 increased by 54 0 and 34 3 of w1s0 respectively in 2017 season the decline of tss and tssc for w2 3s0 reached at 8 08 and 32 7 respectively when compared to w2 3s9 and those for w1s0 reached at 29 5 and 46 1 respectively as compared to w1s4 the two way anova results showed that water had significant or extreme significant influence on fwc fw and tssc during both seasons while salt had extreme significant influence on all the quality parameters except si and ci the interactive effect of water and salt was not significant table 5 3 3 quantitative

process the default and calibrated parameters of epic crop model are presented in table 8 the parameters that were calibrated in this study also were selected for calibration in previous studies such as han et al 2015 and wang et al 2015a b except crop stress factor reg the lai was calibrated and validated first of all owing to the fruit growth depending on the lai curve stress factor reg was calibrated under conditions of no stress water stress and salt stress table 8 the lai curves under three conditions didn t show tendency for over or under estimations and table 7 shows the goodness of fit indicators for the comparisons after the calibration of lai the data collected in 2016 2017 season were used to validate lai curves the r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d were 0 997 0 036 m2 m2 4 88 0 998 and 0 999 under no stress 0 995 0 018 m2 m2 5 65 1 009 and 0 999 under water stress and 0 958 0 091 m2 m2 17 76 0 986 and 0 988 under salt stress respectively table 7 these results showed a close agreement between measured and simulated lai data simulated by the epic crop model and measured data generally matched although there were differences during 20 30 days after anthesis under water stress condition table 9 fig 4 c with respect to no stress water stress and salt stress over the two year periods the model performance index showed good agreement between measured and simulated data with high r2 0 863 0 839 and 0 895 and d 0 967 0 933 and 0 966 respectively in 2016 season the r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d for water stress were 0 799 8 8 g 35 8 0 878 and 0 925 respectively the nrmse value of 35 8 was higher than 30 the results showed that epic crop model performed well to simulate fruit weight under no stress and salt stress conditions in 2017 season values of r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d under no stress condition were 0 891 18 0 g 30 2 1 041 and 0 971 respectively the nrmse value of 30 2 was slightly 30 with regard to salt stress condition the values of r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d were 0 907 11 6 g 32 4 1 100 and 0 970 respectively the nrmse value of 32 4 was slightly 30 accuracy of simulation by epic crop model during both years were acceptable 4 discussion salinity inhibited the root water uptake of plants and quickly caused decrease in plant growth rate salinity induced metabolic changes were similar to water stress munns 2002 katerji et al 2004 the initial reduction in plant growth was likely induced by hormonal signals due to osmatic stress but later the salt specific effect ion toxicity and the associated growth reduction occurred munns 2002 farooq et al 2015 thus plant response to drought and salt stress was similar but salinity induces plant nutrient imbalance that is distinct from water stress munns 2002 farooq et al 2015 de pascale et al 2007 cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 most studies concentrated on the effect of single factor drought or salt in general the enhancement of tomato fruit quality by water stress is accompanied with yield reductions chen et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2017 ripoll et al 2014 2016 ozbahce and tari 2010 lovelli et al 2017 candido et al 2015 in contrast this research shows that compared to well watered treatments w1 mild water stress w2 3 showed a 18 9 and 1 0 increase of yield per plant respectively in 2016 and 2017 seasons at s0 level table 3 however single fruit weight showed an opposite trend table 4 which indicated that the increase of yield was mainly attributed to the increase of fruit number under mild water stress it was reported that tss tssc vc and reducing sugar contents in tomato fruits were higher in the deficit treatments than control wang et al 2015a b mild drought w2 3 improved fruit quality parameters of fn ci tss and tssc in some extent table 4 similarly yield reduction was associated with increasing soil salinity levels katerji et al 2009 2011 schiattone et al 2017 but the fruit quality was enhanced cantore et al 2012 van de wal et al 2017 de pascale et al 2015 mitchell et al 1991a in our research the more stressful of soil salt content the higher yield decline was identified yield per plant was reduced by 49 1 when soil salt content reached at 4 in 2017 season table 3 fruit quality parameters of ci tss and tssc improvements were associated with increasing soil salt levels under both w2 3 and w1 treatments during both 2016 and 2017 seasons while fwc showed a decrease trend table 4 fw decreased with increasing salt stress which indicated that salinity induced yield decline was mainly attributed to the decrease of single fruit weight table 3 and 4 few researches focused on the interactive impact of soil water and salt content on tomato yield and fruit quality it has not been fully understood that whether the same yield reduction and quality variation are caused by the same change in plant water status owing to either drought or salinity de pascale et al 2007 conducted a comparative stress experiment on cherry tomato and illustrated that growth inhibition in water stressed soil matric potential 72 kpa plants was greater than salinity stressed plants 12 mm nacl the contents of tss and dry matter of tomato fruits increased with increasing salinity but not by decreasing irrigation amounts cantore et al 2012 simultaneous water and salt stress aggravated yield reduction but enhanced fruit parameters of ci tss and tssc table 3 and 4 yield per plant was more affected by severe drought 1 2 of full irrigation than moderate salt stress ssc 4 the two way anova showed that the interactive impact of water and salt on fruit quality parameters was not significant and the fruit quality was more affected by salt stress than drought table 5 fruit quality parameter of tssc approached to the higher values in mild drought with severe salt stress table 4 the results demonstrated that tomato quality is more sensitive to salt than water two of van genuchten and hoffman models 1984 eq 4 and eq 5 conformed well to simulate the relations of relative yield and soil salt content r2 of 0 989 and 0 971 respectively fig 2 and table 6 by contrasting the goodness of fitting indicators of the two models table 6 the non linear reduction model eq 4 conformed better to the measured data than the exponential one eq 5 babazadeh et al 2016 also illustrated that the reduction function eq 4 performed better than the eq 5 for estimating yield responses of basil to irrigation and salinity at which yield decreased by 50 is 6 ds m 1 in the non linear reduction model eq 4 positive linear relations between tomato quality parameters e g ci tssc si and tss and soil salt content were also found fig 3a d g j indicating that tomato fruit quality was improved by increasing soil salt content however negative linear relationships were found between fwc fw and soil salt content fig 3e f k l these quantitative relationships of fruit quality with soil salt content are identical to those with soil water content chen et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2017 ozbahce and tari 2010 this was mainly the consequence of a reduced fruits water uptake and a low dilution owing to the osmatic stress not an increased fruit compounds accumulation such as sugar in the fruits mitchell et al 1991a but the salt specific effects on fruit nutrient compounds are still needed to be investigated as the literatures have been reported unlike evaluating the plant yield and biomass by epic growth model there were no attempts to be made to simulate the tomato fruit growth process using the growth module of epic we use the types of basic equations of epic for reference and made attempts to simulate tomato fruit growth process the model was calibrated and validated against pot experiments data of 2016 and 2017 years epic growth model simulated fruit growth process with acceptable accuracy under three conditions i e no stress water stress and salt stress table 9 and fig 4 wang et al 2017a b coupled the growth module of epic with hydrus 1d to assess salinity stress on wheat evapotranspiration yield and wue and long term use of saline water on grain yield and salt accumulation in our study the growth module of epic was used to evaluate salt stress on tomato leaf and fruit growth within an acceptable accuracy however the salt fruit quality relationships and the epic growth model evaluating fruit growth are all empirical and mathematical models further physiological responses of tomato fruit growth and quality to soil water content and salt content should be considered in the future study in addition our study only tested the approach in experimental pots but it still has difficulty extending to field scale due to its destructive effect on original soil and imprecise control of salt content in plant root zone 5 conclusion the responses of tomato yield per plant and fruit quality parameters to soil water and salt content were different in the absence of salt stress yield increased at mild water stress w2 3 and the increase of yield was mainly attributed to the increase of fruit number while fruit quality was enhanced by increasing fn ci tss and tssc under both irrigation treatments w2 3 and w1 yield decreased with increasing soil salt level mainly owing to the decline of single fruit weight but fruit quality parameters of ci tss and tssc improved moreover yield under water stress treatments performed more sensitivity to salt stress than that under non drought treatments fruit quality parameters were more affected by salt stress than drought the interactive impact of water and salt on fruit quality parameters was not significant positive linear relations were found between soil salt content and tomato quality parameters i e ci tssc si and tss while fwc and fw had negative linear relationships with soil salt content two of van genuchten and hoffman models 1984 conformed well to simulate the relationships of soil salt content and relative yield the soil salt content at which yield decreased by 50 is 4 0 and 4 7 respectively in the non linear reduction model and the exponential reduction model the epic crop model simulated fruit growth process with acceptable accuracy in situations of no stress water stress and salt stress with acceptable accuracy acknowledgements we are grateful for the research grants from the national natural science foundation of china 51790534

11164,owing to the severe shortages of fresh water in arid and semi arid areas growers are forced to apply deficit irrigation with fresh or saline water to quantify the impacts of water deficit and salt stress individually and the interaction on tomato yield and quality three pot experiments were conducted from spring 2016 to autumn 2017 the epic growth model was also used to simulate fruit growth process three irrigation treatments used were full irrigation 2 3 and 1 2 of the full irrigation salt stress varied with the season 0 3 6 9 for 2016 season 0 3 for 2016 2017 season and 0 2 3 4 for 2017 season decreases in single fruit weights were associated with increasing soil salt content however fruit quality parameters including ci color index tss total soluble solids and tssc total soluble sugar content improved significantly with increasing salt content of soil in the absence of salt stress the application of 2 3 of full irrigation showed a 18 9 and 1 0 increase of yield per plant respectively in 2016 and 2017 seasons with comparison to full irrigation mainly owing to the increase of fruits number per plant fruit quality also improved with increasing fn fruit firmness ci tss and tssc by 7 9 43 8 9 8 and 3 8 in 2016 season and by 4 7 0 7 20 9 and 34 2 in 2017 season respectively fruit quality parameters were more affected by salt stress than drought the interactive impact of water and salt on fruit quality parameters was not significant at mild water stress 2 3 of full irrigation with moderate salt stress salt content of 3 although yield showed a decline of 20 3 32 0 fruit quality parameters of fn ci tss and tssc increased by 4 9 43 4 through 2016 and 2017 seasons two of van genuchten and hoffman models i e non linear and exponential reduction model were used to evaluate the relations of relative yield and soil salt content with acceptable accuracy r2 of 0 989 and 0 971 respectively soil salt content at which yield decreased by 50 is 4 0 and 4 7 respectively in the non linear reduction model and the exponential reduction model the epic growth model simulated fruit growth process with acceptable accuracy for no stress water stress and salt stress with r2 of 0 863 0 839 and 0 895 respectively the two yield reduction models and the relationship between fruit quality parameters and soil salt content showed that there are tradeoffs between tomato yield and fruit quality in saline soils keywords tomato quality parameters water use efficiency simulation deficit irrigation saline soil 1 introduction abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity severely restrict crop productivity and quality worldwide and the areas affected by these two stresses continue to expand wang et al 2003 owing to the shortages of fresh water in arid and semi arid areas farmers are forced to decide among the following strategies applying deficit irrigation using fresh water irrigation with available saline water or combination of insufficient fresh water and saline water even applying alternant fresh water and saline water in some large irrigation districts thus crops are subjected to water stress salt stress or both ors and suarez 2017 the cultivable land in china is affected by varying degrees of salinity of which about 60 is in the arid areas of northwest china where light and heat resources are rich enough to support corn and fruit production over the past decade drip irrigation under mulch was generalized across these regions coupled with the high evaporation and low precipitation spatial extent of saline area is increasing over time only in xinjiang province of northwest china about 32 of the cultivated land is salt affected the effective approaches to counter drought and salinity stress include application of optimal field irrigation management and development of tolerant cultivars it is thus necessary to assess the impacts of drought and salt stress on crop production and quality tomato is a water demanding crop peet 2005 and is moderately tolerant to salinity maggio et al 2004 the individual effects of water and salt stress on tomato yield and fruit quality are well documented in general the deficit irrigation can adversely affect tomato plant growth physiological characteristics and yield yang et al 2017 in contrast the fruit quality could improve due to suitable deficit irrigation chen et al 2013 2014 tomato fruits were found to be sweeter and less acidic under deficit irrigation ripoll et al 2016 applications of 1 3 to 2 3 of full irrigation at flowering fruit development and maturation stages significantly increased the total soluble solids reduced sugars vitamin c contents and fruit firmness sugar to acid ratio and fruit color index chen et al 2013 salt stress reduced tomato yield but improved total soluble solids and sugar content in the fruits cantore et al 2012 de pascale et al 2015 van de wal et al 2017 fruit shelf life and firmness were unchanged or slightly lowered cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 the high salinity inhibited crop leaf area index and root density seed germination and stomatal conductance radiation use efficiency and above ground dry weight maggio et al 2004 koushafar et al 2011 shahbaz and ashraf 2013 galli et al 2016 albaladejo et al 2017 nutrient imbalance and increases in leaf na and cl concentrations resulted in plant being stunted or dead de pascale et al 2007 cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 although drought and salinity affect the plant in a similar way to some extent it is still unclear whether the plants responses of yield and quality to an increase of 1 cm of osmotic potential are the same as their responses to a decrease 1 cm of matric potential katerji et al 2004 several researches investigated the interactive effect of water and salt stress as related to crop yield and physiological responses on spinach barley cotton maize ors and suarez 2017 ahmed et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 unfortunately only few studies were conducted to investigate the interactive effects of these two abiotic stresses on tomato growth yield and quality gawad et al 2005 mitchell et al 1991b most of the reported experiments were conducted under simulated conditions of using either salinity water by mixing natural river water with fresh water bahazadeh et al 2016 aguilar et al 2017 or fresh water by adding different amounts of nacl cuarter et al 1999 koushafar et al 2011 galli et al 2016 ahmed et al 2013 or nacl and cacl2 katerji et al 2009 2011 plants in many of these experiments were grown in hydroponic culture with different levels of hoagland nutritive solution hoagland and arnon 1950 to simulate different salinity gradients de pascale et al 2007 albaladejo et al 2017 unfortunately none of these experiments were conducted in the saline soils because the uptake and transport rates of saline ions from root to the shoot in nutritive solution were faster and higher than in soil cultivation conditions the leaf symptoms caused by salinity were much earlier under this growth condition albaladejo et al 2017 moreover salinity induced changes in nutrient availability uptake and transport may lead to nutritional imbalances hussain et al 2016 increase in ions of na and cl in rhizosphere induced intense competition with other crucial minerals e g k ca2 no3 and inhibited their uptake hu and schmidhalter 2005 toxic ions in saline soils are usually na cl and so4 2 munns and tester 2008 therefore only multiple salts affected soil can reflect the actual plant response under saline soil condition total radiation and the plant efficiency to utilize it for dry biomass production were estimated to describe the physiological crop growth monteith 1977 this theory was used in crop growth module of epic to simulate crop dry biomass accumulation williams et al 1989 steduto et al 1995 potential plant growth in epic model was restrained by stress factors including water temperature aeration nitrogen and phosphorus williams et al 1989 thus various studies have been conducted to analyze crop response under different climatic conditions and water regimes steduto et al 1995 han et al 2015 bao et al 2017 wang et al 2017a b wang et al 2015a b candido et al 2015 lovelli et al 2017 although the original epic growth model has many components of an agronomic system it did not consider the soil salt stress component tayfur et al 1995 to the best of our knowledge water and salt stresses inhibit the root water uptake in a similar way due to osmotic regulation munns 2002 farooq et al 2015 thus we extended epic to model crop growth in saline soil although crop morphological indexes such as plant height leaf area and biomass were rigorously described using epic growth model under different water treatments the simulation of tomato fruit growth process and how the fruit growth is influenced by water and salt stress are still unsearchable the fruit growth modeling involved two parts the first part was to model crop leaf area due to water and salt stress the second part was to simulate fruit weight as a dependent variable which can be calculated using heat unit accumulation maximum value of single fruit weight and crop stress as independent variables the aims of this research were to i investigate the impacts of simultaneous water and salt stresses on tomato yield and fruit quality parameters ii establish quantitative relationship between fruit quality and soil salt content for the whole growth season as well as for different irrigation treatments iii evaluate epic growth model prediction for tomato fruit growth under various stress scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site three pot experiments were done at the shiyanghe experimental

from 10 d after anthesis at the end of stage ⅱ and ⅲ three plants were harvested to measure fruit diameters and individual fruit weight the relationship between single fruit weight fw and the average of the longitudinal and transverse diameters fd is shown in fig 1 the individual fruit weight had a significant exponential correlation with the average of longitudinal and transverse diameters p 0 01 in both seasons hence the consecutive increasing process of fruit weight was obtained by the non destructive method 2 3 5 fruit quality four tomato fruits with similar maturity in each treatment were

impacts of water and salt treatment on total yield and fruit quality parameters two way analysis of variance anova were analyzed in each growth season using spss software differences between mean values were assessed for significance using the duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 relative values adopted in the regression analysis were calculated as the values for each treatment dividing that of maximum treatment 3 results 3 1 effect of drought and salt stress on tomato yield and wue tomato yield decreased with increasing salt stress table 3 compared to s0 yield declined by 32 9 72 9 and 89 1 for s3 s6 and s9 respectively under w2 3 treatments in the 2016 season and by 20 7 61 6 and 82 4 respectively under well watered w1 treatments the yield decline was significant at soil salt content ssc of 3 but it became sharp at ssc of 6 and 9 suggesting that tomato was moderately sensitive to salt stress thus we adjusted salt gradients during the following growth seasons in the absence of water stress yield loss in s3 during 2016 2017 season was 26 6 compared to s0 table 3 during 2017 season yield decreased by 23 6 32 7 and 50 9 for s2 s3 and s4 respectively under w2 3 treatments and by 26 7 35 4 and 49 1 respectively under w1 treatments moreover yield reduction caused by water and salinity stresses were different compared to w1 treatments yield increased 18 9 and 1 0 for w2 3 treatments in the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively in the absence of salt stress but at moderate salt stress s3 yields under two water treatments had no significant difference for 2016 season yield for w1 2s0 decreased by 22 7 in comparison to w2 3s4 during 2017 season which showed that tomato yield decline was more under the application of 1 2 of full irrigation than under soil salt content of 4 to compare the two yield reduction models eq 4 and eq 5 their parameters were first determined by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations between measured yield and predicted yield by the two models respectively the results indicated that both models performed well in simulating yield response to ssc with r2 of 0 989 and 0 971 respectively fig 2 table 6 moreover the non linear reduction model eq 4 with rmse of 30 6 g and nrmse of 5 18 conformed better to the measured data than the exponential model eq 5 with rmse of 53 8 g and nrmse of 9 10 respectively in van genuchten and hoffman 1984 eq 4 and eq 5 the ssc at which yield decreased by 50 is 4 0 and 4 7 respectively wue decreased significantly with the increasing salt stress under both w2 3 and w1 treatments during 2016 and 2017 seasons wue for w2 3s3 was higher by 5 84 compared to w1s0 treatment in 2016 season while wue for w2 3s2 improved by 1 13 compared to w1s0 in 2017 season table 3 in 2016 and 2017 season wue for w1 2s0 was slightly higher than w1s3 but the yield decreased significantly 3 2 effect of drought and salt stress on tomato fruit quality table 4 shows the fruit quality parameters of tomato under different water and salt stress treatments during 2016 and 2017 growth seasons fn firstly increased at moderate salinity levels s3 and then began to decrease under w2 3 and w1 treatments during both seasons except w2 3 in 2017 season fwc was significantly low for w2 3s9 in 2016 season and w1 2s0 in 2017 season respectively compared to w1s0 fw for w2 3s0 was not significantly lower but decreased by 32 6 52 8 and 64 2 respectively in 2016 season the fw decrease became significant at ssc of 4 under both w2 3 and w1 treatments in 2017 season si varied from 0 714 to 0 838 in 2016 season for fruits of w2 3s2 w2 3s3 and w1s4 in 2017 season si values were 1 054 1 006 and 1 004 respectively ci increased with the salt and water stresses the highest ci of 46 59 was obtained for w1 2s0 and the lowest were in both w1s0 treatments during 2016 and 2017 seasons tss and tssc significantly increased with the salt stress in both seasons tss and tssc for w2 3s9 increased by 48 7 and 31 1 of w2 3s0 respectively during the 2016 season and those for w1s9 increased by 54 0 and 34 3 of w1s0 respectively in 2017 season the decline of tss and tssc for w2 3s0 reached at 8 08 and 32 7 respectively when compared to w2 3s9 and those for w1s0 reached at 29 5 and 46 1 respectively as compared to w1s4 the two way anova results showed that water had significant or extreme significant influence on fwc fw and tssc during both seasons while salt had extreme significant influence on all the quality parameters except si and ci the interactive effect of water and salt was not significant table 5 3 3 quantitative

relations of all the quality parameters with ssca sscmax under w1 and w2 3 treatments were evaluated using linear regression respectively the results showed that sia simax were not significantly

process the default and calibrated parameters of epic crop model are presented in table 8 the parameters that were calibrated in this study also were selected for calibration in previous studies such as han et al 2015 and wang et al 2015a b except crop stress factor reg the lai was calibrated and validated first of all owing to the fruit growth depending on the lai curve stress factor reg was calibrated under conditions of no stress water stress and salt stress table 8 the lai curves under three conditions didn t show tendency for over or under estimations and table 7 shows the goodness of fit indicators for the comparisons after the calibration of lai the data collected in 2016 2017 season were used to validate lai curves the r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d were 0 997 0 036 m2 m2 4 88 0 998 and 0 999 under no stress 0 995 0 018 m2 m2 5 65 1 009 and 0 999 under water stress and 0 958 0 091 m2 m2 17 76 0 986 and 0 988 under salt stress respectively table 7 these results showed a close agreement between measured and simulated lai data simulated by the epic crop model and measured data generally matched although there were differences during 20 30 days after anthesis under water stress condition table 9 fig 4 c with respect to no stress water stress and salt stress over the two year periods the model performance index showed good agreement between measured and simulated data with high r2 0 863 0 839 and 0 895 and d 0 967 0 933 and 0 966 respectively in 2016 season the r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d for water stress were 0 799 8 8 g 35 8 0 878 and 0 925 respectively the nrmse value of 35 8 was higher than 30 the results showed that epic crop model performed well to simulate fruit weight under no stress and salt stress conditions in 2017 season values of r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d under no stress condition were 0 891 18 0 g 30 2 1 041 and 0 971 respectively the nrmse value of 30 2 was slightly 30 with regard to salt stress condition the values of r2 rmse nrmse b0 and d were 0 907 11 6 g 32 4 1 100 and 0 970 respectively the nrmse value of 32 4 was slightly 30 accuracy of simulation by epic crop model during both years were acceptable 4 discussion salinity inhibited the root water uptake of plants and quickly caused decrease in plant growth rate salinity induced metabolic changes were similar to water stress munns 2002 katerji et al 2004 the initial reduction in plant growth was likely induced by hormonal signals due to osmatic stress but later the salt specific effect ion toxicity and the associated growth reduction occurred munns 2002 farooq et al 2015 thus plant response to drought and salt stress was similar but salinity induces plant nutrient imbalance that is distinct from water stress munns 2002 farooq et al 2015 de pascale et al 2007 cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 most studies concentrated on the effect of single factor drought or salt in general the enhancement of tomato fruit quality by water stress is accompanied with yield reductions chen et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2017 ripoll et al 2014 2016 ozbahce and tari 2010 lovelli et al 2017 candido et al 2015 in contrast this research shows that compared to well watered treatments w1 mild water stress w2 3 showed a 18 9 and 1 0 increase of yield per plant respectively in 2016 and 2017 seasons at s0 level table 3 however single fruit weight showed an opposite trend table 4 which indicated that the increase of yield was mainly attributed to the increase of fruit number under mild water stress it was reported that tss tssc vc and reducing sugar contents in tomato fruits were higher in the deficit treatments than control wang et al 2015a b mild drought w2 3 improved fruit quality parameters of fn ci tss and tssc in some extent table 4 similarly yield reduction was associated with increasing soil salinity levels katerji et al 2009 2011 schiattone et al 2017 but the fruit quality was enhanced cantore et al 2012 van de wal et al 2017 de pascale et al 2015 mitchell et al 1991a in our research the more stressful of soil salt content the higher yield decline was identified yield per plant was reduced by 49 1 when soil salt content reached at 4 in 2017 season table 3 fruit quality parameters of ci tss and tssc improvements were associated with increasing soil salt levels under both w2 3 and w1 treatments during both 2016 and 2017 seasons while fwc showed a decrease trend table 4 fw decreased with increasing salt stress which indicated that salinity induced yield decline was mainly attributed to the decrease of single fruit weight table 3 and 4 few researches focused on the interactive impact of soil water and salt content on tomato yield and fruit quality it has not been fully understood that whether the same yield reduction and quality variation are caused by the same change in plant water status owing to either drought or salinity de pascale et al 2007 conducted a comparative stress experiment on cherry tomato and illustrated that growth inhibition in water stressed soil matric potential 72 kpa plants was greater than salinity stressed plants 12 mm nacl the contents of tss and dry matter of tomato fruits increased with increasing salinity but not by decreasing irrigation amounts cantore et al 2012 simultaneous water and salt stress aggravated yield reduction but enhanced fruit parameters of ci tss and tssc table 3 and 4 yield per plant was more affected by severe drought 1 2 of full irrigation than moderate salt stress ssc 4 the two way anova showed that the interactive impact of water and salt on fruit quality parameters was not significant and the fruit quality was more affected by salt stress than drought table 5 fruit quality parameter of tssc approached to the higher values in mild drought with severe salt stress table 4 the results demonstrated that tomato quality is more sensitive to salt than water two of van genuchten and hoffman models 1984 eq 4 and eq 5 conformed well to simulate the relations of relative yield and soil salt content r2 of 0 989 and 0 971 respectively fig 2 and table 6 by contrasting the goodness of fitting indicators of the two models table 6 the non linear reduction model eq 4 conformed better to the measured data than the exponential one eq 5 babazadeh et al 2016 also illustrated that the reduction function eq 4 performed better than the eq 5 for estimating yield responses of basil to irrigation and salinity at which yield decreased by 50 is 6 ds m 1 in the non linear reduction model eq 4 positive linear relations between tomato quality parameters e g ci tssc si and tss and soil salt content were also found fig 3a d g j indicating that tomato fruit quality was improved by increasing soil salt content however negative linear relationships were found between fwc fw and soil salt content fig 3e f k l these quantitative relationships of fruit quality with soil salt content are identical to those with soil water content chen et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2017 ozbahce and tari 2010 this was mainly the consequence of a reduced fruits water uptake and a low dilution owing to the osmatic stress not an increased fruit compounds accumulation such as sugar in the fruits mitchell et al 1991a but the salt specific effects on fruit nutrient compounds are still needed to be investigated as the literatures have been reported unlike evaluating the plant yield and biomass by epic growth model there were no attempts to be made to simulate the tomato fruit growth process using the growth module of epic we use the types of basic equations of epic for reference and made attempts to simulate tomato fruit growth process the model was calibrated and validated against pot experiments data of 2016 and 2017 years epic growth model simulated fruit growth process with acceptable accuracy under three conditions i e no stress water stress and salt stress table 9 and fig 4 wang et al 2017a b coupled the growth module of epic with hydrus 1d to assess salinity stress on wheat evapotranspiration yield and wue and long term use of saline water on grain yield and salt accumulation in our study the growth module of epic was used to evaluate salt stress on tomato leaf and fruit growth within an acceptable accuracy however the salt fruit quality relationships and the epic growth model evaluating fruit growth are all empirical and mathematical models further physiological responses of tomato fruit growth and quality to soil water content and salt content should be considered in the future study in addition our study only tested the approach in experimental pots but it still has difficulty extending to field scale due to its destructive effect on original soil and imprecise control of salt content in plant root zone 5 conclusion the responses of tomato yield per plant and fruit quality parameters to soil water and salt content were different in the absence of salt stress yield increased at mild water stress w2 3 and the increase of yield was mainly attributed to the increase of fruit number while fruit quality was enhanced by increasing fn ci tss and tssc under both irrigation treatments w2 3 and w1 yield decreased with increasing soil salt level mainly owing to the decline of single fruit weight but fruit quality parameters of ci tss and tssc improved moreover yield under water stress treatments performed more sensitivity to salt stress than that under non drought treatments fruit quality parameters were more affected by salt stress than drought the interactive impact of water and salt on fruit quality parameters was not significant positive linear relations were found between soil salt content and tomato quality parameters i e ci tssc si and tss while fwc and fw had negative linear relationships with soil salt content two of van genuchten and hoffman models 1984 conformed well to simulate the relationships of soil salt content and relative yield the soil salt content at which yield decreased by 50 is 4 0 and 4 7 respectively in the non linear reduction model and the exponential reduction model the epic crop model simulated fruit growth process with acceptable accuracy in situations of no stress water stress and salt stress with acceptable accuracy acknowledgements we are grateful for the research grants from the national natural science foundation of china 51790534
