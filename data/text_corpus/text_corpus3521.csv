17605,biofilm activities and their interactions with physical chemical and biological processes are of great importance for a variety of ecosystem functions impacting hydrogeomorphology water quality and aquatic ecosystem health effective management of water bodies requires advancing our understanding of how flow influences biofilm bound sediment and ecosystem processes and vice versa however research on this triangle of flow biofilm sediment is still at its infancy in this review we summarize the current state of the art and methodological approaches in the flow biofilm sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments example studies of this three way interaction across a range of spatial scales from cell nm µm to patch scale mm dm are highlighted in view of the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches as a contribution to the review we combine a literature survey with results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop to explore the feasibility of asking interdisciplinary questions further within this workshop various observation and measuring approaches were tested and the quality of the achieved results was evaluated individually and in combination accordingly the paper concludes by highlighting the following research challenges to be considered within the forthcoming years in the triangle of flow biofilm sediment i establish a collaborative work among hydraulic and sedimentation engineers as well as ecologists to study mutual goals with appropriate methods perform realistic experimental studies to test hypotheses on flow biofilm sediment interactions as well as structural and mechanical characteristics of the bed ii consider spatially varying characteristics of flow at the sediment water interface utilize combinations of microsensors and non intrusive optical methods such as particle image velocimetry and laser scanner to elucidate the mechanism behind biofilm growth as well as mass and momentum flux exchanges between biofilm and water use molecular approaches dna pigments staining microscopy for sophisticated community analyses link varying flow regimes to microbial communities and processes and fine sediment properties to explore the role of key microbial players and functions in enhancing

and wieprecht 2015 west et al 2007 biofilm lifestyle is distinctly different and more common than planktonic lifestyle with an estimated 40 80 of cells contributing to the global biomass residing in biofilms flemming and wuertz 2019 the transition of one microbe from the planktonic to the biofilm lifestyle and vice versa depends on a range of environmental conditions among which the local hydrodynamics are of paramount importance berke et al 2008 mcdougald et al 2012 wheeler et al 2019 hydrodynamics largely dictate initial touch down and the residence time of the microbes on surfaces rusconi et al 2014 when exceeding a certain hydrodynamic force or experiencing a hydraulic retention time shorter than the doubling time of the cells the microbes will disperse again and leave the habitat those cells that still stick are selected towards stronger adherence and the further biofilm development strongly shapes their adjacent physical and chemical surrounding in a reciprocal way gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 thereby biofilm growth and its influence on the surrounding strongly depend on the microbial metabolic activity which leads to redox relevant small scale stratification and impacts large scale biogeochemical budgets packman 2013 however these metabolic processes are determined by mass transfer in the water column and towards the biofilm which is again controlled by hydrodynamics regulating nutrient supply to the microbes gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 for a comprehensive review on the processes related to surface attachment and subsequent colonization we refer

and has been reported to mediate sediment erosion transport deposition and consolidation etdc cycle in aquatic ecosystems paterson et al 2018 it should be noted that biostabilization can also occur through smoothing of the bed surface and therefore reduction of the hydraulic roughness as observed over gravel like hemispheres graba et al 2010 these interactions of sediment and biofilm are critical to the biogeochemical processes at the entire ecosystem level packman 2013 along with their impact on nutrient fluxes battin et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 madsen 2011 biofilms possess further fundamental ecosystem services such as water self purification gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 shannon et al 2008 and they also regulate and mediate primary production and food web processes battin et al 2008 demars 2019 graba et al 2013 such fundamental ecosystem processes and functions of the biofilms are determined by their biodiversity and community composition through the metabolic

oscillating filamentous structures called streamers larned et al 2011 nikora 2010 which not only alter flow dynamism and bed topography but also mass transport near the bed the preceding higher order effects induced by biofilm formation are of ever changing nature battin et al 2016 mainly due to complex reciprocal interactions between flow biofilm and sediment gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 and are also expected to change in a nontrivial way as a result of climate change piggott et al 2015 zeglin 2015 and human alteration however our understanding of dynamic flow biofilm sediment processes nexus in natural water bodies which drive changes in ecosystem processes and functions remain still incomplete nikora 2010 packman 2013 paterson et al 2018 in order to better manage our water bodies for the benefits of human society and ecosystem functioning as well as to support un s sustainable development goals a better understanding of flow biofilm sediment interactions that we call flow biofilm sediment triangle is needed challenges include i creating realistic experimental settings and utilizing a combination of tools and approaches to describe the reciprocal relationships between flow biofilm sediment and associated mass transfer which alters microbial processes and vice versa and ii understanding the role of key microbial players and processes for biogeochemical and morphological processes biostabilization at the entire ecosystem level and how organismal level functions can be linked to ecosystem functions these challenges require acquisition of large bodies of information across various spatial scales by studying hydraulics geomorphology and ecology as an integrated concept using advanced tools and approaches rather than viewing them as subordinately serving the other the increasing needs for interdisciplinary approaches have been underlined by many recent studies battin et al 2016 palmer and ruhi 2019 paterson et al 2018 rice et al 2010 roncoroni et al 2019 in this review coupled with an illustrative experiment we summarize the current understanding of the flow biofilm sediment triangle and demonstrate how this three way interaction and important ecosystem functions such as biostabilization can benefit from a co application of measurement techniques from various disciplines the intersection between scientific fields of hydrodynamics biogeomorphology and microbiology is the theme of this paper while we focus on flow biofilm sediment interactions with implications on fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone first cm of the bed of lotic and lentic environments some examples from other environments e g medicine are also presented to provide a more comprehensive picture of the field 2 methodology 2 1 general approach to address the flow biofilm sediment triangle and its effects on ecosystem processes with an emphasis on biostabilization fig 1 a joint workshop three phase was held in stuttgart germany between june 2018 and february 2019 bringing together experts from germany in the relevant areas of hydromechanics microbial ecology biochemistry and sedimentation engineering the main goals of the workshop were i to consolidate knowledge and identify knowledge gaps in understanding flow biofilm sediment interactions through expert discussions and pivotal papers and ii to perform a pilot experiment to test and discuss how the identified knowledge gaps can be addressed by co application of modern methods in the fields of hydraulics sedimentation engineering microbial ecology and biochemistry the current knowledge and gaps to elucidate flow biofilm sediment interactions were discussed in the first phase together with the design of the pilot experiment and the second and third phases were focused on performance of experiments and review discussion of the results respectively 2 2 pilot experiment during the pilot experiment the capabilities of selected promising instruments and methods from different disciplines shown in black font in fig 1 across various spatial scales were exemplarily demonstrated by their co application on riverine biofilm samples that were quasi naturally grown on fine sediment at contrasting high bed shear stress 0 04 pa and low bed shear stress 0 01 pa flow conditions in six recirculating flumes each with dimensions of 3 m long and 0 15 m wide schmidt et al 2015 the specific aims of this pilot experiment were a to test the applicability and limitations of the techniques applied and b to identify the spatial and temporal scales relevant to better understand the reciprocal interactions in the flow biofilm sediment triangle for the latter we summarize the various scales applied in different disciplines first fig 1 selected preliminary data from this pilot work focusing on young 21 days and mature biofilms 90 days were utilized in the context of current knowledge and methodological advances that exist in each of the relevant fields for this flow biofilm sediment triangle fig 1 2 3 structure of the review this review article provides an update on current scientific knowledge practices and methodological approaches related to flow biofilm sediment interactions including fine sediment dynamics and outlines how future studies can benefit from an interdisciplinary approach in order to better understand the flow biofilm sediment processes nexus the review is organized into three parts the first starts from the initial colonization to mature microbial landscapes thereby focusing on heterotrophic bacteria and microalgae section 3 the second describes the internal architecture polymeric matrix community biomass and composition of the biofilm as well as mass transfer section 4 the third discusses the mechanical properties of biofilm and biofilm embedded sediments with specific regard to biostabilization section 5 in each of these sections selected data from the pilot experiment was used to support the challenges and benefits of a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach finally in section 6 we present research gaps and research challenges in the relevant disciplines based on the condensed knowledge and experience gained during the workshop section 7 concludes the review paper 3 a view from above mutual flow sediment biofilm interactions 3 1 flow attachment colonization in aquatic ecosystems the mostly turbulent flow is generated by an external supply of energy e g gravity wind waves at the macroscale bulk kolmogorov 1941 but gradually passed on to the microscale experienced by the aquatic microorganisms the hydrodynamic forces affect many aspects of microbial movement attachment and subsequent biofilm development for which adherence remobilisation nutrient supply and metabolic waste removal are of utmost importance therefore understanding the reciprocal interaction between microbial assemblages and near bed hydrodynamics has direct theoretical and practical implications living and moving at the microscale herein referred as single cell scale microorganisms are directly exposed to a local viscous flow characterized by low reynolds numbers re 1 which in turn interacts with the larger turbulent scales tennekes 1989 overall like non motile macroorganisms microbes are at the mercy of boundary conditions controlled by the turbulence while macroorganisms experience flow as an intermittent and chaotic motion rapid fluid fluctuations appear slower and smoother to microbes that are smaller than the size of the smallest eddies and thus embedded within a single whirl of the flow wheeler et al 2019 nevertheless most microorganisms are motile and thus even at the microscale self propelling bacteria induce flow perturbations and create spatiotemporal chaos of the otherwise laminar flow this swimming of a self propelling bacterium can occur as a random walk one of the mechanisms being run and tumble motion e g for escherichia coli apart from this individual locomotion collective motion e g chemotactic waves swarming of bacteria might take place lauga 2016 lauga and powers 2009 this behavior might lead to long range motions to impact velocity speed and direction bratanov et al 2015 meso scale turbulence characterized by vortex length scale doostmohammadi et al 2017 as well as collective oscillation as centimetre scale travelling waves chen et al 2017a b thus whether via passive drift downsweeps or active self propulsion buoyancy regulation movements macro and microscale interactions between flow and microbes orchestrate together to influence the likelihood of surface contacts as well as detachment attachment ratios characklis and cooksey 1983 tuson and weibel 2013 wey et al 2009 for instance it seems difficult for a microorganism to overcome the physical forcing when exposed to higher flow conditions 0 08 pa resulting in delayed attachment as well as growth compared to low 0 01 pa and medium 0 04 pa flow schmidt et al 2018 for further microbial colonization flow again seems to be the most decisive factor since forcing may increase particle resuspension and light attenuation limiting metabolic activity and establishment of photoautotrophs within the biofilm schmidt et al 2018 on the other hand flow can be highly beneficial to biofilm development in order to maintain nutrient supply and the removal of waste products decisive for these features is the so called diffusive benthic boundary layer dbbl usually sub millimeter in thickness along with surface roughness the usually turbulent flow above dictates the thickness of this dbbl where viscous flow prevails gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 accordingly the dbbl represents the zone between zero velocity at the surface no slip condition and turbulent conditions within the water column above within this viscous dbbl molecules are transported by molecular diffusion driven by a concentration gradient between the bulk fluid and the surface the diffusion coefficients daq are specific for the molecules of interest and along with the thickness l of the dbbl determine the transfer velocity kl along with the vertical concentration gradient the external mass transfer towards the surface of the substratum or the developing biofilm kl m s 1 daq m2 s 1 l m is quantified this external mass transfer is decisive for the replenishment of nutrients or other molecules essential for further biofilm colonization and the term is used to distinguish it from internal diffusion limitations that might occur within the biofilm stewart 2012 as seen above the external mass transfer depends on the thickness of the dbbl which again is controlled by near bed turbulence and the surface roughness of the biofilm bound sediment nikora 2010 but difficult to determine experimentally due to its thinness and inherent proximity to the bed surface while a growing biofilm under fast local flow conditions which leads to a relatively thin dbbl with a strong concentration gradient might be in a favourable situation regarding nutrient replenishment the risk of immediate detachment or sudden sloughing off is also enhanced zhang et al 2011 consequently the impact of the turbulence has been described as a trade off between shear forces and nutrient supply to influence the overall lifecycle of microbial assemblages ranging from attachment colonization and ongoing growth to dispersal mcdougald et al 2012 3 2 growth topography flow when the biofilm grows horizontally and in height it changes the topography of the colonized substratum rendering the previous surface properties redundant at first the biofilm disseminates across the surface to be colonized and the resulting spatio temporal pattern depends again largely on the flow above while a hydraulically smooth and more constant flow seems to favor isotropic microcolonies multidirectional fluctuating and varying flow velocities allow higher degrees of freedom for colonization rossy et al 2019 stoodley et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 hence growing clusters at a hydraulically rough environment i e turbulent at the roughness scale result in anisotropic star like structures that may optimize the exploitation of space hodl et al 2014 this is consistent with the data from the pilot experiment where it was observed that young biofilm featured isotropic growth while more elevated matured biofilm exhibited a preferred growth orientation in alignment with the flow direction fig 2 a while gaining height the biofilm can either smoothen a formerly rough surface by accruing the valleys or enhance the roughness by growing on hills to accentuate small differences in surface structure picioreanu et al 1998 stewart 2012 in the first scenario growth in valleys might be favoured since the troughs act as a hideaway to protect from hydrodynamic forces barton et al 2010 the second scenario the fingered biofilm growth has been proposed to be due to a competitive advantage at flow conditions that impede nutrient replenishment otherwise nikora et al 2002 generally hydraulically smooth flow conditions seem to promote the formation of filamentous or stalk like structures that protrude out of the biofilm and experience a compressed dbbl with a higher supply of nutrients this is in line with our workshop results on freshwater biofilm where low bed shear stresses 0 01 pa allowed the development of thicker and more heterogeneous biofilm with elongated filaments so called streamers moving with the flow in contrast medium stresses 0 04 pa resulted in biofilm accumulating close to the surface and forming bungalow type structures gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 clearly one way or the other if given time biofilm development changes the bed topography in the pilot experiment we measured bed topography by a scanning the area with microscope axio zoom 1 6 and b with laser triangulation system e g noss et al 2018 where biofilm valleys and peaks are determined by measuring the reflected laser light that falls incidentally onto a receiving object and at a certain angle which depends on the distance of the object here the biofilm at the low flow conditions given above increasing mean and rms root mean square heights over the weeks of growth indicated a rougher topography while increasing autocorrelation lengths distance to a different structure of the surface roughness reflected a more regular surface structure of biofilm fig 2b hence the mature biofilm in week 4 has a remarkably mountainous appearance fig 2c as compared to the initial conditions the average biofilm thickness 1 92 to 3 74 mm as well as surface roughness 0 46 to 1 97 mm increased significantly along with a reduced flow regime 0 04 to 0 01 pa as previously modelled by head 2013 this increase in roughness appears to a reduce the dbbl thickness b increase the surface area and or c induce near bed flow field fluctuations such as micro eddies by the protruding structures e g bishop et al 1997 thereby the effective roughness mediates the friction resistance forces in a way well beyond the expectation arising from the physical appearance of biofilm cowle et al 2017 measurements of flow and biofilm growth across the 5 cm patch scale in our pilot experiment suggest a spatially heterogeneous distribution of the reynolds stress total stress tensor in a fluid which globally increases above the matured biofilm bed as compared to the initial bare sand bed the enhanced and varying peaks in reynolds stress might result in recirculating eddies turbulent wakes or turbulent bursts packets of energetic fluid that penetrate deep into the dbbl to impinge transiently on the biofilm de beer et al 1994a this way the mass transfer towards sweeps to enhance food supply and out of ejections to boost waste removal the biofilm is positively enhanced bishop et al 1997 mcdougald et al 2012 stewart 2012 up to a point where detachment and abrasion occurs zhang et al 2011 in the extreme e g smooth flow conditions the biofilm might become depleted in metabolic substrates and enriched in metabolic waste stewart 2012 while the opposite is true for biofilm growth at rough flow conditions biggs et al 1998 known as the eutrophic effect of the flow 4 entering the microbial city 4 1 architecture and eps matrix biologists developed an early interest in the architecture as well as in the chemical and biological composition of biofilms consequently there are numerous papers dealing with flow biofilm interactions from young to mature stages of biofilm development in this context it has been observed that biofilm matrix architecture and species composition change significantly along with the hydrodynamics azeredo et al 2017 risse buhl et al 2020 van loosdrecht et al 2002 observations by several research groups congruently detail that biofilm thickness is inversely related to flow velocities graba et al 2013 paul et al 2012 pereira et al 2002 interestingly biofilm mass follows this trend but to a much lesser extent for instance paul et al 2012 reported for one biofilm type thickness reduction from 300 to 100 µm and mass reduction from 0 13 to 0 09 mg toc cm 2 when exposed to increasing shear stress from 2 to 9 pa dreszer et al 2014 showed elastic sponge like behavior of biofilm being exposed to varying flow conditions first three days at 20 l m 2 h 1 followed by an increase to 60 l m 2 h 1 and restoring back to the original flow their optical coherence tomography oct measurements revealed that 50 decrease in biofilm thickness at higher velocity was largely due to the collapse of mushroom like void spaces while the biofilm mass remained the same dreszer et al 2014 this not only proves the largely visco elastic nature of biofilm but also the variations in density of the biofilm matrix along with the flow conditions by applying various levels of shear stress from 0 09 to 13 pa on the surface of biofilm cultivation plates in an annular reactor paul et al 2012 confirmed the significantly enhanced biofilm density roughly about three times with increasing shear stress the investigations of pereira et al 2002 on single species pseudomonas biofilm explained the possible mechanisms behind the observed changes in physiognomy cells at stronger hydrodynamic conditions secreted more exopolymeric substances per unit volume while void spaces were reduced the resulting thinner and denser biofilm seems to promote nutrient degradation rates and thus efficiency in wastewater treatment but caution is warranted for the extrapolation to natural multispecies biofilm pereira et al 2002 first studies in fluvial systems on epilithic biofilms confirmed these effects of turbulent flow on biofilm architecture however this was most pronounced at nutrient rich conditions risse buhl et al 2017 furthermore fish et al 2017 and polst et al 2018 attested as well significantly higher production of eps carbohydrates and eps proteins at a stronger hydrodynamic regime for biofilms in drinking water pipes and autotrophic stream biofilms respectively this was different compared to the results of our pilot experiment which showed significantly higher carbohydrates content at the lower flow condition but similar for proteins at both lower and higher flow regimes fig 3 the studies are most likely incongruous since they address different biofilm communities e g heterotrophic bacteria versus microalgae with varying secretion pattern of polymeric substances pierre et al 2012 vu et al 2009 moreover there are some uncertainties as to the broad range of extraction and determination methods used delattre et al 2016 furthermore the composition of eps is highly variable and complex thus challenging to characterize flemming et al 2016 frølund et al 1996 jahn and nielsen 1995 nielsen et al 1997 1996 to the best of our knowledge there are currently no studies on shifts in eps quality e g monomer composition functional groups structural elucidation according to various flow conditions although it is eminent that components for structural integrity e g amyloids zeng et al 2015 might be more prevalent at higher flow conditions that again will be most likely determined by the dominating microbial species that trigger eps secretion highly differently depending on their adaptation an uncharted territory 4 2 microbial biomass and multitrophic relations the effect of flow on biofilm biomass is environment dependent and still inconclusive while most studies in drinking water distribution systems reported increasing bacterial biomass with increasing flow velocity fish et al 2017 simões et al 2007 torvinen et al 2007 the others from stream ecosystems showed the opposite for both bacterial and microalgal biomass battin et al 2003 besemer et al 2007 yet the effect of flow on biomass and diversity of biofilms in streams appears to be season dependent risse buhl et al 2020 suggesting a modulating effect of varying physicochemical parameters and synergistic multitrophic interactions in our pilot experiment hyperspectral imaging and quantification of absorption peaks was used to map photopigments across the surface of sedimentary biofilms chennu et al 2013 this technique can be used to non invasively monitor the distribution and dynamics of chlorophyll a and other pigments at very fine spatial scales chennu et al 2015b and flexible temporal resolution providing a comprehensive view of the spatio temporal evolution of photopigments in biofilms under various ecological interactions chennu et al 2015a the photopigment distributions in our measured biofilms of varying flow regimes age and sedimentary grain structure fig 4 indicated diversity in spatial structure succession of new functional groups in older biofilms and represent a generally robust proxy for photosynthetic potential while studies on pure cell biofilms have indicated discernibility for diatom specific photopigments fucoxanthin jesus et al 2014 we could not detect this in our studied biofilms embedded in a scattering sediment matrix however recent optical modeling work provides promising developments towards fine tuned applications launeau et al 2018 besemer et al 2007 by addressing the community successions of stream biofilms in flumes gave evidence of higher bacterial species abundance and microalgal biomass within laminar to transitional flow as compared to fully turbulent conditions schmidt et al 2018 verified reduced bacterial cell numbers as well as microalgal biomass at stronger flow conditions where both flow scenarios weak vs strong were turbulent nevertheless the effects of flow on microbial cell numbers and biomass might be as well of indirect nature for instance negative effects on microbial grazer densities e g flagellates ciliates by flow potentially generates positive effects in biofilm bacteria as the latter are released from grazing pressure risse buhl et al 2020 wey et al 2008 environmental biofilms are in fact multi trophic consortia including also protistan and micro metazoan grazers besides prokaryotes and algae weitere et al 2018 and it is this complex microbial cosmos that finally determines biofilm functionality arndt et al 2003 besemer 2015 therefore we could get revolutionary insights into the microbial world by including the whole microbial web in this regard risse buhl et al 2017 has done pioneering work to address the interaction between near bed turbulence mean flow ū and biofilm composition architecture as well as trophic structure in mountainous stream ecosystems in this study the abundance of filamentous autotrophs increased with near bed turbulent kinetic energy tke which most likely offered shelter to bacteria that remained unaffected in numbers by the increasing flow velocities bacteria further benefited from a reduced grazing pressure at faster flowing more turbulent sites since the abundance of heterotrophic protists decreased with flow results by risse buhl et al 2017 suggested that near bed flow might impact the magnitude and direction of matter fluxes through shifts in the microbial food web thereby possibly affecting ecosystem functioning 4 3 microbial taxonomy by microscope and molecular techniques insights into the microbial community composition have been traditionally gained my microscopic evaluation of morphological taxonomically unique features clark et al 2018 this classical approach is for instance common for the determination of diatom species that by their appearance and certain requirements are excellent indicators of different water qualities or various hydrodynamics scenarios graba et al 2013 reported that epilithic biofilms at smooth flow grew much thicker developed thicker filaments and accommodated multicellular growth forms of diatoms while biofilm at rough conditions were more compact hosting smaller mobile and unicellular diatoms this seems to confirm the progression of climax populations at low flow velocities that are subject to minor changes but undergo c selection competition in terms of resources such as nutrients in contrast pioneer species dominate at high flow velocities where resources are available but environmental forcing is strong to experience r selection ruderal strategy to be adapted to disturbed habitats biggs et al 1998 while these insights are very valuable on the microalgae level addressing the occurrence of certain bacterial species requires metagenomics approaches nowadays it has become possible to decipher the previously unprecedented diversity of biofilms using high throughput technologies referring to next generation sequencing ngs in terms of community composition results of our pilot experiment of prokaryotic 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna and eukaryotic 18s rrna suggest varying responses of the prokaryotic bacterial and micro eukaryotic higher cells species species diversity number of species and number of individuals per species was significantly higher at high flow condition 0 04 pa for the bacterial community while microalgal species flourished at the low flow 0 01 pa additionally bacterial species that are filamentous or well known to have eps coding genes were more dominant at the mentioned high flow velocities fig 5 this indicates clear shifts of the bacterial community as a response to the hydraulic regime few studies took it even further to the level of gene expression in order to reveal microbial responses to mechanical stress by shear flow but this is so far restricted to the single cell level persat et al 2015 thomen et al 2017 4 4 mass transfer towards out of and within the biofilm the above briefly discussed biofilm architecture eps quantity biomass and community composition is decisive for the mass transfer towards and within the biofilm mass transfer has implications for both the resupply of nutrients and the removal of waste products as stated earlier and is largely influenced by the hydrodynamic features to follow the transport of dissolved molecules into and within the biofilm mainly microelectrodes have been used so far beyenal and babauta 2013 de beer et al 2018 sønderholm et al 2017 for instance vertical profiles of oxygen microelectrodes allowed the calculation of the dbbl thickness for oxygen depending on the flow conditions above as well as metabolic activity photosynthesis respiration and the resulting penetration depth and micro niches within a biofilm or biofilm inhabited sediment de beer et al 1994b gerbersdorf et al 2004 jorgensen and revsbech 1985 using oxygen microelectrodes in our pilot experiment vertical profiles of oxygen concentration at the water biofilm sediment interface were recorded in the transition from light to dark fig 6 a while oxygen peaks and concentrations within the first 5 mm of depth were clearly decreasing over darkness the oxygen concentration below the photic zone never decreased to zero indicating some advection based on the calculated photosynthetic and respiration rates it could be stated that the metabolic activity was quite low in our system as compared to e g studies from intertidal flats de beer et al 2005 microbial mats nübel et al 2002 and alkaline lakes wieland and kühl 2000 the wide range of habitats tested proves the unbroken popularity of microsensors to determine physiological responses and essential functions of biofilms at high spatial and temporal resolution some investigations took it even one step further to address flow pattern in situ within cell clusters or voids of single cell or multi species bacterial biofilm by tracking the movement of microscopic fluorescent particles with the help of confocal microscopy de beer et al 1994a thomen et al 2017 other studies directly determined local mass transfer coefficients applying modified limiting current techniques lct within the biofilm yang and lewandowski 1995 as a result the non uniformity of local mass transfer processes within biofilms became apparent by their large fluctuations that were explained by irregularities in biofilm microstructures comprising channels voids and cell clusters while diffusion was prevailing in cell clusters liquid flow convection and diffusion occurred within the biofilm voids de beer et al 1994b 1994a yang and lewandowski 1995 moreover the flux from the bulk water into the biofilm was enhanced by the elevated biofilm structure being twice as high as compared to a planar surface de beer et al 1994b with these valuable insights that can be gained at high spatial resolutions it is not surprising that microsensor studies have skyrocketed in the last decades right now mass transfer and local conversion rates of various molecules e g n2o h2s no3 no2 can be determined by a large range of sensors to calculate the distribution of a suite of metabolic activities de beer 2011 to give just one example one of the more recent developments the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 microsensor was applied in our pilot experiment while photosynthesis produces h2o2 as damaging by product it is usually scavenged by catalase to avoid cell damage however bursts of h2o2 up to 100 200 µm were observed when the sensor tip touched a diatom colony most likely a defense mechanism of these microalgae against predators that has not been noticed before fig 6b again this allows novel information on prey predator relation and resulting functions at microscale level in order to move on from the fragile micrometer sized glass electrodes towards more robust sensors macroelectrodes with sensing tips in centimetre range were developed and the simultaneous determination of molecules in two dimensional arrays by optodes was pursued glud et al 2000 these optodes based on luminescence quenching are superior to electrochemical sensors in many ways such as obstruction of the local flow field hysteresis or cross sensitivity kautsky 1939 tengberg et al 2006 still there are new challenges associated like response time drift long term stability in organic rich environments and data processing bittig et al 2018 glud et al 1994 tengberg et al 2006 nowadays both types electrochemical and luminescent based microsensors are pushed manifold however to particularly address biofilm flow interaction is still rare glud et al 1998 kühl et al 2007 but has unbowed potential to unravel links between morphology and functionality of biofilms 5 mechanical stability of biofilm and its inhabited environment as one essential ecosystem function 5 1 biofilm functions for its inhabitants and for the ecosystem as opposed to a single planktonic lifestyle the biofilm offers high survival persistence and reproduction potential to the embedded microbes flemming and wuertz 2019 on one hand there is co metabolism and an enhanced availability of essential resources resulting in significantly higher metabolic activity this has attracted extensive attention since it links to the important microbial ecosystem functions such as biodegradation self purification or drinking water provision see introduction and the references therein on the other hand protection from environmental stressors is a key factor for biofilm members the eps matrix controls material fluxes largely by its internal porosity and permeability that determine fluid flow conduits and their connectivity flemming et al 2016 since slow diffusion processes prevail and adsorption occurs toxicants such as antibiotics or disinfectants may be intercepted in the outer layers of a biofilm which also represents a huge problem in medical treatment bjarnsholt et al 2011 all of that is possible by the cohesive and adhesive forces binding microbes to each other as well as to their substratum and conferring their overall mechanical and structural integrity that is largely impacted by the predominant flow conditions thanks to this stability biofilm eventually colonizes all kinds of interfaces whether unintentionally e g biofouling in pipes and on ship hulls or encouraged e g in waste water treatment on membranes therefore understanding mechanical properties of aquatic biofilms and biostabilization potential of biofilm bound sediment have important implications not limited to aquatic ecosystems 5 2 the challenges with biofilm induced mechanical stability characterizing the mechanical stability of biofilm and biofilm enclosed environments is thus of broad and significant concern but remains a challenging task despite a body of work part of the problem is that traditionally it was attempted to remove biological effects while nowadays biology is often brought to the laboratory with little consideration of natural settings paterson et al 2018 in this regard laboratory grown biofilm are often based on distinct microbial strains growing at conditions that are difficult to compare and often lack natural relevance e g single species biofilm and nutrient supply that do not occur in natural rivers vignaga et al 2012 when testing for the biostabilization effect in the laboratory a range of engineering devices are applied that act at different size scales while addressing different forces e g vertical jets versus horizontal bed shear stress vardy et al 2007 widdows et al 2007 moreover examination of erosion thresholds are more complicated in biofilm embedded sediments since they behave very differently compared to the traditionally used abiotic particle size fractions e g they erode in aggregates and chunks rather than in single grain mode thom et al 2015 last but not least investigating development of biofilm over time requires non destructive methods but most approaches require bed failure to occur jonsson et al 2006 overall flow microbe interactions and implications for mechanical stability of biofilm have received special attention since this process understanding might help to control eradicating harmful or encouraging beneficial biofilm by optimizing cleaning procedures e g in drinking water pipes or improving operational parameters e g in rotating biological contactors in the following we will present a brief selection of such studies focusing on the mechanical strength of a biofilm in relation to flow from single cell level to bulk biofilm measurements in the range from several millimeters to several centimeters wagner et al 2010b 5 3 single cell approaches to determine adhesive forces atomic force microscopy afm has been widely used to determine the elasticity and adhesive capacity of single bacterial or microalgal cells linking the results to different cell surface biomolecules with implications to the initial stages of biofilm colonization wright et al 2010 the afm technique can be applied in a static or dynamic mode measures in the range from piconewtons to several nanonewtons and allows 3d mapping of surfaces within a limited area boudarel et al 2018 since the technique has been widely used to study initial attachment only few studies relate to reciprocal microbe flow interactions that become most interesting in later stages of biofilm development lim et al 2008 gave proof of the positive relation between morphological parameters such as surface coverage and roughness as well as flow rate in biofilms growing on glass beads within microfluidic cells to shed light on the internal structure of biofilm passive particle tracking microrheology ptm or active optical tweezer ot and magnetic tweezer mt techniques have been successfully implemented see reviews by ahmad khalili and ahmad 2015 azeredo et al 2017 these approaches allow the determination of spatially and temporally varying adhesive strength as well as the quantification of shear stresses required for detachment while operating in the sub piconewton pn to several hundreds of pn 1 pn range castelain et al 2012 picioreanu et al 2018 using mt as a more robust approach for actively moving cells galy et al 2014 developed a 3d map of mechanical biofilm properties and demonstrated decreasing elastic compliance in e coli biofilms being exposed to increasing shear stress this research provided valuable insights of the heterogeneity of biofilm showing variations in shear compliance in the order of two magnitudes within close proximity galy et al 2014 again at microscale microfluidics are an integral part in the study on mechanical properties of growing biofilms often combined with microscopy to monitor biofilm formation during growth and biofilm deformation due to applied stress such as pressurized air or flow see review by karimi et al 2015 hohne et al 2009 established such an approach to examine the young modulus and relaxation time of two bacterial strains while imaging their deflection due to varying air pressure with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm thomen et al 2017 pursued the growth of e coli to reveal the previously unknown bacterial strategy to settle in low shear stress regions before strategically expanding from these bases towards areas of high shear stress that were impossible to colonize before hou et al 2018 applied attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy as well as cslm to give evidence that the individual staphylococcos aureus bacterium produced two to five times more eps polysaccharides at high shear conditions as compared to low shear stress that also extended to the entire biofilm as was shown by tribometrically measured coefficients of friction cof confirming that eps quantity is considered relevant for mechanical strength hou et al 2018 5 4 structural visualization and mechanical strength at the mesoscale while the microscale is certainly very important to learn about activities and functions of biofilms at high resolution it remains difficult to extrapolate these insights to the dimensions of an entire biofilm mm cm range which is of greater interest if it comes to flow biofilm interaction and the resulting mechanical strength wagner and horn 2017 knowledge on mechanical strength is needed to re think anti biofouling measures to manage biofilm growth in technical systems such as bioreactors membranes or drinking water distribution pipes or simply to better understand the mode of action that is behind the effects recorded in biostabilization of sediments therefore other techniques such as optical coherence tomography oct or optical coherence elastography oce larin and sampson 2017 which has a more holistic view on biofilm structure could be explored oct allows to work on this mesoscale in micrometer resolution and represents a fast non invasive in situ imaging technique that gives depth resolved structural information which does not require staining thus employing near infrared light allows deeper penetration into the biofilm in comparison to clsm and does not need fluorophores that might interfere with local properties of the biofilm azeredo et al 2017 picioreanu et al 2018 however our own oct measurements in the pilot experiment suggest that while surface topography is easy to image it can be difficult to capture the internal structure as well as to differentiate between biofilm and sand particles still oct clearly visualized how the microbes filled the sand grain space with biofilm maturation fig 7 in young biofilms filaments were visible at the mentioned low flow conditions 0 01 pa while at high flow 0 04 pa the growth seems delayed again fig 7 this influence of various flow scenarios in the initial stages of biofilm growth is expected to manifest later in variations in thickness morphology as well as hydraulic resistance of the mature biofilm as has been revealed by other oct measurements dreszer et al 2014 exploring the usage of rotating disk electrodes rde boulêtreau et al 2011 confirmed varying riverine biofilm thickness and elasticity that both were significantly higher at low flow conditions 0 1 versus 0 45 m s 1 over 21 days in contrast to oct rde examines the biofilm as homogenous bulk material which is similar to the application of rheometers that are commonly used for studying viscoelastic material although being destructive boudarel et al 2018 biofilm comprises both an elastic or solid like and a viscous or liquid like part that stores and dissipates energy during strain deformation in our workshop we also tested viscoelastic properties of young and mature biofilms using a rotational rheometer conducting dynamic tests in the oscillatory mode of the rheometer in our pilot experiment documented clearly the viscoelastic behavior of the biofilms at varying stages of maturity beforehand some biofilm samples young biofilm were cultivated in situ on rheometer disks with the same substrate tested simultaneously with other devices while other samples mature biofilm were transferred later onto those disks at termination of the experiment due to the roughness of the substrate both sample preparation methods showed similar results even though the in situ growth has a clear advantage of ensuring an overall structural integrity the recorded phase angle highlighted the strong dependence of the viscoelastic properties on the maturity of the biofilm the results showed a low phase angle of tanδ 0 16 for the matured biofilm indicating less viscous and more elastic behavior while this value increased for the young biofilm to tanδ 0 28 fig 8 however no clear relation could be detected between the phase angle and the prevailing flow conditions although the margin of the phase angle has been slightly larger for biofilms exposed to lower flow conditions fig 8 for a more comprehensive interpretation however it is necessary to link the results on rheological properties to structural features e g streamers or flat biofilm and chemical composition polymer type in future studies then it would also be possible to structurally explain stronger adhesion and lower detachment rates at higher shear stresses as it has been previously observed by recording stress strain tests and creep compliance curves in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm samples stoodley et al 2002 5 5 erosion vulnerability and adhesive capacity in sediment research as we can see from sections 5 1 5 4 there exists promising studies highlighting mechanical properties of biofilm in interaction with the flow at various scales see also review by araújo et al 2019 however none of the research includes the substratum except for our presented oct fig 7 and rheometer measurements fig 8 where biofilm grew on fine sand this is of course different in sedimentation engineering where the erosive response of the substratum towards hydrodynamic forcing is central however biofilms were and sometimes still are neglected in this research field paterson et al 2018 righetti and lucarelli 2007 that changed some decades ago when it was increasingly recognized that biofilms are ubiquitously distributed and impact significantly the dynamics of the etdc erosion transport deposition consolidation sediment cycle black et al 2002 with the consensus on the importance of biostabilization the portfolio of methods to address sediment stability has broadened the classical approach in hydraulic research and engineering utilizes erosion flumes or chambers in which the flowing water eventually causes bed failure to occur aberle et al 2003 jonsson et al 2006 noack et al 2015 widdows et al 2007 with growing interest in the biology mediating the erosive response devices with smaller footprints capable for usage in the field were developed to pursue mechanical failure and sloughing off at higher temporal and spatial resolution vardy et al 2007 however to follow up gradual changes in the attachment and increasing cohesion of substratum by young biofilms non destructive methods with higher sensitivity were needed magnetic particle induction magpi system has been developed to determine the adhesive capacity of growing biofilm at the patch scale with a small footprint but large enough to get meaningful results on biofilm embedded sediment stability gerbersdorf et al 2018 larson et al 2009 using 50 particle clearance the magpi indicated significantly lower adhesiveness at low flow condition 834 59 ma as compared to high flow condition 1241 97 ma in our pilot experiment this is in line with the results of graba et al 2013 who performed a sloughing test on 40 day old biofilms and showed an inverse relation between the proportion of detached biomass and the average value of friction velocity during growth the higher stability might be related to enhanced secretion of extracellular polymeric substances at high shear stresses as stated earlier brading et al 1995 fish et al 2017 whether or not this translates into a higher biostabilization capacity of the biofilm within the sediment at high flow regimes is currently unknown gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 in our pilot experiment by investigating the erosion failure of the samples within the seteg flume noack et al 2015 the critical shear stress necessary to erode the biofilm sediment complex was 40 fold higher as compared to the bare sand fig 9 however there was no statistically significant difference between the two contrasting flow scenarios this might be explained by the growing mode of these samples where the biofilm covered the underlying substratum like a carpet erosion often occurred suddenly at the edges of our sample holders followed by a severe resuspension of the bare unprotected sediment beneath the biofilm carpet rather than indicating a true failure of the biofilm sediment surface see s1 and s2 for videos the starting position of the erosion at the edges of the cartridges can be attributed to a sudden change in surface roughness upstream and downstream of the measurement location hence while cultivating biofilms in special cartridges schmidt et al 2015 or coupons singer et al 2010 2006 facilitates in situ and easier measurements using a multitude of instruments it is critical for erosion tests to exclude unwanted effects of sudden roughness change it is further deemed advisable to adapt shield s like erosion schemes to biofilm embedded material shields 1936 thom et al 2015 6 the gaps in hydromechanics biofilm and sediment research and lessons to learn in biofilm research the single cell scale has been naturally favoured to decipher details on biofilm attachment quorum sensing morphology and or detachment kim et al 2016 mukherjee and bassler 2019 wheeler et al 2019 as we have reported above reciprocal flow biofilm interactions have been experimentally explored within micro fabricated channels that mostly range from micrometres to millimetres and analysed mainly by microsensors de beer et al 1994a yang and lewandowski 1995 and or imaging techniques for the latter thomen et al 2017 visualized the trail lengths of 1 µm fluorescent particles via microscopically derived z stack images in millifluidic channels magnetic resonance microscopy mrm is another promising method for the investigation of transport phenomena which is capable of simultaneously imaging the development of flow field and biofilm structure in a non invasive less time consuming way while covering quantitatively relevant areas gjersing et al 2005 manz et al 2005 2003 for instance wagner et al 2010a addressed the response of biofilm to various flow gradients and shear rates by scanning the flow field with mrm herrling et al 2017 successfully elucidated water diffusion within five different types of biofilm structures by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance pfg nmr as morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 stated a biofilm with a total area of 1 m2 is not simply the sum of biofilm grown in 1000 flow channels even though the total areas roughly correspond consequently in their study morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 went up to the patch scale to address the effect of laminar transient and fully turbulent conditions on biofilm in the range of several millimetres to centimetres collectively these experiments gave essential insights into detailed processes of biofilm development at various hydrodynamic settings however their relevance for aquatic environments is still largely debatable due to difficulties in reproducing natural conditions in the laboratory challenges include representing natural temporal and spatial variability of flow single cell scale to ecosystem scale and biofilm multitaxa and multispecies communities or generating fully developed turbulent flow conditions and irregular surfaces e g mixed sediments spatial heterogeneity of roughness at the measurement section ideally biofilm should be grown in a most natural like setting to allow a typical community composition and matrix structure at environmentally relevant flow patterns obviously this might differ severely in simulating technical or natural habitats but in both cases this requires experimental facilities that are beyond the small scale of the microfluidic channels despite increasing number of mesocosm studies our understanding of near bed flow dynamics is currently hampered by the lack of velocity measurements at the flow biofilm sediment interface e g nuy et al 2018 risse buhl et al 2017 while the interactions between flow and biofilm occur predominantly at mesoscale 100 µm to 10 cm in vertical length most studies concerning flow biofilm reciprocity usually represent flow with a single bulk value for the entire channel either as a depth averaged or cross sectional average velocity and discharge moulin and eiff 2012 and references therein or temporally averaged flow and turbulence parameters far above the bed risse buhl et al 2017 2020 singer et al 2010 ignoring the heterogenous characteristics of the flow at local biofilm scale µm to cm and its dispersive contribution to mass flux this can mainly be attributed to frequent use of acoustic based e g acoustic doppler velocimeter or adv or magnetic field based e g electromagnetic current meter or ecm instruments in both laboratory and field studies which have difficulties in measuring near bed mean flow 5 mm and turbulence 10 mm due to acoustic interference of the bed koca et al 2017 voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 and or sensor size on the other hand applying hot film anemometers biggs et al 1998 demonstrated clearly the influence that the biofilm has on the close by flow pattern 2 mm above its surface while there was no measurable effect to the far more uniform mean velocity of the mid water column hydrodynamic fluctuations with local shear stress peaks are critical to mass transfer stoodley et al 1999 voermans et al 2017 with important consequences for biofilm to modulate ecosystem health and services this is particularly important for biofilms with streamers which oscillate with the flow and modulate mass transfer nikora 2010 larned et al 2011 ultimately only local flow conditions are relevant to describe the forcing at microscale and are not easily inferred from mean bulk velocities graba et al 2013 the introduction of modern optical and non intrusive techniques such as particle image velocimetry piv allows high resolution measurements of flow patterns close to the biofilm 1 2 mm in standard configurations piv is based on visualization and computation of the displacement of small tracer particles in a flow captured by two subsequent images see reviews by adrian et al 2011 westerweel et al 2013 since it allows for both quantitative measurements at larger areas few dm2 and visualization of flow structures piv provides physical insights into the behavior of flow and biofilm interactions thereby offering various advantages over traditional methods i e adv ecm despite its costly and complicated setup low cost piv systems have recently been developed for use in the laboratory cierpka et al 2016 and in the field cameron et al 2013 koca et al unpublished results thus instead of following traditional single point or vertical profile measurements it is now possible and timely to characterize flow pattern near biofilm at high resolution koca et al 2016 nevertheless the challenge remains to measure this at sub millimeter scales in fully turbulent fully rough and fully developed environments which unavoidably must be performed in relatively large flow facilities on the several meter scale for a variety of controlled flow and environmental conditions packman 2013 vignaga et al 2013 indeed it would be desirable to describe scales small enough to include the viscous sublayer on the biofilm and grains while simultaneously capturing the full turbulent spectrum only then can the mechanisms behind biofilm growth as well as mass and momentum flux exchanges between biofilm and the water be elucidated research on flow sediment interaction has a long tradition in engineering science which is motivated inter alia by the huge economical aspect to maintain waterways and harbours for shipping as well as flood control measures voermans et al 2017 sediment dynamics from bedload such as rolling gravel to suspended load of fine particles is of uttermost importance for the hydrological geomorphological and ecological functioning of aquatic systems including rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and coastal zones forstner and westrich 2005 along with sediment properties the hydrodynamic regime is decisive for the transport deposition and finally spatial distribution of sediments hence fine grained particles such as silt and clay usually settle in low energetic habitat while coarser sediment deposit in areas of high energy impact where frequent collisions of sand particles rolling occur van rijn 1993 this in turn impacts the settlement of microbes with a higher likelihood to develop in fine sediments since these small particles feature a a high surface to volume ratio b offer plenty of binding sites to trap nutrients and c offer more protection for sensible shells such as diatom frustules that might be destroyed in rolling delgado et al 1991 gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 mediation of fine sediment characteristics by the developing microbial assemblages then changes their erosive response to hydraulic forcing as described in sections 1 and 5 5 while the onset of motion of non cohesive sediment particles such as sand or gravel is generally predicted by using the shields diagram shields 1936 there is no valid approach for fine cohesive sediment because of the biological features inhabited black et al 2002 in order to better predict the behavior of fine sediment and the often associated pollutants at extreme e g 100 year flood or management scenarios e g flushing experiments have been largely performed in laboratory flumes with sediments that were retrieved and transferred from the field forstner and salomons 2008 gerbersdorf et al 2007 haag et al 2001 however there are increasing efforts towards in situ measurements in order to avoid unwanted changes due to transport of sediment from field to flume and sediment aging aberle et al 2003 noack et al 2015 witt and westrich 2003 overall although fine sediments and their erosional behavior have thus received increasing attention over the last decades with or without the consideration of biofilm their link to the temporally and spatially highly varying pattern of hydrodynamics e g tke and bed topography co evolving with biofilm growth have not been studied yet gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 hannah et al 2004 rice et al 2010 on a much smaller scale some studies addressed the sloughing off phenomena of biofilm at varying shear stresses by measuring biofilm weight losses or the amount of eroded sand biofilm mixtures grün et al 2016 pique et al 2016 consequently future studies should further explore the flow biofilm sediment processes nexus in order to better understand biostabilization and sediment dynamics which have key implications for morphodynamics aquatic habitat water quality and beyond this requires integrated investigations of hydrodynamics biogeomorphology and microbiology an example of such integrated approach was illustrated in this review paper combined with a pilot experiment based on the co application of state of the art methods from different disciplines black font in fig 1 on quasi naturally grown biofilm bound sediment developed at contrasting flow conditions we have made following observations about advantages and challenges associated with the tested methods flow affected time of settlement growth direction and subsequent topography of biofilm bound sediment fig 2 in turn the biofilm growth increased considerably the magnitude and heterogeneity of reynolds shear stress not shown here while the measurements of spatially and temporally varying flow in combination with motion of streamers are still challenging piv may become a key method in studying natural flow biofilm interactions at high resolution obtaining topography by scanning microscopy fig 2a b was far too time consuming for larger areas instead laser triangulation system showed similar results fig 2c in a fraction of the time previously needed and is thus an excellent choice for characterizing topography at patch scale cm2 dm2 microscopy is needed for higher resolutions at spatially limited spots in order to e g visualize key components of the biofilm members and eps moieties by fluorescence signals with application of microsensors we have observed bursts of h2o2 when touching a diatom colony suggesting a likely defense mechanism of these microalgae against predators therefore using microsensors one can also gain insights into how microbes cope with friendly and unfriendly neighbours in their close surrounding fig 6 microsensor measurements could be used together with piv measurements and oct images for analyzing the external and internal mass as well as momentum transfer by combining substrate distribution flow dynamics and biofilm structure even though it is not tested here the application of mrm holds promise for studying internal and external diffusion and flow patterns oct is a beneficial imaging technique for characterizing internal structure of biofilm without disturbing or damaging the samples however since the probe depth is limited it remains to be tested how suitable this technique is for analyzing biofilm embedded sediment over depths larger than 2 mm fig 7 performing biochemical and microbiological analyses it was observed that quantities of polymeric substances and cell numbers play a minor role in explaining the mechanisms of binding within the biofilm and beyond fig 3 suggesting the significant role of various eps moieties and key microbial players to translate into functionality herein biostabilization applying molecular techniques we have observed significant shifts in species composition and diversity at both prokaryotic and eukaryotic levels according to temporal and environmental changes fig 5 the link between functionality and diversity of key players is a matter of an ongoing debate in ecology besemer 2015 dang and lovell 2016 leibold et al 2004 to introduce this idea into biofilm science would be a great research concept for hypothesis building microalgae seem to play a dominant role in biostabilizing the sediment with impact according to the particular groups or species involved thus the possibility to monitor by hyperspectral imaging the density composition and distribution of phototrophic biofilms fig 4 creates a strong predictor for metabolic activity and sediment stability while the magnetic particle induction technique is highly sensitive for measuring adhesiveness of biofilm bound sediment at high temporal and spatial resolution 5 mm not shown here it is restricted to measurements at the sediment surface furthermore measurements are challenging if streamers are abundant until now determination of the stability of deeper layers has been limited to erosion flumes with the known methodological limitations fig 9 like with the erosion flumes the rheometer approach does not allow ongoing measurements for the same sample over time but could structurally explain varying adhesiveness and detachment rates of biofilm at different environmental scenarios fig 8 7 conclusions recent advances in measurement techniques have provided a wealth of knowledge regarding individual domains of biofilm research yet the understanding of flow biofilm sediment processes is still at its infancy studying flow biofilm sediment interactions are of importance to better understand ecological functions and engineering processes and to help establish healthy aquatic ecosystems most of the insights on the sediment ecology relation derive from investigations on macroorganisms and macrophytes this is surprising since microbes are the first colonizers to dictate subsequent colonization by higher trophic levels and they e g predominately affect the flux of matter on larger scales moreover the link to the substratum in which microorganisms settle is mostly missing therefore integrative and interdisciplinary approaches are needed that simultaneously and equally address the complex and non linear ways in which sediment properties and biofilm interact with the hydrodynamics at a scale of µm to cm single cell and patch scale before extrapolating the theoretical knowledge to the larger scales for environmental management purposes while field studies are essential process understanding comes from controllable and repeatable conditions addressed in laboratory experiments which should cross disciplinary boundaries to avoid oversimplification and unrealistic settings e g use of isolated species inappropriate physical conditions unconsidered wall effects or short test sections in this review we summarized the current state of the knowledge and methodological approaches in the flow biofilm sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments specifically we combined a literature review with the results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop with the aims of i consolidating expert knowledge from different scientific fields but all with the same goal directed towards flow biofilm sediment triangle ii identifying knowledge gaps and iii exploring the feasibility of different instruments to address these

17605,biofilm activities and their interactions with physical chemical and biological processes are of great importance for a variety of ecosystem functions impacting hydrogeomorphology water quality and aquatic ecosystem health effective management of water bodies requires advancing our understanding of how flow influences biofilm bound sediment and ecosystem processes and vice versa however research on this triangle of flow biofilm sediment is still at its infancy in this review we summarize the current state of the art and methodological approaches in the flow biofilm sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments example studies of this three way interaction across a range of spatial scales from cell nm µm to patch scale mm dm are highlighted in view of the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches as a contribution to the review we combine a literature survey with results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop to explore the feasibility of asking interdisciplinary questions further within this workshop various observation and measuring approaches were tested and the quality of the achieved results was evaluated individually and in combination accordingly the paper concludes by highlighting the following research challenges to be considered within the forthcoming years in the triangle of flow biofilm sediment i establish a collaborative work among hydraulic and sedimentation engineers as well as ecologists to study mutual goals with appropriate methods perform realistic experimental studies to test hypotheses on flow biofilm sediment interactions as well as structural and mechanical characteristics of the bed ii consider spatially varying characteristics of flow at the sediment water interface utilize combinations of microsensors and non intrusive optical methods such as particle image velocimetry and laser scanner to elucidate the mechanism behind biofilm growth as well as mass and momentum flux exchanges between biofilm and water use molecular approaches dna pigments staining microscopy for sophisticated community analyses link varying flow regimes to microbial communities and processes and fine sediment properties to explore the role of key microbial players and functions in enhancing

biofilms flemming and wuertz 2019 the transition of one microbe from the planktonic to the biofilm lifestyle and vice versa depends on a range of environmental conditions among which the local hydrodynamics are of paramount importance berke et al 2008 mcdougald et al 2012 wheeler et al 2019 hydrodynamics largely dictate initial touch down and the residence time of the microbes on surfaces rusconi et al 2014 when exceeding a certain hydrodynamic force or experiencing a hydraulic retention time shorter than the doubling time of the cells the microbes will disperse again and leave the habitat those cells that still stick are selected towards stronger adherence and the further biofilm development strongly shapes their adjacent physical and chemical surrounding in a reciprocal way gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 thereby biofilm growth and its influence on the surrounding strongly depend on the microbial metabolic activity which leads to redox relevant small scale stratification and impacts large scale biogeochemical budgets packman 2013 however these metabolic processes are determined by mass transfer in the water column and towards the biofilm which is again controlled by hydrodynamics regulating nutrient supply to the microbes gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 for a comprehensive review on the processes related to surface attachment and subsequent colonization we refer

and has been reported to mediate sediment erosion transport deposition and consolidation etdc cycle in aquatic ecosystems paterson et al 2018 it should be noted that biostabilization can also occur through smoothing of the bed surface and therefore reduction of the hydraulic roughness as observed over gravel like hemispheres graba et al 2010 these interactions of sediment and biofilm are

habitat salta et al 2013 wilhelm et al 2014 as well as flow and bed topography battin 2000 risse buhl et al 2017 woodcock et al 2013 indeed many biofilms have complex morphologies and can develop long oscillating filamentous structures called streamers larned et al 2011 nikora 2010 which not only alter flow dynamism and bed topography but also mass transport near the bed the preceding higher order effects induced by biofilm formation are of ever changing nature battin et al 2016 mainly due to complex reciprocal interactions between flow biofilm and sediment gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 and are also expected to change in a nontrivial way as a result of climate change piggott et al 2015 zeglin 2015 and human alteration however our understanding of dynamic flow biofilm sediment processes nexus in natural water bodies which drive changes in ecosystem processes and functions remain still incomplete nikora 2010 packman 2013 paterson et al 2018 in order to better manage our water bodies for the benefits of human society and ecosystem functioning as well as to support un s sustainable development goals a better understanding of flow biofilm sediment interactions that we call flow biofilm sediment triangle is needed challenges include i creating realistic experimental settings and utilizing a combination of tools and approaches to describe the reciprocal relationships between flow biofilm sediment and associated mass transfer which alters microbial processes and vice versa and ii understanding the role of key microbial players and processes for biogeochemical and morphological processes biostabilization at the entire ecosystem level and how organismal level functions can be linked to ecosystem functions these challenges require acquisition of large bodies of information across various spatial scales by studying hydraulics geomorphology and ecology as an integrated concept using advanced tools and approaches rather than viewing them as subordinately serving the other the increasing needs for interdisciplinary approaches have been underlined by many recent studies battin et al 2016 palmer and ruhi 2019 paterson et al 2018 rice et al 2010 roncoroni et al 2019 in this review coupled with an illustrative experiment we summarize the current understanding of the flow biofilm sediment triangle and demonstrate how this three way interaction and important ecosystem functions such as biostabilization can benefit from a co application of measurement techniques from various disciplines the intersection between scientific fields of hydrodynamics biogeomorphology and microbiology is the theme of this paper while we focus on flow biofilm sediment interactions with implications on fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone first cm of the bed of lotic and lentic environments some examples from other environments e g medicine are also presented to provide a more comprehensive picture of the field 2 methodology 2 1 general approach to address the flow biofilm sediment triangle and its effects on ecosystem processes with an emphasis on biostabilization fig 1 a joint workshop three phase was held in stuttgart germany between june 2018 and february 2019 bringing together experts from germany in the relevant areas of hydromechanics microbial ecology biochemistry and sedimentation engineering the main goals of the workshop were i to consolidate knowledge and identify knowledge gaps in understanding flow biofilm sediment interactions through expert discussions and pivotal papers and ii to perform a pilot experiment to test and discuss how the identified knowledge gaps can be addressed by co application of modern methods in the fields of hydraulics sedimentation engineering microbial ecology and biochemistry the current knowledge and gaps to elucidate flow biofilm sediment interactions were discussed in the first phase together with the design of the pilot experiment and the second and third phases were focused on performance of experiments and review discussion of the results respectively 2 2 pilot experiment during the pilot experiment the capabilities of selected promising instruments and methods from different disciplines shown in black font in fig 1 across various spatial scales were exemplarily demonstrated by their co application on riverine biofilm samples that were quasi naturally grown on fine sediment at contrasting high bed shear stress 0 04 pa and low bed shear stress 0 01 pa flow conditions in six recirculating flumes each with dimensions of 3 m long and 0 15 m wide schmidt et al 2015 the specific aims of this pilot experiment were a to test the applicability and limitations of the techniques applied and b to identify the spatial and temporal scales relevant to better understand the reciprocal interactions in the flow biofilm sediment triangle for the latter we summarize the various scales applied in different disciplines first fig 1 selected preliminary data from this pilot work focusing on young 21 days and mature biofilms 90 days were utilized in the context of current knowledge and methodological advances that exist in each of the relevant fields for this flow biofilm sediment triangle fig 1 2 3 structure of the review this review article provides an update on current scientific knowledge practices and methodological approaches related to flow biofilm sediment interactions including fine sediment dynamics and outlines how future studies can benefit from an interdisciplinary approach in order to better understand the flow biofilm sediment processes nexus the review is organized into three parts the first starts from the initial colonization to mature microbial landscapes thereby focusing on heterotrophic bacteria and microalgae section 3 the second describes the internal architecture polymeric matrix community biomass and composition of the biofilm as well as mass transfer section 4 the third discusses the mechanical properties of biofilm and biofilm embedded sediments with specific regard to biostabilization section 5 in each of these sections selected data from the pilot experiment was used to support the challenges and benefits of a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach finally in section 6 we present research gaps and research challenges in the relevant disciplines based on the condensed knowledge and experience gained during the workshop section 7 concludes the review paper 3 a view from above mutual flow sediment biofilm interactions 3 1 flow attachment colonization in aquatic ecosystems the mostly turbulent flow is generated by an external supply of energy e g gravity wind waves at the macroscale bulk kolmogorov 1941 but gradually passed on to the microscale experienced by the aquatic microorganisms the hydrodynamic forces affect many aspects of microbial movement attachment and subsequent biofilm development for which adherence remobilisation nutrient supply and metabolic waste removal are of utmost importance therefore understanding the reciprocal interaction between microbial assemblages and near bed hydrodynamics has direct theoretical and practical implications living and moving at the microscale herein referred as single cell scale microorganisms are directly exposed to a local viscous flow characterized by low reynolds numbers re 1 which in turn interacts with the larger turbulent scales tennekes 1989 overall like non motile macroorganisms microbes are at the mercy of boundary conditions controlled by the turbulence while macroorganisms experience flow as an intermittent and chaotic motion rapid fluid fluctuations appear slower and smoother to microbes that are smaller than the size of the smallest eddies and thus embedded within a single whirl of the flow wheeler et al 2019 nevertheless most microorganisms are motile and thus even at the microscale self propelling bacteria induce flow perturbations and create spatiotemporal chaos of the otherwise laminar flow this swimming of a self propelling bacterium can occur as a random walk one of the mechanisms being run and tumble motion e g for escherichia coli apart from this individual locomotion collective motion e g chemotactic waves swarming of bacteria might take place lauga 2016 lauga and powers 2009 this behavior might lead to long range motions to impact velocity speed and direction bratanov et al 2015 meso scale turbulence characterized by vortex length scale doostmohammadi et al 2017 as well as collective oscillation as centimetre scale travelling waves chen et al 2017a b thus whether via passive drift downsweeps or active self propulsion buoyancy regulation movements macro and microscale interactions between flow and microbes orchestrate together to influence the likelihood of surface contacts as well as detachment attachment ratios characklis and cooksey 1983 tuson and weibel 2013 wey et al 2009 for instance it seems difficult for a microorganism to overcome the physical forcing when exposed to higher flow conditions 0 08 pa resulting in delayed attachment as well as growth compared to low 0 01 pa and medium 0 04 pa flow schmidt et al 2018 for further microbial colonization flow again seems to be the most decisive factor since forcing may increase particle resuspension and light attenuation limiting metabolic activity and establishment of photoautotrophs within the biofilm schmidt et al 2018 on the other hand flow can be highly beneficial to biofilm development in order to maintain nutrient supply and the removal of waste products decisive for these features is the so called diffusive benthic boundary layer dbbl usually sub millimeter in thickness along with surface roughness the usually turbulent flow above dictates the thickness of this dbbl where viscous flow prevails gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 accordingly the dbbl represents the zone between zero velocity at the surface no slip condition and turbulent conditions within the water column above within this viscous dbbl molecules are transported by molecular diffusion driven by a concentration gradient between the bulk fluid and the surface the diffusion coefficients daq are specific for the molecules of interest and along with the thickness l of the dbbl determine the transfer velocity kl along with the vertical concentration gradient the external mass transfer towards the surface of the substratum or the developing biofilm kl m s 1 daq m2 s 1 l m is quantified this external mass transfer is decisive for the replenishment of nutrients or other molecules essential for further biofilm colonization and the term is used to distinguish it from internal diffusion limitations that might occur within the biofilm stewart 2012 as seen above the external mass transfer depends on the thickness of the dbbl which again is controlled by near bed turbulence and the surface roughness of the biofilm bound sediment nikora 2010 but difficult to determine experimentally due to its thinness and inherent proximity to the bed surface while a growing biofilm under fast local flow conditions which leads to a relatively thin dbbl with a strong concentration gradient might be in a favourable situation regarding nutrient replenishment the risk of immediate detachment or sudden sloughing off is also enhanced zhang et al 2011 consequently the impact of the turbulence has been described as a trade off between shear forces and nutrient supply to influence the overall lifecycle of microbial assemblages ranging from attachment colonization and ongoing growth to dispersal mcdougald et al 2012 3 2 growth topography flow when the biofilm grows horizontally and in height it changes the topography of the colonized substratum rendering the previous surface properties redundant at first the biofilm disseminates across the surface to be colonized and the resulting spatio temporal pattern depends again largely on the flow above while a hydraulically smooth and more constant flow seems to favor isotropic microcolonies multidirectional fluctuating and varying flow velocities allow higher degrees of freedom for colonization rossy et al 2019 stoodley et al 1999 thomas et al 2013 hence growing clusters at a hydraulically rough environment i e turbulent at the roughness scale result in anisotropic star like structures that may optimize the exploitation of space hodl et al 2014 this is consistent with the data from the pilot experiment where it was observed that young biofilm featured isotropic growth while more elevated matured biofilm exhibited a preferred growth orientation in alignment with the flow direction fig 2 a while gaining height the biofilm can either smoothen a formerly rough surface by accruing the valleys or enhance the roughness by growing on hills to accentuate small differences in surface structure picioreanu et al 1998 stewart 2012 in the first scenario growth in valleys might be favoured since the troughs act as a hideaway to protect from hydrodynamic forces barton et al 2010 the second scenario the fingered biofilm growth has been proposed to be due to a competitive advantage at flow conditions that impede nutrient replenishment otherwise nikora et al 2002 generally hydraulically smooth flow conditions seem to promote the formation of filamentous or stalk like structures that protrude out of the biofilm and experience a compressed dbbl with a higher supply of nutrients this is in line with our workshop results on freshwater biofilm where low bed shear stresses 0 01 pa allowed the development of thicker and more heterogeneous biofilm with elongated filaments so called streamers moving with the flow in contrast medium stresses 0 04 pa resulted in biofilm accumulating close to the surface and forming bungalow type structures gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 clearly one way or the other if given time biofilm development changes the bed topography in the pilot experiment we measured bed topography by a scanning the area with microscope axio zoom 1 6 and b with laser triangulation system e g noss et al 2018 where biofilm valleys and peaks are determined by measuring the reflected laser light that falls incidentally onto a receiving object and at a certain angle which depends on the distance of the object here the biofilm at the low flow conditions given above increasing mean and rms root mean square heights over the weeks of growth indicated a rougher topography while increasing autocorrelation lengths distance to a different structure of the surface roughness reflected a more regular surface structure of biofilm fig 2b hence the mature biofilm in week 4 has a remarkably mountainous appearance fig 2c as compared to the initial conditions the average biofilm thickness 1 92 to 3 74 mm as well as surface roughness 0 46 to 1 97 mm increased significantly along with a reduced flow regime 0 04 to 0 01 pa as previously modelled by head 2013 this increase in roughness appears to a reduce the dbbl thickness b increase the surface area and or c induce near bed flow field fluctuations such as micro eddies by the protruding structures e g bishop et al 1997 thereby the effective roughness mediates the friction resistance forces in a way well beyond the expectation arising from the physical appearance of biofilm cowle et al 2017 measurements of flow and biofilm growth across the 5 cm patch scale in our pilot experiment suggest a spatially heterogeneous distribution of the reynolds stress total stress tensor in a fluid which globally increases above the matured biofilm bed as compared to the initial bare sand bed the enhanced and varying peaks in reynolds stress might result in recirculating eddies turbulent wakes or turbulent bursts packets of energetic fluid that penetrate deep into the dbbl to impinge transiently on the biofilm de beer et al 1994a this way the mass transfer towards sweeps to enhance food supply and out of ejections to boost waste removal the biofilm is positively enhanced bishop et al 1997 mcdougald et al 2012 stewart 2012 up to a point where detachment and abrasion occurs zhang et al 2011 in the extreme e g smooth flow conditions the biofilm might become depleted in metabolic substrates and enriched in metabolic waste stewart 2012 while the opposite is true for biofilm growth at rough flow conditions biggs et al 1998 known as the eutrophic effect of the flow 4 entering the microbial city 4 1 architecture and eps matrix biologists developed an early interest in the architecture as well as in the chemical and biological composition of biofilms consequently there are numerous papers dealing with flow biofilm interactions from young to mature stages of biofilm development in this context it has been observed that biofilm matrix architecture and species composition change significantly along with the hydrodynamics azeredo et al 2017 risse buhl et al 2020 van loosdrecht et al 2002 observations by several research groups congruently detail that biofilm thickness is inversely related to flow velocities graba et al 2013 paul et al 2012 pereira et al 2002 interestingly biofilm mass follows this trend but to a much lesser extent for instance paul et al 2012 reported for one biofilm type thickness reduction from 300 to 100 µm and mass reduction from 0 13 to 0 09 mg toc cm 2 when exposed to increasing shear stress from 2 to 9 pa dreszer et al 2014 showed elastic sponge like behavior of biofilm being exposed to varying flow conditions first three days at 20 l m 2 h 1 followed by an increase to 60 l m 2 h 1 and restoring back to the original flow their optical coherence tomography oct measurements revealed that 50 decrease in biofilm thickness at higher velocity was largely due to the collapse of mushroom like void spaces while the biofilm mass remained the same dreszer et al 2014 this not only proves the largely visco elastic nature of biofilm but also the variations in density of the biofilm matrix along with the flow conditions by applying various levels of shear stress from 0 09 to 13 pa on the surface of biofilm cultivation plates in an annular reactor paul et al 2012 confirmed the significantly enhanced biofilm density roughly about three times with increasing shear stress the investigations of pereira et al 2002 on single species pseudomonas biofilm explained the possible mechanisms behind the observed changes in physiognomy cells at stronger hydrodynamic conditions secreted more exopolymeric substances per unit volume while void spaces were reduced the resulting thinner and denser biofilm seems to promote nutrient degradation rates and thus efficiency in wastewater treatment but caution is warranted for the extrapolation to natural multispecies biofilm pereira et al 2002 first studies in fluvial systems on epilithic biofilms confirmed these effects of turbulent flow on biofilm architecture however this was most pronounced at nutrient rich conditions risse buhl et al 2017 furthermore fish et al 2017 and polst et al 2018 attested as well significantly higher production of eps carbohydrates and eps proteins at a stronger hydrodynamic regime for biofilms in drinking water pipes and autotrophic stream biofilms respectively this was different compared to the results of our pilot experiment which showed significantly higher carbohydrates content at the lower flow condition but similar for proteins at both lower and higher flow regimes fig 3 the studies are most likely incongruous since they address different biofilm communities e g heterotrophic bacteria versus microalgae with varying secretion pattern of polymeric substances pierre et al 2012 vu et al 2009 moreover there are some uncertainties as to the broad range of extraction and determination methods used delattre et al 2016 furthermore the composition of eps is highly variable and complex thus challenging to characterize flemming et al 2016 frølund et al 1996 jahn and nielsen 1995 nielsen et al 1997 1996 to the best of our knowledge there are currently no studies on shifts in eps quality e g monomer composition functional groups structural elucidation according to various flow conditions although it is eminent that components for structural integrity e g amyloids zeng et al 2015 might be more prevalent at higher flow conditions that again will be most likely determined by the dominating microbial species that trigger eps secretion highly differently depending on their adaptation an uncharted territory 4 2 microbial biomass and multitrophic relations the effect of flow on biofilm biomass is environment dependent and still inconclusive while most studies in drinking water distribution systems reported increasing bacterial biomass with increasing flow velocity fish et al 2017 simões et al 2007 torvinen et al 2007 the others from stream ecosystems showed the opposite for both bacterial and microalgal biomass battin et al 2003 besemer et al 2007 yet the effect of flow on biomass and diversity of biofilms in streams appears to be season dependent risse buhl et al 2020 suggesting a modulating effect of varying physicochemical parameters and synergistic multitrophic interactions in our pilot experiment hyperspectral imaging and quantification of absorption peaks was used to map photopigments across the surface of sedimentary biofilms chennu et al 2013 this technique can be used to non invasively monitor the distribution and dynamics of chlorophyll a and other pigments at very fine spatial scales chennu et al 2015b and flexible temporal resolution providing a comprehensive view of the spatio temporal evolution of photopigments in biofilms under various ecological interactions chennu et al 2015a the photopigment distributions in our measured biofilms of varying flow regimes age and sedimentary grain structure fig 4 indicated diversity in spatial structure succession of new functional groups in older biofilms and represent a generally robust proxy for photosynthetic potential while studies on pure cell biofilms have indicated discernibility for diatom specific photopigments fucoxanthin jesus et al 2014 we could not detect this in our studied biofilms embedded in a scattering sediment matrix however recent optical modeling work provides promising developments towards fine tuned applications launeau et al 2018 besemer et al 2007 by addressing the community successions of stream biofilms in flumes gave evidence of higher bacterial species abundance and microalgal biomass within laminar to transitional flow as compared to fully turbulent conditions schmidt et al 2018 verified reduced bacterial cell numbers as well as microalgal biomass at stronger flow conditions where both flow scenarios weak vs strong were turbulent nevertheless the effects of flow on microbial cell numbers and biomass might be as well of indirect nature for instance negative effects on microbial grazer densities e g flagellates ciliates by flow potentially generates positive effects in biofilm bacteria as the latter are released from grazing pressure risse buhl et al 2020 wey et al 2008 environmental biofilms are in fact multi trophic consortia including also protistan and micro metazoan grazers besides prokaryotes and algae weitere et al 2018 and it is this complex microbial cosmos that finally determines biofilm functionality arndt et al 2003 besemer 2015 therefore we could get revolutionary insights into the microbial world by including the whole microbial web in this regard risse buhl et al 2017 has done pioneering work to address the interaction between near bed turbulence mean flow ū and biofilm composition architecture as well as trophic structure in mountainous stream ecosystems in this study the abundance of filamentous autotrophs increased with near bed turbulent kinetic energy tke which most likely offered shelter to bacteria that remained unaffected in numbers by the increasing flow velocities bacteria further benefited from a reduced grazing pressure at faster flowing more turbulent sites since the abundance of heterotrophic protists decreased with flow results by risse buhl et al 2017 suggested that near bed flow might impact the magnitude and direction of matter fluxes through shifts in the microbial food web thereby possibly affecting ecosystem functioning 4 3 microbial taxonomy by microscope and molecular techniques insights into the microbial community composition have been traditionally gained my microscopic evaluation of morphological taxonomically unique features clark et al 2018 this classical approach is for instance common for the determination of diatom species that by their appearance and certain requirements are excellent indicators of different water qualities or various hydrodynamics scenarios graba et al 2013 reported that epilithic biofilms at smooth flow grew much thicker developed thicker filaments and accommodated multicellular growth forms of diatoms while biofilm at rough conditions were more compact hosting smaller mobile and unicellular diatoms this seems to confirm the progression of climax populations at low flow velocities that are subject to minor changes but undergo c selection competition in terms of resources such as nutrients in contrast pioneer species dominate at high flow velocities where resources are available but environmental forcing is strong to experience r selection ruderal strategy to be adapted to disturbed habitats biggs et al 1998 while these insights are very valuable on the microalgae level addressing the occurrence of certain bacterial species requires metagenomics approaches nowadays it has become possible to decipher the previously unprecedented diversity of biofilms using high throughput technologies referring to next generation sequencing ngs in terms of community composition results of our pilot experiment of prokaryotic 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna and eukaryotic 18s rrna suggest varying responses of the prokaryotic bacterial and micro eukaryotic higher cells species species diversity number of species and number of individuals per species was significantly higher at high flow condition 0 04 pa for the bacterial community while microalgal species flourished at the low flow 0 01 pa additionally bacterial species that are filamentous or well known to have eps coding genes were more dominant at the mentioned high flow velocities fig 5 this indicates clear shifts of the bacterial community as a response to the hydraulic regime few studies took it even further to the level of gene expression in order to reveal microbial responses to mechanical stress by shear flow but this is so far restricted to the single cell level persat et al 2015 thomen et al 2017 4 4 mass transfer towards out of and within the biofilm the above briefly discussed biofilm architecture eps quantity biomass and community composition is decisive for the mass transfer towards and within the biofilm mass transfer has implications for both the resupply of nutrients and the removal of waste products as stated earlier and is largely influenced by the hydrodynamic features to follow the transport of dissolved molecules into and within the biofilm mainly microelectrodes have been used so far beyenal and babauta 2013 de beer et al 2018 sønderholm et al 2017 for instance vertical profiles of oxygen microelectrodes allowed the calculation of the dbbl thickness for oxygen depending on the flow conditions above as well as metabolic activity photosynthesis respiration and the resulting penetration depth and micro niches within a biofilm or biofilm inhabited sediment de beer et al 1994b gerbersdorf et al 2004 jorgensen and revsbech 1985 using oxygen microelectrodes in our pilot experiment vertical profiles of oxygen concentration at the water biofilm sediment interface were recorded in the transition from light to dark fig 6 a while oxygen peaks and concentrations within the first 5 mm of depth were clearly decreasing over darkness the oxygen concentration below the photic zone never decreased to zero indicating some advection based on the calculated photosynthetic and respiration rates it could be stated that the metabolic activity was quite low in our system as compared to e g studies from intertidal flats de beer et al 2005 microbial mats nübel et al 2002 and alkaline lakes wieland and kühl 2000 the wide range of habitats tested proves the unbroken popularity of microsensors to determine physiological responses and essential functions of biofilms at high spatial and temporal resolution some investigations took it even one step further to address flow pattern in situ within cell clusters or voids of single cell or multi species bacterial biofilm by tracking the movement of microscopic fluorescent particles with the help of confocal microscopy de beer et al 1994a thomen et al 2017 other studies directly determined local mass transfer coefficients applying modified limiting current techniques lct within the biofilm yang and lewandowski 1995 as a result the non uniformity of local mass transfer processes within biofilms became apparent by their large fluctuations that were explained by irregularities in biofilm microstructures comprising channels voids and cell clusters while diffusion was prevailing in cell clusters liquid flow convection and diffusion occurred within the biofilm voids de beer et al 1994b 1994a yang and lewandowski 1995 moreover the flux from the bulk water into the biofilm was enhanced by the elevated biofilm structure being twice as high as compared to a planar surface de beer et al 1994b with these valuable insights that can be gained at high spatial resolutions it is not surprising that microsensor studies have skyrocketed in the last decades right now mass transfer and local conversion rates of various molecules e g n2o h2s no3 no2 can be determined by a large range of sensors to calculate the distribution of a suite of metabolic activities de beer 2011 to give just one example one of the more recent developments the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 microsensor was applied in our pilot experiment while photosynthesis produces h2o2 as damaging by product it is usually scavenged by catalase to avoid cell damage however bursts of h2o2 up to 100 200 µm were observed when the sensor tip touched a diatom colony most likely a defense mechanism of these microalgae against predators that has not been noticed before fig 6b again this allows novel information on prey predator relation and resulting functions at microscale level in order to move on from the fragile micrometer sized glass electrodes towards more robust sensors macroelectrodes with sensing tips in centimetre range were developed and the simultaneous determination of molecules in two dimensional arrays by optodes was pursued glud et al 2000 these optodes based on luminescence quenching are superior to electrochemical sensors in many ways such as obstruction of the local flow field hysteresis or cross sensitivity kautsky 1939 tengberg et al 2006 still there are new challenges associated like response time drift long term stability in organic rich environments and data processing bittig et al 2018 glud et al 1994 tengberg et al 2006 nowadays both types electrochemical and luminescent based microsensors are pushed manifold however to particularly address biofilm flow interaction is still rare glud et al 1998 kühl et al 2007 but has unbowed potential to unravel links between morphology and functionality of biofilms 5 mechanical stability of biofilm and its inhabited environment as one essential ecosystem function 5 1 biofilm functions for its inhabitants and for the ecosystem as opposed to a single planktonic lifestyle the biofilm offers high survival persistence and reproduction potential to the embedded microbes flemming and wuertz 2019 on one hand there is co metabolism and an enhanced availability of essential resources resulting in significantly higher metabolic activity this has attracted extensive attention since it links to the important microbial ecosystem functions such as biodegradation self purification or drinking water provision see introduction and the references therein on the other hand protection from environmental stressors is a key factor for biofilm members the eps matrix controls material fluxes largely by its internal porosity and permeability that determine fluid flow conduits and their connectivity flemming et al 2016 since slow diffusion processes prevail and adsorption occurs toxicants such as antibiotics or disinfectants may be intercepted in the outer layers of a biofilm which also represents a huge problem in medical treatment bjarnsholt et al 2011 all of that is possible by the cohesive and adhesive forces binding microbes to each other as well as to their substratum and conferring their overall mechanical and structural integrity that is largely impacted by the predominant flow conditions thanks to this stability biofilm eventually colonizes all kinds of interfaces whether unintentionally e g biofouling in pipes and on ship hulls or encouraged e g in waste water treatment on membranes therefore understanding mechanical properties of aquatic biofilms and biostabilization potential of biofilm bound sediment have important implications not limited to aquatic ecosystems 5 2 the challenges with biofilm induced mechanical stability characterizing the mechanical stability of biofilm and biofilm enclosed environments is thus of broad and significant concern but remains a challenging task despite a body of work part of the problem is that traditionally it was attempted to remove biological effects while nowadays biology is often brought to the laboratory with little consideration of natural settings paterson et al 2018 in this regard laboratory grown biofilm are often based on distinct microbial strains growing at conditions that are difficult to compare and often lack natural relevance e g single species biofilm and nutrient supply that do not occur in natural rivers vignaga et al 2012 when testing for the biostabilization effect in the laboratory a range of engineering devices are applied that act at different size scales while addressing different forces e g vertical jets versus horizontal bed shear stress vardy et al 2007 widdows et al 2007 moreover examination of erosion thresholds are more complicated in biofilm embedded sediments since they behave very differently compared to the traditionally used abiotic particle size fractions e g they erode in aggregates and chunks rather than in single grain mode thom et al 2015 last but not least investigating development of biofilm over time requires non destructive methods but most approaches require bed failure to occur jonsson et al 2006 overall flow microbe interactions and implications for mechanical stability of biofilm have received special attention since this process understanding might help to control eradicating harmful or encouraging beneficial biofilm by optimizing cleaning procedures e g in drinking water pipes or improving operational parameters e g in rotating biological contactors in the following we will present a brief selection of such studies focusing on the mechanical strength of a biofilm in relation to flow from single cell level to bulk biofilm measurements in the range from several millimeters to several centimeters wagner et al 2010b 5 3 single cell approaches to determine adhesive forces atomic force microscopy afm has been widely used to determine the elasticity and adhesive capacity of single bacterial or microalgal cells linking the results to different cell surface biomolecules with implications to the initial stages of biofilm colonization wright et al 2010 the afm technique can be applied in a static or dynamic mode measures in the range from piconewtons to several nanonewtons and allows 3d mapping of surfaces within a limited area boudarel et al 2018 since the technique has been widely used to study initial attachment only few studies relate to reciprocal microbe flow interactions that become most interesting in later stages of biofilm development lim et al 2008 gave proof of the positive relation between morphological parameters such as surface coverage and roughness as well as flow rate in biofilms growing on glass beads within microfluidic cells to shed light on the internal structure of biofilm passive particle tracking microrheology ptm or active optical tweezer ot and magnetic tweezer mt techniques have been successfully implemented see reviews by ahmad khalili and ahmad 2015 azeredo et al 2017 these approaches allow the determination of spatially and temporally varying adhesive strength as well as the quantification of shear stresses required for detachment while operating in the sub piconewton pn to several hundreds of pn 1 pn range castelain et al 2012 picioreanu et al 2018 using mt as a more robust approach for actively moving cells galy et al 2014 developed a 3d map of mechanical biofilm properties and demonstrated decreasing elastic compliance in e coli biofilms being exposed to increasing shear stress this research provided valuable insights of the heterogeneity of biofilm showing variations in shear compliance in the order of two magnitudes within close proximity galy et al 2014 again at microscale microfluidics are an integral part in the study on mechanical properties of growing biofilms often combined with microscopy to monitor biofilm formation during growth and biofilm deformation due to applied stress such as pressurized air or flow see review by karimi et al 2015 hohne et al 2009 established such an approach to examine the young modulus and relaxation time of two bacterial strains while imaging their deflection due to varying air pressure with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm thomen et al 2017 pursued the growth of e coli to reveal the previously unknown bacterial strategy to settle in low shear stress regions before strategically expanding from these bases towards areas of high shear stress that were impossible to colonize before hou et al 2018 applied attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy as well as cslm to give evidence that the individual staphylococcos aureus bacterium produced two to five times more eps polysaccharides at high shear conditions as compared to low shear stress that also extended to the entire biofilm as was shown by tribometrically measured coefficients of friction cof confirming that eps quantity is considered relevant for mechanical strength hou et al 2018 5 4 structural visualization and mechanical strength at the mesoscale while the microscale is certainly very important to learn about activities and functions of biofilms at high resolution it remains difficult to extrapolate these insights to the dimensions of an entire biofilm mm cm range which is of greater interest if it comes to flow biofilm interaction and the resulting mechanical strength wagner and horn 2017 knowledge on mechanical strength is needed to re think anti biofouling measures to manage biofilm growth in technical systems such as bioreactors membranes or drinking water distribution pipes or simply to better understand the mode of action that is behind the effects recorded in biostabilization of sediments therefore other techniques such as optical coherence tomography oct or optical coherence elastography oce larin and sampson 2017 which has a more holistic view on biofilm structure could be explored oct allows to work on this mesoscale in micrometer resolution and represents a fast non invasive in situ imaging technique that gives depth resolved structural information which does not require staining thus employing near infrared light allows deeper penetration into the biofilm in comparison to clsm and does not need fluorophores that might interfere with local properties of the biofilm azeredo et al 2017 picioreanu et al 2018 however our own oct measurements in the pilot experiment suggest that while surface topography is easy to image it can be difficult to capture the internal structure as well as to differentiate between biofilm and sand particles still oct clearly visualized how the microbes filled the sand grain space with biofilm maturation fig 7 in young biofilms filaments were visible at the mentioned low flow conditions 0 01 pa while at high flow 0 04 pa the growth seems delayed again fig 7 this influence of various flow scenarios in the initial stages of biofilm growth is expected to manifest later in variations in thickness morphology as well as hydraulic resistance of the mature biofilm as has been revealed by other oct measurements dreszer et al 2014 exploring the usage of rotating disk electrodes rde boulêtreau et al 2011 confirmed varying riverine biofilm thickness and elasticity that both were significantly higher at low flow conditions 0 1 versus 0 45 m s 1 over 21 days in contrast to oct rde examines the biofilm as homogenous bulk material which is similar to the application of rheometers that are commonly used for studying viscoelastic material although being destructive boudarel et al 2018 biofilm comprises both an elastic or solid like and a viscous or liquid like part that stores and dissipates energy during strain deformation in our workshop we also tested viscoelastic properties of young and mature biofilms using a rotational rheometer conducting dynamic tests in the oscillatory mode of the rheometer in our pilot experiment documented clearly the viscoelastic behavior of the biofilms at varying stages of maturity beforehand some biofilm samples young biofilm were cultivated in situ on rheometer disks with the same substrate tested simultaneously with other devices while other samples mature biofilm were transferred later onto those disks at termination of the experiment due to the roughness of the substrate both sample preparation methods showed similar results even though the in situ growth has a clear advantage of ensuring an overall structural integrity the recorded phase angle highlighted the strong dependence of the viscoelastic properties on the maturity of the biofilm the results showed a low phase angle of tanδ 0 16 for the matured biofilm indicating less viscous and more elastic behavior while this value increased for the young biofilm to tanδ 0 28 fig 8 however no clear relation could be detected between the phase angle and the prevailing flow conditions although the margin of the phase angle has been slightly larger for biofilms exposed to lower flow conditions fig 8 for a more comprehensive interpretation however it is necessary to link the results on rheological properties to structural features e g streamers or flat biofilm and chemical composition polymer type in future studies then it would also be possible to structurally explain stronger adhesion and lower detachment rates at higher shear stresses as it has been previously observed by recording stress strain tests and creep compliance curves in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm samples stoodley et al 2002 5 5 erosion vulnerability and adhesive capacity in sediment research as we can see from sections 5 1 5 4 there exists promising studies highlighting mechanical properties of biofilm in interaction with the flow at various scales see also review by araújo et al 2019 however none of the research includes the substratum except for our presented oct fig 7 and rheometer measurements fig 8 where biofilm grew on fine sand this is of course different in sedimentation engineering where the erosive response of the substratum towards hydrodynamic forcing is central however biofilms were and sometimes still are neglected in this research field paterson et al 2018 righetti and lucarelli 2007 that changed some decades ago when it was increasingly recognized that biofilms are ubiquitously distributed and impact significantly the dynamics of the etdc erosion transport deposition consolidation sediment cycle black et al 2002 with the consensus on the importance of biostabilization the portfolio of methods to address sediment stability has broadened the classical approach in hydraulic research and engineering utilizes erosion flumes or chambers in which the flowing water eventually causes bed failure to occur aberle et al 2003 jonsson et al 2006 noack et al 2015 widdows et al 2007 with growing interest in the biology mediating the erosive response devices with smaller footprints capable for usage in the field were developed to pursue mechanical failure and sloughing off at higher temporal and spatial resolution vardy et al 2007 however to follow up gradual changes in the attachment and increasing cohesion of substratum by young biofilms non destructive methods with higher sensitivity were needed magnetic particle induction magpi system has been developed to determine the adhesive capacity of growing biofilm at the patch scale with a small footprint but large enough to get meaningful results on biofilm embedded sediment stability gerbersdorf et al 2018 larson et al 2009 using 50 particle clearance the magpi indicated significantly lower adhesiveness at low flow condition 834 59 ma as compared to high flow condition 1241 97 ma in our pilot experiment this is in line with the results of graba et al 2013 who performed a sloughing test on 40 day old biofilms and showed an inverse relation between the proportion of detached biomass and the average value of friction velocity during growth the higher stability might be related to enhanced secretion of extracellular polymeric substances at high shear stresses as stated earlier brading et al 1995 fish et al 2017 whether or not this translates into a higher biostabilization capacity of the biofilm within the sediment at high flow regimes is currently unknown gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 in our pilot experiment by investigating the erosion failure of the samples within the seteg flume noack et al 2015 the critical shear stress necessary to erode the biofilm sediment complex was 40 fold higher as compared to the bare sand fig 9 however there was no statistically significant difference between the two contrasting flow scenarios this might be explained by the growing mode of these samples where the biofilm covered the underlying substratum like a carpet erosion often occurred suddenly at the edges of our sample holders followed by a severe resuspension of the bare unprotected sediment beneath the biofilm carpet rather than indicating a true failure of the biofilm sediment surface see s1 and s2 for videos the starting position of the erosion at the edges of the cartridges can be attributed to a sudden change in surface roughness upstream and downstream of the measurement location hence while cultivating biofilms in special cartridges schmidt et al 2015 or coupons singer et al 2010 2006 facilitates in situ and easier measurements using a multitude of instruments it is critical for erosion tests to exclude unwanted effects of sudden roughness change it is further deemed advisable to adapt shield s like erosion schemes to biofilm embedded material shields 1936 thom et al 2015 6 the gaps in hydromechanics biofilm and sediment research and lessons to learn in biofilm research the single cell scale has been naturally favoured to decipher details on biofilm attachment quorum sensing morphology and or detachment kim et al 2016 mukherjee and bassler 2019 wheeler et al 2019 as we have reported above reciprocal flow biofilm interactions have been experimentally explored within micro fabricated channels that mostly range from micrometres to millimetres and analysed mainly by microsensors de beer et al 1994a yang and lewandowski 1995 and or imaging techniques for the latter thomen et al 2017 visualized the trail lengths of 1 µm fluorescent particles via microscopically derived z stack images in millifluidic channels magnetic resonance microscopy mrm is another promising method for the investigation of transport phenomena which is capable of simultaneously imaging the development of flow field and biofilm structure in a non invasive less time consuming way while covering quantitatively relevant areas gjersing et al 2005 manz et al 2005 2003 for instance wagner et al 2010a addressed the response of biofilm to various flow gradients and shear rates by scanning the flow field with mrm herrling et al 2017 successfully elucidated water diffusion within five different types of biofilm structures by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance pfg nmr as morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 stated a biofilm with a total area of 1 m2 is not simply the sum of biofilm grown in 1000 flow channels even though the total areas roughly correspond consequently in their study morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 went up to the patch scale to address the effect of laminar transient and fully turbulent conditions on biofilm in the range of several millimetres to centimetres collectively these experiments gave essential insights into detailed processes of biofilm development at various hydrodynamic settings however their relevance for aquatic environments is still largely debatable due to difficulties in reproducing natural conditions in the laboratory challenges include representing natural temporal and spatial variability of flow single cell scale to ecosystem scale and biofilm multitaxa and multispecies communities or generating fully developed turbulent flow conditions and irregular surfaces e g mixed sediments spatial heterogeneity of roughness at the measurement section ideally biofilm should be grown in a most natural like setting to allow a typical community composition and matrix structure at environmentally relevant flow patterns obviously this might differ severely in simulating technical or natural habitats but in both cases this requires experimental facilities that are beyond the small scale of the microfluidic channels despite increasing number of mesocosm studies our understanding of near bed flow dynamics is currently hampered by the lack of velocity measurements at the flow biofilm sediment interface e g nuy et al 2018 risse buhl et al 2017 while the interactions between flow and biofilm occur predominantly at mesoscale 100 µm to 10 cm in vertical length most studies concerning flow biofilm reciprocity usually represent flow with a single bulk value for the entire channel either as a depth averaged or cross sectional average velocity and discharge moulin and eiff 2012 and references therein or temporally averaged flow and turbulence parameters far above the bed risse buhl et al 2017 2020 singer et al 2010 ignoring the heterogenous characteristics of the flow at local biofilm scale µm to cm and its dispersive contribution to mass flux this can mainly be attributed to frequent use of acoustic based e g acoustic doppler velocimeter or adv or magnetic field based e g electromagnetic current meter or ecm instruments in both laboratory and field studies which have difficulties in measuring near bed mean flow 5 mm and turbulence 10 mm due to acoustic interference of the bed koca et al 2017 voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 and or sensor size on the other hand applying hot film anemometers biggs et al 1998 demonstrated clearly the influence that the biofilm has on the close by flow pattern 2 mm above its surface while there was no measurable effect to the far more uniform mean velocity of the mid water column hydrodynamic fluctuations with local shear stress peaks are critical to mass transfer stoodley et al 1999 voermans et al 2017 with important consequences for biofilm to modulate ecosystem health and services this is particularly important for biofilms with streamers which oscillate with the flow and modulate mass transfer nikora 2010 larned et al 2011 ultimately only local flow conditions are relevant to describe the forcing at microscale and are not easily inferred from mean bulk velocities graba et al 2013 the introduction of modern optical and non intrusive techniques such as particle image velocimetry piv allows high resolution measurements of flow patterns close to the biofilm 1 2 mm in standard configurations piv is based on visualization and computation of the displacement of small tracer particles in a flow captured by two subsequent images see reviews by adrian et al 2011 westerweel et al 2013 since it allows for both quantitative measurements at larger areas few dm2 and visualization of flow structures piv provides physical insights into the behavior of flow and biofilm interactions thereby offering various advantages over traditional methods i e adv ecm despite its costly and complicated setup low cost piv systems have recently been developed for use in the laboratory cierpka et al 2016 and in the field cameron et al 2013 koca et al unpublished results thus instead of following traditional single point or vertical profile measurements it is now possible and timely to characterize flow pattern near biofilm at high resolution koca et al 2016 nevertheless the challenge remains to measure this at sub millimeter scales in fully turbulent fully rough and fully developed environments which unavoidably must be performed in relatively large flow facilities on the several meter scale for a variety of controlled flow and environmental conditions packman 2013 vignaga et al 2013 indeed it would be desirable to describe scales small enough to include the viscous sublayer on the biofilm and grains while simultaneously capturing the full turbulent spectrum only then can the mechanisms behind biofilm growth as well as mass and momentum flux exchanges between biofilm and the water be elucidated research on flow sediment interaction has a long tradition in engineering science which is motivated inter alia by the huge economical aspect to maintain waterways and harbours for shipping as well as flood control measures voermans et al 2017 sediment dynamics from bedload such as rolling gravel to suspended load of fine particles is of uttermost importance for the hydrological geomorphological and ecological functioning of aquatic systems including rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and coastal zones forstner and westrich 2005 along with sediment properties the hydrodynamic regime is decisive for the transport deposition and finally spatial distribution of sediments hence fine grained particles such as silt and clay usually settle in low energetic habitat while coarser sediment deposit in areas of high energy impact where frequent collisions of sand particles rolling occur van rijn 1993 this in turn impacts the settlement of microbes with a higher likelihood to develop in fine sediments since these small particles feature a a high surface to volume ratio b offer plenty of binding sites to trap nutrients and c offer more protection for sensible shells such as diatom frustules that might be destroyed in rolling delgado et al 1991 gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 mediation of fine sediment characteristics by the developing microbial assemblages then changes their erosive response to hydraulic forcing as described in sections 1 and 5 5 while the onset of motion of non cohesive sediment particles such as sand or gravel is generally predicted by using the shields diagram shields 1936 there is no valid approach for fine cohesive sediment because of the biological features inhabited black et al 2002 in order to better predict the behavior of fine sediment and the often associated pollutants at extreme e g 100 year flood or management scenarios e g flushing experiments have been largely performed in laboratory flumes with sediments that were retrieved and transferred from the field forstner and salomons 2008 gerbersdorf et al 2007 haag et al 2001 however there are increasing efforts towards in situ measurements in order to avoid unwanted changes due to transport of sediment from field to flume and sediment aging aberle et al 2003 noack et al 2015 witt and westrich 2003 overall although fine sediments and their erosional behavior have thus received increasing attention over the last decades with or without the consideration of biofilm their link to the temporally and spatially highly varying pattern of hydrodynamics e g tke and bed topography co evolving with biofilm growth have not been studied yet gerbersdorf and wieprecht 2015 hannah et al 2004 rice et al 2010 on a much smaller scale some studies addressed the sloughing off phenomena of biofilm at varying shear stresses by measuring biofilm weight losses or the amount of eroded sand biofilm mixtures grün et al 2016 pique et al 2016 consequently future studies should further explore the flow biofilm sediment processes nexus in order to better understand biostabilization and sediment dynamics which have key implications for morphodynamics aquatic habitat water quality and beyond this requires integrated investigations of hydrodynamics biogeomorphology and microbiology an example of such integrated approach was illustrated in this review paper combined with a pilot experiment based on the co application of state of the art methods from different disciplines black font in fig 1 on quasi naturally grown biofilm bound sediment developed at contrasting flow conditions we have made following observations about advantages and challenges associated with the tested methods flow affected time of settlement growth direction and subsequent topography of biofilm bound sediment fig 2 in turn the biofilm growth increased considerably the magnitude and heterogeneity of reynolds shear stress not shown here while the measurements of spatially and temporally varying flow in combination with motion of streamers are still challenging piv may become a key method in studying natural flow biofilm interactions at high resolution obtaining topography by scanning microscopy fig 2a b was far too time consuming for larger areas instead laser triangulation system showed similar results fig 2c in a fraction of the time previously needed and is thus an excellent choice for characterizing topography at patch scale cm2 dm2 microscopy is needed for higher resolutions at spatially limited spots in order to e g visualize key components of the biofilm members and eps moieties by fluorescence signals with application of microsensors we have observed bursts of h2o2 when touching a diatom colony suggesting a likely defense mechanism of these microalgae against predators therefore using microsensors one can also gain insights into how microbes cope with friendly and unfriendly neighbours in their close surrounding fig 6 microsensor measurements could be used together with piv measurements and oct images for analyzing the external and internal mass as well as momentum transfer by combining substrate distribution flow dynamics and biofilm structure even though it is not tested here the application of mrm holds promise for studying internal and external diffusion and flow patterns oct is a beneficial imaging technique for characterizing internal structure of biofilm without disturbing or damaging the samples however since the probe depth is limited it remains to be tested how suitable this technique is for analyzing biofilm embedded sediment over depths larger than 2 mm fig 7 performing biochemical and microbiological analyses it was observed that quantities of polymeric substances and cell numbers play a minor role in explaining the mechanisms of binding within the biofilm and beyond fig 3 suggesting the significant role of various eps moieties and key microbial players to translate into functionality herein biostabilization applying molecular techniques we have observed significant shifts in species composition and diversity at both prokaryotic and eukaryotic levels according to temporal and environmental changes fig 5 the link between functionality and diversity of key players is a matter of an ongoing debate in ecology besemer 2015 dang and lovell 2016 leibold et al 2004 to introduce this idea into biofilm science would be a great research concept for hypothesis building microalgae seem to play a dominant role in biostabilizing the sediment with impact according to the particular groups or species involved thus the possibility to monitor by hyperspectral imaging the density composition and distribution of phototrophic biofilms fig 4 creates a strong predictor for metabolic activity and sediment stability while the magnetic particle induction technique is highly sensitive for measuring adhesiveness of biofilm bound sediment at high temporal and spatial resolution 5 mm not shown here it is restricted to measurements at the sediment surface furthermore measurements are challenging if streamers are abundant until now determination of the stability of deeper layers has been limited to erosion flumes with the known methodological limitations fig 9 like with the erosion flumes the rheometer approach does not allow ongoing measurements for the same sample over time but could structurally explain varying adhesiveness and detachment rates of biofilm at different environmental scenarios fig 8 7 conclusions recent advances in measurement techniques have provided a wealth of knowledge regarding individual domains of biofilm research yet the understanding of flow biofilm sediment processes is still at its infancy studying flow biofilm sediment interactions are of importance to better understand ecological functions and engineering processes and to help establish healthy aquatic ecosystems most of the insights on the sediment ecology relation derive from investigations on macroorganisms and macrophytes this is surprising since microbes are the first colonizers to dictate subsequent colonization by higher trophic levels and they e g predominately affect the flux of matter on larger scales moreover the link to the substratum in which microorganisms settle is mostly missing therefore integrative and interdisciplinary approaches are needed that simultaneously and equally address the complex and non linear ways in which sediment properties and biofilm interact with the hydrodynamics at a scale of µm to cm single cell and patch scale before extrapolating the theoretical knowledge to the larger scales for environmental management purposes while field studies are essential process understanding comes from controllable and repeatable conditions addressed in laboratory experiments which should cross disciplinary boundaries to avoid oversimplification and unrealistic settings e g use of isolated species inappropriate physical conditions unconsidered wall effects or short test sections in this review we summarized the current state of the knowledge and methodological approaches in the flow biofilm sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments specifically we combined a literature review with the results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop with the aims of i consolidating expert knowledge from different scientific fields but all with the same goal directed towards flow biofilm sediment triangle ii identifying knowledge gaps and iii exploring the feasibility of different instruments to address these gaps in the pilot experiment co application of advanced methods with capabilities to visualize at cell patch and reach scales at high spatial resolution in controllable laboratory conditions has

17606,correcting the systematic bias and quantifying uncertainty associated with the operational water quality forecasts are imperative works for risk based environmental decision making this work proposes a post processing method for addressing both bias correction and total uncertainty quantification for daily forecasts of water quality parameters derived from dynamical lake models the post processing is implemented based on a bayesian joint probability bjp modeling approach the bjp model uses a log sinh transformation to normalize the raw forecasts and corresponding observations and uses a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship the posterior distribution of the transformation parameters is inferenced through metropolis monte carlo markov chain sampling it generates unbiased probabilistic forecasts that account for uncertainties from all sources the bjp is used to post processing raw daily forecasts of dissolved oxygen do ammonium nitrogen nh total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations of lake chaohu the fifth largest lake in china with lead times from 0 to 5 days results suggest that an average 93 1 forecast bias has been removed by bjp the root mean square error in probability skill scores range from 5 8 for nh to 68 2 for tp and the non parametric bootstrapping test suggests that 67 7 forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites water quality parameters and lead times the probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies and have appropriate spread and thus correctly quantify forecast uncertainty the bjp post processing method used in this study can be a useful operational tool that help to better realize the potential of water quality forecasts derived from dynamical models graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality forecasts bias correction uncertainty quantification lake chaohu bayesian joint probability modeling approach 1 introduction accurate forecasts of water quality parameters with reliable uncertainty quantification of large lakes for the coming several days have a wide range of applications such forecasts can improve the security and effectiveness of drinking water supplies public health protection irrigation plans making fisheries human settlements and tourism informative water quality forecasts offer advanced warning of extreme conditions and thus allow water managers to make correct operational water management decisions and assess the risks of water management strategies sadeghian et al 2018 lusic et al 2017 thoe et al 2014 processes based dynamical models are the main tools for short term water quality forecasts for water bodies such as rivers lakes estuaries and oceans vinçon leite and casenave 2019 bedri et al 2014 chan et al 2013 dynamical forecast models are based on the laws of physics which allow them to capture the complex nonlinear interactions of hydrodynamics and nutrient transport and cycling as well as chemical and biological processes in lakes they are adaptable to shifts in a lake ecosystem caused by anthropogenic activities or climate changes moreover dynamical forecast models also provide spatially and temporally coherent forecasts of multiple water quality and ecological variables at multiple temporal resolutions despite the great improvement of dynamical lake models achieved during the last decades in terms of model mechanisms data input and computational efficiency garcia et al 2019 jørgensen s e 2010 forecasts derived from these numerical models still suffer from many formidable shortcomings which restricted their usefulness and effectiveness to real resources management and decision making on one hand forecasts of water quality parameters from dynamical models always suffer from considerable bias the reasons for such bias include systematic model errors caused by imperfect conceptualization coarse temporal and spatial model resolutions which are not able to capture fine scale processes etc teutschbein and seibert 2012 to make a useful short term forecast it is necessary to run calibration algorithms to correct these systematic errors before the forecast can be used by water managers in this direction many simple statistical calibration methods such as additive bias correction multiplicative bias correction and quantile mapping are used for directly post processing daily water quality forecasts these simple methods seems to be adequate in correcting forecast bias zhao et al 2017 on the other hand because the deterministic forecasts generated by dynamical models with insufficient consideration to the uncertainty associated with them there is increasing concern that these forecasts being used may lead to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient management strategies tscheikner gratl et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 uncertainties in water quality forecasts mainly stem from measurement errors of initial conditions boundary conditions and the forcing functions as well as imperfect model structure and parameterization novic et al 2018 lu et al 2012 quantifying uncertainty associated with water quality forecasts is imperative for risk based environmental decision making chaudhary and hantush 2017 skeffington et al 2015 uncertainty estimation of dynamical models has received considerable attention in aquatic ecosystem research and there have been many attempts to rigorously address issues pertaining to input error model structure and parameter selection in this direction the bayesian theory based methods have been increasingly applied to study uncertainties in water quality modeling over the past decades zhao et al 2014 the most popular methods include bayesian monte carlo and maximum likelihood approaches chaudhary and hantush 2017 freni and mannina 2010 bayesian classifiers and machine learning algorithms marcota and penman 2019 and bayesian based hybrid ensemble and variational data assimilation framework abbaszadeh et al 2019 amongst others recently han and zheng 2018 developed an bayesian analysis of input and parametric uncertainties approach for the joint analysis of input and parameter uncertainties of watershed water quality models xia et al 2016 used bayesian hierarchical methods to quantify uncertainties in model structure parameters in export coefficient models used to predict nitrate concentration in streams hantush and chaudhary 2014 presented an bayesian monte carlo simulation and maximum likelihood estimation method to calibrate and estimate uncertainties of water quality model parameters the bayesian methodologies offers several technical advances such as alleviation of the identification problem produce more comprehensive statistical inferences and have fewer restrictive assumptions and realistic uncertainty estimates of ecological predictions that can be particularly useful for environmental management chaudhary and hantush 2017 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 for operational lake water quality forecasts however because of the high dimensionality of both the input and parameter spaces of lake model along with the nonlinearity of the complex hydrodynamic and biochemical processes in lakes conventional bayesian methods that deal with uncertainties propagated throughout the whole forecast duration in a rigorous way may suffer from significant computational challenge not only due to the evaluation of a computationally intensive numerical model in each iteration of the posterior distribution formulation but also because difficulties arise from exploring the high dimensional space of the large scale model input and parameters which can greatly hamper the timelessness and effectiveness of a real time forecast zhao et al 2014 cui et al 2011 on the other hand modern lakes always provide multiple ecosystem functions anthropogenic activities such as operation of hydraulic infrastructures and lake restoration projects as well as water transports fisheries tourism and recreation may cause considerable unforeseen and additional uncertainties to the evolution of lake water quality tscheikner gratl et al 2019 freni and mannina 2010 therefore methods addressing uncertainties from the input data parameter and model structure may underestimate the complexity of large lake systems and thus underestimate the total uncertainties in operational water quality forecasts a highly feasible solution to bridge this gap for real time operational water quality forecasts is by running post processing methods that account for all aspects of uncertainty through subjective assessment of the probability of occurrence of a future event conditional upon all knowledge available up to the present and the information that can be acquired through a learning inferential process tscheikner gratl et al 2019 however finding a method to this regard is still a major challenge in the research field of operational water quality forecasts for lakes in recent studies by schepen et al 2018 and zhao et al 2015 a bayesian joint probability bjp modeling approach was used to post process monthly cgcm rainfall totals across australia and deterministic streamflow forecasts of three gorges reservoir in china the main advantage of the bjp modelling approach is that it provides a highly flexible probability model with relatively few parameters robertson et al 2013 it uses a log sinh transformation to normalize predictor and predictand data and uses a bi variate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship between them zhao et al 2015 the parameters of the transformation and the distribution are estimated through bayesian inference with a monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithm the bjp model produces probabilistic distribution of predictands to represent forecast uncertainty from raw deterministic forecasts the aim of this study is to extend the approach of schepen et al 2018 and zhao et al 2015 we propose a post processing method based on bjp to concurrently correcting systematic bias and quantifying uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts for lakes the specific objectives of our study is to assess the effectiveness of the bjp in correcting systematic bias in the raw numerical forecasts the skill of calibrated forecasts compared to the raw forecasts and reliability and sharpness of the probability distribution section 2 of this paper describes the study area and data sources section 3 describes forecast and post processing methodologies multiple metrics used to evaluate forecast performance are also presented there section 4 provides results and sec 5 provides discussion of forecast skill section 6 gives a summary and conclusions 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area in this study we focus on lake chaohu in the lower yangtze river basin this lake occupies an area of about 778 km2 and is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china in addition to being the unique drinking water source to more than one million people in surrounding urban and rural regions lake chaohu provides important ecosystem functions such as flood regulation water transport fisheries tourism and recreation lake chaohu is a shallow lake with an average depth of 2 69 m the catchment fig 1 has a total area of 13 486 km2 its landscape is primarily plains and low mountains with elevations ranging from 8 m to 1493 m the catchment is characterised by sub tropical monsoon climate resulting in high rainfall in summer and much less rainfall in winter mean annual rainfall and evaporation are 1025 9 mm and 818 7 mm respectively and monthly average temperatures vary from 3 5 c in january to 29 0 c in july with annul average temperature of 16 1 c there are 12 major tributaries draining directly into lake chaohu most of which are concentrated in the western part of the lake yuxi river on the east of the lake is the only outflowing river it connects the lake to the yangtze river during the past two to three decades because of rapid economic development and urbanization together with agricultural diffuse pollution in the lake chaohu catchment most feed in tributaries of the lake are seriously polluted especially the tributaries flowing through hefei city resulting in the deterioration of water quality and the eutrophication of the lake therefore establishing an effective forecast framework to provide informative water quality forecasts has become an emergency task for local government who have the responsibility of the drinking water supply security and safety 2 2 data sources water quality data of lake chaohu and its tributaries are provided by the administration bureau of lake chaohu ablc for the year of 2017 2018 there are 12 sampling sites for the lake and 12 sites for the main tributaries respectively the sampling frequency for the lake ranges from one to seven days from april to november and once a month for the rest months of the year with a total of 145 samples on different days during the period 2017 2018 for each site the sampling frequency for the tributaries is once a month fourteen monitoring variables are available for both the lake and tributaries including water temperature ph do tn tp and nh concentrations mg l water quality parameters exhibit obvious seasonal fluctuations in lake chaohu as is shown in fig 2 both tn and do concentrations are much higher in winter than in summer but tp shows a converse pattern another feature in fig 2 is that water quality in the eastern central lake basin is much better than the western basin for example the nh tp and tn concentrations for the sites located in western basin sites1 to site5 are much higher than other sampling sites reflecting that most of the nutrient load of the lake is from the heavily polluted tributaries that enter at the western end of the lake real time hydrological data are sourced from the hefei bureau of hydrology hbh observation variables include hourly mean flows m3 s at taoxi station and releases m3 s from the chaohu and zhaohe sluices hourly water levels from four stations in the lake and daily rainfall totals from 51 rainfall gauges distributed uniformly across the whole lake chaohu catchment real time hourly meteorological data at six stations in lake chaohu catchment are obtained from the website of china national meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn monitoring variables includes hourly rainfall total mm average air temperature c at 2 m above the surface wind speed m s and direction at 10 m above the surface real time solar radiation data are downloaded online from three automatic meteorological stations installed onto different locations of the lake real time meteorological forecasts for six stations are derived from the official forecasting website of the national meteorological center nmc of china http www nmc cn several forecast variables are available for the next seven days at a 3 h resolution including air temperature rainfall wind speed and wind direction relative humidity and cloud cover these forecasts are updated at a frequency of 3 h from 2 00 lt local time to 23 00 lt monitoring sites for water quality hydrological and meteorological variables can be found in fig 1 3 methods 3 1 daily water quality forecasts using dynamical ecological model 3 1 1 coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model the ecolake model was used to configure a forecast framework for forecasting daily water quality variables of lake chaohu peng et al 2019a ecolake was originally developed in the 1990s it is a coupled three dimensional and nonlinear ecological model that simulates and forecasts the evolution of lake ecosystem variables under different environmental conditions ecolake model consists of three main modules the first one is a relatively independent hydrodynamics module it uses a free surface and terrain following vertical coordinate system scaled on the water column depth to reflect the dynamics of water level lake current and wave the second is a food chain network module state variables include fish zooplankton organic detritus algae and aquatic macrophytes the third is the material transform and transport module state variables include do nitrogen and phosphorus elements etc ecolake model has been validated by long term field observations peng et al 2019a han and hu 2012 and was successfully adapted for assessing the impacts of the yangtze river water transfer project on the restoration of lake taihu hu et al 2008 forecasting the short term algal bloom of lake taihu zhang et al 2013 computing the self purification capacity of lake taihu han et al 2015 and simulating water quality responses to multiple restoration scenarios of lake yangchenghu wang et al 2018 detailed descriptions of the model can be found in hu et al 1998 2006 2011 hu and qin 2002 3 1 2 model setup and forecasts generation the ecolake model configured for lake chaohu has five vertical sigma levels and a uniform horizontal grid cell of 250 m 250 m with a time step of 10 s the initial conditions of the model such as hydrodynamic nutrient and biologic variables are interpolated over each of the grid cells covering the lake using the most recently observed water quality data through inverse distance weighting method the ecolake model is forced by a range of meteorological hydrological and nutrient concentration functions daily forcing functions include lake surface rainfall and evaporation air temperature inflows outflows and nutrient concentrations of the tributaries hourly forcing functions include wind speed wind direction and solar radiation the forcing functions during the model spin up period are processed using observational data most of the meteorological forcing functions during the forecast period can be obtained readily from the cmdc certain forcing functions such as solar radiation and daily inflows cannot be obtained readily thus we established a regression model and a water balance based model to calculate this variables peng et al 2019b in an earlier paper by peng et al 2019a we calibrated the ecolake model parameter using observations obtained in 2016 for lake chaohu calibration results suggested that relative error statistics of the model accuracy in simulating water quality parameters include tn tp do and nh ranges between 0 10 and 0 39 indicating that model accuracy meets the general guidance criteria published in usepa 1990 real time forecasts of water quality parameters for lake chaohu are generated at a frequency of about once three days from the period 2017 to 2018 the forecasts are initialized at about 9 00 lt on each forecasting day daily forecasts of water quality parameters such as do nh tn and tp for current day and the coming five days at lead times from 0 to 5 days can be generated at about 11 00 lt a total of 216 sets of real time forecasts are generated on different days over the period 2017 to 2018 3 2 statistical calibration using bjp 3 2 1 formulation of calibration models with bjp we employ the bayesian joint probability modeling approach bjp wang et al 2009 wang and robertson 2011 to calibrate the raw water quality forecasts derived from the above mentioned forecast framework we focus on the four most important water quality parameters of lake chaohu namely do nh tp and tn bjp was originally designed for forecasting seasonal streamflow totals and was later successfully adapted for forecasting monthly and seasonal precipitation hawthorne et al 2013 peng et al 2014a post processing daily monthly and sub seasonal to seasonal rainfall forecasts from global climate models peng et al 2014b shrestha et al 2015 bennett et al 2016 schepen et al 2018 and calibration and quantifying predictive uncertainty of streamflow forecasts zhao et al 2015 the bjp models are based on a joint probability distribution of a predictor x and a predictand y when used for calibrating daily water quality forecasts in our study the predictors are raw forecasts from the dynamical ecolake model and predictands are daily concentrations of do nh tp and tn the joint probability distribution is assumed to be bivariate normal after transformations of the predictor and predictand variables by using a log sinh transformation wang et al 2012 1 x 1 β x ln sinh α x β x x y 1 β y ln sinh α y β y y where x ˆ and y ˆ are transformed variables of x and y α x β x α y and β y are transformation parameters the log sinh bivariate normal transformation provides a simple structure and have considerable flexibility to model the intrinsic correlations between the raw forecasts and observations furthermore it is considered more suitable for variables that are positively skewed with a zero bound such as water quality parameters including do nh tn and tp in our cases the transformed variables are assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution 2 x y n μ x μ y σ x 2 ρ x y σ x σ y ρ x y σ x σ y σ y 2 where μ x and μ y are the means of the transformed variables x ˆ and y ˆ respectively σ x and σ y are standard deviations ρ x y is the correlation coefficient between x ˆ and y ˆ both the marginal distribution and the conditional distribution of the joint distribution are normal ρ x y defines the strength of relationship between the raw forecasts and corresponding observations when ρ x y is zero the conditional distribution of y ˆ for returns to the marginal distribution of y ˆ zhao et al 2019 more information on the formulation of bjp models can be found in wang and robertson 2011 and wang et al 2009 3 2 2 bayesian inference of model paremeters the set of bjp model parameters θ is comprised of nine transformation parameters namely α x β x α y β y μ x μ y σ x σ y and ρ x y respectively these model parameters need to be inferred before the model can be used for calibration of real time water quality forecasts however the posterior distribution of the parameters is nonstandard and does not allow analytical integration thus we considered to obtain the numerical solutions by using the bayesian method which defines the conditional joint posterior probability distribution function of the parameters specifically we obtain the transformation parameters using the maximum a posteriori probability map estimation and sample the parameters of the joint distribution with a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling based on a metropolis algorithm by using historical data from 2017 to 2018 the mcmc sampling is a well developed and widely applied technique e g krueger 2017 xia et al 2016 obenour et al 2014 cui et al 2011 but its implementation may vary considerably in specifics wang and robertson 2011 serval aspects of the mcmc sampling implemented in this study are noted here firstly in our bayesian inference of the model parameters a prior that assuming parameters is inversely proportional to the standard deviation σ is specified wang et al 2012 secondly we draw a sample of 1000 sets of parameter values that numerically represent the joint posterior distribution of the parameters thirdly mcmc sampling also requires the use of a proposal distribution for generating random jumps in the parameter space the multivariate normal distribution is adopted in this study wang et al 2011 in this study bjp calibration models are set up independently for each of the four water quality parameters 12 sampling sites and six lead times for operational forecasts the set of model parameters θ can be inferenced in advance using all available historical raw forecasts and observations for example when the bjp is implemented for do at sampling site 1 and at a lead time of 1 day all historical forecast and observation pairs of do at site 1 with a lead time of 1 day is used to infer the bjp model parameters once a new raw forecast x ˆ is generated from ecolake model a forecasting problem is stated as getting the conditional distribution of y ˆ given the raw forecast x ˆ and inferred model parameter θ shrestha et al 2015 the conditional distribution of y ˆ is given by 3 f y x θ n μ y ρ x y σ y x μ x σ x σ y 2 1 ρ x y 2 an inverse of the log sinh transformation as is shown in eq 1 is then applied to give the forecast values y in untransformed space 4 y 1 β x arcsin h exp β x y α y probabilistic forecasts of water quality parameters at lead times from 0 to 5 days can be generated by sampling using eqs 3 and 4 it should be note that due to the sparse water quality monitoring the historical raw forecast and observation pairs fed into bjp models are not of the same length for different parameters and lead times 3 3 methods for validation 3 3 1 forecast cross validation validation is performed for both the raw and calibrated forecasts generated over the period 2017 2018 the performance of the calibration method is evaluated using a leave one out cross validation procedure the procedure is implemented by inferring parameters of the bjp model using all raw forecasts with the exception of the forecast being validated for example assuming that we have the archive of the historical forecast dataset f 1 f 2 f n and corresponding observations o 1 o 2 o n to validate the bjp model performance in calibrating the raw forecast f 1 we first use the sub datasets f 2 f n and o 2 o n to infer the bjp model parameters then we feed the raw forecast f 1 and the inferenced parameter into bjp to generate a calibrated forecast of f 1 this procedure is used to ensure that the forecast is being verified against data independent of data used for model parameter inference this procedure is repeated for each of other raw forecasts and the calibrated forecasts f 1 f 2 f n can be generated and then are compared to corresponding observations to validate the bjp model performance it should be note that the cross validation procedure used here is solely for evaluate the bjp model performance for operational applications however all available historical forecasts and corresponding observations can be used to infer the bjp model parameters 3 3 2 forecast bias the bias of the raw and calibrated forecasts is evaluated for each water quality parameter sampling site and lead time individually bias is defined as the average difference between the forecasts and corresponding observations 5 bias 1 t t 1 t y t y o b s t where y t is the raw forecast or ensemble mean of the calibrated forecast for event t t 1 2 t and y o b s t is corresponding observation 3 3 3 forecast accuracy and skill scores two verification metrics are used to evaluate the forecast accuracy the root mean square error in probability rmsep and the continuous ranked probability score crps both are well established metrics to describe probabilistic distribution errors in forecasts related to observations rmsep compares the forecast medians against observed values in probability space wang and robertson 2011 while crps evaluates the distance between the forecast probability distribution and the observation hersbach 2000 note that crps of the raw deterministic forecasts is equivalent to the mean absolute error zhao et al 2015 we then calculate the rmsep and crps based skill scores by comparing the rmsep and crps values calculated for the calibrated forecasts to the raw forecasts for example the rmsep based skill score is calculated as 6 r m s e p s s 1 r m s e p c a l i r m s e p r a w 100 the skill scores measure the improvement over the raw forecasts a skill score of 100 is attained when perfect forecasts are achieved whereas a skill score of 0 indicates that the forecasts have no improvement over the raw forecasts and are thus considered to have no skill a negative skill score means the forecasts are inferior to the raw forecasts 3 3 4 forecast reliability and sharpness for probabilistic forecasts to be informative they must be accurate as well as reliable forecast reliability describes the ability of the ensemble spread to accurately represent the predictive uncertainty zhao et al 2017 we use attribute diagrams hsu and murphy 1986 to evaluate the overall forecast reliability for each of the six lead times attribute diagram plots the probability of threshold forecasts against the relative frequencies of such events in the observation space forecasts are considered reliable if the forecast probabilities are consistent with the observed relative frequencies forecast sharpness can also be presented in the attribute diagrams which is the tendency for forecasts to move away from normal concentration levels forecasts that assign very high or low probabilities e g 90 or 10 to events can be deemed as sharp forecasts which are generally desirable as they are more certain forecasts however sharpness at the expense of reliability will result in overconfident and thereby misleading forecasts alongside the overall reliability evaluation we also evaluate the reliability of the forecast probability distributions for the 12 individual sampling sites by using the pit probability integral transform uniform probability plots in which the pit values are plotted against a standard uniform variate to test for departures from the dual hypotheses of independence and uniformity with departures from uniformity tested using the kolmogorov smirnov statistic bogner and pappenberger 2011 pit is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the forecasts evaluated at observations y o b s t and is given by 7 pit f t y o b s t for a reliable forecast pit values should be mutually independent and uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 indicating that the forecast probability distributions are not too high not too low not too wide or too narrow wang et al 2012 4 results 4 1 effectiveness of bias correction correcting forecast bias is an important precursor before the forecasts used for operational purpose and decision making to evaluate the effectiveness of the bjp calibration models in correcting forecast bias for each water quality parameter sampling site and lead time the average values of the raw forecasts and ensemble means of the bjp forecasts are plotted against the observations in fig 3 it is obvious that the raw forecasts top panel in general suffer from bias the magnitude of the bias varies greatly across different water quality parameters but in general tends to grow with the increasing of lead time this is more obvious for the tp and tn forecasts the do and tp forecasts have a tendency to overestimate observed values while the nh and tn forecasts tend to underestimate observed values the bjp calibration models are highly effective at correcting bias in the raw forecasts as can be seen in fig 3 for each water quality parameter and lead time the average values of the bjp forecasts is virtually indistinguishable from the corresponding average values of observations indicating that the bias in the raw forecasts has been effectively removed by bjp calibration models in order to show the effectiveness of the calibration model in correcting forecast bias more clear table 1 further summarizes the bias of the raw and calibrated forecasts for each water quality parameter and lead time it can be seen that the bias in the raw forecasts has been reduced significantly for example the bias of the raw forecasts of do ranges from 0 818 mg l at lead time of 0 day to 1 533 mg l at lead time of 4 days after application of the bjp calibration model the forecast bias at all five lead times is close to zero table 1 indicates that the calibration procedure correct bias across all water quality parameters at different lead times 4 2 overall skill the rmsep and crps skill scores of the calibrated forecasts for each water quality parameter and lead time are plotted in fig 4 these skill scores reflect the relative improvement in forecast accuracy with regard to the raw forecasts for this analysis the forecasts derived for all 12 sampling sites in lake chaohu are pooled together to evaluate the overall improvement in accuracy of the calibration model a non parametric resampling approach based on the pairs bootstrapping method freedman 1981 is implemented in order to construct the 5 95 confidence intervals of the skill scores specifically for each water quality parameter and lead time a sample distribution of the rmsep and crps skill scores of the calibration forecasts is derived by bootstrapping with 1000 repeats the 5th and 95th quantiles of the rmsep and crps skill scores of the sample distribution are then used to test the significance of skill improvement bennett et al 2016 peng et al 2014b which are shown as the top and bottom edges of the boxes in fig 4 the variation patterns of rmsep and crps skill scores in fig 4 are very similar although there is small difference in magnitude for certain parameters and at certain lead times thus we focus on the rmsep skill scores for brevity fig 4 suggests that the calibration models are overall effective in improving the forecast accuracy of the raw daily forecasts but there is considerable variation in the magnitude of the skill scores across different water quality parameters it is evident that the calibration models are the most skillful for tp among the four parameters the average 5th and 95th percentiles of rmsep skill scores across all lead times are 62 3 and 72 9 respectively with an average median value of 68 2 the forecasts at lead times of five days and two days attain the highest and lowest skill scores respectively with median values of 73 2 and 56 3 the average median values of the rmsep skill scores for do and tn are 26 2 and 22 5 respectively indicating the skill for these two parameters is modest the rmsep skill scores for nh are generally low with median skill scores range between 2 8 and 10 8 and an average median value of 5 8 4 3 detail skill for the 12 sampling sites fig 5 presents the detail rmsep and crps skill scores of the calibrated forecasts for each water quality parameter lead time and sampling site sampling sites form rows and lead times form columns the non parametric bootstrapping method is applied again to test the significance of the improvement or decrease in skill score at 5 confidence level the significance test is made for each water quality parameter lead time and sampling site individually the events pass the significance test are indicated by the green circles or red cross in fig 5 fig 5 indicates clearly the improvements in forecast accuracy achieved by the calibration procedure the distribution pattern of rmsep and crps skill scores are generally consistent with each other although the crps skill score is overall slightly higher than the rmsep skill score the crps skill scores of the calibrated forecasts are consistently positive with the exception of nh for site 2 at four days lead time indicating a general improvement in accuracy compared to the raw forecasts however due to the variations in the errors of the raw forecasts fig 3 the skill scores exhibit considerable variation in magnitude across the parameters lead times and sampling sites there are a few cases where slightly negative rmsep skill scores are observed for nh at site 6 red pixels in bottom panel of fig 5 the negative skill scores can be attributable to either an insufficient sampling size of the raw forecasts and observations to fit a stable joint distribution or an artefact of cross validation in the presence of extreme events schepen et al 2018 the non parametric bootstrapping test results suggest that 67 7 forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites water quality parameters and lead times the calibration model tends to attain the highest rmsep and crps skill scores for tp among the four parameters as is shown in fig 3 the improvement of both rmsep and crps skill scores is significant at the 5 confidence level for tp at all sampling sites at all lead times for do and nh although the sampling sites located in the central eastern basin of lake chaohu site 7 to site 12 have much higher skill scores than the sites in western lake basin most skill scores are not significant at the 5 level suggesting that most of the skill for central eastern lake basin stems from correcting extreme errors in minority forecasts 4 4 uncertainty quantification the raw forecasts derived from the dynamical water quality models are deterministic and the calibration procedure conducted using bjp models generates probabilistic forecasts that account for the measurement uncertainty forecast model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty such that they provide a numerical representation of the likely range of water quality observations corresponding to each model forecast fig 6 presents a comparison of the forecast medians and uncertainty ranges with observed values each row in fig 6 corresponds to a water quality parameter and each column corresponds to a lead time comparisons are visually shown according to the forecast median fig 6 suggests that most observed values are included within the 0 1 0 9 uncertainty ranges of the model forecasts while the median values of model forecasts closely matched the observed patterns for most events suggesting that forecast uncertainties are overall correctly quantified by bjp models on the other hand both the forecast 0 25 0 75 and 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges generally increase with forecast median and also appear to be consistent with observed values the uncertainty ranges become wider with increasing lead time as would be expected this is more evident for do indicating that the forecast uncertainty is higher when lead time is greater the uncertainty pattern of nh is much different to other parameters the magnitude of which is rather small for low nh values but it can be especially wide for high sampling values this is caused by a few extreme sample values in those years fig 2 the magnitude of uncertainty of do is the smallest among the four parameters this is because do is bounded by a narrower physical range and the data are less variable fig 2 4 5 reliability and sharpness of the calibrated forecasts attribute diagrams of the bjp forecasts at lead times from 0 to 5 days are shown in fig 7 attributes diagram requires a large sample size to produce thus for this analysis forecasts for all four water quality parameters and 12 sampling sites are pooled together for each of the six lead times to increase sample size because higher concentration of nh tn and tp indicates worse water quality status for these three parameters the attribute diagrams are plotted for events exceeding the 50th percentile of observed values of each sampling site for do however this evaluation is for events not exceeding the 50th percentile of observed values note that the attributes diagram can be plotted for more extreme events e g for events exceeding the 90th percentile of observations but this is conditional on a large sample size results presented in fig 7 indicate the conditional observed probabilities of the events as a function of forecast probabilities results suggest that the bjp forecasts are generally reliable as suggested by the centres of the dots being positioned close to the one one line indicating that the forecast probabilities are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies especially the forecasts at lead time of 0 day on the other hand when the calibrated forecasts are found to be reliable it means that the forecast ensemble typically have appropriate spread and therefore correctly characterize forecast uncertainty zhao et al 2017 bennett et al 2014 forecast probabilities deviate slightly from the one one line for events at higher forecast probabilities indicating that higher forecasts probabilities are generally overestimated in other words forecast probabilities are too large relative to the observed frequencies of the events patarcic and brankovi 2012 another feature of the probability attributes in fig 7 is that quite a number of forecasts are assigned very high or low probabilities indicating that the forecasts are of adequate sharpness thus have adequate ability to differentiate the extreme events fig 8 presents the pit uniform probability plots for each sampling site and for each water quality parameter at lead time of 0 day it can be seen that the cdfs of the pit values aligns well with the one one line for most sampling sites small departures from the one one line are observed for some events but all pit values lie well within the kolmogorov 5 significance bands this suggests that probability distributions in calibrated cdfs in individual sampling sites are unbiased and in general reliable and of appropriate spread only the results for 0 day lead time are presented here because results for other lead times are similar 5 discussion 5 1 influence of the accuracy of the raw forecasts our results demonstrate that the bjp calibration models can substantially correct systematic bias and reduce the rmsep and crps of the raw forecasts the greatest improvement in forecast accuracy is found for tp where the systematic bias tend to be the greatest among the four water quality parameters thus correction of the forecast bias tend to be the greatest contribution to improvements in forecast skill the tp is inherent difficult to forecast because it is characterised by highly skewed heavy tailed and short term extremes and the low sampling resolution lead to great challenge for dynamical model to fully capture the fluctuation pattern of tp e g krueger 2017 for a given water quality parameter and sampling site however skill scores do not change obviously with lead time this is because the skill scores measure the percentage reduction in error relative to the raw forecasts the top panel of fig 9 further examines the influence of correlation coefficient between the raw forecasts and observations to the rmsep and crps skill scores one can see that there does not appear to be any trend with the forecast skill scores in the relationship between the forecasts and the observed values the bottom panel of fig 9 shows the relationship between the relative widths of the 0 1 0 9 and 0 25 0 75 uncertainty bands and the correlation coefficients between raw forecasts and observations each circle represents a value for a certain water quality parameter sampling site and lead time relative width of the uncertainty band is defined here as mean width of uncertainty bands divided by mean value of the observations even through a higher correlation coefficient between the raw forecasts and observations cannot guarantee a higher skill score it is helpful for generating probabilistic forecasts with less uncertainty as is shown in the bottom row of fig 9 both the relative widths of the 0 1 0 9 and 0 25 0 75 uncertainty bands of the calibrated forecasts tend to decrease with higher correlation coefficients indicating that the uncertainty of the calibrated forecasts tend to decrease with higher correlation coefficients 5 2 influence of the length of the dataset to forecast uncertainty one of the major challenges for developing and evaluating post processing methods for water quality forecasts in china and many other regions is the limited availability of historical forecasts and the sparse water quality observations for lake chaohu there are currently only 2 year 2017 2018 archive of quantitative water quality forecasts in such cases where historical forecasts or concurrent observations are limited it s very difficult to establish a stationary relationship between the forecast outputs and observations thus attempting to explicitly represent all factors affecting water quality within a statistical model would likely result in over parameterization and poor performance in uncertainty quantification obenour et al 2014 in recent years however the central and local governments of china have invested a lot of manpower and material resources to improve the water environment monitoring and forecasts yu et al 2020 and both the forecasts and water quality observation data are accumulating rapidly thus the data limitation will be overcame in the future to analysis the influence of the length of raw forecasts and observation pairs on in uncertainty quantification from the future prospects we set up a set of experiments by excluding the last 20 of the raw forecasts and observation pairs from the post processing dataset we then compare the 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges of diminished forecasts to original post processed forecasts the experiments are conducted for all 12 sampling sites but only for do at a lead time of 0 day fig 10 provide a comparison of the 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges with observed values for the post processed forecasts before and after cutting the length of predictor and predictand pairs only results for do and at a lead time of 0 day are shown the forecast cases are displayed chronologically rmsep skill scores are shown in the top right corner fig 10 suggests rmsep skill scores tend to increase slightly for the diminished forecasts with the exception of site 10 on the other hand the 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges generally become wider for the diminished forecasts although the magnitude of which is very small thus it reasonable to conclude that forecast uncertainty quantified by bjp will be more stationary in future in light of the increasing achieves of forecast and observation pairs in this study the calibration procedure is carried out without considering any seasonal fluctuation of the water quality parameters the nutrient cycling processes within shallow lakes can be highly effected by hydrometeorological factors such as temperature wind field rainfall inflows and outflows and thus exhibit obvious seasonal patterns as have mentioned before both tn and do concentrations in lake chaohu are much higher in winter than in summer but tp shows a converse pattern fig 2 the bjp method used in this study is a data driven modeling approach and thus might not be suited to address seasonality in such cases calibration models could be built separately for each parameter during different months or seasons and such monthly or seasonal models may perform better than the post processing models described here shrestha et al 2015 however building monthly or seasonal models presupposes the availability of water quality hindcasts that span multiple years 6 summary and conclusions bias free accurate and reliable forecasts of daily water quality parameters are of great value for refined water resources and water environment management of large lakes in this paper we investigated the efficiency of the bayesian joint probability bjp modeling approach in correcting systematic bias improving forecast accuracy and quantifying forecast uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts derived from numerical models our analysis highlights that forecast bias in the raw water quality forecasts have been corrected effectively for all water quality parameters at all lead times the calibration models are the most skillful for tp among the four parameters with an average median value of rmsep skill score of 68 2 across all lead times the rmsep skill scores for nh are generally low with median skill scores range between 2 8 and 10 8 the probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are generally reliable and have appropriate spread and thus correctly characterize forecast uncertainty the post processing framework used in this study can help to better realize the potential of dynamical water quality forecasts the improved accuracy and reliable quantification of uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts suggests that this method could be a useful operational forecasting

17606,correcting the systematic bias and quantifying uncertainty associated with the operational water quality forecasts are imperative works for risk based environmental decision making this work proposes a post processing method for addressing both bias correction and total uncertainty quantification for daily forecasts of water quality parameters derived from dynamical lake models the post processing is implemented based on a bayesian joint probability bjp modeling approach the bjp model uses a log sinh transformation to normalize the raw forecasts and corresponding observations and uses a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship the posterior distribution of the transformation parameters is inferenced through metropolis monte carlo markov chain sampling it generates unbiased probabilistic forecasts that account for uncertainties from all sources the bjp is used to post processing raw daily forecasts of dissolved oxygen do ammonium nitrogen nh total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations of lake chaohu the fifth largest lake in china with lead times from 0 to 5 days results suggest that an average 93 1 forecast bias has been removed by bjp the root mean square error in probability skill scores range from 5 8 for nh to 68 2 for tp and the non parametric bootstrapping test suggests that 67 7 forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites water quality parameters and lead times the probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies and have appropriate spread and thus correctly quantify forecast uncertainty the bjp post processing method used in this study can be a useful operational tool that help to better realize the potential of water quality forecasts derived from dynamical models graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality forecasts bias correction uncertainty quantification lake chaohu bayesian joint probability modeling approach 1 introduction accurate forecasts of water quality parameters with reliable uncertainty quantification of large lakes for the coming several days have a wide range of applications such forecasts can improve the security and effectiveness of drinking water supplies public health protection irrigation plans making fisheries human settlements and tourism informative water quality forecasts offer advanced warning of extreme conditions and thus allow water managers to make correct operational water management decisions and assess the risks of water management strategies sadeghian et al 2018 lusic et al 2017 thoe et al 2014 processes based dynamical models are the main tools for short term water quality forecasts for water bodies such as rivers lakes estuaries and oceans vinçon leite and casenave 2019 bedri et al 2014 chan et al 2013 dynamical forecast models are based on the laws of physics which allow them to capture the complex nonlinear interactions of hydrodynamics and nutrient transport and cycling as well as chemical and biological processes in lakes they are adaptable to shifts in a lake ecosystem caused by anthropogenic activities or climate changes moreover dynamical forecast models also provide spatially and temporally coherent forecasts of multiple water quality and ecological variables at multiple temporal resolutions despite the great improvement of dynamical lake models achieved during the last decades in terms of model mechanisms data input and computational efficiency garcia et al 2019 jørgensen s e 2010 forecasts derived from these numerical models still suffer from many formidable shortcomings which restricted their usefulness and effectiveness to real resources management and decision making on one hand forecasts of water quality parameters from dynamical models always suffer from considerable bias the reasons for such bias include systematic model errors caused by imperfect conceptualization coarse temporal and spatial model resolutions which are not able to capture fine scale processes etc teutschbein and seibert 2012 to make a useful short term forecast it is necessary to run calibration algorithms to correct these systematic errors before the forecast can be used by water managers in this direction many simple statistical calibration methods such as additive bias correction multiplicative bias correction and quantile mapping are used for directly post processing daily water quality forecasts these simple methods seems to be adequate in correcting forecast bias zhao et al 2017 on the other hand because the deterministic forecasts generated by dynamical models with insufficient consideration to the uncertainty associated with them there is increasing concern that these forecasts being used may lead to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient management strategies tscheikner gratl et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 uncertainties in water quality forecasts mainly stem from measurement errors of initial conditions boundary conditions and the forcing functions as well as imperfect model structure and parameterization novic et al 2018 lu et al 2012 quantifying uncertainty associated with water quality forecasts is imperative for risk based environmental decision making chaudhary and hantush 2017 skeffington et al 2015 uncertainty estimation of dynamical models has received considerable attention in aquatic ecosystem research and there have been many attempts to rigorously address issues pertaining to input error model structure and parameter selection in this direction the bayesian theory based methods have been increasingly applied to study uncertainties in water quality modeling over the past decades zhao et al 2014 the most popular methods include bayesian monte carlo and maximum likelihood approaches chaudhary and hantush 2017 freni and mannina 2010 bayesian classifiers and machine learning algorithms marcota and penman 2019 and bayesian based hybrid ensemble and variational data assimilation framework abbaszadeh et al 2019 amongst others recently han and zheng 2018 developed an bayesian analysis of input and parametric uncertainties approach for the joint analysis of input and parameter uncertainties of watershed water quality models xia et al 2016 used bayesian hierarchical methods to quantify uncertainties in model structure parameters in export coefficient models used to predict nitrate concentration in streams hantush and chaudhary 2014 presented an bayesian monte carlo simulation and maximum likelihood estimation method to calibrate and estimate uncertainties of water quality model parameters the bayesian methodologies offers several technical advances such as alleviation of the identification problem produce more comprehensive statistical inferences and have fewer restrictive assumptions and realistic uncertainty estimates of ecological predictions that can be particularly useful for environmental management chaudhary and hantush 2017 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 for operational lake water quality forecasts however because of the high dimensionality of both the input and parameter spaces of lake model along with the nonlinearity of the complex hydrodynamic and biochemical processes in lakes conventional bayesian methods that deal with uncertainties propagated throughout the whole forecast duration in a rigorous way may suffer from significant computational challenge not only due to the evaluation of a computationally intensive numerical model in each iteration of the posterior distribution formulation but also because difficulties arise from exploring the high dimensional space of the large scale model input and parameters which can greatly hamper the timelessness and effectiveness of a real time forecast zhao et al 2014 cui et al 2011 on the other hand modern lakes always provide multiple ecosystem functions anthropogenic activities such as operation of hydraulic infrastructures and lake restoration projects as well as water transports fisheries tourism and recreation may cause considerable unforeseen and additional uncertainties to the evolution of lake water quality tscheikner gratl et al 2019 freni and mannina 2010 therefore methods addressing uncertainties from the input data parameter and model structure may underestimate the complexity of large lake systems and thus underestimate the total uncertainties in operational water quality forecasts a highly feasible solution to bridge this gap for real time operational water quality forecasts is by running post processing methods that account for all aspects of uncertainty through subjective assessment of the probability of occurrence of a future event conditional upon all knowledge available up to the present and the information that can be acquired through a learning inferential process tscheikner gratl et al 2019 however finding a method to this regard is still a major challenge in the research field of operational water quality forecasts for lakes in recent studies by schepen et al 2018 and zhao et al 2015 a bayesian joint probability bjp modeling approach was used to post process monthly cgcm rainfall totals across australia and deterministic streamflow forecasts of three gorges reservoir in china the main advantage of the bjp modelling approach is that it provides a highly flexible probability model with relatively few parameters robertson et al 2013 it uses a log sinh transformation to normalize predictor and predictand data and uses a bi variate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship between them zhao et al 2015 the parameters of the transformation and the distribution are estimated through bayesian inference with a monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithm the bjp model produces probabilistic distribution of predictands to represent forecast uncertainty from raw deterministic forecasts the aim of this study is to extend the approach of schepen et al 2018 and zhao et al 2015 we propose a post processing method based on bjp to concurrently correcting systematic bias and quantifying uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts for lakes the specific objectives of our study is to assess the effectiveness of the bjp in correcting systematic bias in the raw numerical forecasts the skill of calibrated forecasts compared to the raw forecasts and reliability and sharpness of the probability distribution section 2 of this paper describes the study area and data sources section 3 describes forecast and post processing methodologies

study area and data collection 2 1 study area in this study we focus on lake chaohu in the lower yangtze river basin this lake occupies an area of about 778 km2 and is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china in addition to being the unique drinking water source to more than one million people in surrounding urban and rural regions lake chaohu provides important ecosystem functions such as flood regulation water transport fisheries tourism and recreation lake chaohu is a shallow lake with an average depth of 2 69 m the catchment fig 1 has a total area of 13 486 km2 its landscape is primarily plains and low mountains with elevations ranging from 8 m to 1493 m the catchment is characterised by sub tropical monsoon climate resulting in high rainfall in summer and much less rainfall in winter mean annual rainfall and evaporation are 1025 9 mm and 818 7 mm respectively and monthly average temperatures vary from 3 5 c in january to 29 0 c in july with annul average temperature of 16 1 c there are 12 major tributaries draining directly into lake chaohu most of which are concentrated in the western part of the lake yuxi river on the east of the lake is the only outflowing river it connects the lake to the yangtze river during the past two to three decades because of rapid economic development and urbanization together with agricultural diffuse pollution in the lake chaohu catchment most feed in tributaries of the lake are seriously polluted especially the tributaries flowing through hefei city resulting in the deterioration of water quality and the eutrophication of the lake therefore establishing an effective forecast framework to provide informative water quality forecasts has become an emergency task for local government who have the responsibility of the drinking water supply security and safety 2 2 data sources water quality data of lake chaohu and its tributaries are provided by the administration bureau of lake chaohu ablc for the year of 2017 2018 there are 12 sampling sites for the lake and 12 sites for the main tributaries respectively the sampling frequency for the lake ranges from one to seven days from april to november and once a month for the rest months of the year with a total of 145 samples on different days during the period 2017 2018 for each site the sampling frequency for the tributaries is once a month fourteen monitoring variables are available for both the lake and tributaries including water temperature ph do tn tp and nh concentrations mg l water quality parameters exhibit obvious seasonal fluctuations in lake chaohu as is shown in fig 2 both tn and do concentrations are much higher in winter than in summer but tp shows a converse pattern another feature in fig 2 is that water quality in the eastern central lake basin is much better than the western basin for example the nh tp and tn concentrations for the sites located in western basin sites1 to site5 are much higher than other sampling sites reflecting that most of the nutrient load of the lake is from the heavily polluted tributaries that enter at the western end of the lake real time hydrological data are sourced from the hefei bureau of hydrology hbh observation variables include hourly mean flows m3 s at taoxi station and releases m3 s from the chaohu and zhaohe sluices hourly water levels from four stations in the lake and daily rainfall totals from 51 rainfall gauges distributed uniformly across the whole lake chaohu catchment real time hourly meteorological data at six stations in lake chaohu catchment are obtained from the website of china national meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn monitoring variables includes hourly rainfall total mm average air temperature c at 2 m above the surface wind speed m s and direction at 10 m above the surface real time solar radiation data are downloaded online from three automatic meteorological stations installed onto different locations of the lake real time meteorological forecasts for six stations are derived from the official forecasting website of the national meteorological center nmc of china http www nmc cn several forecast variables are available for the next seven days at a 3 h resolution including air temperature rainfall wind speed and wind direction relative humidity and cloud cover these forecasts are updated at a frequency of 3 h from 2 00 lt local time to 23 00 lt monitoring sites for water quality hydrological and meteorological variables can be found in fig 1 3 methods 3 1 daily water quality forecasts using dynamical ecological model 3 1 1 coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model the ecolake model was used to configure a forecast framework for forecasting daily water quality variables of lake chaohu peng et al 2019a ecolake was originally developed in the 1990s it is a coupled three dimensional and nonlinear ecological model that simulates and forecasts the evolution of lake ecosystem variables under different environmental conditions ecolake model consists of three main modules the first one is a relatively independent hydrodynamics module it uses a free surface and terrain following vertical coordinate system scaled on the water column depth to reflect the dynamics of water level lake current and wave the second is a food chain network module state variables include fish zooplankton organic detritus algae and aquatic macrophytes the third is the material transform and transport module state variables include do nitrogen and phosphorus elements etc ecolake model has been validated by long term field observations peng et al 2019a han and hu 2012 and was successfully adapted for assessing the impacts of the yangtze river water transfer project on the restoration of lake taihu hu et al 2008 forecasting the short term algal bloom of lake taihu zhang et al 2013 computing the self purification capacity of lake taihu han et al 2015 and simulating water quality responses to multiple restoration scenarios of lake yangchenghu wang et al 2018 detailed descriptions of the model can be found in hu et al 1998 2006 2011 hu and qin 2002 3 1 2 model setup and forecasts generation the ecolake model configured for lake chaohu has five vertical sigma levels and a uniform horizontal grid cell of 250 m 250 m with a time step of 10 s the initial conditions of the model such as hydrodynamic nutrient and biologic variables are interpolated over each of the grid cells covering the lake using the most recently observed water quality data through inverse distance weighting method the ecolake model is forced by a range of meteorological hydrological and nutrient concentration functions daily forcing functions include lake surface rainfall and evaporation air temperature inflows outflows and nutrient concentrations of the tributaries hourly forcing functions include wind speed wind direction and solar radiation the forcing functions during the model spin up period are processed using observational data most of the meteorological forcing functions during the forecast period can be obtained readily from the cmdc certain forcing functions such as solar radiation and daily inflows cannot be obtained readily thus we established a regression model and a water balance based model to calculate this variables peng et al 2019b in an earlier paper by peng et al 2019a we calibrated the ecolake model parameter using observations obtained in 2016 for lake chaohu calibration results suggested that relative error statistics of the model accuracy in simulating water quality parameters include tn tp do and nh ranges between 0 10 and 0 39 indicating that model accuracy meets the general guidance criteria published in usepa 1990 real time forecasts of water quality parameters for lake chaohu are generated at a frequency of about once three days from the period 2017 to 2018 the forecasts are initialized at about 9 00 lt on each forecasting day daily forecasts of water quality parameters such as do nh tn and tp for current day and the coming five days at lead times from 0 to 5 days can be generated at about 11 00 lt a total of 216 sets of real time forecasts are generated on different days over the period 2017 to 2018 3 2 statistical calibration using bjp 3 2 1 formulation of calibration models with bjp we employ the bayesian joint probability modeling approach bjp wang et al 2009 wang and robertson 2011 to calibrate the raw water quality forecasts derived from the above mentioned forecast framework we focus on the four most important water quality parameters of lake chaohu namely do nh tp and tn bjp was originally designed for forecasting seasonal streamflow totals and was later successfully adapted for forecasting monthly and seasonal precipitation hawthorne et al 2013 peng et al 2014a post processing daily monthly and sub seasonal to seasonal rainfall forecasts from global climate models peng et al 2014b shrestha et al 2015 bennett et al 2016 schepen et al 2018 and calibration and quantifying predictive uncertainty of streamflow forecasts zhao et al 2015 the bjp models are based on a joint probability distribution of a predictor x and a predictand y when used for calibrating daily water quality forecasts in our study the predictors are raw forecasts from the dynamical ecolake model and predictands are daily concentrations of do nh tp and tn the joint probability distribution is assumed to be bivariate normal after transformations of the predictor and predictand variables by using a log sinh transformation wang et al 2012 1 x 1 β x ln sinh α x β x x y 1 β y ln sinh α y β y y where x ˆ and y ˆ are transformed variables of x and y α x β x α y and β y are transformation parameters the log sinh bivariate normal transformation provides a simple structure and have considerable flexibility to model the intrinsic correlations between the raw forecasts and observations furthermore it is considered more suitable for variables that are positively skewed with a zero bound such as water quality parameters including do nh tn and tp in our cases the transformed variables are assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution 2 x y n μ x μ y σ x 2 ρ x y σ x σ y ρ x y σ x σ y σ y 2 where μ x and μ y are the means of the transformed variables x ˆ and y ˆ respectively σ x and σ y are standard deviations ρ x y is the correlation coefficient between x ˆ and y ˆ both the marginal distribution and the conditional distribution of the joint distribution are normal ρ x y defines the strength of relationship between the raw forecasts and corresponding observations when ρ x y is zero the conditional distribution of y ˆ for returns to the marginal distribution of y ˆ zhao et al 2019 more information on the formulation of bjp models can be found in wang and robertson 2011 and wang et al 2009 3 2 2 bayesian inference of model paremeters the set of bjp model parameters θ is comprised of nine transformation parameters namely α x β x α y β y μ x μ y σ x σ y and ρ x y respectively these model parameters need to be inferred before the model can be used for calibration of real time water quality forecasts however the posterior distribution of the parameters is nonstandard and does not allow analytical integration thus we considered to obtain the numerical solutions by using the bayesian method which defines the conditional joint posterior probability distribution function of the parameters specifically we obtain the transformation parameters using the maximum a posteriori probability map estimation and sample the parameters of the joint distribution with a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling based on a metropolis algorithm by using historical data from 2017 to 2018 the mcmc sampling is a well developed and widely applied technique e g krueger 2017 xia et al 2016 obenour et al 2014 cui et al 2011 but its implementation may vary considerably in specifics wang and robertson 2011 serval aspects of the mcmc sampling implemented in this study are noted here firstly in our bayesian inference of the model parameters a prior that assuming parameters is inversely proportional to the standard deviation σ is specified wang et al 2012 secondly we draw a sample of 1000 sets of parameter values that numerically represent the joint posterior distribution of the parameters thirdly mcmc sampling also requires the use of a proposal distribution for generating random jumps in the parameter space the multivariate normal distribution is adopted in this study wang et al 2011 in this study bjp calibration models are set up independently for each of the four water quality parameters 12 sampling sites and six lead times for operational forecasts the set of model parameters θ can be inferenced in advance using all available historical raw forecasts and observations for example when the bjp is implemented for do at sampling site 1 and at a lead time of 1 day all historical forecast and observation pairs of do at site 1 with a lead time of 1 day is used to infer the bjp model parameters once a new raw forecast x ˆ is generated from ecolake model a forecasting problem is stated as getting the conditional distribution of y ˆ given the raw forecast x ˆ and inferred model parameter θ shrestha et al 2015 the conditional distribution of y ˆ is given by 3 f y x θ n μ y ρ x y σ y x μ x σ x σ y 2 1 ρ x y 2 an inverse of the log sinh transformation as is shown in eq 1 is then applied to give the forecast values y in untransformed space 4 y 1 β x arcsin h exp β x y α y probabilistic forecasts of water quality parameters at lead times from 0 to 5 days can be generated by sampling using eqs 3 and 4 it should be note that due to the sparse water quality monitoring the historical raw forecast and observation pairs fed into bjp models are not of the same length for different parameters and lead times 3 3 methods for validation 3 3 1 forecast cross validation validation is performed for both the raw and calibrated forecasts generated over the period 2017 2018 the performance of the calibration method is evaluated using a leave one out cross validation procedure the procedure is implemented by inferring parameters of the bjp model using all raw forecasts with the exception of the forecast being validated for example assuming that we have the archive of the historical forecast dataset f 1 f 2 f n and corresponding observations o 1 o 2 o n to validate the bjp model performance in calibrating the raw forecast f 1 we first use the sub datasets f 2 f n and o 2 o n to infer the bjp model parameters then we feed the raw forecast f 1 and the inferenced parameter into bjp to generate a calibrated forecast of f 1 this procedure is used to ensure that the forecast is being verified against data independent of data used for model parameter inference this procedure is repeated for each of other raw forecasts and the calibrated forecasts f 1 f 2 f n can be generated and then are compared to corresponding observations to validate the bjp model performance it should be note that the cross validation procedure used here is solely for evaluate the bjp model performance for operational applications however all available historical forecasts and corresponding observations can be used to infer the bjp model parameters 3 3 2 forecast bias the bias of the raw and calibrated forecasts is evaluated for each water quality parameter sampling site and lead time individually bias is defined as the average difference between the forecasts and corresponding observations 5 bias 1 t t 1 t y t y o b s t where y t is the raw forecast or ensemble mean of the calibrated forecast for event t t 1 2 t and y o b s t is corresponding observation 3 3 3 forecast accuracy and skill scores two verification metrics are used to evaluate the forecast accuracy the root mean square error in probability rmsep and the continuous ranked probability score crps both are well established metrics to describe probabilistic distribution errors in forecasts related to observations rmsep compares the forecast medians against observed values in probability space wang and robertson 2011 while crps evaluates the distance between the forecast probability distribution and the observation hersbach 2000 note that crps of the raw deterministic forecasts is equivalent to the mean absolute error zhao et al 2015 we then calculate the rmsep and crps based skill scores by comparing the rmsep and crps values calculated for the calibrated forecasts to the raw forecasts for example the rmsep based skill score is calculated as 6 r m s e p s s 1 r m s e p c a l i r m s e p r a w 100 the skill scores measure the improvement over the raw forecasts a skill score of 100 is attained when perfect forecasts are achieved whereas a skill score of 0 indicates that the forecasts have no improvement over the raw forecasts and are thus considered to have no skill a negative skill score means the forecasts are inferior to the raw forecasts 3 3 4 forecast reliability and sharpness for probabilistic forecasts to be informative they must be accurate as well as reliable forecast reliability describes the ability of the ensemble spread to accurately represent the predictive uncertainty zhao et al 2017 we use attribute diagrams hsu and murphy 1986 to evaluate the overall forecast reliability for each of the six lead times attribute diagram plots the probability of threshold forecasts against the relative frequencies of such events in the observation space forecasts are considered reliable if the forecast probabilities are consistent with the observed relative frequencies forecast sharpness can also be presented in the attribute diagrams which is the tendency for forecasts to move away from normal concentration levels forecasts that assign very high or low probabilities e g 90 or 10 to events can be deemed as sharp forecasts which are generally desirable as they are more certain forecasts however sharpness at the expense of reliability will result in overconfident and thereby misleading forecasts alongside the overall reliability evaluation we also evaluate the reliability of the forecast probability distributions for the 12 individual sampling sites by using the pit probability integral transform uniform probability plots in which the pit values are plotted against a standard uniform variate to test for departures from the dual hypotheses of independence and uniformity with departures from uniformity tested using the kolmogorov smirnov statistic bogner and pappenberger 2011 pit is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the forecasts evaluated at observations y o b s t and is given by 7 pit f t y o b s t for a reliable forecast pit values should be mutually independent and uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 indicating that the forecast probability distributions are not too high not too low not too wide or too narrow wang et al 2012 4 results 4 1 effectiveness of bias correction correcting forecast bias is an important precursor before the forecasts used for operational purpose and decision making to evaluate the effectiveness of the bjp calibration models in correcting forecast bias for each water quality parameter sampling site and lead time the average values of the raw forecasts and ensemble means of the bjp forecasts are plotted against the observations in fig 3 it is obvious that the raw forecasts top panel in general suffer from bias the magnitude of the bias varies greatly across different water quality parameters but in general tends to grow with the increasing of lead time this is more obvious for the tp and tn forecasts the do and tp forecasts have a tendency to overestimate observed values while the nh and tn forecasts tend to underestimate observed values the bjp calibration models are highly effective at correcting bias in the raw forecasts as can be seen in fig 3 for each water quality parameter and lead time the average values of the bjp forecasts is virtually indistinguishable from the corresponding average values of observations indicating that the bias in the raw forecasts has been effectively removed by bjp calibration models in order to show the effectiveness of the calibration model in correcting forecast bias more clear table 1 further summarizes the bias of the raw and calibrated forecasts for each water quality parameter and lead time it can be seen that the bias in the raw forecasts has been reduced significantly for example the bias of the raw forecasts of do ranges from 0 818 mg l at lead time of 0 day to 1 533 mg l at lead time of 4 days after application of the bjp calibration model the forecast bias at all five lead times is close to zero table 1 indicates that the calibration procedure correct bias across all water quality parameters at different lead times 4 2 overall skill the rmsep and crps skill scores of the calibrated forecasts for each water quality parameter and lead time are plotted in fig 4 these skill scores reflect the relative improvement in forecast accuracy with regard to the raw forecasts for this analysis the forecasts derived for all 12 sampling sites in lake chaohu are pooled together to evaluate the overall improvement in accuracy of the calibration model a non parametric resampling approach based on the pairs bootstrapping method freedman 1981 is implemented in order to construct the 5 95 confidence intervals of the skill scores specifically for each water quality parameter and lead time a sample distribution of the rmsep and crps skill scores of the calibration forecasts is derived by bootstrapping with 1000 repeats the 5th and 95th quantiles of the rmsep and crps skill scores of the sample distribution are then used to test the significance of skill improvement bennett et al 2016 peng et al 2014b which are shown as the top and bottom edges of the boxes in fig 4 the variation patterns of rmsep and crps skill scores in fig 4 are very similar although there is small difference in magnitude for certain parameters and at certain lead times thus we focus on the rmsep skill scores for brevity fig 4 suggests that the calibration models are overall effective in improving the forecast accuracy of the raw daily forecasts but there is considerable variation in the magnitude of the skill scores across different water quality parameters it is evident that the calibration models are the most skillful for tp among the four parameters the average 5th and 95th percentiles of rmsep skill scores across all lead times are 62 3 and 72 9 respectively with an average median value of 68 2 the forecasts at lead times of five days and two days attain the highest and lowest skill scores respectively with median values of 73 2 and 56 3 the average median values of the rmsep skill scores for do and tn are 26 2 and 22 5 respectively indicating the skill for these two parameters is modest the rmsep skill scores for nh are generally low with median skill scores range between 2 8 and 10 8 and an average median value of 5 8 4 3 detail skill for the 12 sampling sites fig 5 presents the detail rmsep and crps skill scores of the calibrated forecasts for each water quality parameter lead time and sampling site sampling sites form rows and lead times form columns the non parametric bootstrapping method is applied again to test the significance of the improvement or decrease in skill score at 5 confidence level the significance test is made for each water quality parameter lead time and sampling site individually the events pass the significance test are indicated by the green circles or red cross in fig 5 fig 5 indicates clearly the improvements in forecast accuracy achieved by the calibration procedure the distribution pattern of rmsep and crps skill scores are generally consistent with each other although the crps skill score is overall slightly higher than the rmsep skill score the crps skill scores of the calibrated forecasts are consistently positive with the exception of nh for site 2 at four days lead time indicating a general improvement in accuracy compared to the raw forecasts however due to the variations in the errors of the raw forecasts fig 3 the skill scores exhibit considerable variation in magnitude across the parameters lead times and sampling sites there are a few cases where slightly negative rmsep skill scores are observed for nh at site 6 red pixels in bottom panel of fig 5 the negative skill scores can be attributable to either an insufficient sampling size of the raw forecasts and observations to fit a stable joint distribution or an artefact of cross validation in the presence of extreme events schepen et al 2018 the non parametric bootstrapping test results suggest that 67 7 forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites water quality parameters and lead times the calibration model tends to attain the highest rmsep and crps skill scores for tp among the four parameters as is shown in fig 3 the improvement of both rmsep and crps skill scores is significant at the 5 confidence level for tp at all sampling sites at all lead times for do and nh although the sampling sites located in the central eastern basin of lake chaohu site 7 to site 12 have much higher skill scores than the sites in western lake basin most skill scores are not significant at the 5 level suggesting that most of the skill for central eastern lake basin stems from correcting extreme errors in minority forecasts 4 4 uncertainty quantification the raw forecasts derived from the dynamical water quality models are deterministic and the calibration procedure conducted using bjp models generates probabilistic forecasts that account for the measurement uncertainty forecast model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty such that they provide a numerical representation of the likely range of water quality observations corresponding to each model forecast fig 6 presents a comparison of the forecast medians and uncertainty ranges with observed values each row in fig 6 corresponds to a water quality parameter and each column corresponds to a lead time comparisons are visually shown according to the forecast median fig 6 suggests that most observed values are included within the 0 1 0 9 uncertainty ranges of the model forecasts while the median values of model forecasts closely matched the observed patterns for most events suggesting that forecast uncertainties are overall correctly quantified by bjp models on the other hand both the forecast 0 25 0 75 and 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges generally increase with forecast median and also appear to be consistent with observed values the uncertainty ranges become wider with increasing lead time as would be expected this is more evident for do indicating that the forecast uncertainty is higher when lead time is greater the uncertainty pattern of nh is much different to other parameters the magnitude of which is rather small for low nh values but it can be especially wide for high sampling values this is caused by a few extreme sample values in those years fig 2 the magnitude of uncertainty of do is the smallest among the four parameters this is because do is bounded by a narrower physical range and the data are less variable fig 2 4 5 reliability and sharpness of the calibrated forecasts attribute diagrams of the bjp forecasts at lead times from 0 to 5 days are shown in fig 7 attributes diagram requires a large sample size to produce thus for this analysis forecasts for all four water quality parameters and 12 sampling sites are pooled together for each of the six lead times to increase sample size because higher concentration of nh tn and tp indicates worse water quality status for these three parameters the attribute diagrams are plotted for events exceeding the 50th percentile of observed values of each sampling site for do however this evaluation is for events not exceeding the 50th percentile of observed values note that the attributes diagram can be plotted for more extreme events e g for events exceeding the 90th percentile of observations but this is conditional on a large sample size results presented in fig 7 indicate the conditional observed probabilities of the events as a function of forecast probabilities results suggest that the bjp forecasts are generally reliable as suggested by the centres of the dots being positioned close to the one one line indicating that the forecast probabilities are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies especially the forecasts at lead time of 0 day on the other hand when the calibrated forecasts are found to be reliable it means that the forecast ensemble typically have appropriate spread and therefore correctly characterize forecast uncertainty zhao et al 2017 bennett et al 2014 forecast probabilities deviate slightly from the one one line for events at higher forecast probabilities indicating that higher forecasts probabilities are generally overestimated in other words forecast probabilities are too large relative to the observed frequencies of the events patarcic and brankovi 2012 another feature of the probability attributes in fig 7 is that quite a number of forecasts are assigned very high or low probabilities indicating that the forecasts are of adequate sharpness thus have adequate ability to differentiate the extreme events fig 8 presents the pit uniform probability plots for each sampling site and for each water quality parameter at lead time of 0 day it can be seen that the cdfs of the pit values aligns well with the one one line for most sampling sites small departures from the one one line are observed for some events but all pit values lie well within the kolmogorov 5 significance bands this suggests that probability distributions in calibrated cdfs in individual sampling sites are unbiased and in general reliable and of appropriate spread only the results for 0 day lead time are presented here because results for other lead times are similar 5 discussion 5 1 influence of the accuracy of the raw forecasts our results demonstrate that the bjp calibration models can substantially correct systematic bias and reduce the rmsep and crps of the raw forecasts the greatest improvement in forecast accuracy is found for tp where the systematic bias tend to be the greatest among the four water quality parameters thus correction of the forecast bias tend to be the greatest contribution to improvements in forecast skill the tp is inherent difficult to forecast because it is characterised by highly skewed heavy tailed and short term extremes and the low sampling resolution lead to great challenge for dynamical model to fully capture the fluctuation pattern of tp e g krueger 2017 for a given water quality parameter and sampling site however skill scores do not change obviously with lead time this is because the skill scores measure the percentage reduction in error relative to the raw forecasts the top panel of fig 9 further examines the influence of correlation coefficient between the raw forecasts and observations to the rmsep and crps skill scores one can see that there does not appear to be any trend with the forecast skill scores in the relationship between the forecasts and the observed values the bottom panel of fig 9 shows the relationship between the relative widths of the 0 1 0 9 and 0 25 0 75 uncertainty bands and the correlation coefficients between raw forecasts and observations each circle represents a value for a certain water quality parameter sampling site and lead time relative width of the uncertainty band is defined here as mean width of uncertainty bands divided by mean value of the observations even through a higher correlation coefficient between the raw forecasts and observations cannot guarantee a higher skill score it is helpful for generating probabilistic forecasts with less uncertainty as is shown in the bottom row of fig 9 both the relative widths of the 0 1 0 9 and 0 25 0 75 uncertainty bands of the calibrated forecasts tend to decrease with higher correlation coefficients indicating that the uncertainty of the calibrated forecasts tend to decrease with higher correlation coefficients 5 2 influence of the length of the dataset to forecast uncertainty one of the major challenges for developing and evaluating post processing methods for water quality forecasts in china and many other regions is the limited availability of historical forecasts and the sparse water quality observations for lake chaohu there are currently only 2 year 2017 2018 archive of quantitative water quality forecasts in such cases where historical forecasts or concurrent observations are limited it s very difficult to establish a stationary relationship between the forecast outputs and observations thus attempting to explicitly represent all factors affecting water quality within a statistical model would likely result in over parameterization and poor performance in uncertainty quantification obenour et al 2014 in recent years however the central and local governments of china have invested a lot of manpower and material resources to improve the water environment monitoring and forecasts yu et al 2020 and both the forecasts and water quality observation data are accumulating rapidly thus the data limitation will be overcame in the future to analysis the influence of the length of raw forecasts and observation pairs on in uncertainty quantification from the future prospects we set up a set of experiments by excluding the last 20 of the raw forecasts and observation pairs from the post processing dataset we then compare the 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges of diminished forecasts to original post processed forecasts the experiments are conducted for all 12 sampling sites but only for do at a lead time of 0 day fig 10 provide a comparison of the 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges with observed values for the post processed forecasts before and after cutting the length of predictor and predictand pairs only results for do and at a lead time of 0 day are shown the forecast cases are displayed chronologically rmsep skill scores are shown in the top right corner fig 10 suggests rmsep skill scores tend to increase slightly for the diminished forecasts with the exception of site 10 on the other hand the 0 10 0 90 uncertainty ranges generally become wider for the diminished forecasts although the magnitude of which is very small thus it reasonable to conclude that forecast uncertainty quantified by bjp will be more stationary in future in light of the increasing achieves of forecast and observation pairs in this study the calibration procedure is carried out without considering any seasonal fluctuation of the water quality parameters the nutrient cycling processes within shallow lakes can be highly effected by hydrometeorological factors such as temperature wind field rainfall inflows and outflows and thus exhibit obvious seasonal patterns as have mentioned before both tn and do concentrations in lake chaohu are much higher in winter than in summer but tp shows a converse pattern fig 2 the bjp method used in this study is a data driven modeling approach and thus might not be suited to address seasonality in such cases calibration models could be built separately for each parameter during different months or seasons and such monthly or seasonal models may perform better than the post processing models described here shrestha et al 2015 however building monthly or seasonal models presupposes the availability of water quality hindcasts that span multiple years 6 summary and conclusions bias free accurate and reliable forecasts of daily water quality parameters are of great value for refined water resources and water environment management of large lakes in this paper we investigated the efficiency of the bayesian joint probability bjp modeling approach in correcting systematic bias improving forecast accuracy and quantifying forecast uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts derived from numerical models our analysis highlights that forecast bias in the raw water quality forecasts have been corrected effectively for all water quality parameters at all lead times the calibration models are the most skillful for tp among the four parameters with an average median value of rmsep skill score of 68 2 across all lead times the rmsep skill scores for nh are generally low with median skill scores range between 2 8 and 10 8 the probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are generally reliable and have appropriate spread and thus correctly characterize forecast uncertainty the post processing framework used in this study can help to better realize the potential of dynamical water quality forecasts the improved accuracy and reliable quantification of uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts suggests that this method could be a useful operational forecasting

cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of water samples at ph 5 5 and 8 5 compared with fac alone the decrease of dbps formation resulted from fast fac decomposition upon led uv365 irradiation a feasible reaction pathway of dbps formation in the led uv365 fac system was examined with density functional theory dft for fac decay during led uv365 fac with effluent from wastewater the residual fac in 15 min was 0 8 mg l lower than limit of 0 2 mg l once initial fac was 2 0 mg l the results indicate that more tests on the balance of target pollutant removal efficiency residual fac and cost should be explored in led uv365 fac system for application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords led uv365 free active chlorine phenacetin acetaminophen disinfection by products 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are representatives of emerging pollutants that can remain biologically active for long periods in aquatic environments tamura et al 2017 ppcps are widely available in waters because they can spread in the environment including human and animal ingestion followed by the excretion and disposal in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents ebele et al 2017 nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are a kind of typical ppcps with anti inflammatory and analgesic effects ebele et al 2017 qi et al 2016 however the vast majority of their metabolites and respective ecotoxicity are either unknown or poorly understood ebele et al 2017 kim et al 2007 among nsaids phenacetin pnt and acetaminophen act have been widely used for more than three decades su et al 2013 xiao and zhang 2016 due to the nature of massive use high solubility multiple pka values and low absorption pnt and act are frequently detected in surface water worldwide changotra et al 2019 wang et al 2019 for example concentration of pnt was reported to be up to 68 3 μg l 1 in dam inlet gumbi et al 2016 in addition 44 0 ng l 1 of pnt was also detected in source water from drinking water purification plants dai et al 2015 in a national survey of trace organic pollutants in australian rivers up to 7 15 μg l 1 of act was detected ebele et al 2017 unfortunately traditional wastewater treatment technologies such as sedimentation clarification and activated sludge process are not effective in removing pnt and act wang et al 2017 a mean concentration of 41 7 ng l 1 for act was identified in effluent from california sewage treatment plants yu et al 2013 therefore developing high effective technologies to degrade nsaids is important and imperative recent studies have revealed that advanced oxidation technologies aops such as fenton reaction ahmad et al 2019 wang et al 2019 ozonation chávez et al 2019 mena et al 2017 and photocatalytic oxidation ali et al 2018 can remove pnt and act efficiently traditional fenton reaction employs h2o2 and fe2 as oxidant and catalyst respectively at acid ph to generate hydroxyl radicals oh e0 1 8 2 7 ev vorontsov 2019 whereas metal ions will be released during fenton reaction causing secondary pollution to downstream water bodies zhang et al 2019b edds ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid was employed as a chelating agent to form complexes with fe ⅱ the quantum yield of reactive radicals produced by the photolysis of 290 400 nm at different ph values of fe iii edds complex was similar indicating that photo fenton processes with fe iii edds complex is effective under neutral ph condition clarizia et al 2017 ozone oxidation utilizes ozone to decompose the refractory macromolecules into small molecules improve the biodegradability of wastewater and reduce the load of subsequent biochemical system sun et al 2019 ozone has very strong oxidation ability as well e0 2 07 ev which can degrade pollutants directly or via producing oh mansouri et al 2019 meanwhile this method has boundedness as ozone is unstable and cannot be stored for a long time however unlike activated carbon and ozone and although photo fenton and heterogeneous photocatalysis processes have been successfully investigated in the removal of ppcps and nsaids from secondary treated urban wastewater they have not yet been applied at full scale rizzo et al 2019 compared with photo fenton oxidation or photocatalysis systems ultraviolet uv photolysis of oxidative reagents such as free available chlorine fac hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfate s2o8 2 was more promising without secondary metal pollution of water tan et al 2013 the molar absorption coefficient of hypochlorous acid hocl 59 m 1cm 1 and hypochlorite ocl 66 m 1cm 1 are higher than that of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 19 m 1cm 1 and persulfate s2o8 2 47 5 m 1cm 1 pan et al 2019 under 254 nm making it more effective in contaminant removal a few studies have revealed that free radicals such as oh eq 1 xiang et al 2016 and reactive chlorine species rcs eqs 2 and 3 are produced in uv fac system kong et al 2018 1 hocl cl o hv oh o cl 2 hocl cl o oh clo h 2 o o h 3 cl c l cl 2 uv lamps are increasingly used in many wastewater treatment plants nevertheless traditionally mercury based uv lamps such as medium pressure mp and low pressure lp lamps possess several drawbacks yet for instance the lamps have short life mp 4000 hours lp 9000 12000 hours do harm to the environment and can be easy to break compared with mercury lamps light emitting diode uv led uv is more environmentally friendly with longer life 26000 h and lower intensity 1 2 w for each matafonova and batoev 2018 furthermore led uv is small sturdy and convenient to transport in addition uv254 has a short wavelength that is harmful to human body short periods of exposure under uv254 could burn the skin and cause changes in the structure of dna which would lead to skin cancer sinha and häder 2002 recently researches have shown that longer wavelengths of uv light within 290 400 nm or usually designated as uva could also activate free chlorine fac to produce rcs hua et al 2019 for contaminant degradation however the kinetic degradation of pollutants by specific wavelength is unknown for uva fac system the wavelength of uv light at 365 nm designated as uv365 in this study is close to sunlight with lower biological risk than that of uv light at 254 nm uv254 ou et al 2016 most studies focused on the photolysis of fac by uv254 tan et al 2013 verma and sillanpää 2015 but few studied the photolysis of fac by uv365 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a additionally according to eqs 4 and 5 ocl could form oxygen atoms o 3p when exposed to visible light 290 400 nm and o 3p could continue to combine with o2 in the air to produce o3 forsyth et al 2013 however the o3 generation in uv fac at selected wavelength of 365 nm is still unknow 4 oc l hv c l o 3 p 5 o 3 p o 2 o 3 in light of the above context this study was undertaken to research the efficiency and kinetics of nsaids removal in led uv365 fac system with a typical wavelength of 365 nm chosen for photolysis furthermore the relative contributions of reactive species and formation mechanism of disinfection by products were evaluated as well the contribution of ozone for pollutant removal is firstly quantitatively evaluated in led uv365 fac system as far as we know 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials the chemicals and materials were displayed in text s1 2 2 reactor configuration the led uv365 devices were made up of nine led bulbs 2 w bulb for a total of 18 w fig s1 the module produced a sole wavelength of 365 nm which is verified using a spectroradiometer fig s2 a total of 12 vertical cooling aluminum plates with a fan on the top of the module were added to control the temperature at room temperature of 20 1 c the reactor was made of quartz dish 10 0 cm in diameter and 4 0 cm in high and placed on a magnetic stirrer a hole with diameter of 1cm was made in the cover of the quartz lid to facilitate sampling with disposable syringes in order to improve uv irradiation upon the reaction solution the led uv365 module was fixed on an iron shelf with the bulb 2 0 cm above the liquid level the uv photon fluence rate of the device was determined to be 1 63 10 3 e m 2 s 1 53 4 mw cm 2 by means of para nitroanisole pna pyridine actinometry text s1 table s1 and fig s3 laszakovits et al 2016 with adsorbed photo fluence rate of 53 35 mw cm 2 bolton et al 2015 2 3 led uv365 free chlorine treatment of pnt and act the reaction solution contains 10 μμ target pnt and act 1 79 mg l as pnt and 1 51 mg l as act buffered with 10 mm phosphate at ph 5 5 7 0 or 8 5 the reaction was initiated by dosing 0 14 mm fac as sodium hypochlorite or naocl 10 mg l as cl2 and exposing the reactor to uv irradiation during the sampling time intervals 1 0 ml solution was sampled into the vials prefilled with 10 μl sodium thiosulfate 3 0 m to terminate the reaction 1 0 μm of nitrobenzene nb benzoate acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were added into the system and employed as probes at different phs xiang et al 2016 to quantify the concentration of ozone generated in the system a mixed solution containing ammonium chloride nh4cl and cinnamic acid was added into the led uv365 fac system at the end of the reaction to keep the concentration at 1 0 mm and 10 0 μm respectively forsyth et al 2013 cinnamic acid could quickly react with ozone in a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio to produce benzaldehyde k o3 cinnamic 3 8 105 m 1s 1 leitzke et al 2001 and nh4cl could quench the remaining fac in the system so that the ozone producing reaction in the system would be terminated without affecting the generated ozone as ozone reacts very slowly with nh3 k o3 nh3 20 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1978 the sample was extracted for benzaldehyde determination after 1 min reaction with cinnamic acid control experiments were conducted to investigate the removal of contaminants by led uv365 or fac alone by exposing the same reaction solutions at the same phs to led uv365 light or fac 140 μμ as10 mg l cl2 in the dark respectively in the alcohol inhibition experiment in addition to target pollutants 10 mm of various alcohols i e tert butanol tba ethanol etoh 3 buten 2ol and 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp were added in system for different aquatic components tests 5 0 mg l of natural organic matter nom suwannee river nom cat no 2r101n or 50 mg l of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 were added in the reaction solution for three phs for lower chlorine dose experiments the initial concentration of fac was set to 0 2 5 0 mg l as cl2 for real wastewater experiments secondary effluent wastewater samples were all collected from one local sewage treatment plant and the water quality parameters were shown in table s2 the oxidation of pollutant in ozone alone system was conducted according to the method reported by previous study tan et al 2020 all the experiments were undertaken in duplicate with buffered agent water solution 10 mm phosphate except real wastewater experiments 2 4 analytical assays the concentrations of pnt and act were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters with uv detector an acquity beh c18 column 1 7 μm 2 1 100 mm was used with a 70 20 10 v v v water acetonitrile methanol as the mobile phase detection wavelength λ of 245 nm flow rate of 0 15 ml min concentrations of nb ba and dmob were determined with a 45 55 v v water with 2 phosphoric acid methanol as the mobile phase detection wavelength λ of 225 nm for ba and dmob λ of 270 nm for nb flow rate of 0 20 ml min the concentrations of benzaldehyde were analyzed in the mobile phase that was composed of water with 0 1 phosphoric acid and acetonitrile the composition of acetonitrile water v v was changed nearly from 0 100 to 50 50 in the first 15 min continuously changed to 100 0 in 5 min maintained at 100 0 for 2 min returned to 0 100 in 0 5 min and then maintained at 0 100 in the following 3 5 min residual concentrations of free chlorine were monitored by dpd colorimetry association 1985 dissolved organic carbon of the filtered samples was determined with a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu tocvcph kyoto japan to assess the mineralization degree of the contaminant solution after the reaction for the analysis of five typical cx3 r dbps including trichloroacetonitrile tcan dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetaldehyde tcal dichloroacetaldehyde dcal and trichloromethane tcm the other three thms such as bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and tribromomethane were under detect limit as no extra bromide was added in system 10 ml of the solution was collected and transferred into a headspace free brown glass bottle the bottle was kept in the dark at temperature 20 c for 24 h afterwards 2 0 ml methyl tertbutyl ether was added for liquid liquid extraction fang et al 2019 the extracts were tested through a shimadzu qp2010 plus gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd kyoto japan and an rtx 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 mm film thickness restek corporation bellefonte usa fang et al 2019 2 5 data processing methods the overall rate law for the degradation of pollutants could be expressed as eq 6 where kobs min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant of the pollutant t min is the reaction time c m is the concentration of the pollutant at t and c0 m is the initial concentration of the pollutant 6 k obs d ln c c 0 dt the toxicity of each dbp could be obtained by eq 7 where c dbp is the concentration of each dbp lc50 m is its semi lethal concentration and m dbp is its relative molecular weight as shown in table s3 xiang et al 2020 7 cytotoxicity c dbp m dbp l c 50 the genotoxicity of each dbp could be calculated by eq 8 where 50 tail dna value m is a genotoxicity index which were published in the chinese hamster ovary cho as shown in table s4 ding et al 2018 8 genotoxicity c dbp m dbp 50 tail dna value the electronic structure of pnt and act were calculated using gaussian 09 software package gaussian inc usa and the m062x hybrid functional at 6 31 tg d p respectively multiwfn3 37 software was used to analyze the frontier electron 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on degradation of pnt and act during led uv365 fac degradation kinetics of the two target compounds during led uv365 fac treatment at various phs were shown in fig 1 with results of the control experiments led uv365 or fac alone provided in fig s4 according to fig s4 the removal of two pollutants by uv alone could be neglected whereas fac alone could degrade two pollutants to a certain extent the degradation efficiency of pnt was 2 2 10 4 and 35 1 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively meanwhile a higher degradation efficiency of 18 0 72 9 and 92 3 was observed in act degradation at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively compared with either led uv365 or fac alone systems led uv365 photolysis of fac enhanced the removal and increased the kobs of both pollutants significantly at all phs as shown in fig 1 the accelerated degradation of pollutants can be ascribed to generation of reactive oxygen or halogen species ros or rcs during photolysis of free chlorine according to eqs 1 3 which would be further investigated below pseudo first order rate constants kobs were determined for degradation of pnt and act during treatment of led uv365 fac and fac alone for each ph condition according to eq 4 with results illustrated in figs 1 and s5 respectively for both systems of led uv365 fac and fac alone the determined values of kobs for each compound at various ph conditions were compared in fig 2 the highest kobs of 2 3 10 1 and 4 7 10 1 min 1 were observed for pnt and act respectively in led uv365 fac system at ph 8 5 also shown in fig 1 and similarly the maximum kobs of pnt and act were also observed at ph 8 5 in fac system as 2 2 10 2 and 3 3 10 1 min 1 respectively also shown in fig s5 fac decay kinetics at three phs in led uv365 fac system were presented in fig s6 and the degradation kinetics of the two target pollutants in the two systems were normalized to fac exposures or ct values and compared in fig s7 at 15 mins the ct values of fac in led uv365 fac system were 88 3 82 3 and 54 3 mg l min at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively whereas 138 6 135 9 and 133 4 mg l min for fac alone system respectively which were much higher than those in led uv365 fac system fig s7 it confirms that the chlorine was largely consumed through photolysis during led uv365 fac treatment as shown in fig s7 the removal of pnt and act in led uv365 fac system was significantly higher than that in fac system at same ct values supporting that in addition to free chlorine other reactive species should also be responsible for pollutant degradation in led uv365 fac system xiang et al 2016 to further estimate the influence of ph on fac decomposition f factor f k w h ka was calculated in led uv365 fac system where k w was the ion product of water and ka was the ionization constant of hocl at 4 10 8 25 c it could be illustrated that the reaction is dominated by the hydrolytic dissociation of oxidant if the f value is proportional to the apparent rate constant of oxidant consumption ball and edwards 1956 according to the calculation f value was 4 3 10 8 1 4 10 7 and 3 2 10 6 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively however there was no linear relationship between the free chlorine decay rate and the f value in inserted fig 2 indicating that a catalytic process radical generation should also be involved at different phs 3 2 reactive species identification during led uv365 fac to identify the reactive species such as oh and rcs in led uv365 fac treatment various probing compounds including nb ba and dmob were employed in the system fig s8 and table s5 it is known that nb is reactive toward only oh k oh nb 4 7 109 m 1s 1 while calcitrant to rcs asmus et al 1967 the nb degradation revealed that oh should be involved in system the k obs of nb degradation k nb in led uv365 fac system was 3 1 10 2 min 1 at ph 7 0 with calculated steady state oh concentration oh ss of 1 10 10 13 m according to eq 9 ba is reactive toward both oh k oh ba 5 3 109 m 1s 1 and cl k cl ba 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 the k obs value regarding to ba degradation k ba was determined as 8 8 10 2 min 1 calculated by eq 10 the steady state concentration of cl cl ss was 4 95 10 14 m at ph 7 0 by excluding the contribution of oh to ba degradation according to the reported data by hua et al 2019 dmob could react with oh cl and clo with second order rate constants of 7 0 109 1 8 1010 and 2 1 109 m 1s 1 respectively additionally nitrogen was injected into the solution in advance to inihib formation of o3 in the system the k obs value regarding to dmob degradation k dmob was determined as 6 02 10 1 min 1 therefore the steady state of clo clo ss at ph 7 0 could be calculated as 3 99 10 12 m by eq 11 9 k nb k oh nb oh ss 10 k ba k oh ba oh ss k cl ba cl ss 11 k dmob k oh dmob oh ss k cl dmob cl ss k clo dmob clo ss scavenging tests with various alcohols were performed to screen the reactive species in the led uv365 fac system figs 3 and s9 it was reported that tba could scavenge oh cl and o 3p with second order rate constants k of 3 8 7 6 108 duan et al 2018 3 0 108 mertens and sonntag 1995 wu et al 2017 and 3 0 107 m 1 s 1 forsyth et al 2013 respectively the kobs of act degradation decreased from 4 1 10 1 to 1 5 10 1 min 1 after 10 0 mm tba was added in led uv365 fac system ethanol etoh could also react with oh cl and o 3p with second order rate constants of 7 7 109 m 1 s 1 tan et al 2019 1 5 109 m 1 s 1 gilbert et al 1988 and 1 52 109 m 1 s 1 determined in this study see text s2 and fig s10 after addition of 10 0 mm etoh the kobs of act degradation fell greatly from 4 1 10 1 to 4 9 10 2 min 1 fig 3 the removal of pnt was also depressed similarly with the scavenge of tba and etoh the quenching effect of etoh was more obvious than that of tba which could be explained as following the rate constant of reactive species oh cl and o 3p with etoh is higher than that with tba leading to a greater inhibition effect at the same dosage therefore both oh cl and o 3p were probably involved in led uv365 fac system according to the results from etoh and tba after adding 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp pnt and act had almost no degradation in the system indicating suppression of all kinds of ros species in the system temp could react with singlet oxygen 1o2 with rate constant of 4 0 107 m 1 s 1 cheng et al 2017 homma et al 2019 however due to lack of information on the rate constant between temp with other radicals oh cl clo cl2 it is hard to determine whether singlet oxygen existed in system or not 3 buten 2ol could react with o3 kobs 7 9 104 m 1 s 1 as well as with oh kobs 6 6 108 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 thus it could quench both o3 and oh generated in the system nist https kinetics nist gov solution with adding of 3 buten 2ol the kobs of act decreased to 6 3 10 3 min 1 while degradation of pnt was completely suppressed kobs 0 indicating that o3 and or oh would probably be involved in the degradation of both target compounds in the alcohol inhibition experiments the kobs of pollutants after adding alcohols such as etoh and tba were smaller than that obtained in fac alone systems the main reason was that in the case of led uv365 fac free chlorine consumption was accelerated leading to lower ct values at the same time point compared with that without irradiation fig s7 3 3 relative contribution analysis of reactive species based on the screening analysis using various alcohols above several reactive species oh o3 fac cl clo and cl2 contributed to the removal of pollutants fig 4 the contribution ratios of oh o3 fac and rcs e g cl clo and cl2 xiang et al 2016 could be determined according to eq 12 12 k p k oh p k o 3 p k fac p k rcs p where k p min 1 was the apparent observed rate constant kapp of pollutant p pnt or act degradation in the system k oh p min 1 k o 3 p min 1 k fac p min 1 and k rcs p min 1 were the observed rate constants at which oh o3 fac and rcs react toward p respectively the contribution ratios of these four reactive species were presented in fig 4 with the calculation methods described below firstly the contribution of oh was determined with applying the probe of nb the experiments were conducted by adding nb 1 0 μm in the system with pollutants pnt 0 act 0 10 0 μm figure s11 presented degradation kinetics of nb at three phs from which the observed degradation rate constants of nb k nb were determined as 3 41 10 2 3 11 10 2 and 9 70 10 3 for ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively at each ph the steady state concentration of oh oh ss m could be calculated by taking the measured k nb into eq 9 xiang et al 2016 which turned out to be 1 21 10 13 1 10 10 13 and 3 44 10 14 m at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively then k oh pnt and k oh act could be calculated by taking the oh ss and the second second order rate constants of oh toward pnt k oh pnt 4 99 109 m 1 s 1 and act k oh act 3 23 109 m 1 s 1 into eq 13 finally the contribution ratios of oh in removing pnt or act could be calculated as k oh pnt or k oh act kobs which turned out to be 48 4 or 17 9 45 7 or 11 3 and 8 6 or 1 8 for ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively the contribution ratio of oh decreased as ph increased which is consistent with the results reported by xiang et al xiang et al 2016 13 k oh p k oh p oh ss o3 concentrations in the system were determined by cinnamic acid as shown in fig s13 o3 concentration rose rapidly in the first 10 minutes then slowed or even decreased at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 the ct value of o3 ct o3 reached 40 7 65 5 and 39 6 μm min at 15 min corresponding to 1 9 3 1 and 1 9 mg l min respectively the obtained ct o3 values were higher than those reported in solar fac system by hua et al 2019 in which the ct value of o3 reached to 0 80 μm min in 90 min in the solar fac system 1 mg l 1 cl2 wavelength of 290 400 nm the relationship between ct o3 and pollutant removal was shown in fig s14 considering the contribution of o3 with same ct values in system the removal ratios of pnt were 1 48 2 39 and 1 45 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively in the led uv365 fac system the removal ratios of pnt in 15 min were 89 39 88 23 and 100 according to fig 1 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively therefore the contributions of o3 in pnt removal were 1 7 2 7 and 1 4 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively at the same time the contribution ratios of o3 in act decomposition were 2 5 3 9 and 2 4 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively the contribution ratios of fac were neglected in most of papers dealing with uv fac system as the pollutants selected in reported papers react slow toward fac or o3 alone such as metronidazole ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 kong et al 2018 wu et al 2017 however in our study fac has a small degradation of pnt but a significant degradation of act fig s4 therefore it is necessary to calculate the contribution ratio of fac to the two pollutants under the same ct values the contribution of fac could be calculated by ct values of fac according to fig s7 at the same ct value of 88 30 mg l min at ph 5 5 act was removed by 15 2 in the absence of led uv365 irradiation dividing over the overall degradation efficiency reached 100 with uv365 irradiation the contribution of chlorine in degrading act was thus 15 2 similarly the contribution of fac in degrading pnt at ph 5 5 was calculated as 2 7 analogously the contribution of fac in pnt and act removal was 3 6 and 54 5 respectively at ph 7 0 and as 13 1 and 84 2 respectively at ph 8 5 finally the observed rate constants of rcs could be calculated by subtracting that of the other species according to eq 12 the contributions of rcs in degrading pnt were 47 3 47 9 and 76 9 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively meanwhile the contribution ratios of rcs in degrading act were 64 4 30 2 and 11 7 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively the contributions of the four reactive species were summarized in figs 4 and s15 expressed as the absolute values of overall observed rate constants or normalized to 100 in total respectively with ph increasing the contribution of oh gradually decreased for both compounds at all three phs and the contribution of oh to act degradation was higher than that to pnt degradation and the contribution of o3 to the degradation of pollutants was less than 5 also at all three phs fac contributed more significantly to the degradation of act than pnt especially at ph 7 0 and 8 5 when degrading pnt rcs contributed more significantly at ph 5 5 than at more alkaline conditions reaching 47 3 whereas considering the degradation of act rcs contributed more significantly at ph 8 5 than at more acid conditions reaching 76 9 3 4 dbp formation during led uv365 fac the concentrations of five typical cx3r type dbps in the led uv365 fac and fac alone systems were evaluated fig 5 a in the absence of led uv365 irradiation the highest concentration of total dbps was determined to be 304 8 μg l 1 at ph 8 5 among the five monitored dbps the proportion of tcm was the highest up to 49 70 followed by dcan at 44 35 the concentration of total dbps was comparatively small at ph 5 5 218 9 μg l 1 and 7 0 181 4 μg l 1 among which dcan accounted for the highest proportion of 70 2 and 62 0 respectively comparing tcm concentrations at various phs it can be found that basic ph was conducive to the formation of tcm agreeing to the widely accepted explanation that the base catalyzed hydrolysis mechanism played an important role in the formation of tcm hua and rechhow 2008 wang et al 2014 in addition the mineralization rate of the system was tested in the study the mineralization ratios of pnt and act for led uv365 fac system at different phs were in range of 18 5 29 2 fig s16 although the removal efficiencies of the two compounds were much higher 88 2 100 at reaction time of 15 min therefore it was confirmed that intermediates are formed in the reaction which was consistent with the experimental results of dbps for led uv365 fac system the minimum total concentration of the five dbps was observed at ph 8 5 120 5 μg l 1 among the three ph conditions while the maximum value of total dbp concentration achieved at ph 7 0 289 9 μg l 1 at all three ph values compared with fac alone systems tcm was more prevalent in led uv365 fac systems accounting for 53 30 58 82 and 73 85 at a ph of 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 corresponding to concentrations of 114 50 μg l 1 170 53 μg l 1 and 89 02 μg l 1 respectively according to the previous study conducted by cerreta et al in wastewater matrix the concentration of tcm produced was less than led uv365 fac systems because of lower contaminant concentration and shorter uv wavelength cerreta et al 2020 additionally nom in wastewater matrix could consume free chlorine which could also decrease the production of tcm as discussed in fig 4 oh owned the higher contribution to pollutant degradation under acidic and neutral conditions compared with basic condition due to higher oh ss in more acidic conditions previous researches showed that the production of oh increased the concentration of tcm de vera et al 2015 young et al 2018 which was consistent with the experimental results here the increase of dbps with led uv365 irradiation at 7 0 was due to the increase of dbps precursors such as low molecule organics after oh rcs and o3 attack dotson et al 2010 kent et al 2011 at ph 8 5 the decrease of total dbps with uv365 irradiation was probably because of rapid chlorine consumption during irradiation resulting in the corresponding decrease of dbps fig s17 showed the results of frontier electro densities fed in homo on atoms of pnt and act the possible sites of chlorine attack in the aromatic ring could be predicted by calculating the sum of hammett constant values σ for the substituents present du et al 2018 it was reported that the site with minimum σ was attacked by chlorine most frequently deborde and von gunten 2008 comparing the unsubstituted ortho and meta positions to the phenolic function sites 1 and 2 of pnt and act fig s18 the most probable sites of chlorine attack on act were the ortho positions to the phenolic function 7c 8c and the most probable sites of chlorine attack on pnt were the meta to the benzamide 6c 7c tcm would probably be formed from the attack of benzene ring ding et al 2018 the obtained tcm concentration decreased at ph 8 5 in led uv365 fac system from the frontier electron density fed in homo on atoms of pnt and act table s6 carbon atom 4c connected to the acetylamino group had the highest fed in pnt 16 78 and act 17 01 indicating that 4c was also substituted by chlorine the acetamide could be formed after 4c was attacked by reactive electrophile oh and dcan and tcan would be formed after chlorination yu and reckhow 2017 in the meantime acetaldehyde was generated after 3n was attacked by reactive electrophile oh and dcal tcal were formed after chlorination the above pathway s proposed for formation of each dbp are illustrated in fig s19 cytotoxicity of dbps in the fac system with and without led uv365 irradiation were calculated under different phs according to lc50 values of five dbps in this research table s3 luo et al 2020 with results shown in fig 5b at ph 5 5 and 8 5 calculated cytotoxicity decreased by introducing led uv365 irradiation in the system from 0 012 to 0 009 at ph 5 5 and from 0 010 to 0 007 at ph 8 5 respectively the lowest calculated cytotoxicity was observed at ph 7 0 which increased from 0 003 to 0 007 by exposing fac to led uv365 irradiation amongst the five dbps dcan and dcal exhibit the highest extents of 5 73 10 5 and 2 93 10 5 value toxicity according to table s3 although the concentration of dcal amongst the total dbps was small 20 μg l 1 in all conditions its strong toxicity made itself occupy a large proportion in the total toxicity it showed that at all the three phs the led uv365 fac could reduce the proportion of dcan and increase the proportion of dcal relative to the total toxicity e g normalized to 100 fig s20 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 the decreasing extent of dcan was much higher than the increasing extent of dcal after introducing led uv365 irradiation into the system leading to declination of the total calculated cytotoxicity at ph 7 0 increase extent of dcal overcome decrease extent of dcan thus the toxicity of total dbps in the solution increased slightly with led uv365 irradiation additionally according to the 50 tail dna values of dcal dcan and tcan table s4 and fig s21 ding et al 2018 wagner and plewa 2017 the genotoxicity values of dbps with or without led uv365 was calculated it could be seen from fig s21 that in the absence of led uv365 the genotoxicity of dcan took up a large proportion about 97 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 while tcan accounted for a large proportion of 65 1 in total genotoxicity at ph 7 0 with participation of led uv365 the total genotoxicity decreased by 58 7 and 91 1 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 respectively meanwhile the genotoxicity increased to 207 0 at ph 7 0 3 5 economy calculation impact of water matrix nom and hco3 the efficiency of led uv365 photolysis of fac in degrading contaminants could also be calculated by electrical energy per order ee o a parameter recommended by the photochemistry commission of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ee o is defined as the electricity in kilowatt hours kwh required to degrade pollutants by one order of magnitude which could be calculated by eq 14 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 tan et al 2017 14 ee o pt 60 v where p is the total electrical power kw t is the time cost h for degradation by one order of magnitude 1 log10 loss and v is the volume of the solution m3 the electric power of the led uv365 module is 0 018 kw and the power adsorbed in solution is 0 00419 kw because there were two pollutants in this research the slower degradation rate of pnt was used as the conservative evaluation standard in the led uv365 fac system the kobs of pnt has a range of 0 1379 to 0 2313 min 1 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 t could be calculated to be 0 28 and 0 16 h respectively therefore when calculating the electric power or the effective power ee o of the led uv365 system has a range of 0 199 0 334 kwh m3 order and 0 046 0 086 kwh m3 order table 1 which is close to the low ranges of 0 017 2 26 kwh m3 order reported in uv254 fac system when degrading 1 μg l ppcps in drinking water with an average uv fluence rate of 0 78 mw cm 2at ph 7 0 guo et al 2018 the results of ee o revealed that uv365 would be one cost effective application for pollutant degradation to evaluate the influence of hco3 and nom on the degradation of pollutants and ee o values in system experiments were conducted on the pollutant solutions containing hco3 and nom with the addition of hco3 or nom the k obs of pnt decreased to 0 087 0 135 and 0 046 0 171 min 1 respectively figs s22 and s23 meanwhile the ee o values increased to 0 34 0 53 and 0 27 1 00 kwh m3 order table s7 the degradation efficiency at lower chlorine dosages in ranges of 0 2 5 0 mg l were explored as well yielding k obs of pnt determined as 0 0005 0 042 min 1 fig s24 and ee o values of 1 10 92 0 kwh m3 order correspondingly table s8 which is close to the results reported by zhou et al 2019 to better understand the water matrix on the efficiency of pollutant degradation in led uv365 fac system as well as the possibility for application of led uv365 fac system as advanced treatment in wastewater treatment the tests of pnt and act degradation in the effluent of wastewater treatment plant were conducted fig s25 the k obs of pnt was 0 0056 min 1 with initial fac dosage of 140 μm 10 mg l as cl2 with ee o values of 8 21 kwh m3 order table s9 the residual fac in matrix of wastewater was 3 7 mg l which is higher than that in pure water 0 3 mg l in fig s6 the removal of pnt was 3 4 7 4 and 11 1 with fac dosage of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively fig s25a at the same time the decomposition of act was 7 6 38 3 and 77 6 with initail fac dosage of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively fig s25b considering for fac decay in system the residual fac in the effluent after 15 min reaction was 0 03 0 8 and 3 7 mg l with initial fac dosage of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively fig s25c the residual fac in 15 min was lower than 0 2 mg l once initial fac was lower than 2 0 mg l the results obtained herein indicated that under initial fac dosage that higher than 2 0 mg l the uv led365 fac processes could not meet the standard for redisual fac of 0 2 mg l in the effluent thouth the target contaminant was degraded effectively compared the values in pure water the decrease of k obs and increase of ee o values in water matrix from wastewater treatment plant indicates that components in matrix would affect the removal efficiency of pollutant the fac decay and cost of the led uv365 fac system as the compounds in matrix such as nom hco3 etc which would compete for the reactive species in water pan et al 2019 4 conclusion the degradation of pnt and act by led uv365 fac system followed pseudo first order kinetics both of which resulted from combination effect of oh o3 fac and rcs with ph increases the contributions of oh and fac decreased and increased respectively with regards to dbp formation it was found that led uv365 could reduce the dbp concentrations in the treated solution and reduce their total cytotoxicity and genotoxicity at both acidic and basic ph conditions additionally economic analysis showed that led uv365 fac system was an economical technology in practical circumstances e g in the presence of nom and hco3 with regards to degradation of micropollutants or more specifically anti inflammatory drugs for the first time the production of o3 and its contribution in degrading target pollutants were quantitatively evaluated at a single wavelength of 365 nm and the second order reaction rate constant of o 3p and ethanol was determined to be 1 52 109 m 1s 1 led uv365 fac system had great potential to be used in advanced treatment of wastewater comparing the two pollutants selected in this study fac contributes to the degradation of act more significantly than that of pnt which seemed to be related to the structures and properties of pollutants on their degradation characteristics and deserve further investigation moreover contribution ratios of various rcs including clo cl and cl2 in degrading model pollutants require further examination by finding approaches to isolate each individual radical generated in led uv365 fac system for future application the effect of matrix in wastewater such as nom or anions should be evaluated for the balance between target pollutant removal and

17607,light emitting diode led is environmentally friendly with longer life compared with traditionally mercury lamps this study investigated the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids phenacetin pnt and acetaminophen act removal during led uv 365 nm photolysis of free available chlorine fac degradation of pnt and act during led uv365 fac treatment at ph 5 5 8 5 followed the pseudo first order kinetics the presence of hydroxyl radicals oh reactive chlorine species rcs and ozone o3 transformed from o 3p were screened by using scavengers of ethanol etoh tert butanol tba and 3 buten 2ol and 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and quantified by competition kinetics with probing compounds of nitrobenzene nb benzoate acid ba 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob higher ph would lead to decrease of oh contribution and an increase of fac contribution to pnt and act degradation it has been determined that the contribution of o3 to degradation of pnt and act was less than 5 for all phs and o3 p reacts toward etoh with second order constant of 1 52 109 m 1s 1 led uv365 fac system reduced the formation of five typical cx3 r type disinfection by products dbps as well as the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of water samples at ph 5 5 and 8 5 compared with fac alone the decrease of dbps formation resulted from fast fac decomposition upon led uv365 irradiation a feasible reaction pathway of dbps formation in the led uv365 fac system was examined with density functional theory dft for fac decay during led uv365 fac with effluent from wastewater the residual fac in 15 min was 0 8 mg l lower than limit of 0 2 mg l once initial fac was 2 0 mg l the results indicate that more tests on the balance of target pollutant removal efficiency residual fac and cost should be explored in led uv365 fac system for application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords led uv365 free active chlorine phenacetin acetaminophen disinfection by products 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are representatives of emerging pollutants that can remain biologically active for long periods in aquatic environments tamura et al 2017 ppcps are widely available in waters because they can spread in the environment including human and animal ingestion followed by the excretion and disposal in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents ebele et al 2017 nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are a kind of typical ppcps with anti inflammatory and analgesic effects ebele et al 2017 qi et al 2016 however the vast majority of their metabolites and respective ecotoxicity are either unknown or poorly understood ebele et al 2017 kim et al 2007 among nsaids phenacetin pnt and acetaminophen act have been widely used for more than three decades su et al 2013 xiao and zhang 2016 due to the nature of massive use high solubility multiple pka values and low absorption pnt and act are frequently detected in surface water worldwide changotra et al 2019 wang et al 2019 for example concentration of pnt was reported to be up to 68 3 μg l 1 in dam inlet gumbi et al 2016 in addition 44 0 ng l 1 of pnt was also detected in source water from drinking water purification plants dai et al 2015 in a national survey of trace organic pollutants in australian rivers up to 7 15 μg l 1 of act was detected ebele et al 2017 unfortunately traditional wastewater treatment technologies such as sedimentation clarification and activated sludge process are not effective in removing pnt and act wang et al 2017 a mean concentration of 41 7 ng l 1 for act was identified in effluent from california sewage treatment plants yu et al 2013 therefore developing high effective technologies to degrade nsaids is important and imperative recent studies have revealed that advanced oxidation technologies aops such as fenton reaction ahmad et al 2019 wang et al 2019 ozonation chávez et al 2019 mena et al 2017 and photocatalytic oxidation ali et al 2018 can remove pnt and act efficiently traditional fenton reaction employs h2o2 and fe2 as oxidant and catalyst respectively at acid ph to generate hydroxyl radicals oh e0 1 8 2 7 ev vorontsov 2019 whereas metal ions will be released during fenton reaction causing secondary pollution to downstream water bodies zhang et al 2019b edds ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid was employed as a chelating agent to form complexes with fe ⅱ the quantum yield of reactive radicals produced by the photolysis of 290 400 nm at different ph values of fe iii edds complex was similar indicating that photo fenton processes with fe iii edds complex is effective under neutral ph condition clarizia et al 2017 ozone oxidation utilizes ozone to decompose the refractory macromolecules into small molecules improve the biodegradability of wastewater and reduce the load of subsequent biochemical system sun et al 2019 ozone has very strong oxidation ability as well e0 2 07 ev which can degrade pollutants directly or via producing oh mansouri et al 2019 meanwhile this method has boundedness as ozone is unstable and cannot be stored for a long time however unlike activated carbon and ozone and although photo fenton and heterogeneous photocatalysis processes have been successfully investigated in the removal of ppcps and nsaids from secondary treated urban wastewater they have not yet been applied at full scale rizzo et al 2019 compared with photo fenton oxidation or photocatalysis systems ultraviolet uv photolysis of oxidative reagents such as free available chlorine fac hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfate s2o8 2 was more promising without secondary metal pollution of water tan et al 2013 the molar absorption coefficient of hypochlorous acid hocl 59 m 1cm 1 and hypochlorite ocl 66 m 1cm 1 are higher than that of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 19 m 1cm 1 and persulfate s2o8 2 47 5 m 1cm 1 pan et al 2019 under 254 nm making it more effective in contaminant removal a few studies have revealed that free radicals such as oh eq 1 xiang et al 2016 and reactive chlorine species rcs eqs 2 and 3 are produced in uv fac system kong et al 2018 1 hocl cl o hv oh o cl 2 hocl cl o oh clo h 2 o o h 3 cl c l cl 2 uv lamps are increasingly used in many wastewater treatment plants nevertheless traditionally mercury based uv lamps such as medium pressure mp and low pressure lp lamps possess several drawbacks yet for instance the lamps have short life mp 4000 hours lp 9000 12000 hours do harm to the environment and can be easy to break compared with mercury lamps light emitting diode uv led uv is more environmentally friendly with longer life 26000 h and lower intensity 1 2 w for each matafonova and batoev 2018 furthermore led uv is small sturdy and convenient to transport in addition uv254 has a short wavelength that is harmful to human body short periods of exposure under uv254 could burn the skin and cause changes in the structure of dna which would lead to skin cancer sinha and häder 2002 recently researches have shown that longer wavelengths of uv light within 290 400 nm or usually designated as uva could also activate free chlorine fac to produce rcs hua et al 2019 for contaminant degradation however the kinetic degradation of pollutants by specific wavelength is unknown for uva fac system the wavelength of uv light at 365 nm designated as uv365 in this study is close to sunlight with lower biological risk than that of uv light at 254 nm uv254 ou et al 2016 most studies focused on the photolysis of fac by uv254 tan et al 2013 verma and sillanpää 2015 but few studied the photolysis of fac by uv365 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a additionally according to eqs 4 and 5 ocl could form oxygen atoms o 3p when exposed to visible light 290 400 nm and o 3p could continue to combine with o2 in the air to produce o3 forsyth et al 2013 however the o3 generation in uv fac at selected wavelength of 365 nm is still unknow 4 oc l hv c l o 3 p 5 o 3 p o 2 o 3 in light of the above context this study was undertaken to research the efficiency and kinetics of nsaids removal in led uv365 fac system with a typical wavelength of 365 nm chosen for photolysis furthermore the relative contributions of reactive species and formation mechanism of disinfection by products were evaluated as well the contribution of ozone for pollutant removal is firstly quantitatively evaluated in led uv365 fac system as far as we know 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials the chemicals and materials were displayed in text s1 2 2 reactor configuration the led uv365 devices were made up of nine led bulbs 2 w bulb for a total of 18 w fig s1 the module produced a sole wavelength of 365 nm which is verified using a spectroradiometer fig s2 a total of 12 vertical cooling aluminum plates with a fan on the top of the module were added to control the temperature at room temperature of 20 1 c the reactor was made of quartz dish 10 0 cm in diameter and 4 0 cm in high and placed on a magnetic stirrer a hole with diameter of 1cm was made in the cover of the quartz lid to facilitate sampling with disposable syringes in order to improve uv irradiation upon the reaction solution the led uv365 module was fixed on an iron shelf with the bulb 2 0 cm above the liquid level the uv photon fluence rate of the device was determined to be 1 63 10 3 e m 2 s 1 53 4 mw cm 2 by means of para nitroanisole pna pyridine actinometry text s1 table s1 and fig s3 laszakovits et al 2016 with adsorbed photo fluence rate of 53 35 mw cm 2 bolton et al 2015 2 3 led uv365 free chlorine treatment of pnt and act the reaction solution contains 10 μμ target pnt and act 1 79 mg l as pnt and 1 51 mg l as act buffered with 10 mm phosphate at ph 5 5 7 0 or 8 5 the reaction was initiated by dosing 0 14 mm fac as sodium hypochlorite or naocl 10 mg l as cl2 and exposing the reactor to uv irradiation during the sampling time intervals 1 0 ml solution was sampled into the vials prefilled with 10 μl sodium thiosulfate 3 0 m to terminate the reaction 1 0 μm of nitrobenzene nb benzoate acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were added into the system and employed as probes at different phs xiang et al 2016 to quantify the concentration of ozone generated in the system a mixed solution containing ammonium chloride nh4cl and cinnamic acid was added into the led uv365 fac system at the end of the reaction to keep the concentration at 1 0 mm and 10 0 μm respectively forsyth et al 2013 cinnamic acid could quickly react with ozone in a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio to produce benzaldehyde k o3 cinnamic 3 8 105 m 1s 1 leitzke et al 2001 and nh4cl could quench the remaining fac in the system so that the ozone producing reaction in the system would be terminated without affecting the generated ozone as ozone reacts very slowly with nh3 k o3 nh3 20 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1978 the sample was extracted for benzaldehyde determination after 1 min reaction with cinnamic acid control experiments were conducted to investigate the removal of contaminants by led uv365 or fac alone by exposing the same reaction solutions at the same phs to led uv365 light or fac 140 μμ as10 mg l cl2 in the dark respectively in the alcohol inhibition experiment in addition to target pollutants 10 mm of various alcohols i e tert butanol tba ethanol etoh 3 buten 2ol and 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp were added in system for different aquatic components tests 5 0 mg l of natural organic matter nom suwannee river nom cat no 2r101n or 50 mg l of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 were added in the reaction solution for three phs for lower chlorine dose experiments the initial concentration of fac was set to 0 2 5 0 mg l as cl2 for real wastewater experiments secondary effluent wastewater samples were all collected from one local sewage treatment plant and the water quality parameters were shown in table s2 the oxidation of pollutant in ozone alone system was conducted according to the method reported by previous study tan et al 2020 all the experiments were undertaken in duplicate with buffered agent water solution 10 mm phosphate except real wastewater experiments 2 4 analytical assays the concentrations of pnt and act were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters with uv detector an acquity beh c18 column 1 7 μm 2

a 45 55 v v water with 2 phosphoric acid methanol as the mobile phase detection wavelength λ of 225 nm for ba and dmob λ of 270 nm for nb flow rate of 0 20 ml min the concentrations of benzaldehyde were analyzed in the mobile phase that was composed of water with 0 1 phosphoric acid and acetonitrile the composition of acetonitrile water v v was changed nearly from 0 100 to 50 50 in the first 15 min continuously changed to 100 0 in 5 min maintained at 100 0 for 2 min returned to 0 100 in 0 5 min and then maintained at 0 100 in the following 3 5 min residual concentrations of free chlorine were monitored by dpd colorimetry association 1985 dissolved organic carbon of the filtered samples was determined with a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu tocvcph kyoto japan to assess the mineralization degree of the contaminant solution after the reaction for the analysis of five typical cx3 r dbps including trichloroacetonitrile tcan dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetaldehyde tcal dichloroacetaldehyde dcal and trichloromethane tcm the other three thms such as bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and tribromomethane were under detect limit as no extra bromide was added in system 10 ml of the solution was collected and transferred into a headspace free brown glass bottle the bottle was kept in the dark at temperature 20 c for 24 h afterwards 2 0 ml methyl tertbutyl ether was added for liquid liquid extraction fang et al 2019 the extracts were tested through a shimadzu qp2010 plus gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd kyoto japan and an rtx 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 mm film thickness restek corporation bellefonte usa fang et al 2019 2 5 data processing methods the overall rate law for the degradation of pollutants could be expressed as eq 6 where kobs min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant of the pollutant t min is the reaction time c m is the concentration of the pollutant at t and c0 m is the initial concentration of the pollutant 6 k obs d ln c c 0 dt the toxicity of each dbp could be obtained by eq 7 where c dbp is the concentration of each dbp lc50 m is its semi lethal concentration and m dbp is its relative molecular weight as shown in table s3 xiang et al 2020 7 cytotoxicity c dbp m dbp l c 50 the genotoxicity of each dbp could be calculated by eq 8 where 50 tail dna value m is a genotoxicity index which were published in the chinese hamster ovary cho as shown in table s4 ding et al 2018 8 genotoxicity c dbp m dbp 50 tail dna value the electronic structure of pnt and act were calculated using gaussian 09 software package gaussian inc usa and the m062x hybrid functional at 6 31 tg d p respectively multiwfn3 37 software was used to analyze the frontier electron 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on degradation of pnt and act during led uv365 fac degradation kinetics of the two target compounds during led uv365 fac treatment at various phs were shown in fig 1 with results of the control experiments led uv365 or fac alone provided in fig s4 according to fig s4 the removal of two pollutants by uv alone could be neglected whereas fac alone could degrade two pollutants to a certain extent the degradation efficiency of pnt was 2 2 10 4 and 35 1 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively meanwhile a higher degradation efficiency of 18 0 72 9 and 92 3 was observed in act degradation at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively compared with either led uv365 or fac alone systems led uv365 photolysis of fac enhanced the removal and increased the kobs of both pollutants significantly at all phs as shown in fig 1 the accelerated degradation of pollutants can be ascribed to generation of reactive oxygen or halogen species ros or rcs during photolysis of free chlorine according to eqs 1 3 which would be further investigated below pseudo first order rate constants kobs were determined for degradation of pnt and act during treatment of led uv365 fac and fac alone for each ph condition according to eq 4 with results illustrated in figs 1 and s5 respectively for both systems of led uv365 fac and fac alone the determined values of kobs for each compound at various ph conditions were compared in fig 2 the highest kobs of 2 3 10 1 and 4 7 10 1 min 1 were observed for pnt and act respectively in led uv365 fac system at ph 8 5 also shown in fig 1 and similarly the maximum kobs of pnt and act were also observed at ph 8 5 in fac system as 2 2 10 2 and 3 3 10 1 min 1 respectively also shown in fig s5 fac decay kinetics at three phs in led uv365 fac system were presented in fig s6 and the degradation kinetics of the two target pollutants in the two systems were normalized to fac exposures or ct values and compared in fig s7 at 15 mins the ct values of fac in led uv365 fac system were 88 3 82 3 and 54 3 mg l min at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively whereas 138 6 135 9 and 133 4 mg l min for fac alone system respectively which were much higher than those in led uv365 fac system fig s7 it confirms that the chlorine was largely consumed through photolysis during led uv365 fac treatment as shown in fig s7 the removal of pnt and act in led uv365 fac system was significantly higher than that in fac system at same ct values supporting that in addition to free chlorine other reactive species should also be responsible for pollutant degradation in led uv365 fac system xiang et al 2016 to further estimate the influence of ph on fac decomposition f factor f k w h ka was calculated in led uv365 fac system where k w was the ion product of water and ka was the ionization constant of hocl at 4 10 8 25 c it could be illustrated that the reaction is dominated by the hydrolytic dissociation of oxidant if the f value is proportional to the apparent rate constant of oxidant consumption ball and edwards 1956 according to the calculation f value was 4 3 10 8 1 4 10 7 and 3 2 10 6 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively however there was no linear relationship between the free chlorine decay rate and the f value in inserted fig 2 indicating that a catalytic process radical generation should also be involved at different phs 3 2 reactive species identification during led uv365 fac to identify the reactive species such as oh and rcs in led uv365 fac treatment various probing compounds including nb ba and dmob were employed in the system fig s8 and table s5 it is known that nb is reactive toward only oh k oh nb 4 7 109 m 1s 1 while calcitrant to rcs asmus et al 1967 the nb degradation revealed that oh should be involved in system the k obs of nb degradation k nb in led uv365 fac system was 3 1 10 2 min 1 at ph 7 0 with calculated steady state oh concentration oh ss of 1 10 10 13 m according to eq 9 ba is reactive toward both oh k oh ba 5 3 109 m 1s 1 and cl k cl ba 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 the k obs value regarding to ba degradation k ba was determined as 8 8 10 2 min 1 calculated by eq 10 the steady state concentration of cl cl ss was 4 95 10 14 m at ph 7 0 by excluding the contribution of oh to ba degradation according to the reported data by hua et al 2019 dmob could react with oh cl and clo with second order rate constants of 7 0 109 1 8 1010 and 2 1 109 m 1s 1 respectively additionally nitrogen was injected into the solution in advance to inihib formation of o3 in the system the k obs value regarding to dmob degradation k dmob was determined as 6 02 10 1 min 1 therefore the steady state of clo clo ss at ph 7 0 could be calculated as 3 99 10 12 m by eq 11 9 k nb k oh nb oh ss 10 k ba k oh ba oh ss k cl ba cl ss 11 k dmob k oh dmob oh ss k cl dmob cl ss k clo dmob clo ss scavenging tests with various alcohols were performed to screen the reactive species in the led uv365 fac system figs 3 and s9 it was reported that tba could scavenge oh cl and o 3p with second order rate constants k of 3 8 7 6 108 duan et al 2018 3 0 108 mertens and sonntag 1995 wu et al 2017 and 3 0 107 m 1 s 1 forsyth et al 2013 respectively the kobs of act degradation decreased from 4 1 10 1 to 1 5 10 1 min 1 after 10 0 mm tba was added in led uv365 fac system ethanol etoh could also react with oh cl and o 3p with second order rate constants of 7 7 109 m 1 s 1 tan et al 2019 1 5 109 m 1 s 1 gilbert et al 1988 and 1 52 109 m 1 s 1 determined in this study see text s2 and fig s10 after addition of 10 0 mm etoh the kobs of act degradation fell greatly from 4 1 10 1 to 4 9 10 2 min 1 fig 3 the removal of pnt was also depressed similarly with the scavenge of tba and etoh the quenching effect of etoh was more obvious than that of tba which could be explained as following the rate constant of reactive species oh cl and o 3p with etoh is higher than that with tba leading to a greater inhibition effect at the same dosage therefore both oh cl and o 3p were probably involved in led uv365 fac system according to the results from etoh and tba after adding 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp pnt and act had almost no degradation in the system indicating suppression of all kinds of ros species in the system temp could react with singlet oxygen 1o2 with rate constant of 4 0 107 m 1 s 1 cheng et al 2017 homma et al 2019 however due to lack of information on the rate constant between temp with other radicals oh cl clo cl2 it is hard to determine whether singlet oxygen existed in system or not 3 buten 2ol could react with o3 kobs 7 9 104 m 1 s 1 as well as with oh kobs 6 6 108 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 thus it could quench both o3 and oh generated in the system nist https kinetics nist gov solution with adding of 3 buten 2ol the kobs of act decreased to 6 3 10 3 min 1 while degradation of pnt was completely suppressed kobs 0 indicating that o3 and or oh would probably be involved in the degradation of both target compounds in the alcohol inhibition experiments the kobs of pollutants after adding alcohols such as etoh and tba were smaller than that obtained in fac alone systems the main reason was that in the case of led uv365 fac free chlorine consumption was accelerated leading to lower ct values at the same time point compared with that without irradiation fig s7 3 3 relative contribution analysis of reactive species based on the screening analysis using various alcohols above several reactive species oh o3 fac cl clo and cl2 contributed to the removal of pollutants fig 4 the contribution ratios of oh o3 fac and rcs e g cl clo and cl2 xiang et al 2016 could be determined according to eq 12 12 k p k oh p k o 3 p k fac p k rcs p where k p min 1 was the apparent observed rate constant kapp of pollutant p pnt or act degradation in the system k oh p min 1 k o 3 p min 1 k fac p min 1 and k rcs p min 1 were the observed rate constants at which oh o3 fac and rcs react toward p respectively the contribution ratios of these four reactive species were presented in fig 4 with the calculation methods described below firstly the contribution of oh was determined with applying the probe of nb the experiments were conducted by adding nb 1 0 μm in the system with pollutants pnt 0 act 0 10 0 μm figure s11 presented degradation kinetics of nb at three phs from which the observed degradation rate constants of nb k nb were determined as 3 41 10 2 3 11 10 2 and 9 70 10 3 for ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively at each ph the steady state concentration of oh oh ss m could be calculated by taking the measured k nb into eq 9 xiang et al 2016 which turned out to be 1 21 10 13 1 10 10 13 and 3 44 10 14 m at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively then k oh pnt and k oh act could be calculated by taking the oh ss and the second second order rate constants of oh toward pnt k oh pnt 4 99 109 m 1 s 1 and act k oh act 3 23 109 m 1 s 1 into eq 13 finally the contribution ratios of oh in removing pnt or act could be calculated as k oh pnt or k oh act kobs which turned out to be 48 4 or 17 9 45 7 or 11 3 and 8 6 or 1 8 for ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively the contribution ratio of oh decreased as ph increased which is consistent with the results reported by xiang et al xiang et al 2016 13 k oh p k oh p oh ss o3 concentrations in the system were determined by cinnamic acid as shown in fig s13 o3 concentration rose rapidly in the first 10 minutes then slowed or even decreased at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 the ct value of o3 ct o3 reached 40 7 65 5 and 39 6 μm min at 15 min corresponding to 1 9 3 1 and 1 9 mg l min respectively the obtained ct o3 values were higher than those reported in solar fac system by hua et al 2019 in which the ct value of o3 reached to 0 80 μm min in 90 min in the solar fac system 1 mg l 1 cl2 wavelength of 290 400 nm the relationship between ct o3 and pollutant removal was shown in fig s14 considering the contribution of o3 with same ct values in system the removal ratios of pnt were 1 48 2 39 and 1 45 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively in the led uv365 fac system the removal ratios of pnt in 15 min were 89 39 88 23 and 100 according to fig 1 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively therefore the contributions of o3 in pnt removal were 1 7 2 7 and 1 4 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively at the same time the contribution ratios of o3 in act decomposition were 2 5 3 9 and 2 4 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively the contribution ratios of fac were neglected in most of papers dealing with uv fac system as the pollutants selected in reported papers react slow toward fac or o3 alone such as metronidazole ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 kong et al 2018 wu et al 2017 however in our study fac has a small degradation of pnt but a significant degradation of act fig s4 therefore it is necessary to calculate the contribution ratio of fac to the two pollutants under the same ct values the contribution of fac could be calculated by ct values of fac according to fig s7 at the same ct value of 88 30 mg l min at ph 5 5 act was removed by 15 2 in the absence of led uv365 irradiation dividing over the overall degradation efficiency reached 100 with uv365 irradiation the contribution of chlorine in degrading act was thus 15 2 similarly the contribution of fac in degrading pnt at ph 5 5 was calculated as 2 7 analogously the contribution of fac in pnt and act removal was 3 6 and 54 5 respectively at ph 7 0 and as 13 1 and 84 2 respectively at ph 8 5 finally the observed rate constants of rcs could be calculated by subtracting that of the other species according to eq 12 the contributions of rcs in degrading pnt were 47 3 47 9 and 76 9 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively meanwhile the contribution ratios of rcs in degrading act were 64 4 30 2 and 11 7 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively the contributions of the four reactive species were summarized in figs 4 and s15 expressed as the absolute values of overall observed rate constants or normalized to 100 in total respectively with ph increasing the contribution of oh gradually decreased for both compounds at all three phs and the contribution of oh to act degradation was higher than that to pnt degradation and the contribution of o3 to the degradation of pollutants was less than 5 also at all three phs fac contributed more significantly to the degradation of act than pnt especially at ph 7 0 and 8 5 when degrading pnt rcs contributed more significantly at ph 5 5 than at more alkaline conditions reaching 47 3 whereas considering the degradation of act rcs contributed more significantly at ph 8 5 than at more acid conditions reaching 76 9 3 4 dbp formation during led uv365 fac the concentrations of five typical cx3r type dbps in the led uv365 fac and fac alone systems were evaluated fig 5 a in the absence of led uv365 irradiation the highest concentration of total dbps was determined to be 304 8 μg l 1 at ph 8 5 among the five monitored dbps the proportion of tcm was the highest up to 49 70 followed by dcan at 44 35 the concentration of total dbps was comparatively small at ph 5 5 218 9 μg l 1 and 7 0 181 4 μg l 1 among which dcan accounted for the highest proportion of 70 2 and 62 0 respectively comparing tcm concentrations at various phs it can be found that basic ph was conducive to the formation of tcm agreeing to the widely accepted explanation that the base catalyzed hydrolysis mechanism played an important role in the formation of tcm hua and rechhow 2008 wang et al 2014 in addition the mineralization rate of the system was tested in the study the mineralization ratios of pnt and act for led uv365 fac system at different phs were in range of 18 5 29 2 fig s16 although the removal efficiencies of the two compounds were much higher 88 2 100 at reaction time of 15 min therefore it was confirmed that intermediates are formed in the reaction which was consistent with the experimental results of dbps for led uv365 fac system the minimum total concentration of the five dbps was observed at ph 8 5 120 5 μg l 1 among the three ph conditions while the maximum value of total dbp concentration achieved at ph 7 0 289 9 μg l 1 at all three ph values compared with fac alone systems tcm was more prevalent in led uv365 fac systems accounting for 53 30 58 82 and 73 85 at a ph of 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 corresponding to concentrations of 114 50 μg l 1 170 53 μg l 1 and 89 02 μg l 1 respectively according to the previous study conducted by cerreta et al in wastewater matrix the concentration of tcm produced was less than led uv365 fac systems because of lower contaminant concentration and shorter uv wavelength cerreta et al 2020 additionally nom in wastewater matrix could consume free chlorine which could also decrease the production of tcm as discussed in fig 4 oh owned the higher contribution to pollutant degradation under acidic and neutral conditions compared with basic condition due to higher oh ss in more acidic conditions previous researches showed that the production of oh increased the concentration of tcm de vera et al 2015 young et al 2018 which was consistent with the experimental results here the increase of dbps with led uv365 irradiation at 7 0 was due to the increase of dbps precursors such as low molecule organics after oh rcs and o3 attack dotson et al 2010 kent et al 2011 at ph 8 5 the decrease of total dbps with uv365 irradiation was probably because of rapid chlorine consumption during irradiation resulting in the corresponding decrease of dbps fig s17 showed the results of frontier electro densities fed in homo on atoms of pnt and act the possible sites of chlorine attack in the aromatic ring could be predicted by calculating the sum of hammett constant values σ for the substituents present du et al 2018 it was reported that the site with minimum σ was attacked by chlorine most frequently deborde and von gunten 2008 comparing the unsubstituted ortho and meta positions to the phenolic function sites 1 and 2 of pnt and act fig s18 the most probable sites of chlorine attack on act were the ortho positions to the phenolic function 7c 8c and the most probable sites of chlorine attack on pnt were the meta to the benzamide 6c 7c tcm would probably be formed from the attack of benzene ring ding et al 2018 the obtained tcm concentration decreased at ph 8 5 in led uv365 fac system from the frontier electron density fed in homo on atoms of pnt and act table s6 carbon atom 4c connected to the acetylamino group had the highest fed in pnt 16 78 and act 17 01 indicating that 4c was also substituted by chlorine the acetamide could be formed after 4c was attacked by reactive electrophile oh and dcan and tcan would be formed after chlorination yu and reckhow 2017 in the meantime acetaldehyde was generated after 3n was attacked by reactive electrophile oh and dcal tcal were formed after chlorination the above pathway s proposed for formation of each dbp are illustrated in fig s19 cytotoxicity of dbps in the fac system with and without led uv365 irradiation were calculated under different phs according to lc50 values of five dbps in this research table s3 luo et al 2020 with results shown in fig 5b at ph 5 5 and 8 5 calculated cytotoxicity decreased by introducing led uv365 irradiation in the system from 0 012 to 0 009 at ph 5 5 and from 0 010 to 0 007 at ph 8 5 respectively the lowest calculated cytotoxicity was observed at ph 7 0 which increased from 0 003 to 0 007 by exposing fac to led uv365 irradiation amongst the five dbps dcan and dcal exhibit the highest extents of 5 73 10 5 and 2 93 10 5 value toxicity according to table s3 although the concentration of dcal amongst the total dbps was small 20 μg l 1 in all conditions its strong toxicity made itself occupy a large proportion in the total toxicity it showed that at all the three phs the led uv365 fac could reduce the proportion of dcan and increase the proportion of dcal relative to the total toxicity e g normalized to 100 fig s20 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 the decreasing extent of dcan was much higher than the increasing extent of dcal after introducing led uv365 irradiation into the system leading to declination of the total calculated cytotoxicity at ph 7 0 increase extent of dcal overcome decrease extent of dcan thus the toxicity of total dbps in the solution increased slightly with led uv365 irradiation additionally according to the 50 tail dna values of dcal dcan and tcan table s4 and fig s21 ding et al 2018 wagner and plewa 2017 the genotoxicity values of dbps with or without led uv365 was calculated it could be seen from fig s21 that in the absence of led uv365 the genotoxicity of dcan took up a large proportion about 97 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 while tcan accounted for a large proportion of 65 1 in total genotoxicity at ph 7 0 with participation of led uv365 the total genotoxicity decreased by 58 7 and 91 1 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 respectively meanwhile the genotoxicity increased to 207 0 at ph 7 0 3 5 economy calculation impact of water matrix nom and hco3 the efficiency of led uv365 photolysis of fac in degrading contaminants could also be calculated by electrical energy per order ee o a parameter recommended by the photochemistry commission of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ee o is defined as the electricity in kilowatt hours kwh required to degrade pollutants by one order of magnitude which could be calculated by eq 14 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 tan et al 2017 14 ee o pt 60 v where p is the total electrical power kw t is the time cost h for degradation by one order of magnitude 1 log10 loss and v is the volume of the solution m3 the electric power of the led uv365 module is 0 018 kw and the power adsorbed in solution is 0 00419 kw because there were two pollutants in this research the slower degradation rate of pnt was used as the conservative evaluation standard in the led uv365 fac system the kobs of pnt has a range of 0 1379 to 0 2313 min 1 at ph 5 5 and 8 5 t could be calculated to be 0 28 and 0 16 h respectively therefore when calculating the electric power or the effective power ee o of the led uv365 system has a range of 0 199 0 334 kwh m3 order and 0 046 0 086 kwh m3 order table 1 which is close to the low ranges of 0 017 2 26 kwh m3 order reported in uv254 fac system when degrading 1 μg l ppcps in drinking water with an average uv fluence rate of 0 78 mw cm 2at ph 7 0 guo et al 2018 the results of ee o revealed that uv365 would be one cost effective application for pollutant degradation to evaluate the influence of hco3 and nom on the degradation of pollutants and ee o values in system experiments were conducted on the pollutant solutions containing hco3 and nom with the addition of hco3 or nom the k obs of pnt decreased to 0 087 0 135 and 0 046 0 171 min 1 respectively figs s22 and s23 meanwhile the ee o values increased to 0 34 0 53 and 0 27 1 00 kwh m3 order table s7 the degradation efficiency at lower chlorine dosages in ranges of 0 2 5 0 mg l were explored as well yielding k obs of pnt determined as 0 0005 0 042 min 1 fig s24 and ee o values of 1 10 92 0 kwh m3 order correspondingly table s8 which is close to the results reported by zhou et al 2019 to better understand the water matrix on the efficiency of pollutant degradation in led uv365 fac system as well as the possibility for application of led uv365 fac system as advanced treatment in wastewater treatment the tests of pnt and act degradation in the effluent of wastewater treatment plant were conducted fig s25 the k obs of pnt was 0 0056 min 1 with initial fac dosage of 140 μm 10 mg l as cl2 with ee o values of 8 21 kwh m3 order table s9 the residual fac in matrix of wastewater was 3 7 mg l which is higher than that in pure water 0 3 mg l in fig s6 the removal of pnt was 3 4 7 4 and 11 1 with fac dosage of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively fig s25a at the same time the decomposition of act was 7 6 38 3 and 77 6 with initail fac dosage of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively fig s25b considering for fac decay in system the residual fac in the effluent after 15 min reaction was 0 03 0 8 and 3 7 mg l with initial fac dosage of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively fig s25c the residual fac in 15 min was lower than 0 2 mg l once initial fac was lower than 2 0 mg l the results obtained herein indicated that under initial fac dosage that higher than 2 0 mg l the uv led365 fac processes could not meet the standard for redisual fac of 0 2 mg l in the effluent thouth the target contaminant was degraded effectively compared the values in pure water the decrease of k obs and increase of ee o values in water matrix from wastewater treatment plant indicates that components in matrix would affect the removal efficiency of pollutant the fac decay and cost of the led uv365 fac system as the compounds in matrix such as nom hco3 etc which would compete for the reactive species in water pan et al 2019 4 conclusion the degradation of pnt and act by led uv365 fac system followed pseudo first order kinetics both of which resulted from combination effect of oh o3 fac and rcs with ph increases the contributions of oh and fac decreased and increased respectively with regards to dbp formation it was found that led uv365 could reduce the dbp concentrations in the treated solution and reduce their total cytotoxicity and genotoxicity at both acidic and basic ph conditions additionally economic analysis showed that led uv365 fac system was an economical technology in practical circumstances e g in the presence of nom and hco3 with regards to degradation of micropollutants or more specifically anti inflammatory drugs for the first time the production of o3 and its contribution in degrading target pollutants were quantitatively evaluated at a single wavelength of 365 nm and the second order reaction rate constant of o 3p and ethanol was determined to be 1 52 109 m 1s 1 led uv365 fac system had great potential to be used in advanced treatment of wastewater comparing the two pollutants selected in this study fac contributes to the degradation of act more significantly than that of pnt which seemed to be related to the structures and properties of pollutants on their degradation characteristics and deserve further investigation moreover contribution ratios of various rcs including clo cl and cl2 in degrading model pollutants require further examination by finding approaches to isolate each individual radical generated in led uv365 fac system for future application the effect of matrix in wastewater such as nom or anions should be evaluated for the balance between target pollutant removal and

17608,the widely occurring debris of plastic materials particularly microplastics can be an important source of flame retardants which are one of the main groups of chemicals added in the production of plastics from polymers this review provides an overview on the use of flame retardants in plastic manufacturing the kinetics of their releases from microplastics the factors affecting their releases and the potential environmental and ecosystem risk of the released flame retardants the releases of flame retardants from microplastics typically involve three major steps internal diffusion mass transfer across the plastic medium boundary layer and diffusion in the environmental medium while the overall mass transfer rate is commonly controlled by diffusion within the plastic matrix the overall release rates of additive flame retardants from microplastics which are dependent on the particle s geometry can often be described by the fick s law the physicochemical properties of flame retardant and plastic matrix and ambient temperature all affect the release rate which can be predicted with empirical and semi empirical models weathering of microplastics which reduces their particle sizes and likely disrupts their polymeric structures can greatly accelerate the releases of flame retardants flame retardants could also be released directly from the microplastics ingested by aquatic organisms and seabirds with physical and chemical digestion in the bodies significantly enhancing their release rates limited by the extremely slow diffusion in plastic matrices the fluxes of flame retardants released from microplastics are very low and are unlikely to pose significant risk to the ecosystem in general more research is needed to characterize the mechanical chemical and biological processes that degrade microplastics and accelerate the releases of flame retardants and to model their release kinetics from microplastics while efforts should also be made to develop environmentally benign flame retardants to ultimately minimize their risk to the environment and ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics flame retardants release kinetics internal diffusion fick s law ecosystem risk 1 introduction plastics are polymers with various additives nouman et al 2017 due to their excellent chemical stability electrical insulation characteristics easiness to process and low cost plastics have been widely used in the electronics construction transportation and packaging industries and they have brought significant medical and technological advances energy conservation and other societal benefits plasticseurope 2019 rodrigues et al 2019 xia et al 2020 yeo et al 2020 as a result the production volume of plastics had increased consistently from around 0 5 million tonnes in 1950 to over 350 million tonnes in 2018 plasticseurope 2019 thompson et al 2009 composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen most polymers are highly combustible and burn at high temperatures delva et al 2018 once the polymers combust their molten drips can ignite nearby combustibles causing the fire to spread ray and kuruma 2020a in addition the burning of polymers also emits corrosive or toxic gases e g co hcn so2 h2s and nh3 and smokes these toxic smokes cause significant difficulty for evacuation life saving and fire fighting efforts kim et al 2018 ray and kuruma 2020a the flammability of polymers is usually measured by the limiting oxygen index loi which is the minimum concentration of oxygen required to support their combustion polymers with loi values lower than 21 are generally considered flammable archibald et al 2004 john 2019 the loi values of polymers commonly used for plastic production are summarized in table s1 polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polyurethane pu which account for more than half of the european demand for all plastics in 2018 are flammable plasticseurope 2019 thus enhancing their intrinsic fire resistance is a major task in producing plastics from these polymers and addition of flame retardants has been the most logical and effective solution flame retardants are an essential group of chemical additives added in the manufacturing of plastics to protect them from the ignition and spread of flame during service life ray and kuruma 2020a they typically make up 10 20 of the weight of plastics and their total share in the global plastic market is only lower than those of fillers and plasticizers table s2 the combustion of plastics in air can generally be divided into three stages a heating and pyrolysis in which the plastics are decomposed by heat to produce combustible species b ignition in which the combustible gases are ignited in the air and c flame spread in which part of the heat generated by the combustion process promotes the plastics to decompose and sustain the burning alaee 2003 flame retardants can act at any of these three stages interrupting or retarding the combustion reactions of the combustible gases and or delaying or interrupting the decomposition reactions of plastics to prevent combustion chen and wang 2009 dasari et al 2013 hollingbery and hull 2010 schreiber and saur 2011 it has been demonstrated that the products with flame retardants performed much better in the fire and the amount of heat released was only a quarter of that of the products containing no such additives vytenis et al 1988 the use of flame retardants greatly increases the time to react escape and rescue in household fires in the room with flame retardants the average available escaping time was 15 fold greater than that of the room without them hirschler 2015a morgan and gilman 2013 vytenis et al 1988 in addition a wide variety of flame retardants have been proven to have smoke suppression and drip prevention effects morgan and gilman 2013 ray and kuruma 2020a overall addition of flame retardants not only effectively reduces the flammability of plastics but also slows down the spread of fire during the combustion process preventing small fires from developing into catastrophic ones thus greatly reducing fire hazards ray and kuruma 2020a plastics and plastic containing products are often disposed of at the end of their service life with significant amounts of waste plastics ultimately ended up in the surface soils surface water and oceans chen et al 2020 henderson and green 2020 despite of their chemical stability a range of processes during the use of plastics and after their disposal including wear and tear pulverization and weathering can cause them to lose structural integrity andrady 2011 liu et al 2020 teuten et al 2009 the fragmentation of bulk plastics under the action of external forces and solar irradiation results in the breakaway of small pieces andrady 2011 liu et al 2020 the continuous weathering of plastic debris generates progressively smaller fragments silva et al 2018 therefore it is possible that the final fate of all plastics in the environment is tiny plastic debris known as microplastics which refers to plastic particles of 5 mm and smaller in sizes thompson 2019 the accumulation of microplastics in both terrestrial and marine environment has been well documented gonzález pleiter et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 it was estimated that plastics make up more than 80 of marine litter and have pervaded even the most remote marine environment auta et al 2017 gonzález pleiter et al 2020 wright et al 2013 significant efforts have been made on detecting microplastics in different types of environmental media e g seawater freshwater sediments and soils as well as identifying their potential toxicological effects on organisms which have been summarized in several recent reviews guo et al 2020b koelmans et al 2019 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 due to the inherent toxicity of most flame retardants e g halogenated ones they would potentially impact the environment and ecosystem once released from the microplastics to date a number of studies have been conducted to understand the toxicity of flame retardants on mice fish and birds in particular the halogen and phosphorus based flame retardants have been well demonstrated to have acute toxicity reproductive and developmental toxicity neurotoxicity viscera toxicity genetic toxicity mutagenicity as well as endocrine disrupting effect table s3 with microplastics dispersed widely in both terrestrial and marine environment it is important to understand the releases of flame retardants contained in their matrices and the factors affecting their releases to assess and predict the associated risk to the environment and ecosystem this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the makeup of flame retardants in commercial plastics and discuss the kinetics of their releases from microplastics the factors influencing their releases as well as the potential environmental and ecosystem impact of the released flame retardants important questions that need to be addressed and recommendations for future research are also proposed it is worth noting that this review is based on data reported in published journal articles conference proceedings books and gray literature among them the gray literature includes technical reports published by government agencies academic institutions trade publications and information collected from websites of manufacturers and other groups which is usually not peer reviewed but contains the latest data from the industry cheng et al 2014 2 makeup of flame retardants in plastics the total number of commercial flame retardants has reached thousands since their adoption in plastic production in the 18th century hirschler 2015b the compounds that are used as flame retardants usually contain one or more of the following elements b n f mg al si p s cl ca ti v cr mn fe co ni cu zn br mo sn sb i bi and la while most commercial flame retardants used today are based on br cl p al mg n sb zn sn and b khanna and pearce 1978 morgan et al 2014 ray and kuruma 2020c depending on their relationship with the polymers flame retardants can be classified into two major types additive flame retardants and reactive ones ray and kuruma 2020b the additive flame retardants are incorporated by physical dispersion without any chemical reactions with the polymers laoutid et al 2009 this is the most economical and easiest way of introducing flame retardancy into the plastics although various problems such as poor compatibility leaching and reduction of mechanical properties impair its attractiveness wazarkar et al 2015 the additive types of flame retardants are generally added into thermoplastic polymers such as pe pp polystyrene ps polycarbonate pc and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs landrock 1995 in contrast reactive flame retardants contain functional groups that allow them to be incorporated with the polymers during the synthesis as co polymers or cross linking agents to participate in the synthesis reactions usepa 2005 they are incorporated into the main chain or side chain of the polymer blocks to become structural units and are often used in the thermosetting plastics such as epoxy resin ep and pu landrock 1995 reactive flame retardants have the advantages of good stability and having little influence on the other properties of the polymers they are considered as ideal flame retardants with good effect achieved at rather low loadings schreiber and saur 2011 however reactive flame retardants are expensive compared to the additive ones which affects their market shares in addition to the compounds containing halogen phosphorus silicon and nitrogen which can be either reactive or additive flame retardants containing the other elements are usually the additive type covaci et al 2009 morgan et al 2014 wazarkar et al 2015 it should be noted that there is no clear boundary between the reactive and additive flame retardants for example tetrabromobisphenol a tbppa is used in ep as a reactive flame retardant while it is also used in abs as an additive flame retardant covaci et al 2009 innes and innes 2004 the annual global consumption of flame retardants has been increasing in recent years table s4 it was estimated that the global consumption of flame retardants was as high as 2 25 million tonnes in 2016 flameretardants online 2017 aluminum hydroxide ath which has been the largest single component on the flame retardant market accounted for 38 of the total share in 2016 halogenated flame retardant systems brominated and chlorinated which are commonly used together with the synergist antimony trioxide ato were the second largest group 22 with a market share of 18 organic phosphorus flame retardants ranked the third flameretardants online 2017 gvr 2016 flame retardants are mainly consumed by the plastics industry to meet the stringent flammability performance requirements with the polyolefin e g pe and pp applications accounting for most of the demand gvr 2016 the major terminal applications of flame retardants used in plastics include electrical and electronic industry building and construction transportation and furnishings table s5 with flame retardants used in all connectors printed wire boards enclosures and cables of televisions computers and refrigerators the electrical and electronic industry dominates the end use of flame retardants today gvr 2016 table 1 summarizes the advantages and limitations of the major types of flame retardants compared with ath and magnesium di hydroxide mdh which have to be used at minimum loadings of 40 up to 80 halogen phosphorus and silicon based flame retardants have higher flame retarding efficiency sauerwein 2014 as a result of the low required loadings such flame retardants have little effect on the physical properties of plastics and do not cause major deterioration in their processing property meanwhile the addition of boron compounds and ato as synergists can further reduce the required loadings of these flame retardants nitrogen based flame retardants have moderate flame retarding efficiency and are considered as environment friendly similar to ath mdh and silicon compounds in contrast halogenated compounds are toxic and they release corrosive and toxic gases when burned ray and kuruma 2020a nonetheless with low cost and proven effectiveness halogenated flame retardants had been widely adopted since the 1930s while their environmental and human health impact was recognized much later ray and kuruma 2020a to date the use of halogenated flame retardants of major toxicological concerns have been restricted by various regulatory rules such as the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive and the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops table s6 in 2001 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs were added to the list of pops ssc 2018 in 2002 polybrominated biphenyls pbbs and poly brominated diphenyl ethers pbdes were regulated in the rohs directive european union 2003 tetrabromodiphenyl ether tetra bdes pentabromodiphenyl ether penta bdes hexabromodiphenyl ether hexa bde and heptabromodiphenyl ether hepta bde were included in the list of pops in 2009 ssc 2018 subsequently hexabromocyclododecane hbcd decabromodiphenyl ether bde 209 and short chain chlorinated paraffins sccps were added to the list in 2013 and 2017 respectively ssc 2018 more recently the european union has announced that the use of halogenated flame retardants in electronic displays such as the enclosure and the stand will be banned on march 1 2021 european union 2019 although some of these regulations e g rohs directive were only intended for regional markets all the manufacturing countries have followed them or similar ones more or less sun et al 2016 as a result the share of halogenated flame retardants in the global market has decreased from 26 6 in 2005 to 22 in 2016 table s4 although their global production volume has continued to grow de boer and stapleton 2019 ou and lang 2010 sauerwein 2014 the total market share of halogenated flame retardants is expected to shrink further with more stringent regulatory controls on their use in the foreseeable future a clear trend of shifting from the traditional halogenated flame retardants towards non halogenated ones has already been observed in the plastics industry de boer and stapleton 2019 li et al 2019 3 releases of flame retardants from microplastics microplastics refer to the small particles of plastic materials found in the environment and their sources sizes shapes and chemical compositions can vary significantly they are often defined based on the physical sizes i e with length less than 5 mm according to national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa while they could occur in sizes ranging from 0 1 μm to less than 5 mm arthur et al 2009 based on their origins microplastics are classified into two types primary and secondary microplastics matthew et al 2011 the plastics that are directly released into the environment as small particles 5 mm are considered as primary microplastics some of these microplastics are added to products for intended purposes such as scrubbing agents in cosmetics while they can also derive from the abrasion of large plastic objects during manufacturing and use boucher and friot 2017 secondary microplastics originate from the small plastic fragments formed from the splitting or degradation of large plastic materials both in oceans and on land matthew et al 2011 secondary microplastics which result from the fragmentation of large plastic materials such as pipes decking electrical cables computer monitors and keyboards under the action of external force often contain flame retardants andrady 2011 conkle et al 2018 eerkesmedrano et al 2015 zarfl and matthies 2010 commercial plastic materials typically have high loadings of flame retardants 10 20 table s2 while no significant loss of the flame retardants from the bulk plastics during their use and even after initial disintegration could occur as a result the contents of flame retardants in the newly formed microplastics are expected to be comparable to the levels added during the production of the plastics depending on the types of plastics and the flame retardant formulations which could be quite different among the manufacturers and shifted over time due to changes in the supply markets and regulations the compositions and contents of flame retardants found in plastics vary largely despite the growing attention only several studies have characterized the compositions and contents of brominated flame retardants which are one of the major types of flame retardants used in plastic production in plastic debris and microplastics cao et al 2019 2020 guo et al 2019 jang et al 2017 sun et al 2016 yeo et al 2020 pbdes and 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe which is one of the most commonly applied substitutes of pbdes were detected at levels up to tens of mg g in recycled plastic particles and particles prepared from waste plastics table s7 pbdes and the brominated substitutes of pbdes which were adopted after the use of some pbde congeners was banned were also detected at significant levels in the plastic debris and microplastics collected in the coastal regions and in surface water table s8 although the concentrations of these brominated flame retardants in plastic debris and microplastics vary over a wide range they are typically orders of magnitude higher than the occurrence levels of these pollutants in the atmosphere or the aquatic environment thus microplastics could potentially serve as an importance source of flame retardants in the environment for a long time both the reactive and additive flame retardants could be released from microplastics the additive flame retardants are not chemically bound to the polymer chains and interact with the plastic matrices only through intermolecular forces thus they can move relatively freely within the polymer matrix helmroth 2002 in contrast the reactive ones are bonded with the polymer chains and their releases can occur only when an excess of non polymerized flame retardants are present in the plastics rauert et al 2014 thus the environmental releases of reactive flame retardants are not expected to be significant compared to the additive ones in the absence of degradation of the plastic matrices accordingly the rest part of this review focuses only on the releases of additive flame retardants particularly brominated ones from microplastics in the environment 3 1 kinetics of flame retardant releases from microplastics the critical link between the occurrence of flame retardants in microplastics at rather high contents and their actual environmental and ecosystem risk is the release kinetics as shown on fig 1 the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into the environmental medium e g air or water usually occur via three major steps a internal diffusion within the microplastic matrix b transport across the microplastic medium boundary layer and c diffusion into the environmental medium lee et al 2018a sun et al 2016 2019 if one of these steps is significantly slower than the others it becomes rate limiting for the overall release process siepmann and siepmann 2012 with the diffusion coefficients of molecules in solid phase being many orders of magnitude lower than those in air or water internal diffusion and or transport across the plastic medium boundary layer could well be the rate limiting step for the releases of flame retardants from microplastics detailed investigations on the rate limiting step in the releases of brominated flame retardants from microplastics have been made recently sun et al 2016 estimated the values for the mass transfer resistance which is defined as the reciprocal of mass transfer coefficient of the three major processes involved in the releases of major brominated flame retardants pbdes and btbpe from abs microplastics into the air based on the typical values for the relevant parameters including the length of the diffusion path δ m the diffusion coefficient of the flame retardant d m2 s and the plastic air partition coefficient kp a dimensionless of the flame retardant fig 1a the mass transfer resistance of internal diffusion δ p d p s m could be 13 or more orders of magnitude higher than that of plastic air boundary layer δ p a d p k p a s m sun et al 2016 it was also noted that the release rates of brominated flame retardants from abs microplastic particles at 10 30 and 50 c were several orders of magnitude lower than those determined by surface evaporation i e when mass transfer across the plastic air boundary layer is rate limiting sun et al 2016 as a result the resistance of mass transfer across the plastic air boundary layer could be ignored in the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into the air which greatly simplifies the modeling of their release kinetics sun et al 2016 for the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into the water or other liquid phases the mass transfer across the plastic water boundary layer could also be a rate limiting step model calculation results by endo et al 2013 showed that the desorption of pcbs from millimeter sized pe pellets was limited by the mass transfer across the aqueous boundary layer as the pcb congeners had adsorbed from the environmental media onto the field collected pe pellets they were expected to be enriched on or near the surface layer instead of being distributed uniformly within the plastic matrix which could make internal diffusion less important compared to the mass transfer across the plastic water boundary layer in the desorption process lee et al 2018b investigated the desorption behavior of hexachlorocyclohexanes hchs and chlorinated benzenes from pe and pp sheets and found that the desorption of hchs was predominantly determined by diffusion within the plastic matrix whereas that of chlorinated benzenes was controlled by mass transfer across the aqueous boundary layer it should be noted that the hchs and chlorinated benzenes were loaded onto the plastic sheets using n hexane as the solvent in the study of lee et al 2018b although soaking in n hexane for 24 h would lead to more homogenous distribution of the spiked chemicals within the plastic matrices narvaez valderrama et al 2016 this caused significant swelling of the plastic sheets lee et al 2018b which altered the mass transfer resistance for internal diffusion of the chemicals in fact the diffusion coefficients reported for hchs and chlorinated benzenes in the swollen pe and pp sheets by n hexane were several orders of magnitude higher compared to those of brominated flame retardants with comparable molecular weights observed in abs microplastics lee et al 2018b sun et al 2016 2019 the relative importance of external and internal mass transfer for the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into aqueous solution can be quantitatively evaluated with the mass transfer biot number bi dimensionless which is calculated as the ratio of the transport rate across the plastic water boundary layer to the diffusion rate within the microplastic particle lee et al 2018b sun et al 2019 1 b i k m l d p where dp is the diffusion coefficient of flame retardant in plastic matrix m2 s l is the characteristic dimension of the plastic layer m and km is the mass transfer coefficient in the plastic water boundary layer m s km can be calculated from the diffusion coefficient of flame retardant in water dw m2 s its plastic water partition coefficient kp w dimensionless and the thickness of aqueous boundary layer on the microplastic particle δ m as booij et al 2003 crank 1975 2 k m d w k p w δ internal diffusion within the microplastic particle determines the overall release of flame retardant when bi is greater than 100 mass transfer across the plastic water boundary layer is rate limiting when bi is less than 1 whereas both steps are important in the cases with bi values between 1 and 100 cho et al 2006 sun et al 2019 it is important to differentiate the desorption of flame retardants adsorbed on the external surface of microplastics and the releases of additive flame retardants from the microplastic matrix for the flame retardants and other hydrophobic organic pollutants enriched on the surface of the microplastics their desorption is most likely controlled by the diffusion across the plastic water boundary later due to their enrichment on the surface and within the surface layer in contrast the additive flame retardants are distributed uniformly within the plastic matrix without excess molecules present on the external surface thus internal diffusion plays a key role in their overall releases sun et al 2019 for the releases of pbdes and btbpe from abs microplastics in water the bi values are in the range of 109 to 1016 which indicates that internal diffusion is clearly the rate limiting step sun et al 2019 in fact internal diffusion within microplastics has long been recognized as the rate controlling step for the transfer of hydrophobic organic pollutants contained in them to the organisms dwelling in sediments koelmans et al 2013 teuten et al 2007 2009 internal diffusion was also assumed to solely control the releases of pbdes from microplastic spheres of low density polyethylene ldpe and silicone rubber narvaez valderrama et al 2016 in addition internal diffusion within the plastic matrix has been well accepted to be the rate limiting step in the releases of additives from food packaging helmroth 2002 it should be noted that the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in the matrix of a given microplastic partlces could change over time especially when weathered over a long time the physicochemical properties e g crystallinity oxygen containing groups and size of microplastics can be significantly altered by various processes during weathering in the natural environment such as sunlight irradiation oxidation and physical abrasion jahnke et al 2017 liu et al 2020 in particular breakdown of the polymeric structure could greatly reduce the reisistance for diffusion of flame retardants in the matrices of microplastics while degradation of the flame retardants released from microplastics might also facilitate their releases by increasing the concentration gradients between the microplastics and surrounding medium more details discussed later these effects might well render the diffusion of flame retardants across plastic medium boundary layer more important and even become the rate limiting step in the overall mass transfer process based on the above discussion releases of additive flame retardants from microplastics are most likely to be solely controlled by their diffusion within the plastic matrices in such cases the release kinetics of flame retardants can be conveniently modeled with the fick s laws of diffusion helmroth 2002 lee et al 2018b narvaez valderrama et al 2016 sun et al 2016 2019 the basic concept is that the diffusant molecules diffuse from the locations with higher concentrations to the adjacent locations with lower concentrations siepmann and siepmann 2012 fick s first law relates the diffusive flux to the concentration under the assumption of steady state crank 1975 3 f d c x where f is the diffusion flux g s m2 c is the concentration of diffusant g m3 and x is the distance to the center of the particle m the fick s second law is for non steady diffusion and describes the concentration change at definite location brought by diffusion with respect to time t s crank 1975 4 c t d 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 2 c z 2 where x y and z are the distances to the center of the particle in three dimensional space m in the absence of significant change in the plastic matrix i e no swelling or plasticization of the polymer and when the perfect sink conditions i e the receptor chamber has an essentially zero diffusant concentration are maintained the releases of flame retardants from microplastics of various geometries can be mathematically modeled as the simplest cases crank 1975 siepmann and siepmann 2008 2012 table 2 summarizes the exact solutions and their approximations to the fick s law applied to the releases of flame retardants from microplastics in the shapes of sphere slab and cylinder based on the corresponding equations the cumulative masses of flame retardants released from microplastics of common shapes as a function of time can be easily calculated based on their diffusion coefficients and the other relevant parameters and vice versa in water and sediments the most abundant shape category of microplastics is fibers 48 5 followed by fragments 31 spheres 6 5 and films 5 5 kooi and koelmans 2019 up to date research on the releases of flame retardants as well as other additives from microplastics mainly focuses on the shapes of spheres and films hale et al 2010 howell et al 1985 narvaez valderrama et al 2016 sun et al 2016 2019 for microplastics with complex shapes and systems in which the diffusion coefficient depends on time and location there is usually no analytical solution to the fick s law siepmann et al 2012 in these cases the masses released can be obtained with numerical solutions which are often based on certain approximations such as replacement of derivatives with finite difference calculated on a spatial and or temporal grid siepmann et al 2012 siepmann and siepmann 2012 in addition to the mechanistic models discussed above a range of empirical models including zero order first order second order higuchi hixson crowell hopfenberg weibull peppas korsmeyer and peppas sahlin models have also been used to describe the release kinetics of molecules from solid matrices table s9 although only few of them were applied to model the releases of additives from microplastics chi et al 2015 flores and kong 2017 varma et al 2004 guo and co workers simulated the leaching kinetics of brominated flame retardants from abs in gastric fluid with first order second order and higuchi models and found that the second order model performed better than the others guo et al 2020a the zero order first order second order and higuchi models are commonly used for systems whose structure remains intact guo et al 2020a varma et al 2004 while the hixson crowell and hopfenberg models are often applied in study of the erodible formulations siepmann and siepmann 2008 varma et al 2004 in contrast the weibull peppas korsmeyer and peppas sahlin models can be applied to the swellable plastics e g polymers added with large amounts of plasticizers chi et al 2015 siepmann and siepmann 2008 varma et al 2004 3 2 diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastic matrices quantification of the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastic matrices is key for understanding and predicting the release behaviors of these additives from microplastics helmroth 2002 a classic phenomenological model for the diffusivity of diffusant molecules in various polymers is the free volume theory of diffusion developed by vrentas and duda 1978 which is based on the assumption that the diffusion of a small diffusant molecule is accompanied by movement in the polymer matrix to fill the free volume left by the displaced diffusant molecule rafailovich and sokolov 2001 vrentas et al 1989 as illustrated on fig 2 the free volume arises from the dynamic and transient molecular scale free spaces between the entangled polymer chains with the opening or closing of the channels brought by the translation of the polymer chains providing pathways for diffusive jumps marcilla and beltrán 2012 wilson et al 2018 as a result the diffusion coefficients predicted by the free volume theory are closely related to the space filling properties of both the diffusant and the polymer matrix ramesh and duda 2001 the self diffusion constant d1 m2 s can be expressed as the product of two factors an arrhenius term e typically at around 4 2 kj mol which represents the probability of a diffusant molecule having sufficient energy to escape its local environment and a term indicating the probability of local density fluctuation is large enough to produce sufficient free volume for the movement of diffusant molecules rafailovich and sokolov 2001 and it can be estimated as 5 d 1 d 0 e x p e r t e x p γ v c r i t v m i x t u r e t where d 0 is a pre exponential factor m2 s v crit is the critical local hole free volume required for a diffusive jump m3 v mixture t is the average hole free volume in the mixture m3 and γ 0 5 1 dimensionless is an overlap factor that accounts for the access of the same free volume by multiple molecules v crit has only a weak dependence on temperature t k while v mixture t increases significantly with temperature the free volume theory can explain the reduction in d1 with increases in cross linking of the polymer and the temperature effect as well as the more pronounced effect for the larger diffusants rafailovich and sokolov 2001 it is worth noting that the free volume model contains several adjustable parameters that are difficult to predict or measure except for a few model systems helmroth 2002 tonge and gilbert 2001 tonge and gilbert 2001 found that the prediction was reasonable for the diffusion coefficient of methyl methacrylate in polymethyl methacrylate pmma but the priori predictions had significant errors for the other systems there are a few ways to determine the diffusion coefficient either from empirical or semi empirical methods or based on approximations to values of certain properties mantina et al 2009 table s10 lists some common empirical formulas that can be used to estimate the diffusion coefficient in plastic matrix based on the physical and chemical properties of the diffusant and the polymer although these methods may not yield highly accurate results they could provide reasonably good approximations based on available property values of the diffusant and the plastic experimentally the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants within microplastics could be estimated by fitting the observed release fluxes to the solutions to the fick s laws sun et al 2016 2019 for spherical particles of radius r m and infinite exposure time karapanagioti and werner 2019 estimated the diffusion coefficients from the experimentally observed first order rate constant k 1 s as 6 d k r 2 π 2 based on the value of k 1 16 10 6 1 s for the release of pcb 153 from ldpe pellet r 3 10 4 m reported in the study of rochman et al 2013 the diffusion coefficient of pcb 153 in ldpe was calculated to be 1 06 10 14 m2 s karapanagioti and werner 2019 which is on the same order as the value 5 24 10 1m2 s reported by rusina et al 2010 for pcb 153 in ldpe in the study of rochman et al 2013 the k values for the releases of pcbs from high density polyethylene hdpe ldpe pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc were 1 16 10 6 2 31 10 6 2 31 10 6 5 79 10 6 and 5 79 10 6 1 s respectively it could thus be estimated that the diffusion coefficients of pcbs in these plastics are all at the level of 10 14m2 s table 3 summarizes the diffusion coefficients of different flame retardants in various types of plastics reported in the literature and table s11 lists those of other types of compounds in plastics as expected the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants show significant dependence on their properties the plastic matrices and the temperature berk 2009 3 3 factors affecting the diffusion of flame retardants within microplastics the diffusion of flame retardants in plastic matrix is closely related to the free volume within the polymer and the segmental chain mobility which are affected by the degree of unsaturation the extent of crystallinity and the nature of the substituents karapanagioti and werner 2019 the glass transition temperature tg which is determined by the type of polymer is an important plastic property table s1 also lists the tg values of common polymers used for the production of plastics as the ambient temperature is increased to tg gradual and reversible transition of the plastic material from a glassy or semi crystalline state into a rubbery state occurs at temperatures below tg k or c the energy of the polymeric molecules is too low to overcome the rotating barrier in the main chain thus it cannot sustain the movement of the chain segment which is in a frozen state helmroth 2002 sperling 2006 under such conditions only vibrational and short range rotational motions are involved and the chance of finding a sufficiently large hole for the flame retardants to move is limited helmroth 2002 platé and shibaev 1987 sperling 2006 when the temperature is raised above tg the polymer molecules in a rubbery state are capable of segmental chain movement endo and koelmans 2019 sperling 2006 yohei et al 2012 as a result the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in a plastic material can differ dramatically at temperatures below and above its tg naylor 1989 for example it has been observed that the diffusion coefficient of bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate in pvc increased drastically once the temperature was raised above its tg storey et al 1991 it is well known that tg increases and all dynamics within the polymer matrix is slowed as the cross link density in the plastic increases rafailovich and sokolov 2001 plastics with lower tg values have greater chain segmental mobility allowing the flame retardant molecules in them to move more easily sun et al 2019 for example the diffusion coefficient of hexachlorobenzene hecb in pe tg 120 c is two orders of magnitude higher than that in pp tg 10 c at 25 c table 3 the presence of ch3 units as the side group in pp increases the resistance of chain movement resulting in much lower chain segmental mobility in pp compared to that in pe at the same temperature the diffusion coefficients of pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in polydimethylsiloxane pdms tg 125 c were also found to be higher than those in ldpe rusina et al 2010 the faster diffusion of pcbs and pahs in pdms could be attributed to the fact that the main chain unit of pdms si o has lower rotational resistance than that of pe c c in general factors that increase the energy required for the onset of segment motion such as intermolecular forces internal chain steric hindrance bulky groups and stiff side groups increase the tg of plastic matrix and thus reduce the diffusion of flame retardants sperling 2006 in contrast the presence of flexible side groups symmetrical substitution and in chain groups promoting flexibility e g double bonds and ether linkages can decrease tg and facilitate the diffusion of flame retardants in the plastic matrices sperling 2006 the dependence of a diffusant s diffusion coefficient on the tg of plastic matrix can be described by the following empirical relationship brown and park 1970 williams et al 1955 7 ln d c b f g a 1 a 2 t t g where c is an empirical constant dimensionless b is a constant that is related to the critical local free volume required for diffusion dimensionless fg is the fraction of free space in the polymer dimensionless at tg k a1 1 k and a2 1 k are the expansion coefficients in the glassy state and at the transition to the rubbery state respectively and t is the temperature k fig 3 a shows the linear dependence of log10 d of bde 209 at 20 c on the tg of different plastic materials as expected at a given temperature the plastics with higher tg values have lower segmental chain movement and thus pose greater resistance on the diffusion of additives present in their matrices for polymers that contain crystalline region e g pe crystallinity is also an important factor that affects the diffusion of flame retardants as shown in table s11 the diffusion coefficient of acenaphthylene acy in ldpe with crystallinity generally in the range of 55 65 is higher than that in hdpe which has much higher crystallinity usually 80 the crystalline regions where the polymer chains are regularly arranged have an ordered structure as such structure increases the density of the polymers the density of hdpe is 0 94 0 97 g cm3 compared to 0 91 0 94 g cm3 of ldpe it is not conductive to the diffusion of flame retardants sperling 2006 consequently the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants are lower in the plastics with higher crystallinity the diffusion coefficients of diffusants are well known to be dependent on their molar volumes and hence also on their molecular radii and molecular weights in general larger molecules encounter greater steric hindrance when passing through the polymer chains and thus diffuse slower compared to the smaller ones kwan and takada 2019 rusina et al 2010 it has been observed that the diffusivity of spherical gaseous molecules in polymers decreases exponentially with their diameters berens and hopfenberg 1982 table 3 shows that the log10 d values of pcbs in ldpe and those of pbdes in abs and ldpe all decrease with increasing molecular weights of the congeners fig 3b depicts the linear dependence of log10 d on molecular diameter for flame retardants in various types of plastics it is noted that the molecules with rigid structures which have poor conformational freedom have lower mobility in plastic matrices compared to the linear flexible molecules or molecules with symmetrical structures nouman et al 2017 rusina et al 2007 sun et al 2019 diffusion is a thermally activated process flame retardant molecules need to possess enough thermal energy to squeeze through the surrounding polymer chains thus flame retardant molecules diffuse faster within the plastic matrix as the temperature increases meanwhile the polymer matrix of plastic also becomes less rigid which reduces the resistance for diffusion of flame retardant molecules for instance the diffusion coefficient of btbpe in abs at 50 c is about three orders of magnitude higher than that at 10 c table 3 the diffusion coefficients of diffusants in polymers have strong temperature dependence which can be well described by the arrhenius equation naylor 1989 8 ln d 1 d 2 e a r 1 t 1 1 t 2 where d1 m2 s and d2 m2 s are the diffusion coefficients at temperatures of t1 k and t2 k respectively ea is the apparent activation energy for diffusion kj mol and r is the gas constant 8 314 10 3 kj mol k for diffusion of various pbdes in abs in the temperature ranges of 10 50 c the ea values were found to be in the range of 70 180 kj mol sun et al 2016 2019 the activation energies of diffusion for a range of c1 to c6 organic vapors in glassy pvc ps and pmma were found to increase linearly with their diameters berens and hopfenberg 1982 it should be noted that the arrhenius plots typically bend when measured over a wide temperature range naylor 1989 therefore attention should be paid to the appropriate temperature range when predicting the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants based on extrapolation of measurement data using the arrhenius equation besides the chemical properties of the plastic matrix and the specific diffusant an important physical property of microplastic particle size also affects the releases of flame retardants although particle size is not an intrinsic property of microplastics and the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastic matrices are independent of particle size the releasing fluxes of additive flame retardants from microplastics are size dependent as the particles with smaller sizes have higher surface area to volume ratios sun et al 2019 demonstrated that the release fluxes of pbdes from abs microplastics in the size range of 0 149 0 297 mm were much higher than those of 0 841 2 000 mm it is worth noting that the actual leaching of flame retardants from microplastics is a complicated dynamic process as the physical and chemical structures of microplastics can be gradually damaged during natural weathering liu et al 2020 in the oceans fragmentation of microplastics and thus reduction in their sizes can occur under the actions of ocean eddy current turbulence and wind force while destruction of their polymer structures surface embrittlement and cracking can also take place due to the long term immersion in seawater and exposure to sunlight irradiation and wind force conkle et al 2018 eerkesmedrano et al 2015 on the land surface freeze thaw cycles pressure due to burial under soil or snow and damages inflicted by animals or birds can also reduce the particle sizes of microplastics duis and coors 2016 lambert et al 2014 the disintegration of plastics such as pe pp and ps are mainly initiated by ultraviolet irradiation duis and coors 2016 and their matrices become brittle and fragmented due to the scission of their chain bonds yousif and haddad 2013 other types of additives co existing with the flame retardants can also affect their diffusion in particular plasticizers can promote the migration of flame retardants by increasing the mobility of polymer segments calò et al 2011 thus the releases of such additives in the environment can also impact the release behaviors of flame retardants from microplastics jambeck et al 2015 estimated that 4 8 to 12 7 million tonnes of plastic debris entered the oceans each year in 2010 and the cumulative input would increase by ten folds by 2025 the breakdown of plastic debris leads to the wide occurrence of microplastics and even nano sized plastic particles in the environment eriksen et al 2014 estimated that at least 5 25 trillion plastic particles with a total weight of 268 940 tonnes are floating in the world s oceans and that more than 233 400 tonnes of larger plastic debris are afloat at sea compared to 35 540 tonnes of microplastics as most of the smaller microplastics resulted from disintegration of the larger plastic debris their abundance in term of number is expected to be much greater than the larger ones weathering is an important process that causes the breakdown of plastic debris and generation of smaller fragments song et al 2017 observed that pellets of pe pp and styrofoam aka expanded ps all of approximately 20 mm3 in volume produced 20 8 3 6084 1061 and 10 501 1718 particles pellet respectively after being exposed to uv light for 12 months followed by mechanical abrasion with sand for 2 months while pe and pp pellets were minimally fragmented by mechanical abrasion in the absence of uv exposure significant amount of particles 4220 33 particles pellet were produced from mechanical abrasion treatment alone for styrofoam song et al 2017 the generation of smaller plastic fragments increased with decreasing size of the plastic pellets in the accelerated weathering treatment and significant losses in the volumes of the plastic materials up to three quarters for styrofoam could occur due to their breakdown into finer particles that were undetectable song et al 2017 fragmentation of plastic materials has been demonstrated to release nano sized plastic particles in laboratory studies gigault et al 2016 lambert and wagner 2016 such nano sized plastic particles have also been detected in the north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 although the rate and extent of plastic debris fragmenting into microplastics and nano sized plastic particles in the environment are unknown it has been estimated that fragmentation of plastics into such tiny particles probably took up to hundreds of years in nature koelmans et al 2015 overall once in the environment large plastic debris are expected to fragment into smaller particles under the actions of a range of mechanical thermal chemical and biological stressors besseling et al 2018 liu et al 2020 degradation of spherical microplastics in the size range of 0 1µm to 5mm into nano sized particles 100 nm in the world s oceans could increase the particle concentrations by over 14 orders of magnitude besseling et al 2018 the continuous fragmentation of plastic particles by weathering could significantly accelerate the releases of flame retardants from their matrices fig 4 schematically illustrates the changes in the total surface area of spherical plastic particles and the releasing half life i e the time required for the loss of half of the initial mass of flame retardant from them with progressive breakdown in particle size after the spherical plastic particles of 25 mm in radius are fragmented into spheres with radii of 0 025 mm the total number of particles increases by 9 orders of magnitude while the total surface area of the particles increase by 3 orders of magnitude as a result of the significant size reduction from 25 to 0 025 mm the releasing half life of flame retardant from the plastic particles decreases by 6 orders of magnitude even if their chemical structure would remain intact i e the diffusion coefficient of the flame retardant is constant on the other hand the releasing half life of flame retardant would be further lowered when its diffusion in the plastic matrix is accelerated due to breakdown of the polymeric structure during weathering 4 environmental and ecosystem impact of flame retardants released from microplastics 4 1 environmental fate of flame retardants released from microplastics the level of organic flame retardants added to plastics is usually 10 20 andrady and rajapakse 2019 innes and innes 2004 although they are present at rather high contents in plastics the release rates of flame retardants at ambient temperatures are extremely slow the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastics table 3 are many orders of magnitude lower than those of small organic molecules in water 10 9m2 s at 25 c cussler 2009 it has been estimated that among the 275 million tonnes of waste plastics produced in 2010 4 8 to 12 7 million tonnes entered the oceans jambeck et al 2015 with the assumptions that 4 8 million tonnes of waste plastics enter the ocean each year 30 of them contain flame retardants at a typical level of 15 and 10 of the flame retardants are brominated ones andrady and rajapakse 2019 ou and fang 2006 a total of 2 16 104 tonnes of brominated flame retardants would be introduced into the ocean each year if all these waste plastics were present in the form of microplastic particles with an uniform radius of 2 5 mm and the diffusion coefficients of the brominated flame retardants in them were 10 25m2 s a total of 51 94 kg of brominated flame retardants would be released into the ocean water from these newly introduced microplastics in the first year which is very small compared to the total masses contained in the waste plastics it should be noted that the above rough estimation carries significant uncertainty and assumes that the structures of the microplastics remain intact in the natural environment many factors such as heat light and oxygen can cause degradation of plastic matrices and thus accelerate the releases of flame retardants as discussed later the flame retardants released from microplastics can exist in the air as gaseous molecules or adsorb on the airborne particulates most of the lower brominated pbdes such as bde 47 bde 99 and bde 100 are present in the air in gaseous form and can be transported over long distances while the higher brominated ones mainly bde 209 occur mostly in the sorbed form on airborne particulates and are unlikely to be transported far away from the points of initial emissions hale et al 2004 möller et al 2012 shoeib et al 2004 relatively high levels of flame retardants ng m3 had been found in the air of electronic product recycling facilities sjodin et al 2001 in contrast the concentrations of flame retardants measured in the air of the southern ocean were much lower sub pg m3 möller et al 2012 it can thus be speculated that the microplastics generated in various processes contributed substantially to the levels flame retardants detected in the air of the recycling facilities microplastics are insoluble in water but can float in the form of particulate matter or settle into the sediment eerkesmedrano et al 2015 the small size and low density contribute to their transport across long distances especially by the ocean currents eerkesmedrano et al 2015 microplastics may also act as sorbents for the accumulation of a range of hydrophobic organic pollutants including flame retardants in the aquatic environment with the hydrophobic effect playing a major role in the sorption liu et al 2020 the direction of net chemical flow between the microplastics and aqueous phase or atmosphere is determined by the gradient of fugacity which is a measure of the tendency of the compound to escape from its confined phase mackay 2001 results of fugacity analysis suggests that equilibrium is not attained for high molecular weight pahs in open oceans with pe debris because of the long time required for the compounds with high partition coefficients to reach equilibrium between pe and seawater and their slow diffusion in pe lee et al 2017 added at rather high levels in plastic production table 1 flame retardants should have a much higher fugacity in microplastics than that in seawater for a long time and thus serve as a long term source of these pollutants in the marine environment most flame retardants have very low water solubility and high hydrophobicity thus they would adsorb onto the suspended particulates in the water column once leached out of the microplastics some flame retardants could volatilize into the air due to the increase of temperature and may return with rain and snowfall regnery and püttmann 2010 xia et al 2020 the others may be transported over long distances with the flow of water or suspended particulates and enter the sediment or soil through the interaction between water and particulates or are absorbed or accumulated by aquatic organisms and plants streets et al 2006 by now flame retardants as well as microplastics have been widely detected in drinking water sewage and river and lake water andresen et al 2004 koelmans et al 2019 martínez carballo et al 2007 regnery et al 2011 massive global consumption of plastics has resulted in the accumulation of large volumes of plastic debris in the world s oceans eriksen et al 2014 a range of physical chemical and biological processes can cause continuous fragmentation of the plastic debris into microplastics and plastic particles of even smaller sizes besseling et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in fact all the large plastic items in the environment would break down into nano sized plastic particles and eventually become undetectable as particles despite the rather slow releases of additive flame retardants from microplastics due to their extremely low diffusion coefficients in the plastic matrices weathering can disrupt the physical and chemical structures of microplastics which facilitates the releases of flame retardants because of both smaller particle sizes and lower resistance to molecular diffusion in their matrices when the plastic debris occur in relatively large pieces the releasing half lives of flame retardants from its matrix are extremely long and the releasing fluxes of flame retardants are quite low which could not pose any significant risk to the environment and ecosystem on the other hand the progressive breakdown of plastic debris and microplastics in both physical size and chemical structures during the weathering process can greatly accelerate the releases of flame retardants as illustrated on fig 4 the releasing half life of flame retardants from plastic debris and microplastics would decrease by orders of magnitude with reduction in particle size and correspondingly their releasing fluxes would increase by orders of magnitude and thus pose much greater risk it should be noted that although relatively fast breakdown of plastic particles has been observed under laboratory conditions gigault et al 2016 lambert and wagner 2016 song et al 2017 model based estimations suggest that fragmentation of plastic debris into nano sized particles could take hundreds of years koelmans et al 2015 of course the stability of different types of plastic debris depends strongly on their chemical compositions as well as the environmental conditions despite of the growing attention on plastic debris and microplastics their actual rates of fragmentation in various environmental compartments including terrestrial marine freshwater and atmospheric ones are still unclear overall all the flame retardants contained the plastic debris are expected to be released once the plastic materials degrade into forms undetectable as particles or even before that how fast and to what extent the breakdown occurs in nature determine the releasing dynamics of flame retardants from the microplastics in the environment 4 2 risk of flame retardants released from microplastics to aquatic life flame retardants in microplastics could be transferred to aquatic organisms by two pathways ingestion of the microplastics by aquatic organisms and subsequent releases of the flame retardants within their bodies leaching of the flame retardants from microplastics into water and subsequent adsorption onto particulate organic matter in the surrounding followed by ingestion by the aquatic species jang et al 2016 rochman 2019 microplastics could be ingested by a variety of aquatic organisms and most of them would be retained in the digestive tract before being excreted within hours or a few days duis and coors 2016 however with decreases in particle size microplastics could also be found in the other tissues such as hemolymph tissue of mussels 3 0 and 9 6 μm browne et al 2008 and brain testis liver and blood of medaka 0 0394 42 μm kashiwada 2006 farrell and nelson 2013 found that fluorescent ps microspheres 0 5 μm remained in the hemolymph of crabs for 21 days the presence of microplastics inside aquatic organisms indicates that ingestion can be an important route of flame retardant exposure for them farrell and nelson 2013 jang et al 2016 long term retention may increase the absorption of flame retardants by aquatic organisms narvaez valderrama et al 2016 simulated the releases of pbdes from microplastics in the lugworm gut and found that only limited amounts of pbdes could leach out of the particles with a radius over 0 1 mm while significant releases of the lower brominated pbdes up to penta bde would occur from the particles with a radius of 0 01 mm under a gut retention time of 0 25 days in contrast most pbdes up to hexa bde would be released when the gut retention time was increased to 20 days it has also been found that the stomach oil of seabird could leach 12 6 15 6 of the pbdes from the microplastic pellets of around 3 mm in diameter in 15 days which are over 20 times more than those leached by a water based leaching solution kosuke et al 2015 greater leaching of the more lipophilic flame retardants from microplastics than the less lipophilic ones was also observed in simulated avian gastrointestinal fluid which was attributed to their greater affinity towards the lipophilic leaching medium guo et al 2019 aquatic organisms can indirectly absorb flame retardants released by microplastics from water through the skin and the respiratory and digestion systems it is rather difficult to distinguish whether the bioaccumulated flame retardants are directly or indirectly absorbed by aquatic organisms as these uptake processes occur simultaneously jang et al 2016 found that the body concentrations of hbcd in mussels were proportional to the levels of styrofoam in the mussels inhabiting styrofoam debris and postulated that indirect uptake via water could be a substantial exposure route given the high leaching potential of hbcd from styrofoam fish at stations with greater densities of microplastics were also found to have significantly higher concentrations of pbdes in their tissues than those from the stations with fewer microplastics rochman et al 2014 pbdes at 0 084 ng g wet wt were detected in juvenile yellowtail in the north pacific which is located over 1800 km away from the coast of california gassel et al 2013 as this region is far away from industrial and municipal areas the flame retardants detected in the marine organisms most likely resulted from exposure to microplastics instead of direct uptake from the seawater which contained pbdes at extremely low concentrations gassel et al 2013 in comparison the fish from the bohai sea of china which receives large volumes of pollutants discharged from the coastal industrial operations were found to contain pbdes at levels up to 36 ng g wet wt such high levels of flame retardants probably resulted from leaching of the ingested microplastics in the fish bodies and ingestion of particular organic matter with adsorbed pbdes table s12 shows that the aquatic organisms from coastal water of china had significantly elevated levels of brominated flame retardants compared to those from other coastal regions of the world and remote oceans which probably resulted primarily from pollution of the marine environment by industrial sources despite of the growing interests on the environmental distribution fate and risk of chemical additives released from microplastics no consensus can be reached on whether they cause significant harm to the environment and ecosystem kwon et al 2017 the toxic effect of pbdes in aquatic ecosystem has been relatively well studied although zhang et al 2013 reported that bde 209 showed acute toxicity on marine bloom forming microalgae heterosigma akashiwo and karenia mikimotoi with the former being more sensitive the concentrations bde 209 used in the acute toxicity test ranged from 5 to 150 mg l which are 4 to 6 orders of magnitude greater than its water solubility in fact it has been reported that the higher brominated congeners of pbdes such as bde 209 could exert little toxic effect on microalgae birnbaum and staskal 2004 european commission 2004 with a rather high molecular weight or molecular size and extremely low water solubility 0 1 μg l at 24 c bde 209 could not be efficiently uptake by organisms as a result of its negligible bioavailability bde 209 is believed to have no ecotoxicological importance hardy 2000 in contrast the lower brominated bde congeners have been well observed to have greater toxicity to phytoplankton or zooplankton in aquatic ecosystem compared to the higher brominated ones breitholtz and wollenberger 2003 mhadhbi et al 2012 lee and kim 2015 evandri et al 2003 reported a 24 h half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 0 58 mg l for exposure of freshwater zooplankton daphnia manga to bde 99 källqvist et al 2006 observed that bde 47 could inhibit the growth of marine diatom skeletonema costatum and the no observed effect concentration noec was 6 6 mg l although bde 47 was likely to be present in a colloidal form at such a high aqueous concentration zhao et al 2017 found that bde 47 at concentrations ranging from 0 074 to 0 697 mg l inhibited the population growth cellular structure photosynthetic function and antioxidant system of two microalgal species alexandrium minutum and dunaliella salina with the former being more sensitive qiu et al 2018 reported that in vivo and in vitro exposure to 5 20 μg l of bde 47 for 14 days significantly suppressed the growth of aquatic plant lemna minor and greatly reduced the contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein in the fronds which was attributed to the remarkable oxidative damage induced by bde 47 in the frond cells it is worth noting that these toxicological studies were mostly conducted with brominated flame retardants at concentrations much higher than those detected in aquatic environment ng l or lower to sub μg l and some time even above their water solubility several studies have shown that the leachates from a range of new commercial plastic products exerted significant toxic effects on aquatic invertebrates bejgarn et al 2015 li et al 2016 lithner et al 2009 2012 chemical analysis revealed complex mixture of substances in the plastic leachates while results of toxicity identification evaluation tests suggested that hydrophobic organic compounds and metals in certain cases were the main causes for the toxicity li et al 2016 lithner et al 2009 2012 it should be noted that these laboratory investigations were mostly conducted with virgin plastics of relatively large particle sizes and at rather high plastic concentrations nobre et al 2015 evaluated the toxicity of leachates from virgin and beach stranded plastic pellets on the larvae of sea urchin lytechinus variegatus and found that the leached chemicals from these pellets reduced the viability of sea urchin larvae with the newly released pellets exhibiting greater toxicity than the beach stranded ones gandara e silva et al 2016 found that the leachates from virgin plastic pellets and beach collected microplastics impaired the embryo development of brown mussel perna perna with the leachates from beached collected microplastics having greater toxicity gardon et al 2020 reported that the leachates from plastic pearl farming gear impaired the embryo larval development of pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera and the leachates from the new plastic gear had greater toxicity compared to those from the aged ones the apparently conflicting results in different studies can be explained by the fact that the contaminants released from the microplastics in the environment come from two sources the additives used in the product manufacturing and the chemicals especially the hydrophobic organic pollutants accumulated on them as a result the toxicity of the leachates from virgin plastic pellets on biota arises from the additives released from their matrices while the toxic effects of microplastics are contributed by both desorption of the various types of environmental pollutants accumulated on their surfaces and leaching of the additives present in their matrices unfortunately although the toxic effects of chemicals released from microplastics have been observed the structures of chemicals causing such effects have not been identified because of the complexity in the chemical composition of plastic leachates as well as the challenge in the assessment of joint toxic action of chemical mixtures for flame retardants that are intentionally added in plastic production diffusion in the matrices of microplastics is often the key step that controls the overall transfer from microplastics to water and air as well even though the fugacity of additive flame retardants in the plastic phase is much greater than that in water or air their concentrations in aquatic environment are low because equilibrium in their fugacity between the two phases could not be reached under environmental conditions kwon et al 2017 lee et al 2017 as discussed previously the fluxes of flame retardants released from microplastics are extremely low due to their very slow diffusion in plastic matrices despite of the large amounts of flame retardants contained in them on the other hand even without diffusion limitation the concentrations of plastic additives in the open ocean water would be extremely low based on the levels of microplastics and their contents in the plastic matrices kwon et al 2017 thus the flame retardants released from microplastics are unlikely to pose any significant risk to the marine environment and ecosystem in general nonetheless the risk should be evaluated in the zones that favor accumulation of plastic debris such as semi enclosed and shallow embayments for example significant enrichment of hbcd has been observed in the coastal sediments near oyster culture farms in a semi enclosed bay in south korea due to the releases from the debris of massively used styrofoam buoys al odaini et al 2015 the available studies on the toxic effects of leachates from microplastics have been conducted under laboratory conditions while evaluating the exposed species in such hot spots would provide conclusions that are more applicable in real world hale et al 2020 while the risk of flame retardant leaching from microplastics is not adequately understood at this time no significant environmental and ecological risk has been reported for the flame retardants released from microplastics in the general marine environment so far nonetheless the risk could well increase with the accumulation of more plastic debris and microplastics in the world s oceans and the progressive fragmentation of large number of microplastics especially in the hot spots with significant enrichment of microplastics 5 knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research there are growing concerns on the environmental and ecosystem risk brought by microplastics while the releases of flame retardants from microplastics have received little attention probably because the overall leaching fluxes are low nonetheless with rather high contents in plastic matrices and the acceleration of release rates accompanying the physical and chemical degradation of microplastics the environmental releases of flame retardants from the large volumes of microplastics in the environment can be a significant problem fig 5 schematically depicts the transport of microplastics in the environment and the releases of flame retardants during their transport the factors affecting the release kinetics of flame retardants and the potential impact of the released flame retardants on the environment and ecosystem it is worth noting that the above discussions on flame retardants are also applicable to the other types of additives present in plastics such as fillers plasticizers antioxidants and thermal stabilizers as they are all small molecular substances and their releases from microplastic matrices involve the very same processes as those of flame retardants to better understand the environmental and ecosystem risk posed by the flame retardants in microplastics and minimize the adverse impact from the continued use of flame retardants in plastics future research should focus on understanding the mechanical chemical and biological processes that could degrade microplastics and facilitate the diffusion of flame retardants in their matrices developing predictive models for the releases of different flame retardants from various types of plastic matrices and designing and developing alternative flame retardants that could pose little risk to the environment and ecosystem such research and development efforts will help close the current knowledge gaps on the transport fate and ecosystem risk of flame retardants in microplastics and lower the concerns on their environmental releases from the widely occurring plastic debris 5 1 understanding the mechanical chemical and biological processes that could cause degradation of microplastics it has been estimated that it would take 105 to 1012 years for half of the bde 209 in abs microplastics 0 15 2 0 mm in diameters to be released if the plastic matrix would remain intact sun et al 2016 nonetheless a wide range of mechanical chemical and biological processes can cause degradation of microplastics and thus accelerate the releases of flame retardants exposure to heat oxygen sunlight and liquids can cause oxidation cracking cross linking hydrolysis transesterification dissolution or swelling of the plastic matrices and such changes in physical and or chemical properties of microplastics subsequently affect the releases of flame retardants li et al 2011 heat accelerates the degradation of polymers but cross linking of the polymers during degradation induced by heat may alter the properties of plastics in an opposite way li et al 2011 oxygen can cause oxidation of the polymers rendering the plastics to degrade or cross link the degradation of plastics is characterized by softening sticking and decreases in molecular weights while their cross linking is characterized by hardening brittleness and increases in molecular weights thus the releases of flame retardants are expected to be accelerated with progressive degradation of microplastics but the opposite could also occur under special circumstances the influence of sunlight exposure on plastics is also complex light can harden the structures of plastics which inhibits the diffusion of flame retardants while it can also cause degradation of plastics which accelerates the releases of flame retardants from their matrices while photo oxidation is a key process responsible for the degradation of plastic debris and microplastics at water surface or exposed land surface liu et al 2020 the brominated flame retardants released from microplastics could also undergo photochemical transformation which mainly occurs through the pathways of debromination and ether bond cleavage ling et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 under strong sunlight irradiation degradation of the flame retardants could proceed faster than their releases from microplastics which causes their depletion on the surface of microplastics and in the surrounding environment e g surface water this could accelerate the leaching of flame retardants due to the greater concentration gradients between the microplastic matrix and plastic medium boundary layer when mass transfer across the boundary layer also poses significant resistance under combustion conditions phosphonate based flame retardants are known to induce cross linking and carbonization of polymer degradation fragments often in the presence of metal oxides as catalysts producing a carbonaceous char on the surface that reduces the releases of volatiles from the plastics ebdon et al 2000 liu et al 2016 weil and patel 2003 similarly the leaching of flame retardants from microplastic matrices would be inhibited if their photochemical transformation products could cross link on the surface although cross linking products have not been observed in the very limited number of photodegradation studies conducted while microorganisms can degrade the polymers that occur naturally they are not capable of degrading the large majority of plastics produced from petroleum based synthetic polymers hale et al 2020 nonetheless recent studies indicate that certain microorganisms have adapted to degrade synthetic polymers for example the gut bacteria of plastic eating mealworms larvae of tenebrio molitor linnaeus were found to be able to degrade and mineralize ps slowly yang et al 2015 yoshida et al 2016 isolated a novel bacterium from pet debris contaminated environmental samples at a pet bottle recycling site which enzymatically converts pet into the constituent monomers for subsequent use as major energy and carbon sources brandon et al 2018 observed that the biodegradation rates of pe and ps by mealworms were comparable and attributed the lack of specificity in the degradation of chemically dissimilar plastics to the adaptability of the mealworm gut microbiome despite of the enrichment and isolation of bacteria capable of degrading plastics biodegradation is not expected to play an important role in the overall weathering and breakdown of microplastics in the natural environment krueger et al 2015 tokiwa et al 2009 the swelling of plastic matrices by liquids could loosen the molecular chains which significantly reduces the steric hindrance for diffusion of flame retardant molecules and thus facilitates their releases for example it has been observed that swelling of the matrix of ldpe caused by n hexane greatly accelerated the diffusion of pbdes narvaez valderrama et al 2016 mechanical action can also affect the releases of flame retardants from microplastics by altering their sizes and physical structures as discussed in section 3 3 it is worth noting that the factors discussed above including heat oxidation sunlight exposure biodegradation swelling by liquids and physical abrasion do not act on microplastics alone in the environment thus it is necessary to quantify their impact on the diffusion of flame retardants within the matrices of microplastics individually as well as when working together uptake of microplastics by aquatic organisms occurs through direct ingestion and breathing through their gills and indirectly through ingestion of the organisms that contain microplastics the ingested microplastics undergo physical and chemical digestion in the bodies as a result they are further broken down into smaller particles through chewing and gastrointestinal motility which increases the surface areas for reactions with digestive enzymes kong and singh 2010 these processes significantly alter the physical and chemical integrity of microplastics and thus accelerate the releases of flame retardants from them the releases of flame retardants from microplastics ingested by aquatic organisms and seabirds as well depend not only on their retention time in the bodies but also on the in vivo environment where they reside for instance it has been shown that the releases of flame retardants increased dramatically when the microplastics were soaked in seabirds stomach oil due to the significant reduction in the steric hindrance to the diffusion of flame retardants in the plastic matrices kosuke et al 2015 thus better understanding on the releases of flame retardants from the microplastics in bodies is also needed for more accurate assessment of their risk to the organisms 5 2 modeling the release kinetics of different flame retardants from various types of plastic matrices microplastics found in the environment are typically made of various types of plastics which contain different flame retardants at varying levels relatively good understanding on the release behaviors of brominated flame retardants from the major types of plastics has been obtained from the limited research conducted so far as a wide variety of flame retardants and plastics exist there remains a significant need to quantify the environmental releases of the major additive flame retardants from various types of microplastics under different conditions with limited data on the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in microplastic matrices and the established relationship between diffusion coefficient and various properties of the diffusants e g molecular diameter and plastic matrices e g tg models even empirical ones can greatly facilitate the prediction of the release behaviors of flame retardants from microplastics under relevant conditions such models are critically needed for quantitative assessment of the impact of flame retardants in microplastics on the environment and ecosystem the fundamental understanding on the effects of sunlight heat and other factors on the plastic matrices should also be incorporated into these modeling tools to better predict the long term releases of flame retardants from microplastics in natural environment 5 3 development of environmentally benign flame retardants besides aquatic organisms humans are also exposed to flame retardants in water air and food through the skin and the digestive and respiratory systems some of the flame retardants with high human toxicity have been banned while many of the current use ones are also known to have negative impact on the ecosystem and human health with increasingly stringent regulations on flame retardants environment friendly flame retardants should be actively developed to replace the current use ones the green chemistry principles could help guide the efforts on design and development of such new products a the harm to the ecological environment around the factory in the production and the use of flame retardants should be minimized or eliminated b the flame retardants should not cause environmental pollution during fire and c degradation of the flame retardant should not bring irreversible damages to the atmosphere soil water and organisms anastas and eghbali 2010 a potential challenge in the development and commercial adoption of alternative flame retardants is the cost as the primary criteria of the manufacturers are cost and performance shaw et al 2010 ath mdh nitrogen and silicon based flame retardants are considered environmentally benign as they could pose little risk to human health and the environment however they all suffer the major drawback of high loadings which can bring significant detrimental effects on the physical properties of polymers innes and innes 2004 significant effort has been devoted to reducing the required loadings of ath and mdh in plastic manufacturing sauerwein 2014 surface treatments can improve their physical electrical flame or chemical resistance properties and make them acceptable in many applications innes and innes 2004 reducing the overall loading is also the future development trend for nitrogen based flame retardants klatt 2014 with inferior yield and performance compared to ath and mdh the development and application of nitrogen based flame retardants need to be strengthened silicon based flame retardants are thermally stable and resistant to high temperatures but the commercial products currently available are limited and relatively expensive kilinc 2014 obviously significant investment in the research and development of these promising alternative flame retardants is necessary to improve their performance and lower their cost before they can effectively substitute the ones used currently 6 conclusions the release kinetics of flame retardants is the critical link between their occurrence in microplastics at high contents and the actual risk to the environment and ecosystem internal diffusion within the plastic matrix is often the rate limiting step for the releases of additive flame retardants from microplastics which can be well described by the fick s law and other empirical models empirical and semi empirical models are available to predict the diffusion of different flame retardants in various types of plastic matrices and the effect of ambient temperature although the low fluxes of flame retardants released from microplastics are not expected to pose significant risk to the environment and ecosystem their releases could be greatly accelerated by a range of physical chemical and biological processes efforts are needed to better understand the rates and extents of microplastics degradation in the environment and the accompanying changes in the release behaviors of flame retardants while environment friendly flame retardants should also be actively developed to ultimately minimize the risk to the environment and ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors

17608,the widely occurring debris of plastic materials particularly microplastics can be an important source of flame retardants which are one of the main groups of chemicals added in the production of plastics from polymers this review provides an overview on the use of flame retardants in plastic manufacturing the kinetics of their releases from microplastics the factors affecting their releases and the potential environmental and ecosystem risk of the released flame retardants the releases of flame retardants from microplastics typically involve three major steps internal diffusion mass transfer across the plastic medium boundary layer and diffusion in the environmental medium while the overall mass transfer rate is commonly controlled by diffusion within the plastic matrix the overall release rates of additive flame retardants from microplastics which are dependent on the particle s geometry can often be described by the fick s law the physicochemical properties of flame retardant and plastic matrix and ambient temperature all affect the release rate which can be predicted with empirical and semi empirical models weathering of microplastics which reduces their particle sizes and likely disrupts their polymeric structures can greatly accelerate the releases of flame retardants flame retardants could also be released directly from the microplastics ingested by aquatic organisms and seabirds with physical and chemical digestion in the bodies significantly enhancing their release rates limited by the extremely slow diffusion in plastic matrices the fluxes of flame retardants released from microplastics are very low and are unlikely to pose significant risk to the ecosystem in general more research is needed to characterize the mechanical chemical and biological processes that degrade microplastics and accelerate the releases of flame retardants and to model their release kinetics from microplastics while efforts should also be made to develop environmentally benign flame retardants to ultimately minimize their risk to the environment and ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics flame retardants release kinetics internal diffusion fick s law ecosystem risk 1 introduction plastics are polymers with various additives nouman et al 2017 due to their excellent chemical stability electrical insulation characteristics easiness to process and low cost plastics have been widely used in the electronics construction transportation and packaging industries and they have brought significant medical and technological advances energy conservation and other societal benefits plasticseurope 2019 rodrigues et al 2019 xia et al 2020 yeo et al 2020 as a result the production volume of plastics had increased consistently from around 0 5 million tonnes in 1950 to over 350 million tonnes in 2018 plasticseurope 2019 thompson et al 2009 composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen most polymers are highly combustible and burn at high temperatures delva et al 2018 once the polymers combust their molten drips can ignite nearby combustibles causing the fire to spread ray and kuruma 2020a in addition the burning of polymers also emits corrosive or toxic gases e g co hcn so2 h2s and nh3 and smokes these toxic smokes cause significant difficulty for evacuation life saving and fire fighting efforts kim et al 2018 ray and kuruma 2020a the flammability of polymers is usually measured by the limiting oxygen index loi which is the minimum concentration of oxygen required to support their combustion polymers with loi values lower than 21 are generally considered flammable archibald et al 2004 john 2019 the loi values of polymers commonly used for plastic production are summarized in table s1 polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polyurethane pu which account for more than half of the european demand for all plastics in 2018 are flammable plasticseurope 2019 thus enhancing their intrinsic fire resistance is a major task in producing plastics from these polymers and addition of flame retardants has been the most logical and effective solution flame retardants are an essential group of chemical additives added in the manufacturing of plastics to protect them from the ignition and spread of flame during service life ray and kuruma 2020a they typically make up 10 20 of the weight of plastics and their total share in the global plastic market is only lower than those of fillers and plasticizers table s2 the combustion of plastics in air can generally be divided into three stages a heating and pyrolysis in which the plastics are decomposed by heat to produce combustible species b ignition in which the combustible gases are ignited in the air and c flame spread in which part of the heat generated by the combustion process promotes the plastics to decompose and sustain the burning alaee 2003 flame retardants can act at any of these three stages interrupting or retarding the combustion reactions of the combustible gases and or delaying or interrupting the decomposition reactions of plastics to prevent combustion chen and wang 2009 dasari et al 2013 hollingbery and hull 2010 schreiber and saur 2011 it has been demonstrated that the products with flame retardants performed much better in the fire and the amount of heat released was only a quarter of that of the products containing no such additives vytenis et al 1988 the use of flame retardants greatly increases the time to react escape and rescue in household fires in the room with flame retardants the average available escaping time was 15 fold greater than that of the room without them hirschler 2015a morgan and gilman 2013 vytenis et al 1988 in addition a wide variety of flame retardants have been proven to have smoke suppression and drip prevention effects morgan and gilman 2013 ray and kuruma 2020a overall addition of flame retardants not only effectively reduces the flammability of plastics but also slows down the spread of fire during the combustion process preventing small fires from developing into catastrophic ones thus greatly reducing fire hazards ray and kuruma 2020a plastics and plastic containing products are often disposed of at the end of their service life with significant amounts of waste plastics ultimately ended up in the surface soils surface water and oceans chen et al 2020 henderson and green 2020 despite of their chemical stability a range of processes during the use of plastics and after their disposal including wear and tear pulverization and weathering can cause them to lose structural integrity andrady 2011 liu et al 2020 teuten et al 2009 the fragmentation of bulk plastics under the action of external forces and solar irradiation results in the breakaway of small pieces andrady 2011 liu et al 2020 the continuous weathering of plastic debris generates progressively smaller fragments silva et al 2018 therefore it is possible that the final fate of all plastics in the environment is tiny plastic debris known as microplastics which refers to plastic particles of 5 mm and smaller in sizes thompson 2019 the accumulation of microplastics in both terrestrial and marine environment has been well documented gonzález pleiter et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 it was estimated that plastics make up more than 80 of marine litter and have pervaded even the most remote marine environment auta et al 2017 gonzález pleiter et al 2020 wright et al 2013 significant efforts have been made on detecting microplastics in different types of environmental media e g seawater freshwater sediments and soils as well as identifying their potential toxicological effects on organisms which have been summarized in several recent reviews guo et al 2020b koelmans et al 2019 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 due to the inherent toxicity of most flame retardants e g halogenated ones they would potentially impact the environment and ecosystem once released from the microplastics to date a number of studies have been conducted to understand the toxicity of flame retardants on mice fish and birds in particular the halogen and phosphorus based flame retardants have been well demonstrated to have acute toxicity reproductive and developmental toxicity neurotoxicity viscera toxicity genetic toxicity mutagenicity as well as endocrine disrupting effect table s3 with microplastics dispersed widely in both terrestrial and marine environment it is important to understand the releases of flame retardants contained in their matrices and the factors affecting their releases to assess and predict the associated risk to the environment and ecosystem this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the makeup of flame retardants in commercial plastics and discuss the kinetics of their releases from microplastics the factors influencing their releases as well as the potential environmental and ecosystem impact of the released flame retardants important questions that need to be addressed and recommendations for future research are also proposed it is worth noting that this review is based on data reported in published journal articles conference proceedings books and gray literature among them the gray literature includes technical reports published by government agencies academic institutions trade publications and information collected from websites of manufacturers and other groups which is usually not peer reviewed but contains the latest data from the industry cheng et al 2014 2 makeup of flame retardants in plastics the total number of commercial flame retardants has reached thousands since their adoption in plastic production in the 18th century hirschler 2015b the compounds that are used as flame retardants usually contain one or more of the following elements b n f mg al si p s cl ca ti v cr mn fe co ni cu zn br mo sn sb i bi and la while most commercial flame retardants used today are based on br cl p al mg n sb zn sn and b khanna and pearce 1978 morgan et al 2014 ray and kuruma 2020c depending on their relationship with the polymers flame retardants can be classified into two major types additive flame retardants and reactive ones ray and kuruma 2020b the additive flame retardants are incorporated by physical dispersion without any chemical reactions with the polymers laoutid et al 2009 this is the most economical and easiest way of introducing flame retardancy into the plastics although various problems such as poor compatibility leaching and reduction of mechanical properties impair its attractiveness wazarkar et al 2015 the additive types of flame retardants are generally added into thermoplastic polymers such as pe pp polystyrene ps polycarbonate pc and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs landrock 1995 in contrast reactive flame retardants contain functional groups that allow them to be incorporated with the polymers during the synthesis as co polymers or cross linking agents to participate in the synthesis reactions usepa 2005 they are incorporated into the main chain or side chain of the polymer blocks to become structural units and are often used in the thermosetting plastics such as epoxy resin ep and pu landrock 1995 reactive flame retardants have the advantages of good stability and having little influence on the other properties of the polymers they are considered as ideal flame retardants with good effect achieved at rather low loadings schreiber and saur 2011 however reactive flame retardants are expensive compared to the additive ones which affects their market shares in addition to the compounds containing halogen phosphorus silicon and nitrogen which can be either reactive or additive flame retardants containing the other elements are usually the additive type covaci et al 2009 morgan et al 2014 wazarkar et al 2015 it should be noted that there is no clear boundary between the reactive and additive flame retardants for example tetrabromobisphenol a tbppa is used in ep as a reactive flame retardant while it is also used in abs as an additive flame retardant covaci et al 2009 innes and innes 2004 the annual global consumption of flame retardants has been increasing in recent years table s4 it was estimated that the global consumption of flame retardants was as high as 2 25 million tonnes in 2016 flameretardants online 2017 aluminum hydroxide ath which has been the largest single component on the flame retardant market accounted for 38 of the total share in 2016 halogenated flame retardant systems brominated and chlorinated which are commonly used together with the synergist antimony trioxide ato were the second largest group 22 with a market share of 18 organic phosphorus flame retardants ranked the third flameretardants online 2017 gvr 2016 flame retardants are mainly consumed by the plastics industry to meet the stringent flammability performance requirements with the polyolefin e g pe and pp applications accounting for most of the demand gvr 2016 the major terminal applications of flame retardants used in plastics include electrical and electronic industry building and construction transportation and furnishings table s5 with flame retardants used in all connectors printed wire boards enclosures and cables of televisions computers and refrigerators the electrical and electronic industry dominates the end use of flame retardants today gvr 2016 table 1 summarizes the advantages and limitations of the major types of flame retardants compared with ath and magnesium di hydroxide mdh which have to be used at minimum loadings of 40 up to 80 halogen phosphorus and silicon based flame retardants have higher flame retarding efficiency sauerwein 2014 as a result of the low required loadings such flame retardants have little effect on the physical properties of plastics and do not cause major deterioration in their processing property meanwhile the addition of boron compounds and ato as synergists can further reduce the required loadings of these flame retardants nitrogen based flame retardants have moderate flame retarding efficiency and are considered as environment friendly similar to ath mdh and silicon compounds in contrast halogenated compounds are toxic and they release corrosive and toxic gases when burned ray and kuruma 2020a nonetheless with low cost and proven effectiveness halogenated flame retardants had been widely adopted since the 1930s while their environmental and human health impact was recognized much later ray and kuruma 2020a to date the use of halogenated flame retardants of major toxicological concerns have been restricted by various regulatory rules such as the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive and the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops table s6 in 2001 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs were added to the list of pops ssc 2018 in 2002 polybrominated biphenyls pbbs and poly brominated diphenyl ethers pbdes were regulated in the rohs directive european union 2003 tetrabromodiphenyl ether tetra bdes pentabromodiphenyl ether penta bdes hexabromodiphenyl ether hexa bde and heptabromodiphenyl ether hepta bde were included in the list of pops in 2009 ssc 2018 subsequently hexabromocyclododecane hbcd decabromodiphenyl ether bde 209 and short chain chlorinated paraffins sccps were added to the list in 2013 and 2017 respectively ssc 2018 more recently the european union has announced that the use of halogenated flame retardants in electronic displays such as the enclosure and the stand will be banned on march 1 2021 european union 2019 although some of these regulations e g rohs directive were only intended for regional markets all the manufacturing countries have followed them or similar ones more or less sun et al 2016 as a result the share of halogenated flame retardants in the global market has decreased from 26 6 in 2005 to 22 in 2016 table s4 although their global production volume has continued to grow de boer and stapleton 2019 ou and lang 2010 sauerwein 2014 the total market share of halogenated flame retardants is expected to shrink further with more stringent regulatory controls on their use in the foreseeable future a clear trend of shifting from the traditional halogenated flame retardants towards non halogenated ones has already been observed in the plastics industry de boer and stapleton 2019 li et al 2019 3 releases of flame retardants from microplastics microplastics refer to the small particles of plastic materials found in the environment and their sources sizes shapes and chemical compositions can vary significantly they are often defined based on the physical sizes i e with length less than 5 mm according to national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa while they could occur in sizes ranging from 0 1 μm to less than 5 mm arthur et al 2009 based on their origins microplastics are classified into two types primary and secondary microplastics matthew et al 2011 the plastics that are directly released into the environment as small particles 5 mm are considered as primary microplastics some of these microplastics are added to products for intended purposes such as scrubbing agents in cosmetics while they can also derive from the abrasion of large plastic objects during manufacturing and use boucher and friot 2017 secondary microplastics originate from the small plastic fragments formed from the splitting or degradation of large plastic materials both in oceans and on land matthew et al 2011 secondary microplastics which result from the fragmentation of large plastic materials such as pipes decking electrical cables computer monitors and keyboards under the action of external force often contain flame retardants andrady 2011 conkle et al 2018 eerkesmedrano et al 2015 zarfl and matthies 2010 commercial plastic materials typically have high loadings of flame retardants 10 20 table s2 while no significant loss of the flame retardants from the bulk plastics during their use and even after initial disintegration could occur as a result the contents of flame retardants in the newly formed microplastics are expected to be comparable to the levels added during the production of the plastics depending on the types of plastics and the flame retardant formulations which could be quite different among the manufacturers and shifted over time due to changes in the supply markets and regulations the compositions and contents of flame retardants found in plastics vary largely despite the growing attention only several studies have characterized the compositions and contents of brominated flame retardants which are one of the major types of flame retardants used in plastic production in plastic debris and microplastics cao et al 2019 2020 guo et al 2019 jang et al 2017 sun et al 2016 yeo et al 2020 pbdes and 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe which is one of the most commonly applied substitutes of pbdes were detected at levels up to tens of mg g in recycled plastic particles and particles prepared from waste plastics table s7 pbdes and the brominated substitutes of pbdes which were adopted after the use of some pbde congeners was banned were also detected at significant levels in the plastic debris and microplastics collected in the coastal regions and in surface water table s8 although the concentrations of these brominated flame retardants in plastic debris and microplastics vary over a wide range they are typically orders of magnitude higher than the occurrence levels of these pollutants in the atmosphere or the aquatic environment thus microplastics could potentially serve as an importance source of flame retardants in the environment for a long time both the reactive and additive flame retardants could be released from microplastics the additive flame retardants are not chemically bound to the polymer chains and interact with the plastic matrices only through intermolecular forces thus they can move relatively freely within the polymer matrix helmroth 2002 in contrast the reactive ones are bonded with the polymer chains and their releases can occur only when an excess of non polymerized flame retardants are present in the plastics rauert et al 2014 thus the environmental releases of reactive flame retardants are not expected to be significant compared to the additive ones in the absence of degradation of the plastic matrices accordingly the rest part of this review focuses only on the releases of additive flame retardants particularly brominated ones from microplastics in the environment 3 1 kinetics of flame retardant releases from microplastics the critical link between the occurrence of flame retardants in microplastics at rather high contents and their actual environmental and ecosystem risk is the release kinetics as shown on fig 1 the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into the environmental medium e g air or water usually occur via three major steps a internal diffusion within the microplastic matrix b transport across the microplastic medium boundary layer and c diffusion into the environmental medium lee et al 2018a sun et al 2016 2019 if one of these steps is significantly slower than the others it becomes rate limiting for the overall release process siepmann and siepmann 2012 with the diffusion coefficients of molecules in solid phase being many orders of magnitude lower than those in air or water internal diffusion and or transport across the plastic medium boundary layer could well be the rate limiting step for the releases of flame retardants from microplastics detailed investigations on the rate limiting step in the releases of brominated flame retardants from microplastics have been made recently sun et al 2016 estimated the values for the mass transfer resistance which is defined as the reciprocal of mass transfer coefficient of the three major processes involved in the releases of major brominated flame retardants pbdes and btbpe from abs microplastics into the air based on the typical values for the relevant parameters including the length of the diffusion path δ m the diffusion coefficient of the flame retardant d m2 s and the plastic air partition coefficient kp a dimensionless of the flame retardant fig 1a the mass transfer resistance of internal diffusion δ p d p s m could be 13 or more orders of magnitude higher than that of plastic air boundary layer δ p a d p k p a s m sun et al 2016 it was also noted that the release rates of brominated flame retardants from abs microplastic particles at 10 30 and 50 c were several orders of magnitude lower than those determined by surface evaporation i e when mass transfer across the plastic air boundary layer is rate limiting sun et al 2016 as a result the resistance of mass transfer across the plastic air boundary layer could be ignored in the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into the air which greatly simplifies the modeling of their release kinetics sun et al 2016 for the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into the water or other liquid phases the mass transfer across the plastic water boundary layer could also be a rate limiting step model calculation results by endo et al 2013 showed that the desorption of pcbs from millimeter sized pe pellets was limited by the mass transfer across the aqueous boundary layer as the pcb congeners had adsorbed from the environmental media onto the field collected pe pellets they were expected to be enriched on or near the surface layer instead of being distributed uniformly within the plastic matrix which could make internal diffusion less important compared to the mass transfer across the plastic water boundary layer in the desorption process lee et al 2018b investigated the desorption behavior of hexachlorocyclohexanes hchs and chlorinated benzenes from pe and pp sheets and found that the desorption of hchs was predominantly determined by diffusion within the plastic matrix whereas that of chlorinated benzenes was controlled by mass transfer across the aqueous boundary layer it should be noted that the hchs and chlorinated benzenes were loaded onto the plastic sheets using n hexane as the solvent in the study of lee et al 2018b although soaking in n hexane for 24 h would lead to more homogenous distribution of the spiked chemicals within the plastic matrices narvaez valderrama et al 2016 this caused significant swelling of the plastic sheets lee et al 2018b which altered the mass transfer resistance for internal diffusion of the chemicals in fact the diffusion coefficients reported for hchs and chlorinated benzenes in the swollen pe and pp sheets by n hexane were several orders of magnitude higher compared to those of brominated flame retardants with comparable molecular weights observed in abs microplastics lee et al 2018b sun et al 2016 2019 the relative importance of external and internal mass transfer for the releases of flame retardants from microplastics into aqueous solution can be quantitatively evaluated with the mass transfer biot number bi dimensionless which is calculated as the ratio of the transport rate across the plastic water boundary layer to the diffusion rate within the microplastic particle lee et al 2018b sun et al 2019 1 b i k m l d p where dp is the diffusion coefficient of flame retardant in plastic matrix m2 s l is the characteristic dimension of the plastic layer m and km is the mass transfer coefficient in the plastic water boundary layer m s km can be calculated from the diffusion coefficient of flame retardant in water dw m2 s its plastic water partition coefficient kp w dimensionless and the thickness of aqueous boundary layer on the microplastic particle δ m as booij et al 2003 crank 1975 2 k m d w k p w δ internal diffusion within the microplastic particle determines the overall release of flame retardant when bi is greater than 100 mass transfer across the plastic water boundary layer is rate limiting when bi is less than 1 whereas both steps are important in the cases with bi values between 1 and 100 cho et al 2006 sun et al 2019 it is important to differentiate the desorption of flame retardants adsorbed on the external surface of microplastics and the releases of additive flame retardants from the microplastic matrix for the flame retardants and other hydrophobic organic pollutants enriched on the surface of the microplastics their desorption is most likely controlled by the diffusion across the plastic water boundary later due to their enrichment on the surface and within the surface layer in contrast the additive flame retardants are distributed uniformly within the plastic matrix without excess molecules present on the external surface thus internal diffusion plays a key role in their overall releases sun et al 2019 for the releases of pbdes and btbpe from abs microplastics in water the bi values are in the range of 109 to 1016 which indicates that internal diffusion is clearly the rate limiting step sun et al 2019 in fact internal diffusion within microplastics has long been recognized as the rate controlling step for the transfer of hydrophobic organic pollutants contained in them to the organisms dwelling in sediments koelmans et al 2013 teuten et al 2007 2009 internal diffusion was also assumed to solely control the releases of pbdes from microplastic spheres of low density polyethylene ldpe and silicone rubber narvaez valderrama et al 2016 in addition internal diffusion within the plastic matrix has been well accepted to be the rate limiting step in the releases of additives from food packaging helmroth 2002 it should be noted that the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in the matrix of a given microplastic partlces could change over time especially when weathered over a long time the physicochemical properties e g crystallinity oxygen containing groups and size of microplastics can be significantly altered by various processes during weathering in the natural environment such as sunlight irradiation oxidation and physical abrasion jahnke et al 2017 liu et al 2020 in particular breakdown of the polymeric structure could greatly reduce the reisistance for diffusion of flame retardants in the matrices of microplastics while degradation of the flame retardants released from microplastics might also facilitate their releases by increasing the concentration gradients between the microplastics and surrounding medium more details discussed later these effects might well render the diffusion of flame retardants across plastic medium boundary layer more important and even become the rate limiting step in the overall mass transfer process based on the above discussion releases of additive flame retardants from microplastics are most likely to be solely controlled by their diffusion within the plastic matrices in such cases the release kinetics of flame retardants can be conveniently modeled with the fick s laws of diffusion helmroth 2002 lee et al 2018b narvaez valderrama et al 2016 sun et al 2016 2019 the basic concept is that the diffusant molecules diffuse from the locations with higher concentrations to the adjacent locations with lower concentrations siepmann and siepmann 2012 fick s first law relates the diffusive flux to the concentration under the assumption of steady state crank 1975 3 f d c x where f is the diffusion flux g s m2 c is the concentration of diffusant g m3 and x is the distance to the center of the particle m the fick s second law is for non steady diffusion and describes the concentration change at definite location brought by diffusion with respect to time t s crank 1975 4 c t d 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 2 c z 2 where x y and z are the distances to the center of the particle in three dimensional space m in the absence of significant change in the plastic matrix i e no swelling or plasticization of the polymer and when the perfect sink conditions i e the receptor chamber has an essentially zero diffusant concentration are maintained the releases of flame retardants from microplastics of various geometries can be mathematically modeled as the simplest cases crank 1975 siepmann and siepmann 2008 2012 table 2 summarizes the exact solutions and their approximations to the fick s law applied to the releases of flame retardants from microplastics in the shapes of sphere slab and cylinder based on the corresponding equations the cumulative masses of flame retardants released from microplastics of common shapes as a function of time can be easily calculated based on their diffusion coefficients and the other relevant parameters and vice versa in water and sediments the most abundant shape category of microplastics is fibers 48 5 followed by fragments 31 spheres 6 5 and films 5 5 kooi and koelmans 2019 up to date research on the releases of flame retardants as well as other additives from microplastics mainly focuses on the shapes of spheres and films hale et al 2010 howell et al 1985 narvaez valderrama et al 2016 sun et al 2016 2019 for microplastics with complex shapes and systems in which the diffusion coefficient depends on time and location there is usually no analytical solution to the fick s law siepmann et al 2012 in these cases the masses released can be obtained with numerical solutions which are often based on certain approximations such as replacement of derivatives with finite difference calculated on a spatial and or temporal grid siepmann et al 2012 siepmann and siepmann 2012 in addition to the mechanistic models discussed above a range of empirical models including zero order first order second order higuchi hixson crowell hopfenberg weibull peppas korsmeyer and peppas sahlin models have also been used to describe the release kinetics of molecules from solid matrices table s9 although only few of them were applied to model the releases of additives from microplastics chi et al 2015 flores and kong 2017 varma et al 2004 guo and co workers simulated the leaching kinetics of brominated flame retardants from abs in gastric fluid with first order second order and higuchi models and found that the second order model performed better than the others guo et al 2020a the zero order first order second order and higuchi models are commonly used for systems whose structure remains intact guo et al 2020a varma et al 2004 while the hixson crowell and hopfenberg models are often applied in study of the erodible formulations siepmann and siepmann 2008 varma et al 2004 in contrast the weibull peppas korsmeyer and peppas sahlin models can be applied to the swellable plastics e g polymers added with large amounts of plasticizers chi et al 2015 siepmann and siepmann 2008 varma et al 2004 3 2 diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastic matrices quantification of the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastic matrices is key for understanding and predicting the release behaviors of these additives from microplastics helmroth 2002 a classic phenomenological model for the diffusivity of diffusant molecules in various polymers is the free volume theory of diffusion developed by vrentas and duda 1978 which is based on the assumption that the diffusion of a small diffusant molecule is accompanied by movement in the polymer matrix to fill the free volume left by the displaced diffusant molecule rafailovich and sokolov 2001 vrentas et al 1989 as illustrated on fig 2 the free volume arises from the dynamic and transient molecular scale free spaces between the entangled polymer chains with the opening or closing of the channels brought by the translation of the polymer chains providing pathways for diffusive jumps marcilla and beltrán 2012 wilson et al 2018 as a result the diffusion coefficients predicted by the free volume theory are closely related to the space filling properties of both the diffusant and the polymer matrix ramesh and duda 2001 the self diffusion constant d1 m2 s can be expressed as the product of two factors an arrhenius term e typically at around 4 2 kj mol which represents the probability of a diffusant molecule having sufficient energy to escape its local environment and a term indicating the probability of local density fluctuation is large enough to produce sufficient free volume for the movement of diffusant molecules rafailovich and sokolov 2001 and it can be estimated as 5 d 1 d 0 e x p e r t e x p γ v c r i t v m i x t u r e t where d 0 is a pre exponential factor m2 s v crit is the critical local hole free volume required for a diffusive jump m3 v mixture t is the average hole free volume in the mixture m3 and γ 0 5 1 dimensionless is an overlap factor that accounts for the access of the same free volume by multiple molecules v crit has only a weak dependence on temperature t k while v mixture t increases significantly with temperature the free volume theory can explain the reduction in d1 with increases in cross linking of the polymer and the temperature effect as well as the more pronounced effect for the larger diffusants rafailovich and sokolov 2001 it is worth noting that the free volume model contains several adjustable parameters that are difficult to predict or measure except for a few model systems helmroth 2002 tonge and gilbert 2001 tonge and gilbert 2001 found that the prediction was reasonable for the diffusion coefficient of methyl methacrylate in polymethyl methacrylate pmma but the priori predictions had significant errors for the other systems there are a few ways to determine the diffusion coefficient either from empirical or semi empirical methods or based on approximations to values of certain properties mantina et al 2009 table s10 lists some common empirical formulas that can be used to estimate the diffusion coefficient in plastic matrix based on the physical and chemical properties of the diffusant and the polymer although these methods may not yield highly accurate results they could provide reasonably good approximations based on available property values of the diffusant and the plastic experimentally the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants within microplastics could be estimated by fitting the observed release fluxes to the solutions to the fick s laws sun et al 2016 2019 for spherical particles of radius r m and infinite exposure time karapanagioti and werner 2019 estimated the diffusion coefficients from the experimentally observed first order rate constant k 1 s as 6 d k r 2 π 2 based on the value of k 1 16 10 6 1 s for the release of pcb 153 from ldpe pellet r 3 10 4 m reported in the study of rochman et al 2013 the diffusion coefficient of pcb 153 in ldpe was calculated to be 1 06 10 14 m2 s karapanagioti and werner 2019 which is on the same order as the value 5 24 10 1m2 s reported by rusina et al 2010 for pcb 153 in ldpe in the study of rochman et al 2013 the k values for the releases of pcbs from high density polyethylene hdpe ldpe pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc were 1 16 10 6 2 31 10 6 2 31 10 6 5 79 10 6 and 5 79 10 6 1 s respectively it could thus be estimated that the diffusion coefficients of pcbs in these plastics are all at the level of 10 14m2 s table 3 summarizes the diffusion coefficients of different flame retardants in various types of plastics reported in the literature and table s11 lists those of other types of compounds in plastics as expected the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants show significant dependence on their properties the plastic matrices and the temperature berk 2009 3 3 factors affecting the diffusion of flame retardants within microplastics the diffusion of flame retardants in plastic matrix is closely related to the free volume within the polymer and the segmental chain mobility which are affected by the degree of unsaturation the extent of crystallinity and the nature of the substituents karapanagioti and werner 2019 the glass transition temperature tg which is determined by the type of polymer is an important plastic property table s1 also lists the tg values of common polymers used for the production of plastics as the ambient temperature is increased to tg gradual and reversible transition of the plastic material from a glassy or semi crystalline state into a rubbery state occurs at temperatures below tg k or c the energy of the polymeric molecules is too low to overcome the rotating barrier in the main chain thus it cannot sustain the movement of the chain segment which is in a frozen state helmroth 2002 sperling 2006 under such conditions only vibrational and short range rotational motions are involved and the chance of finding a sufficiently large hole for the flame retardants to move is limited helmroth 2002 platé and shibaev 1987 sperling 2006 when the temperature is raised above tg the polymer molecules in a rubbery state are capable of segmental chain movement endo and koelmans 2019 sperling 2006 yohei et al 2012 as a result the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in a plastic material can differ dramatically at temperatures below and above its tg naylor 1989 for example it has been observed that the diffusion coefficient of bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate in pvc increased drastically once the temperature was raised above its tg storey et al 1991 it is well known that tg increases and all dynamics within the polymer matrix is slowed as the cross link density in the plastic increases rafailovich and sokolov 2001 plastics with lower tg values have greater chain segmental mobility allowing the flame retardant molecules in them to move more easily sun et al 2019 for example the diffusion coefficient of hexachlorobenzene hecb in pe tg 120 c is two orders of magnitude higher than that in pp tg 10 c at 25 c table 3 the presence of ch3 units as the side group in pp increases the resistance of chain movement resulting in much lower chain segmental mobility in pp compared to that in pe at the same temperature the diffusion coefficients of pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in polydimethylsiloxane pdms tg 125 c were also found to be higher than those in ldpe rusina et al 2010 the faster diffusion of pcbs and pahs in pdms could be attributed to the fact that the main chain unit of pdms si o has lower rotational resistance than that of pe c c in general factors that increase the energy required for the onset of segment motion such as intermolecular forces internal chain steric hindrance bulky groups and stiff side groups increase the tg of plastic matrix and thus reduce the diffusion of flame retardants sperling 2006 in contrast the presence of flexible side groups symmetrical substitution and in chain groups promoting flexibility e g double bonds and ether linkages can decrease tg and facilitate the diffusion of flame retardants in the plastic matrices sperling 2006 the dependence of a diffusant s diffusion coefficient on the tg of plastic matrix can be described by the following empirical relationship brown and park 1970 williams et al 1955 7 ln d c b f g a 1 a 2 t t g where c is an empirical constant dimensionless b is a constant that is related to the critical local free volume required for diffusion dimensionless fg is the fraction of free space in the polymer dimensionless at tg k a1 1 k and a2 1 k are the expansion coefficients in the glassy state and at the transition to the rubbery state respectively and t is the temperature k fig 3 a shows the linear dependence of log10 d of bde 209 at 20 c on the tg of different plastic materials as expected at a given temperature the plastics with higher tg values have lower segmental chain movement and thus pose greater resistance on the diffusion of additives present in their matrices for polymers that contain crystalline region e g pe crystallinity is also an important factor that affects the diffusion of flame retardants as shown in table s11 the diffusion coefficient of acenaphthylene acy in ldpe with crystallinity generally in the range of 55 65 is higher than that in hdpe which has much higher crystallinity usually 80 the crystalline regions where the polymer chains are regularly arranged have an ordered structure as such structure increases the density of the polymers the density of hdpe is 0 94 0 97 g cm3 compared to 0 91 0 94 g cm3 of ldpe it is not conductive to the diffusion of flame retardants sperling 2006 consequently the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants are lower in the plastics with higher crystallinity the diffusion coefficients of diffusants are well known to be dependent on their molar volumes and hence also on their molecular radii and molecular weights in general larger molecules encounter greater steric hindrance when passing through the polymer chains and thus diffuse slower compared to the smaller ones kwan and takada 2019 rusina et al 2010 it has been observed that the diffusivity of spherical gaseous molecules in polymers decreases exponentially with their diameters berens and hopfenberg 1982 table 3 shows that the log10 d values of pcbs in ldpe and those of pbdes in abs and ldpe all decrease with increasing molecular weights of the congeners fig 3b depicts the linear dependence of log10 d on molecular diameter for flame retardants in various types of plastics it is noted that the molecules with rigid structures which have poor conformational freedom have lower mobility in plastic matrices compared to the linear flexible molecules or molecules with symmetrical structures nouman et al 2017 rusina et al 2007 sun et al 2019 diffusion is a thermally activated process flame retardant molecules need to possess enough thermal energy to squeeze through the surrounding polymer chains thus flame retardant molecules diffuse faster within the plastic matrix as the temperature increases meanwhile the polymer matrix of plastic also becomes less rigid which reduces the resistance for diffusion of flame retardant molecules for instance the diffusion coefficient of btbpe in abs at 50 c is about three orders of magnitude higher than that at 10 c table 3 the diffusion coefficients of diffusants in polymers have strong temperature dependence which can be well described by the arrhenius equation naylor 1989 8 ln d 1 d 2 e a r 1 t 1 1 t 2 where d1 m2 s and d2 m2 s are the diffusion coefficients at temperatures of t1 k and t2 k respectively ea is the apparent activation energy for diffusion kj mol and r is the gas constant 8 314 10 3 kj mol k for diffusion of various pbdes in abs in the temperature ranges of 10 50 c the ea values were found to be in the range of 70 180 kj mol sun et al 2016 2019 the activation energies of diffusion for a range of c1 to c6 organic vapors in glassy pvc ps and pmma were found to increase linearly with their diameters berens and hopfenberg 1982 it should be noted that the arrhenius plots typically bend when measured over a wide temperature range naylor 1989 therefore attention should be paid to the appropriate temperature range when predicting the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants based on extrapolation of measurement data using the arrhenius equation besides the chemical properties of the plastic matrix and the specific diffusant an important physical property of microplastic particle size also affects the releases of flame retardants although particle size is not an intrinsic property of microplastics and the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastic matrices are independent of particle size the releasing fluxes of additive flame retardants from microplastics are size dependent as the particles with smaller sizes have higher surface area to volume ratios sun et al 2019 demonstrated that the release fluxes of pbdes from abs microplastics in the size range of 0 149 0 297 mm were much higher than those of 0 841 2 000 mm it is worth noting that the actual leaching of flame retardants from microplastics is a complicated dynamic process as the physical and chemical structures of microplastics can be gradually damaged during natural weathering liu et al 2020 in the oceans fragmentation of microplastics and thus reduction in their sizes can occur under the actions of ocean eddy current turbulence and wind force while destruction of their polymer structures surface embrittlement and cracking can also take place due to the long term immersion in seawater and exposure to sunlight irradiation and wind force conkle et al 2018 eerkesmedrano et al 2015 on the land surface freeze thaw cycles pressure due to burial under soil or snow and damages inflicted by animals or birds can also reduce the particle sizes of microplastics duis and coors 2016 lambert et al 2014 the disintegration of plastics such as pe pp and ps are mainly initiated by ultraviolet irradiation duis and coors 2016 and their matrices become brittle and fragmented due to the scission of their chain bonds yousif and haddad 2013 other types of additives co existing with the flame retardants can also affect their diffusion in particular plasticizers can promote the migration of flame retardants by increasing the mobility of polymer segments calò et al 2011 thus the releases of such additives in the environment can also impact the release behaviors of flame retardants from microplastics jambeck et al 2015 estimated that 4 8 to 12 7 million tonnes of plastic debris entered the oceans each year in 2010 and the cumulative input would increase by ten folds by 2025 the breakdown of plastic debris leads to the wide occurrence of microplastics and even nano sized plastic particles in the environment eriksen et al 2014 estimated that at least 5 25 trillion plastic particles with a total weight of 268 940 tonnes are floating in the world s oceans and that more than 233 400 tonnes of larger plastic debris are afloat at sea compared to 35 540 tonnes of microplastics as most of the smaller microplastics resulted from disintegration of the larger plastic debris their abundance in term of number is expected to be much greater than the larger ones weathering is an important process that causes the breakdown of plastic debris and generation of smaller fragments song et al 2017 observed that pellets of pe pp and styrofoam aka expanded ps all of approximately 20 mm3 in volume produced 20 8 3 6084 1061 and 10 501 1718 particles pellet respectively after being exposed to uv light for 12 months followed by mechanical abrasion with sand for 2 months while pe and pp pellets were minimally fragmented by mechanical abrasion in the absence of uv exposure significant amount of particles 4220 33 particles pellet were produced from mechanical abrasion treatment alone for styrofoam song et al 2017 the generation of smaller plastic fragments increased with decreasing size of the plastic pellets in the accelerated weathering treatment and significant losses in the volumes of the plastic materials up to three quarters for styrofoam could occur due to their breakdown into finer particles that were undetectable song et al 2017 fragmentation of plastic materials has been demonstrated to release nano sized plastic particles in laboratory studies gigault et al 2016 lambert and wagner 2016 such nano sized plastic particles have also been detected in the north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 although the rate and extent of plastic debris fragmenting into microplastics and nano sized plastic particles in the environment are unknown it has been estimated that fragmentation of plastics into such tiny particles probably took up to hundreds of years in nature koelmans et al 2015 overall once in the environment large plastic debris are expected to fragment into smaller particles under the actions of a range of mechanical thermal chemical and biological stressors besseling et al 2018 liu et al 2020 degradation of spherical microplastics in the size range of 0 1µm to 5mm into nano sized particles 100 nm in the world s oceans could increase the particle concentrations by over 14 orders of magnitude besseling et al 2018 the continuous fragmentation of plastic particles by weathering could significantly accelerate the releases of flame retardants from their matrices fig 4 schematically illustrates the changes in the total surface area of spherical plastic particles and the releasing half life i e the time required for the loss of half of the initial mass of flame retardant from them with progressive breakdown in particle size after the spherical plastic particles of 25 mm in radius are fragmented into spheres with radii of 0 025 mm the total number of particles increases by 9 orders of magnitude while the total surface area of the particles increase by 3 orders of magnitude as a result of the significant size reduction from 25 to 0 025 mm the releasing half life of flame retardant from the plastic particles decreases by 6 orders of magnitude even if their chemical structure would remain intact i e the diffusion coefficient of the flame retardant is constant on the other hand the releasing half life of flame retardant would be further lowered when its diffusion in the plastic matrix is accelerated due to breakdown of the polymeric structure during weathering 4 environmental and ecosystem impact of flame retardants released from microplastics 4 1 environmental fate of flame retardants released from microplastics the level of organic flame retardants added to plastics is usually 10 20 andrady and rajapakse 2019 innes and innes 2004 although they are present at rather high contents in plastics the release rates of flame retardants at ambient temperatures are extremely slow the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in plastics table 3 are many orders of magnitude lower than those of small organic molecules in water 10 9m2 s at 25 c cussler 2009 it has been estimated that among the 275 million tonnes of waste plastics produced in 2010 4 8 to 12 7 million tonnes entered the oceans jambeck et al 2015 with the assumptions that 4 8 million tonnes of waste plastics enter the ocean each year 30 of them contain flame retardants at a typical level of 15 and 10 of the flame retardants are brominated ones andrady and rajapakse 2019 ou and fang 2006 a total of 2 16 104 tonnes of brominated flame retardants would be introduced into the ocean each year if all these waste plastics were present in the form of microplastic particles with an uniform radius of 2 5 mm and the diffusion coefficients of the brominated flame retardants in them were 10 25m2 s a total of 51 94 kg of brominated flame retardants would be released into the ocean water from these newly introduced microplastics in the first year which is very small compared to the total masses contained in the waste plastics it should be noted that the above rough estimation carries significant uncertainty and assumes that the structures of the microplastics remain intact in the natural environment many factors such as heat light and oxygen can cause degradation of plastic matrices and thus accelerate the releases of flame retardants as discussed later the flame retardants released from microplastics can exist in the air as gaseous molecules or adsorb on the airborne particulates most of the lower brominated pbdes such as bde 47 bde 99 and bde 100 are present in the air in gaseous form and can be transported over long distances while the higher brominated ones mainly bde 209 occur mostly in the sorbed form on airborne particulates and are unlikely to be transported far away from the points of initial emissions hale et al 2004 möller et al 2012 shoeib et al 2004 relatively high levels of flame retardants ng m3 had been found in the air of electronic product recycling facilities sjodin et al 2001 in contrast the concentrations of flame retardants measured in the air of the southern ocean were much lower sub pg m3 möller et al 2012 it can thus be speculated that the microplastics generated in various processes contributed substantially to the levels flame retardants detected in the air of the recycling facilities microplastics are insoluble in water but can float in the form of particulate matter or settle into the sediment eerkesmedrano et al 2015 the small size and low density contribute to their transport across long distances especially by the ocean currents eerkesmedrano et al 2015 microplastics may also act as sorbents for the accumulation of a range of hydrophobic organic pollutants including flame retardants in the aquatic environment with the hydrophobic effect playing a major role in the sorption liu et al 2020 the direction of net chemical flow between the microplastics and aqueous phase or atmosphere is determined by the gradient of fugacity which is a measure of the tendency of the compound to escape from its confined phase mackay 2001 results of fugacity analysis suggests that equilibrium is not attained for high molecular weight pahs in open oceans with pe debris because of the long time required for the compounds with high partition coefficients to reach equilibrium between pe and seawater and their slow diffusion in pe lee et al 2017 added at rather high levels in plastic production table 1 flame retardants should have a much higher fugacity in microplastics than that in seawater for a long time and thus serve as a long term source of these pollutants in the marine environment most flame retardants have very low water solubility and high hydrophobicity thus they would adsorb onto the suspended particulates in the water column once leached out of the microplastics some flame retardants could volatilize into the air due to the increase of temperature and may return with rain and snowfall regnery and püttmann 2010 xia et al 2020 the others may be transported over long distances with the flow of water or suspended particulates and enter the sediment or soil through the interaction between water and particulates or are absorbed or accumulated by aquatic organisms and plants streets et al 2006 by now flame retardants as well as microplastics have been widely detected in drinking water sewage and river and lake water andresen et al 2004 koelmans et al 2019 martínez carballo et al 2007 regnery et al 2011 massive global consumption of plastics has resulted in the accumulation of large volumes of plastic debris in the world s oceans eriksen et al 2014 a range of physical chemical and biological processes can cause continuous fragmentation of the plastic debris into microplastics and plastic particles of even smaller sizes besseling et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in fact all the large plastic items in the environment would break down into nano sized plastic particles and eventually become undetectable as particles despite the rather slow releases of additive flame retardants from microplastics due to their extremely low diffusion coefficients in the plastic matrices weathering can disrupt the physical and chemical structures of microplastics which facilitates the releases of flame retardants because of both smaller particle sizes and lower resistance to molecular diffusion in their matrices when the plastic debris occur in relatively large pieces the releasing half lives of flame retardants from its matrix are extremely long and the releasing fluxes of flame retardants are quite low which could not pose any significant risk to the environment and ecosystem on the other hand the progressive breakdown of plastic debris and microplastics in both physical size and chemical structures during the weathering process can greatly accelerate the releases of flame retardants as illustrated on fig 4 the releasing half life of flame retardants from plastic debris and microplastics would decrease by orders of magnitude with reduction in particle size and correspondingly their releasing fluxes would increase by orders of magnitude and thus pose much greater risk it should be noted that although relatively fast breakdown of plastic particles has been observed under laboratory conditions gigault et al 2016 lambert and wagner 2016 song et al 2017 model based estimations suggest that fragmentation of plastic debris into nano sized particles could take hundreds of years koelmans et al 2015 of course the stability of different types of plastic debris depends strongly on their chemical compositions as well as the environmental conditions despite of the growing attention on plastic debris and microplastics their actual rates of fragmentation in various environmental compartments including terrestrial marine freshwater and atmospheric ones are still unclear overall all the flame retardants contained the plastic debris are expected to be released once the plastic materials degrade into forms undetectable as particles or even before that how fast and to what extent the breakdown occurs in nature determine the releasing dynamics of flame retardants from the microplastics in the environment 4 2 risk of flame retardants released from microplastics to aquatic life flame retardants in microplastics could be transferred to aquatic organisms by two pathways ingestion of the microplastics by aquatic organisms and subsequent releases of the flame retardants within their bodies leaching of the flame retardants from microplastics into water and subsequent adsorption onto particulate organic matter in the surrounding followed by ingestion by the aquatic species jang et al 2016 rochman 2019 microplastics could be ingested by a variety of aquatic organisms and most of them would be retained in the digestive tract before being excreted within hours or a few days duis and coors 2016 however with decreases in particle size microplastics could also be found in the other tissues such as hemolymph tissue of mussels 3 0 and 9 6 μm browne et al 2008 and brain testis liver and blood of medaka 0 0394 42 μm kashiwada 2006 farrell and nelson 2013 found that fluorescent ps microspheres 0 5 μm remained in the hemolymph of crabs for 21 days the presence of microplastics inside aquatic organisms indicates that ingestion can be an important route of flame retardant exposure for them farrell and nelson 2013 jang et al 2016 long term retention may increase the absorption of flame retardants by aquatic organisms narvaez valderrama et al 2016 simulated the releases of pbdes from microplastics in the lugworm gut and found that only limited amounts of pbdes could leach out of the particles with a radius over 0 1 mm while significant releases of the lower brominated pbdes up to penta bde would occur from the particles with a radius of 0 01 mm under a gut retention time of 0 25 days in contrast most pbdes up to hexa bde would be released when the gut retention time was increased to 20 days it has also been found that the stomach oil of seabird could leach 12 6 15 6 of the pbdes from the microplastic pellets of around 3 mm in diameter in 15 days which are over 20 times more than those leached by a water based leaching solution kosuke et al 2015 greater leaching of the more lipophilic flame retardants from microplastics than the less lipophilic ones was also observed in simulated avian gastrointestinal fluid which was attributed to their greater affinity towards the lipophilic leaching medium guo et al 2019 aquatic organisms can indirectly absorb flame retardants released by microplastics from water through the skin and the respiratory and digestion systems it is rather difficult to distinguish whether the bioaccumulated flame retardants are directly or indirectly absorbed by aquatic organisms as these uptake processes occur simultaneously jang et al 2016 found that the body concentrations of hbcd in mussels were proportional to the levels of styrofoam in the mussels inhabiting styrofoam debris and postulated that indirect uptake via water could be a substantial exposure route given the high leaching potential of hbcd from styrofoam fish at stations with greater densities of microplastics were also found to have significantly higher concentrations of pbdes in their tissues than those from the stations with fewer microplastics rochman et al 2014 pbdes at 0 084 ng g wet wt were detected in juvenile yellowtail in the north pacific which is located over 1800 km away from the coast of california gassel et al 2013 as this region is far away from industrial and municipal areas the flame retardants detected in the marine organisms most likely resulted from exposure to microplastics instead of direct uptake from the seawater which contained pbdes at extremely low concentrations gassel et al 2013 in comparison the fish from the bohai sea of china which receives large volumes of pollutants discharged from the coastal industrial operations were found to contain pbdes at levels up to 36 ng g wet wt such high levels of flame retardants probably resulted from leaching of the ingested microplastics in the fish bodies and ingestion of particular organic matter with adsorbed pbdes table s12 shows that the aquatic organisms from coastal water of china had significantly elevated levels of brominated flame retardants compared to those from other coastal regions of the world and remote oceans which probably resulted primarily from pollution of the marine environment by industrial sources despite of the growing interests on the environmental distribution fate and risk of chemical additives released from microplastics no consensus can be reached on whether they cause significant harm to the environment and ecosystem kwon et al 2017 the toxic effect of pbdes in aquatic ecosystem has been relatively well studied although zhang et al 2013 reported that bde 209 showed acute toxicity on marine bloom forming microalgae heterosigma akashiwo and karenia mikimotoi with the former being more sensitive the concentrations bde 209 used in the acute toxicity test ranged from 5 to 150 mg l which are 4 to 6 orders of magnitude greater than its water solubility in fact it has been reported that the higher brominated congeners of pbdes such as bde 209 could exert little toxic effect on microalgae birnbaum and staskal 2004 european commission 2004 with a rather high molecular weight or molecular size and extremely low water solubility 0 1 μg l at 24 c bde 209 could not be efficiently uptake by organisms as a result of its negligible bioavailability bde 209 is believed to have no ecotoxicological importance hardy 2000 in contrast the lower brominated bde congeners have been well observed to have greater toxicity to phytoplankton or zooplankton in aquatic ecosystem compared to the higher brominated ones breitholtz and wollenberger 2003 mhadhbi et al 2012 lee and kim 2015 evandri et al 2003 reported a 24 h half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 0 58 mg l for exposure of freshwater zooplankton daphnia manga to bde 99 källqvist et al 2006 observed that bde 47 could inhibit the growth of marine diatom skeletonema costatum and the no observed effect concentration noec was 6 6 mg l although bde 47 was likely to be present in a colloidal form at such a high aqueous concentration zhao et al 2017 found that bde 47 at concentrations ranging from 0 074 to 0 697 mg l inhibited the population growth cellular structure photosynthetic function and antioxidant system of two microalgal species alexandrium minutum and dunaliella salina with the former being more sensitive qiu et al 2018 reported that in vivo and in vitro exposure to 5 20 μg l of bde 47 for 14 days significantly suppressed the growth of aquatic plant lemna minor and greatly reduced the contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein in the fronds which was attributed to the remarkable oxidative damage induced by bde 47 in the frond cells it is worth noting that these toxicological studies were mostly conducted with brominated flame retardants at concentrations much higher than those detected in aquatic environment ng l or lower to sub μg l and some time even above their water solubility several studies have shown that the leachates from a range of new commercial plastic products exerted significant toxic effects on aquatic invertebrates bejgarn et al 2015 li et al 2016 lithner et al 2009 2012 chemical analysis revealed complex mixture of substances in the plastic leachates while results of toxicity identification evaluation tests suggested that hydrophobic organic compounds and metals in certain cases were the main causes for the toxicity li et al 2016 lithner et al 2009 2012 it should be noted that these laboratory investigations were mostly conducted with virgin plastics of relatively large particle sizes and at rather high plastic concentrations nobre et al 2015 evaluated the toxicity of leachates from virgin and beach stranded plastic pellets on the larvae of sea urchin lytechinus variegatus and found that the leached chemicals from these pellets reduced the viability of sea urchin larvae with the newly released pellets exhibiting greater toxicity than the beach stranded ones gandara e silva et al 2016 found that the leachates from virgin plastic pellets and beach collected microplastics impaired the embryo development of brown mussel perna perna with the leachates from beached collected microplastics having greater toxicity gardon et al 2020 reported that the leachates from plastic pearl farming gear impaired the embryo larval development of pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera and the leachates from the new plastic gear had greater toxicity compared to those from the aged ones the apparently conflicting results in different studies can be explained by the fact that the contaminants released from the microplastics in the environment come from two sources the additives used in the product manufacturing and the chemicals especially the hydrophobic organic pollutants accumulated on them as a result the toxicity of the leachates from virgin plastic pellets on biota arises from the additives released from their matrices while the toxic effects of microplastics are contributed by both desorption of the various types of environmental pollutants accumulated on their surfaces and leaching of the additives present in their matrices unfortunately although the toxic effects of chemicals released from microplastics have been observed the structures of chemicals causing such effects have not been identified because of the complexity in the chemical composition of plastic leachates as well as the challenge in the assessment of joint toxic action of chemical mixtures for flame retardants that are intentionally added in plastic production diffusion in the matrices of microplastics is often the key step that controls the overall transfer from microplastics to water and air as well even though the fugacity of additive flame retardants in the plastic phase is much greater than that in water or air their concentrations in aquatic environment are low because equilibrium in their fugacity between the two phases could not be reached under environmental conditions kwon et al 2017 lee et al 2017 as discussed previously the fluxes of flame retardants released from microplastics are extremely low due to their very slow diffusion in plastic matrices despite of the large amounts of flame retardants contained in them on the other hand even without diffusion limitation the concentrations of plastic additives in the open ocean water would be extremely low based on the levels of microplastics and their contents in the plastic matrices kwon et al 2017 thus the flame retardants released from microplastics are unlikely to pose any significant risk to the marine environment and ecosystem in general nonetheless the risk should be evaluated in the zones that favor accumulation of plastic debris such as semi enclosed and shallow embayments for example significant enrichment of hbcd has been observed in the coastal sediments near oyster culture farms in a semi enclosed bay in south korea due to the releases from the debris of massively used styrofoam buoys al odaini et al 2015 the available studies on the toxic effects of leachates from microplastics have been conducted under laboratory conditions while evaluating the exposed species in such hot spots would provide conclusions that are more applicable in real world hale et al 2020 while the risk of flame retardant leaching from microplastics is not adequately understood at this time no significant environmental and ecological risk has been reported for the flame retardants released from microplastics in the general marine environment so far nonetheless the risk could well increase with the accumulation of more plastic debris and microplastics in the world s oceans and the progressive fragmentation of large number of microplastics especially in the hot spots with significant enrichment of microplastics 5 knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research there are growing concerns on the environmental and ecosystem risk brought by microplastics while the releases of flame retardants from microplastics have received little attention probably because the overall leaching fluxes are low nonetheless with rather high contents in plastic matrices and the acceleration of release rates accompanying the physical and chemical degradation of microplastics the environmental releases of flame retardants from the large volumes of microplastics in the environment can be a significant problem fig 5 schematically depicts the transport of microplastics in the environment and the releases of flame retardants during their transport the factors affecting the release kinetics of flame retardants and the potential impact of the released flame retardants on the environment and ecosystem it is worth noting that the above discussions on flame retardants are also applicable to the other types of additives present in plastics such as fillers plasticizers antioxidants and thermal stabilizers as they are all small molecular substances and their releases from microplastic matrices involve the very same processes as those of flame retardants to better understand the environmental and ecosystem risk posed by the flame retardants in microplastics and minimize the adverse impact from the continued use of flame retardants in plastics future research should focus on understanding the mechanical chemical and biological processes that could degrade microplastics and facilitate the diffusion of flame retardants in their matrices developing predictive models for the releases of different flame retardants from various types of plastic matrices and designing and developing alternative flame retardants that could pose little risk to the environment and ecosystem such research and development efforts will help close the current knowledge gaps on the transport fate and ecosystem risk of flame retardants in microplastics and lower the concerns on their environmental releases from the widely occurring plastic debris 5 1 understanding the mechanical chemical and biological processes that could cause degradation of microplastics it has been estimated that it would take 105 to 1012 years for half of the bde 209 in abs microplastics 0 15 2 0 mm in diameters to be released if the plastic matrix would remain intact sun et al 2016 nonetheless a wide range of mechanical chemical and biological processes can cause degradation of microplastics and thus accelerate the releases of flame retardants exposure to heat oxygen sunlight and liquids can cause oxidation cracking cross linking hydrolysis transesterification dissolution or swelling of the plastic matrices and such changes in physical and or chemical properties of microplastics subsequently affect the releases of flame retardants li et al 2011 heat accelerates the degradation of polymers but cross linking of the polymers during degradation induced by heat may alter the properties of plastics in an opposite way li et al 2011 oxygen can cause oxidation of the polymers rendering the plastics to degrade or cross link the degradation of plastics is characterized by softening sticking and decreases in molecular weights while their cross linking is characterized by hardening brittleness and increases in molecular weights thus the releases of flame retardants are expected to be accelerated with progressive degradation of microplastics but the opposite could also occur under special circumstances the influence of sunlight exposure on plastics is also complex light can harden the structures of plastics which inhibits the diffusion of flame retardants while it can also cause degradation of plastics which accelerates the releases of flame retardants from their matrices while photo oxidation is a key process responsible for the degradation of plastic debris and microplastics at water surface or exposed land surface liu et al 2020 the brominated flame retardants released from microplastics could also undergo photochemical transformation which mainly occurs through the pathways of debromination and ether bond cleavage ling et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 under strong sunlight irradiation degradation of the flame retardants could proceed faster than their releases from microplastics which causes their depletion on the surface of microplastics and in the surrounding environment e g surface water this could accelerate the leaching of flame retardants due to the greater concentration gradients between the microplastic matrix and plastic medium boundary layer when mass transfer across the boundary layer also poses significant resistance under combustion conditions phosphonate based flame retardants are known to induce cross linking and carbonization of polymer degradation fragments often in the presence of metal oxides as catalysts producing a carbonaceous char on the surface that reduces the releases of volatiles from the plastics ebdon et al 2000 liu et al 2016 weil and patel 2003 similarly the leaching of flame retardants from microplastic matrices would be inhibited if their photochemical transformation products could cross link on the surface although cross linking products have not been observed in the very limited number of photodegradation studies conducted while microorganisms can degrade the polymers that occur naturally they are not capable of degrading the large majority of plastics produced from petroleum based synthetic polymers hale et al 2020 nonetheless recent studies indicate that certain microorganisms have adapted to degrade synthetic polymers for example the gut bacteria of plastic eating mealworms larvae of tenebrio molitor linnaeus were found to be able to degrade and mineralize ps slowly yang et al 2015 yoshida et al 2016 isolated a novel bacterium from pet debris contaminated environmental samples at a pet bottle recycling site which enzymatically converts pet into the constituent monomers for subsequent use as major energy and carbon sources brandon et al 2018 observed that the biodegradation rates of pe and ps by mealworms were comparable and attributed the lack of specificity in the degradation of chemically dissimilar plastics to the adaptability of the mealworm gut microbiome despite of the enrichment and isolation of bacteria capable of degrading plastics biodegradation is not expected to play an important role in the overall weathering and breakdown of microplastics in the natural environment krueger et al 2015 tokiwa et al 2009 the swelling of plastic matrices by liquids could loosen the molecular chains which significantly reduces the steric hindrance for diffusion of flame retardant molecules and thus facilitates their releases for example it has been observed that swelling of the matrix of ldpe caused by n hexane greatly accelerated the diffusion of pbdes narvaez valderrama et al 2016 mechanical action can also affect the releases of flame retardants from microplastics by altering their sizes and physical structures as discussed in section 3 3 it is worth noting that the factors discussed above including heat oxidation sunlight exposure biodegradation swelling by liquids and physical abrasion do not act on microplastics alone in the environment thus it is necessary to quantify their impact on the diffusion of flame retardants within the matrices of microplastics individually as well as when working together uptake of microplastics by aquatic organisms occurs through direct ingestion and breathing through their gills and indirectly through ingestion of the organisms that contain microplastics the ingested microplastics undergo physical and chemical digestion in the bodies as a result they are further broken down into smaller particles through chewing and gastrointestinal motility which increases the surface areas for reactions with digestive enzymes kong and singh 2010 these processes significantly alter the physical and chemical integrity of microplastics and thus accelerate the releases of flame retardants from them the releases of flame retardants from microplastics ingested by aquatic organisms and seabirds as well depend not only on their retention time in the bodies but also on the in vivo environment where they reside for instance it has been shown that the releases of flame retardants increased dramatically when the microplastics were soaked in seabirds stomach oil due to the significant reduction in the steric hindrance to the diffusion of flame retardants in the plastic matrices kosuke et al 2015 thus better understanding on the releases of flame retardants from the microplastics in bodies is also needed for more accurate assessment of their risk to the organisms 5 2 modeling the release kinetics of different flame retardants from various types of plastic matrices microplastics found in the environment are typically made of various types of plastics which contain different flame retardants at varying levels relatively good understanding on the release behaviors of brominated flame retardants from the major types of plastics has been obtained from the limited research conducted so far as a wide variety of flame retardants and plastics exist there remains a significant need to quantify the environmental releases of the major additive flame retardants from various types of microplastics under different conditions with limited data on the diffusion coefficients of flame retardants in microplastic matrices and the established relationship between diffusion coefficient and various properties of the diffusants e g molecular diameter and plastic matrices e g tg models even empirical ones can greatly facilitate the prediction of the release behaviors of flame retardants from microplastics under relevant conditions such models are critically needed for quantitative assessment of the impact of flame retardants in microplastics on the environment and ecosystem the fundamental understanding on the effects of sunlight heat and other factors on the plastic matrices should also be incorporated into these modeling tools to better predict the long term releases of flame retardants from microplastics in natural environment 5 3 development of environmentally benign flame retardants besides aquatic organisms humans are also exposed to flame retardants in water air and food through the skin and the digestive and respiratory systems some of the flame retardants with high human toxicity have been banned while many of the current use ones are also known to have negative impact on the ecosystem and human health with increasingly stringent regulations on flame retardants environment friendly flame retardants should be actively developed to replace the current use ones the green chemistry principles could help guide the efforts on design and development of such new products a the harm to the ecological environment around the factory in the production and the use of flame retardants should be minimized or eliminated b the flame retardants should not cause environmental pollution during fire and c degradation of the flame retardant should not bring irreversible damages to the atmosphere soil water and organisms anastas and eghbali 2010 a potential challenge in the development and commercial adoption of alternative flame retardants is the cost as the primary criteria of the manufacturers are cost and performance shaw et al 2010 ath mdh nitrogen and silicon based flame retardants are considered environmentally benign as they could pose little risk to human health and the environment however they all suffer the major drawback of high loadings which can bring significant detrimental effects on the physical properties of polymers innes and innes 2004 significant effort has been devoted to reducing the required loadings of ath and mdh in plastic manufacturing sauerwein 2014 surface treatments can improve their physical electrical flame or chemical resistance properties and make them acceptable in many applications innes and innes 2004 reducing the overall loading is also the future development trend for nitrogen based flame retardants klatt 2014 with inferior yield and performance compared to ath and mdh the development and application of nitrogen based flame retardants need to be strengthened silicon based flame retardants are thermally stable and resistant to high temperatures but the commercial products currently available are limited and relatively expensive kilinc 2014 obviously significant investment in the research and development of these promising alternative flame retardants is necessary to improve their performance and lower their cost before they can effectively substitute the ones used currently 6 conclusions the release kinetics of flame retardants is the critical link between their occurrence in microplastics at high contents and the actual risk to the environment and ecosystem internal diffusion within the plastic matrix is often the rate limiting step for the releases of additive flame retardants from microplastics which can be well described by the fick s law and other empirical models empirical and semi empirical models are available to predict the diffusion of different flame retardants in various types of plastic matrices and the effect of ambient temperature although the low fluxes of flame retardants released from microplastics are not expected to pose significant risk to the environment and ecosystem their releases could be greatly accelerated by a range of physical chemical and biological processes efforts are needed to better understand the rates and extents of microplastics degradation in the environment and the accompanying changes in the release behaviors of flame retardants while environment friendly flame retardants should also be actively developed to ultimately minimize the risk to the environment and ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors

reaching the south china sea fig 1 cas 2012 the pre is a bell shaped semi enclosed sea on the guangdong coast of south china covering an area of about 2500 km2 fig 1 ji et al 2011 water depths in the pre range from 2 to 5 m in the western region to about 15 m in the eastern region ji et al 2011 the prd is located in guangdong province and surrounds the pre consisting of guangzhou foshan zhaoqing shenzhen dongguan huizhou zhuhai zhongshan and jiangmen fig 1 during summer tide in june 2018 intertidal surface sediment samples were collected from 21 stations fig 1 via careful removal with a plastic spade in each station five sub samples were collected and mixed thoroughly to form a representative sample then rock and plant fragments were eliminated along with any other visible debris before the samples were freeze dried ground and passed through a 150 μm sieve to ensure complete homogenization then stored at 20 c until dgt analysis of labile rees was performed 2 2 dgt experiment 2 2 1 dgt extraction procedure the dgt device was composed of a binding gel 0 40 mm thickness a diffusive gel 0 80 mm thickness and a filter membrane 0 80 mm thickness the three layers were assembled within a dual mode holder consisting of an o shape ring a recessed base and a hollow base offering structural support and accommodating the gel layers ding et al 2016 the procedure of dgt application for the analysis of homogenized sediments complied with the method proposed by yuan et al 2018 accordingly the procedure consisted of three sequential steps 1 pretreatment of samples 2 dgt deployment in samples and 3 dgt retrieval in the first step about 10 g of sediment sample was weighed placed in a 100 ml beaker and mixed with deionized water to reach 70 80 of the water holding capacity then mixed thoroughly the well stirred sediment was then covered with plastic wrap to prevent water evaporation and incubated for 48 h at a constant ambient temperature in the second step a small volume of rehydrated sediment was homogenized and added to the open cavity of the dgt device using a plastic spoon then shaken gently to ensure the sediment settled fully and was in contact with the surface of the filter membrane more rehydrated sediment was then added to ensure complete filling of the cavity the loaded dgt device was then transferred into a plastic semi opened bag and incubated for 24 h at a constant ambient temperature with 1 2 ml of deionized water added to the bag to maintain moisture during deployment in the third step after incubation the dgt core was unscrewed and removed from the base using another base unit the surface of the filter membrane was rinsed with deionized water and the binding gel was retrieved and placed in a centrifuge tube 1 8 ml of 2 m hcl was added to the tube to immerse the gel and then the tube was closed and incubated at 4 c for 16 h the eluent was then collected for the analysis of dgt labile rees the concentrations of rees were determined via icp ms agilent 7800 the process of dgt operation and detection were performed in the easysensor ltd laboratory http www easysensor net en 2 2 2 equations for dgt labile rees rees comply with fick s first

method of establishing the extraction rate has been described in detail previously by yuan et al 2018 the dgt labile concentration was then calculated using eq 2 2 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg is the

retrieved from sciencedirect https www sciencedirect com springer https www springer com wiley https onlinelibrary wiley com cnk https www cnki net and google scholar http scholar google com the acute toxicity data lc50 or ec50 for aquatic species from four different trophic level groups including algae crustacean fish and benthic species are tabulated in table 1 species sensitivity distribution ssd was established in accordance with the standard method outlined by the usepa 2001 2018 using the following steps 1 an appropriate endpoint was selected lethality growth reproduction etc 2 toxicity data were collected from the literature for as many relevant species as possible 3 the distribution of toxicity data across species was characterized with an appropriate probability density 2 4 ecotoxicological risk models 2 4 1 single ree risk assessment the risk quotient rq was applied to estimate the ecological risk for each dgt labile ree referring to the ratio of determined concentrations of rees in environment dcr in relation to the predicted no effect concentration pnec eq 3 3 r q d c r p n e c the established pnec values of rees in this study were tabulated in table 1 the rq method is a powerful approach for single pollutant ecology risk assessment and is extensively applied in water sediment and soil environments ccanccapa et al 2016 riva et al 2019 vašíčková et al 2019 an rq value equal to or less than 1 suggests a relatively small risk while an rq value higher than 1 indicates a potential ecological risk and that the environmental risk posed should not be excluded meng et al 2019 riva et al 2019 a larger value indicates a greater potential risk 2 4 2 ree mixture risk assessment prior to establishing the risk of ree mixtures the risk probability of single rees to aquatic biota was calculated based on the probabilistic risk assessment pra procedure usepa 2001 gu et al 2020 following this the fifteen single ree risk probabilities were used to calculate the combined risk of ree mixtures to aquatic biota based on the addition of probabilities steen et al 1999 as shown in eq 4 4 φ a 1 a 2 a n i 1 n φ a i i 1 i 2 φ a i 1 a i 2 1 r 1 i 1 i 2 i r φ a i 1 a i 2 a i r 1 n 1 φ a 1 a 2 a n where φ is the probability φ a i 1 a i 2 a i r is taken over all of the n r possible subsets of size r for the set 1 2 n 2 5 statistical analysis one sample t test and the kolmogorov smirnov k s test were performed using the spss v19 0 software package for windows the data were box cox transformed using the statistica v8 0 software package for windows the overlap areas between exposure data and toxicity data were calculated using the mass package in r v3 6 2 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 dgt labile concentrations of rees the descriptive statistics of ree concentrations in each sampling site are presented in table 2 and table s1 the total rees rees varied from 7 02 μg l to 16 06 μg l among all the determined individual ree in this study y was the most abundant with a mean concentration of 1 78 μg l while er and yb were both the second most abundant rees with mean concentrations of 0 93 μg l the third and fourth most abundant rees were la mean 0 86 μg l and dy mean 0 81 μg l overall these five rees accounted for about 33 94 of rees rees are generally separated into two groups designated as the cerium group light rees lree and the yttrium group heavy rees hree cheisson and schelter 2019 the ratio of lree hree reflects the geochemical processes which occurred during transportation from land to sea lan smn chondrite normalized la and sm values are indicators of lree and hree differentiation han et al 2019 accordingly the results show that the rees came from continental weathering during transport through the pearl river system fig 2 in seawater lree are preferentially assimilated or adsorbed while hree tend to remain in solution rees dissolved in oceans come from continental weathering and transport through rivers the pattern for the majority of rivers span a wide range depending on the shale concentrations with enrichment of hree in the dissolved phase alakangas et al 2020 therefore the dgt labile concentrations observed in the present study could represent the dissolved phase fig 2 3 2 ecotoxicological risk for individual rees fig 3 and table s2 show each rq for single rees in the intertidal sediments of the pre the ranked order for average rq values was as follows yb y pr ce er dy eu nd tb lu ho tm la gd sm the rq values of y pr nd eu dy er and yb exceeded 1 in terms of the one sample t test p 0 05 indicating the occurrence of ecological adverse effects in detail the rq values of pr and yb at all sites were greater than the threshold value of 1 the rq values of y and er were higher than the threshold value of 1 at 20 sites 95 23 and 14 sites 66 67 respectively indicating the ree mixture presents an ecological risk overall these results suggest that the ecotoxicological risk should not be ignored in the study area due to the rq value for some rees in most sites being higher than the threshold value of 1 fig 3 accordingly further studies are urgently required on basis of current directives 3 3 ecotoxicological risk of ree mixtures the dgt labile concentration coupled with toxicity data species sensitivity distribution ssd was used to assess the probable ecotoxicological risk combined toxicity of rees usepa 2001 gu et al 2020 the k s test was implemented to determine whether the exposure and toxic data were normally distributed the k s results show that the transformed data for exposure and toxicity exhibited normal distributions p 0 05 the mean standard deviation sd and k s test results for fifteen rees are shown in table 3 furthermore the transformed normal probability distribution curves for risk analysis were established with the means and standard deviations sds of exposure and toxic data for fifteen rees fig 4 the overlap area was calculated between the exposure single ree data distribution and the corresponding toxicity single ree data distribution fig 3 results indicate that y la and the remaining thirteen rees had a 2 55 1 20 and less than 8 7e 04 probability of toxic effects respectively based on the addition of probabilities steen et al 1999 the toxic effect probabilities of rees were used to estimate the combined risk of ree mixtures results show that the intertidal sediments of the pre present a 3 72 probability of having a combined toxic effect on aquatic organisms rq is intended to be conservative in nature making assumptions related to exposure and effects that are intended to represent the upper bounds of the range of toxicity data pellizzato 2014 table 1 as conservative assumptions apply to both exposure and toxicity endpoints in the hq assessment the hq method is inherently protective in nature although it does not provide deterministic quantitation of the overall level of risk fig 3 and table s2 however the pra method based on ssd can overcome this shortcoming and provide a quantitative probabilistic risk to aquatic biota pellizzato 2014 fig 4 as a tool to establish the toxicity of ree mixtures the addition of probabilities coupled with the pra method was effectively used in this study to quantify the probable risk to aquatic biota this novel approach is of great significance to the protection and management of the ecological environment 4 conclusion establishing the combined toxicity of rees to aquatic biota is challenging in natural aquatic ecosystem particularly in sediments sediments are a major ree reservoir and source while dgt is a valuable tool to measure the bioaccessibility of inorganic substances in this study the bioaccessible dgt labile concentrations of rees were established using the dgt technique the pra method considering ree toxicity to four different trophic level aquatic groups was established based on the ssd method and dgt labile concentrations then this novel method based on the addition of probabilities coupled with the pra method was developed to assess the toxicity of ree mixtures in sediments as the areas surrounding the upper reaches of the pearl river are a major ree reservoir and production region the intertidal zone of the pre was chosen as a case study the pra results show that y and la present a 2 55 and a 1 20 biological risk to aquatic biota ranking as the first and second most significant level of risk the results of this novel method reveal that intertidal surface sediments of the pre present a 3 72 probability of inducing a toxic effect on aquatic organisms consequently the ecotoxicological risk of ree mixtures in sediments using this novel method in combination with the dgt technique is effective and should be considered a powerful tool for the monitoring and protection of aquatic ecosystem declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we gratefully

in samples and 3 dgt retrieval in the first step about 10 g of sediment sample was weighed placed in a 100 ml beaker and mixed with deionized water to reach 70 80 of the water holding capacity then mixed thoroughly the well stirred sediment was then covered with plastic wrap to prevent water evaporation and incubated for 48 h at a constant ambient temperature in the second step a small volume of rehydrated sediment was homogenized and added to the open cavity of the dgt device using a plastic spoon then shaken gently to ensure the sediment settled fully and was in contact with the surface of the filter membrane more rehydrated sediment was then added to ensure complete filling of the cavity the loaded dgt device was then transferred into a plastic semi opened bag and incubated for 24 h at a constant ambient temperature with 1 2 ml of deionized water added to the bag to maintain moisture during deployment in the third step after incubation the dgt core was unscrewed and removed from the base using another base unit the surface of the filter membrane was rinsed with deionized water and the binding gel was retrieved and placed in a centrifuge tube 1 8 ml of 2 m hcl was added to the tube to immerse the gel and then the tube was closed and incubated at 4 c for 16 h the eluent was then collected for the analysis of dgt labile rees the concentrations of rees were determined via icp ms agilent 7800 the process of dgt operation and detection were performed in the easysensor ltd laboratory http www easysensor net en 2 2 2 equations for dgt labile rees rees comply with fick s first law of diffusion in the diffusive gel layer the concentrations of rees in the dgt extract liquor were converted into a ree mass m via eq 1 1 m c e v e v g f e where ce is the concentration of rees in the extract liquor ve is the extract liquor volume ml vg is the gel volume ml which in the present study was and vg is 0 2 ml fe is the extraction rate which in the present study was 0 894 for y 0 865 for la 0 872 for ce 0 887 for pr 0 902 for nd 0 916 for sm 0 90 for eu 0 891 for gd 0 938 for tb 0 896 for dy 0 913 for ho 0 916 for er 0 911 for tm 0 918 for yb and 0 924 for lu yuan et al 2018 the method of establishing the extraction rate has been described in detail previously by yuan et al 2018 the dgt labile concentration was then calculated using eq 2 2 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg is the diffusive layer thickness which was 0 9 mm in the present study d is the ree diffusion coefficient with d values for all investigated rees based on the easysensor ltd user manual a is the dgt device exposed surface area which was 3 14 cm2 in the present study t is the deployment time which was 48 h in the present study 2 3 toxicity data collection the aquatic acute toxicity data for rees were retrieved from sciencedirect https www sciencedirect com springer https www springer com wiley https onlinelibrary wiley com cnk https www cnki net and google scholar http scholar google com the acute toxicity data lc50 or ec50 for aquatic species from four different trophic level groups including algae crustacean fish and benthic species are tabulated in table 1 species sensitivity distribution ssd was established in accordance with the standard method outlined by the usepa 2001 2018 using the following steps 1 an appropriate endpoint was selected lethality growth reproduction etc 2 toxicity data were collected from the literature for as many relevant species as possible 3 the distribution of toxicity data across species was characterized with an appropriate probability density 2 4 ecotoxicological risk models 2 4 1 single ree risk assessment the risk quotient rq was applied to estimate the ecological risk for each dgt labile ree referring to the ratio of determined concentrations of rees in environment dcr in relation to the predicted no effect concentration pnec eq 3 3 r q d c r p n e c the established pnec values of rees in this study were tabulated in table 1 the rq method is a powerful approach for single pollutant ecology risk assessment and is extensively applied in water sediment and soil environments ccanccapa et al 2016 riva et al 2019 vašíčková et al 2019 an rq value equal to or less than 1 suggests a relatively small risk while an rq value higher than 1 indicates a potential ecological risk and that the environmental risk posed should not be excluded meng et al 2019 riva et al 2019 a larger value indicates a greater potential risk 2 4 2 ree mixture risk assessment prior to establishing the risk of ree mixtures the risk probability of single rees to aquatic biota was calculated based on the probabilistic risk assessment pra procedure usepa 2001 gu et al 2020 following this the fifteen single ree risk probabilities were used to calculate the combined risk of ree mixtures to aquatic biota based on the addition of probabilities steen et al 1999 as shown in eq 4 4 φ a 1 a 2 a n i 1 n φ a i i 1 i 2 φ a i 1 a i 2 1 r 1 i 1 i 2 i r φ a i 1 a i 2 a i r 1 n 1 φ a 1 a 2 a n where φ is the probability φ a i 1 a i 2 a i r is taken over all of the n r possible subsets of size r for the set 1 2 n 2 5 statistical analysis one sample t test and the kolmogorov smirnov k s test were performed using the spss v19 0 software package for windows the data were box cox transformed using the statistica v8 0 software package for windows the overlap areas between exposure data and toxicity data were calculated using the mass package in r v3 6 2 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 dgt labile concentrations of rees the descriptive statistics of ree concentrations in each sampling site are presented in table 2 and table s1 the total rees rees varied from 7 02 μg l to 16 06 μg l among all the determined individual ree in this study y was the most abundant with a mean concentration of 1 78 μg l while er and yb were both the second most abundant rees with mean concentrations of 0 93 μg l the third and fourth most abundant rees were la mean 0 86 μg l and dy mean 0 81 μg l overall these five rees accounted for about 33 94 of rees rees are generally separated into two groups designated as the cerium group light rees lree and the yttrium group heavy rees hree cheisson and schelter 2019 the ratio of lree hree reflects the geochemical processes which occurred during transportation from land to sea lan smn chondrite normalized la and sm values are indicators of lree and hree differentiation han et al 2019 accordingly the results show that the rees came from continental weathering during transport through the pearl river system fig 2 in seawater lree are preferentially assimilated or adsorbed while hree tend to remain in solution rees dissolved in oceans come from continental weathering and transport through rivers the pattern for the majority of rivers span a wide range depending on the shale concentrations with enrichment of hree in the dissolved phase alakangas et al 2020 therefore the dgt labile concentrations observed in the present study could represent the dissolved phase fig 2 3 2 ecotoxicological risk for individual rees fig 3 and table s2 show each rq for single rees in the intertidal sediments of the pre the ranked order for average rq values was as follows yb y pr ce er dy eu nd tb lu ho tm la gd sm the rq values of y pr nd eu dy er and yb exceeded 1 in terms of the one sample t test p 0 05 indicating the occurrence of ecological adverse effects in detail the rq values of pr and yb at all sites were greater than the threshold value of 1 the rq values of y and er were higher than the threshold value of 1 at 20 sites 95 23 and 14 sites 66 67 respectively indicating the ree mixture presents an ecological risk overall these results suggest that the ecotoxicological risk should not be ignored in the study area due to the rq value for some rees in most sites being higher than the threshold value of 1 fig 3 accordingly further studies are urgently required on basis of current directives 3 3 ecotoxicological risk of ree mixtures the dgt labile concentration coupled with toxicity data species sensitivity distribution ssd was used to assess the probable ecotoxicological risk combined toxicity of rees usepa 2001 gu et al 2020 the k s test was implemented to determine whether the exposure and toxic data were normally distributed the k s results show that the transformed data for exposure and toxicity exhibited normal distributions p 0 05 the mean standard deviation sd and k s test results for fifteen rees are shown in table 3 furthermore the transformed normal probability distribution curves for risk analysis were established with the means and standard deviations sds of exposure and toxic data for fifteen rees fig 4 the overlap area was calculated between the exposure single ree data distribution and the corresponding toxicity single ree data distribution fig 3 results indicate that y la and the remaining thirteen rees had a 2 55 1 20 and less than 8 7e 04 probability of toxic effects respectively based on the addition of probabilities steen et al 1999 the toxic effect probabilities of rees were used to estimate the combined risk of ree mixtures results show that the intertidal sediments of the pre present a 3 72 probability of having a combined toxic effect on aquatic organisms rq is intended to be conservative in nature making assumptions related to exposure and effects that are intended to represent the upper bounds of the range of toxicity data pellizzato 2014 table 1 as conservative assumptions apply to both exposure and toxicity endpoints in the hq assessment the hq method is inherently protective in nature although it does not provide deterministic quantitation of the overall level of risk fig 3 and table s2 however the pra method based on ssd can overcome this shortcoming and provide a quantitative probabilistic risk to aquatic biota pellizzato 2014 fig 4 as a tool to establish the toxicity of ree mixtures the addition of probabilities coupled with the pra method was effectively used in this study to quantify the probable risk to aquatic biota this novel approach is of great significance to the protection and management of the ecological environment 4 conclusion establishing the combined toxicity of rees to aquatic biota is challenging in natural aquatic ecosystem particularly in sediments sediments are a major ree reservoir and source while dgt is a valuable tool to measure the bioaccessibility of inorganic substances in this study the bioaccessible dgt labile concentrations of rees were established using the dgt technique the pra method considering ree toxicity to four different trophic level aquatic groups was established based on the ssd method and dgt labile concentrations then this novel method based on the addition of probabilities coupled with the pra method was developed to assess the toxicity of ree mixtures in sediments as the areas surrounding the upper reaches of the pearl river are a major ree reservoir and production region the intertidal zone of the pre was chosen as a case study the pra results show that y and la present a 2 55 and a 1 20 biological risk to aquatic biota ranking as the first and second most significant level of risk the results of this novel method reveal that intertidal surface sediments of the pre present a 3 72 probability of inducing a toxic effect on aquatic organisms consequently the ecotoxicological risk of ree mixtures in sediments using this novel method in combination with the dgt technique is effective and should be considered a powerful tool for the monitoring and protection of aquatic ecosystem declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we gratefully
