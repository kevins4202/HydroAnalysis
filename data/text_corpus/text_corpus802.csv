4010,co2 geological storage is a key technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions but merely injecting co2 into sedimentary strata has high costs and no direct economic benefit a more cost effective and environment friendly way is storing and utilizing co2 in deep sedimentary reservoirs for heat extraction however the effects of ubiquitous impurities on the sequestration safety and heat extraction performance of co2 in high temperature reservoirs are unclear in this study we have performed numerical simulations of multiphase flow solute transport and heat conduction at reservoir temperature 50 250 c to reveal the effects of two common impurities i e h2s and n2 on the migration dissolution and thermal absorption of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs it is found that for higher reservoir temperature the impurity n2 leads to smaller promotion on the migration of gas phase but retains the acceleration effect on the cooling in reservoir above 150 c the deviations on the gas phase migration velocity and the co2 dissolution efficiency caused by 10 mol n2 are less than 12 meanwhile the 10 mol n2 can increase the total heat absorbed from reservoir by about 40 at least it means that n2 has the potential to benefit a co2 plume geothermal system significantly without distinct risks besides it is also found that the co2 dissolution efficiency can be increased and decreased by h2s and n2 through partitioning phenomenon respectively keywords co2 geological storage impurity co2 migration co2 dissolution sedimentary geothermal reservoirs numerical modeling

intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 world meteorological organization 2020a 2020b among the anthropogenic greenhouse gases co2 is responsible for nearly 78 of the increase in the total greenhouse gas emissions from 1970 and contributes approximately 82 of the increase in global radiative forcing over the past decade world meteorological organization 2020a intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 in this context co2 geological storage cgs is widely approved as one of the most promising options for reducing co2 emissions international energy agency 2008 xu et al 2020 however merely storing co2 in geological body does not generate direct economic benefit and has to bear high costs a more cost effective way is utilizing the deposited co2 for energy exploitation which can be mainly divided into two categories 1 oil and gas recovery enhancement and 2 geothermal energy extraction by comparison geothermal energy is renewable and sustainable which is more conducive to co2 emission reduction atrens et al 2009 2010 xu et al 2018 moreover by virtue of innovative equipment and system layouts arslan 2011 baik et al 2012 low temperature geothermal resources can also be converted into electronic power therefore potential subsurface space that suitable for co2 sequestration and heat extraction is substantially enlarged randolph and saar 2011 chen et al 2020 according to different geothermal reservoir medium co2 based geothermal systems can be mainly divided into two patterns 1 enhanced geothermal systems egs brown 2000 pruess 2006 and 2 co2 plume geothermal cpg systems randolph and saar 2011 although co2 egs shows more efficient for electricity generation due to the high temperature hot dry rock the artificial high permeable reservoir might also result in limited storage capacity and potential leakage risk of co2 esteves et al 2019 on the other hand the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs considered in co2 plume geothermal cpg systems are ubiquitously worldwide with high co2 storage capacity and abundant geothermal reserves adams et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 however due to the variety of reservoir conditions and the uncertainty in sealing effectiveness the two common concerns still remain 1 the heat extraction performance of co2 and 2 the leakage risk of co2 the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs are usually at depths 1 5 km naturally porous and permeable overlain by low permeability caprock brine saturated and with temperature 50 250 c randolph and saar 2011 allis et al 2012 the injected co2 in these reservoirs will mainly exist in three states free phase co2 dissolved co2 and mineralized co2 huppert and neufeld 2014 zhang et al 2017 li and yu 2020 the free phase co2 is the actual working fluid in geothermal reservoirs which can provide effective heat advection by similar thermal properties to water and a significantly low viscosity garapati et al 2015 pruess 2008 zhang et al 2014 the dissolved co2 is the premise of geochemical reactions to mineralize co2 for geological timescale and generally moves with brine at a velocity less than 0 1 cm year which plays a critical role for the security of sequestrating large amounts of co2 in brine saturated reservoirs bachu et al 1994 that is to say the heat extraction performance and leakage risk of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs are highly related to the migration and dissolution of free phase co2 generally hydrogeological conditions in specific project sites are the major factors that affects the migration and dissolution of co2 birkholzer et al 2008 wigand et al 2008 yu et al 2017 the simulation study of adams et al 2015 has demonstrated that in cpg systems higher reservoir permeability and temperature makes free phase co2 migrate faster and hence leads to more effective electronic power production meanwhile due to the larger migration distance and greater solubility of free phase co2 by the higher reservoir permeability and temperature the dissolution efficiency of co2 defined as the ratio of dissolved co2 amount to total injected co2 amount can also be promoted li et al 2017 duan and sun 2003 mao et al 2013 besides the density driven convection mixing which plays a dominant role during co2 dissolution in brine islam et al 2013 slim 2014 also has been shown related to reservoir permeability temperature capillary entry pressure and so forth emami meybodi and hassanzadeh 2015 singh et al 2019 2020 however it should be noted that since the purification of captured co2 can significantly raise the total cost de visser et al 2008 impurities are co injected with co2 in most practical operations which can also influence the migration and dissolution of co2 by affecting the fluid properties of injected co2 streams fig 1 li and yan 2009 talman 2015 li et al 2019 in other words the impurities might impact the heat extraction performance and leakage risk of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs either but to our best knowledge there has no published study investigating the impurity effects on co2 storage and utilization in cpg systems apart from some impurities e g n2 and ar allowed for reducing the costs some hazardous gases like h2s and so2 even have been co injected with co2 deliberately because their emission into atmosphere would cause the formation of acid rain and damage to human health bachu and gunter 2005 bachu et al 2005 the light impurity species such as n2 by decreasing the density and viscosity of injected co2 streams would increase the buoyancy force of free phase co2 and accelerate its migration wang et al 2011 ieaghg 2011 yu et al 2021 this would also promote the co2 dissolution efficiency lei et al 2016 li et al 2017 but most impurities have been found unfavorable for the convection mixing process li et al 2015 mahmoodpour et al 2017 mahmoodpour et al 2018 by decreasing the density difference between the pure brine and brine with dissolved co2 ennis king and paterson 2005 ji and zhu 2013 these researches have provided references for understanding the impurity effects on co2 geological storage in brine saturated reservoirs at low reservoir temperature conditions below 75 c however different from the conventional co2 geological storage in widely distributed deep saline aquifers the temperature of brine saturated geothermal reservoirs can be up to 250 c which would be significantly higher than the temperature of injected co2 streams thus high reservoir temperature and non isothermal conditions are necessary to be considered when investigate the impurity effects on the migration and dissolution of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of two common impurities i e n2 and h2s on the dissolution efficiency of co2 and the heat extraction performance of injected fluid with reservoir temperature varying from 50 to 250 c we have aimed to capture the difference caused by the impurities in three main aspects 1 the migration process of supercritical plume 2 the evolution of temperature field in non isothermal cases 3 the spreading of dissolved co2 to this end we have simulated two phase fluid flow in a deep brine saturated geothermal reservoir with large extension distance under impermeable caprock and convective diffusive flow with relatively high resolution at near well zone the impurity effects of n2 and h2s are compared for different reservoir temperature and injection temperature 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model the flow and transport of fluids and heat in porous media can be modeled by solving the following mass and energy balance equations 1 d dt v β ϕ s β ρ β x β κ d v γ β ρ β x β κ u β n d γ γ β ϕ s β ρ β d β κ x β κ n d γ v q κ d v 2 d dt v 1 ϕ ρ r c r t

vinsome and westerveld 1980 the conservation equations are discretized in space with the integral finite difference method while time is discretized using the first order finite difference method fully implicitly then the coupled discrete equations can be linearized and solved by newton raphson iteration method the maximum scaled residual allowed for any single governing conservation equation at convergence dimensionless is set as 5 0 10 5 in this study the fluid systems altogether involve four components co2 h2s n2 and h2o and two phases gas and aqueous based on the thermodynamic equilibrium the mutual solubilities of the components are calculated from the fugacity fugacity model f g κ f aq κ we can have the fugacity of components in gas phase f g κ by using the peng robinson equation of state pr eos peng and robinson 1976 while the fugacity of co2 h2s and n2 in aqueous phase is calculated using henry s law considering the large temperature difference when injecting cool co2 streams into geothermal reservoirs the henry s constants are obtained from the following semiempirical correlation harvey 1996 5 ln h i ln p h 2 o s a 1 t t c h 2 o b 1 1 t t c h 2 o 0 355 t c h 2 o t c 1 exp 1 t t c h 2 o t t c h 2 o 0 41 1 rt p h 2 o s p v i d p where the saturation pressure of h2o p h 2 o s and the partial molar volume of gaseous component i v i in the aqueous phase are calculated from corresponding empirical functions saul and wagner 1987 garcia 2001 heidemann and prausnitz 1977 perez and heidemann 2006 for the fluid properties of the gas and aqueous phases the calculation of density and viscosity involves pr eos and other correlations reid et al 1977 kestin et al 1981 rowe and chou 1970 these correlations that taken into consideration both the effects of pressure and temperature are necessary in our non isothermal simulations moreover the calculation of fluid enthalpy is also required for the non isothermal conditions the enthalpy of aqueous phase can be obtained from a steam table while the gas enthalpy is calculated as followed 6 h h re h ig where h ig denotes the enthalpy of ideal gas at zero pressure and temperature and the residual enthalpy h re is calculated from the pr eos 2 2 physical model the geometry of the modeled reservoir is shown in fig 2 a with a depth of 3 km and a height of 150 m we idealized this system as a symmetric two dimensional domain and performed simulations in the right half the top and bottom boundaries are respectively set as impermeable caprock and bedrock the right boundary is set 10 km away from the injection well which is determined by the preliminary simulation results in order not to affect the spreading of the injected fluids also the right boundary is set dirichlet condition by assigning large volumes i e 1050 m3 so that the hydrostatic pressure and the initial reservoir temperature are unchanged the injection well is shown as a red point 30 m below the caprock fig 2a three injected fluids including impure co2 with 10 mol h2s impure co2 with 10 mol n2 and pure co2 are injected at the same constant rate of q 0 002 kg s to minimize the effect of injection pressure on the spreading of supercritical and dissolved co2 the injection temperature of the fluids is maintained constant throughout the entire injection period in order to capture the differences in the migration and dissolution processes between the pure and impure co2 we performed high resolution modeling of fluid flow near well the dimension of the grids is shown in fig 2a in the z direction the model is divided into 75 layers and each layer is 2 m high in the x direction the gridding starts with 2 m increments for the first 500 m and then becomes coarser with increasing distance the thickness of the grids is 2 m which is the smallest gridding increment in the x direction and also same as the height of each layer in the z direction to focus on the impurity effects on the flow dissolution and thermal absorption of co2 we have made some assumptions including the homogenization of porosity and the simplification of permeability details besides considering the small injection rate 0 002 kg s in this study we have activated the modeling of molecular diffusion in the simulations since li and jiang 2020 demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients of impurities n2 and h2s 10 mol would not have distinct effects on the occurrence and development of density driven convection we assumed the same diffusion coefficients for the three injected fluids the model parameters used in this study includes ϕ 0 15 k 10 13 m2 ρ r 2560 kg m3 c r 1010 j kg oc λ r 1 w m oc d β κ 10 9 m2 s s rw 0 2 s rg 0 2 which are within common range of co2 geological storage projects the correlations of relative permeability are taken from corey 1954 the simulations are performed using the compositional and unconventional reservoir simulator cmg gem cmg 2012 2 3 analysis method to quantify the migration velocity of gas phase we define the gas phase plume tip as the intersection point of the gas saturation contour of 0 5 and the top boundary fig 2b it means that the time the gas phase plume tip reaches a grid at x m in the horizontal direction below the caprock t x is the time the gas saturation of this grid reaches 0 5 the horizontal location of the gas plume tip in the coordinate system shown in fig 2b is denoted as x tip then the average migration velocity of gas phase can be calculated as v g x tip t x the heat extraction performance of the injected fluids in the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs corresponds to the temperature dropping speed in reservoir since the principle of cpg systems is using co2 as working fluid for heat extraction from host rock the heat absorbed from reservoir after time t can be calculated as 7 q 1 ϕ ρ r c r 1 n v n t n t t n 0 the co2 dissolution efficiency in high temperature reservoirs is the third focus point in this study we define the ratio of dissolved co2 amount to total injected co2 amount as co2 dissolution efficiency de since solute fingering is an important mechanism of co2 dissolution trapping we estimate the onset and growth of solute fingers for each case in this study the onset time of solute fingering is estimated from the procedures shown in fig 2c the grid dimension is 2 m in both the x and z directions at the near well zone in our work thus we specify that the solute fingering onsets when the fluctuation of the contour with a dissolved co2 concentration of 0 02 is no less than 4 m and the fluctuation amplitude of the contour is defined as the length of solute fingering taking the pure co2 system as reference the impurity effects on the v g q and de are quantified as relative deviations between the simulation results of impure and pure co2 systems 3 results and discussion the simulation results of 18 cases for the three injected fluids under different reservoir temperature tr and injection temperature ti conditions are presented and discussed in this section for tr we have chosen 50 150 and 250 c respectively to represent the low moderate and high reservoir temperature it is noteworthy that at the high reservoir temperature 250 c the density of brine with dissolved co2 is lower than that of pure brine which is just the opposite of the cases with the low and moderate reservoir temperature singh et al 2020 hnedkovsky et al 1996 for each case two injection temperatures ti tr and ti 25 c are considered when ti 25 c the injected liquid co2 will be warmed up quickly and turns to supercritical therefore in this study both the liquid and supercritical co2 are regarded as a single non wetting phase and sometimes written as gaseous co2 the simulations in this study contain two stages the first 100 years is the injection period and the last 100 years is the storage period in table 1 the fluid properties at corresponding conditions and some simulation results are presented to assist the analysis 3 1 validation of the fluid thermophysical properties since fluid thermophysical property is crucial for the reliability of simulations we compared the calculated fluid properties to the values taken from nist lemmon et al 2019 and the available experimental data listed in tables 2 and 3 the relative deviation and average absolute deviation between the calculated results and the reference data are defined as 8 rd m cal m ref m ref 100 a a d a b s r d n 100 where n is the number of data points using the pr eos correlations and steam table mentioned in section 2 1 we obtained the densities viscosities and enthalpies of pure co2 h2s n2 and h2o at 30 mpa and 25 250 c with a temperature step of 1 c these calculated results are compared to the values from nist in fig 3 a for the pure component densities the relative deviations are less than 10 which suggest the calculated results are reasonable for the pure component viscosities 95 of the relative deviations for co2 n2 and h2o are less than 10 while those for h2s reach about 25 the calculation of h2s viscosity can be further improved but 75 of the relative deviations for h2s are less than 10 and the average absolute relative difference is 7 thus the viscosity models used in this study can be considered reliable preliminarily meanwhile the relative deviations of the enthalpies for pure co2 h2s and n2 are less than 10 while the average absolute relative deviation of the water enthalpy is 15 45 but the accuracy of the water enthalpy is still regarded enough since the focus of this study is the effect of the impurities in co2 streams on the migration dissolution and heat extraction performance of the injected fluids due to the lack of experimental viscosity data of co2 h2s or co2 n2 mixtures only the calculated densities of co2 h2s and co2 n2 mixtures were compared to experimental data table 2 in fig 3b although the relative deviations can reach about 20 in the vicinity of co2 critical pressure and temperature almost 95 of the relative deviations are less than 10 moreover the average absolute relative deviations are less than 4 05 it indicates that the calculation of co2 mixture densities in this study is reliable meanwhile the predicted gas solubilities are also compared to available experimental data listed in table 3 fig 3c shows that the relative deviations of gas solubilities range from 50 to 75 however for the solubilities of co2 and n2 in water large gaps only exist between calculated results and a few experimental data sources it shows that 95 of the relative deviations are less than 20 and 75 of the relative deviations are less than 10 moreover the average absolute deviations for the co2 h2o n2 h2o and co2 n2 h2o systems are 4 85 7 87 and 4 08 respectively for the system of h2s h2o limited experimental solubility data are found especially for the conditions of high pressure and high temperature based on a few of data sources the average absolute relative deviation is up to 14 7 since the calculation precision of models generally depends on the availability of experimental data the capability of the model calculating h2s solubility in water can be further optimized with more experimental data 3 2 impurity effects on the distribution and migration of gas phase the distribution of gas saturation in fig 4 a is taken when the gas phase plume tip reaches x 50 m below the caprock for isothermal cases it can be seen that the impurity effect of 10 mol n2 on the gas phase distribution is negligible when tr equals 150 and 250 c while trivial effects of 10 mol h2s are shown under three reservoir temperature conditions in this study we quantified the gas phase distribution by non dimensionalizing the arrival time of gas phase reaching x 2000 m below the caprock t 2000 as t 2000 1 d e q l 2000 δ h ctz ρ f ϕ 1 s rw singh et al 2020 the numerator is the total mass of gaseous co2 in the reservoir at time t 2000 while the denominator is the mass of gaseous co2 in an assumed triangular capillary transition zone sg greater than 0 5 as can be seen in fig 4d the dimensionless values of t 2000 for different injected fluids make clusters when tr 150 c and tr 250 c and they are close to unity which means the capillary transition zones of these cases are all approximately triangular for tr 50 c the dimensionless t 2000 of the cases injecting pure co2 and impure co2 containing h2s are greater than 1 2 which results from the horizontal spread of gas phase near the injection well out of the triangular zone the buoyancy due to the density difference between injected fluid and ambient brine is the driven force controlling the spread of gas phase when the buoyancy is greater enough the gas phase of the injected fluids nearly does not spread horizontally during the upward migration but rises directly to accumulate below the caprock since the decrease in density of injected fluid caused by impurities gets smaller with higher reservoir temperature table 1 the impurity effects on the gas phase distribution also become weaker the impurities affect the gas phase distribution by affecting the density of injected fluid fig 1a b the impurity effects on the density of injected fluid determines not only the impurity effects on the distribution of gas phase but also the impurity effects on the migration velocity of gas phase fig 4b shows the location variation of the gas phase plume tips with time fig 4c is the average moving velocities of the tips during injection period and storage period for tr 50 c it is clear that the impurity n2 accelerates the migration of gas phase most significantly then the increase in average velocities caused by n2 decreases with increasing reservoir temperature by comparison the effects of the impurity h2s on the gas phase plume is almost negligible but for tr 150 c and tr 250 c instead of accelerating the lateral migration of gas phase like that in the cases of tr 50 c the impurity h2s shrinks the gas phase plume slightly considering the solubilities of co2 and h2s are both greatly promoted in the cases of moderate and high reservoir temperature we speculate that it is the increased dissolved mass of injected fluid that decreases the amount of gas phase and hence results in the shrinkage of the gas phase plume 3 3 impurity effects on the heat absorption from reservoir in section 3 2 the injection temperature shows negligible effects on the distribution of gas phase plume it has been explained by the much smaller thermal disturbed area than the migration range of the gas phase plume zhao and cheng 2015 as shown in fig 5 a the thermal disturbed areas in all cases are within 150 m from the injection well at 100 years while the gas phase plume tip has already reached about 2 6 km the injected fluids are lighter than brine and mainly rises in the form of gas phase hence the prominent temperature drop is shown above the injection area singh et al 2020 besides the thermal disturbance spreading along with the injected fluid is also affected by the specific heat capacity of the injected fluid since the difference in the specific heat capacity of the three injected fluids is negligible fig 1 the impurity effects on the temperature field are mainly controlled by the impurity effects on the migration of injected fluid it can be seen that the cooling both below and above the injection area is significantly accelerated by the impurity n2 while the impurity h2s shows negligible effects figure 5b and c compare the heat absorbed from reservoir by the three injected fluids after 50 and 100 years the 10 mol n2 not only increases the total absorbed heat by about 40 80 and 120 for reservoir temperature 50 150 and 250 c respectively but also improves the heat extraction below the injection area in contrast the 10 mol h2s decreases the both the cooling below the injection area is caused by the convection mixing of brine the density driven convection mixing during co2 dissolution is discussed in the next section 3 4 impurity effects on the dissolution trapping of co2 the convection mixing due to the gravity instability near the co2 diffusion boundary results in a much higher dissolution rate of co2 and hence is regarded as an important mechanism of co2 dissolution trapping in brine saturated reservoirs xu et al 2006 here we mainly focus on the effects of the impurities h2s and n2 on the solute fingering and the co2 dissolution efficiency de for different temperature conditions when the injection area is located in the middle of aquifers it has been demonstrated that the convection mixing of brine near injection well can be significantly affected by the injection temperature singh et al 2020 thus the simulation results of isothermal and non isothermal conditions ti tr and ti 25 c are presented separately in the following subsections 3 4 1 isothermal conditions figure 6 a illustrates the evolution of dissolved co2 in the near well zone within 50 m from the injection well for isothermal cases when tr 50 c and tr 150 c not only the solute fingers convection trunks stretched out from the injection area also can be seen moving downward the impurities slow down the falling of convection trunks delay the onset of solute fingers and also narrow the fingers fig 6a and b the reason is that the density difference between the brine with dissolved co2 and pure brine the driven force of convection mixing is decreased by the impurities meanwhile the impurity h2s and n2 slightly decreases and increases the growth rate of fingers respectively overall the impurities have adverse effects on the convection mixing at the low and moderate reservoir temperature according to the negligible effect of h2s and the promotion effect of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency de at tr 50 c it can be concluded that the impurity effect on de is mainly controlled by the impurity effect on the migration of gas phase for the low reservoir temperature because larger migration extent of gaseous co2 increasing the gas aqueous contact area implies higher co2 dissolution efficiency when the increment in the migration velocity of gas phase caused by n2 decrease from 40 at tr 50 c to 10 at tr 150 c the effect of n2 on co2 dissolution efficiency also becomes trivial or even negative when tr ti 250 c the dissolved co2 only migrates laterally below the caprock and no convection trunks or solute fingers develop fig 6a the dissolution of the injected fluids decreases the brine density which prevents the density driven convection mixing fig 6c shows that the impurity h2s and n2 increases and decreases the co2 dissolution efficiency respectively at this time the impurity effect on de can not be related to the impurity effects on the gas phase migration because the migration velocity of gas phase is decreased 2 by h2s and increased 8 by n2 we speculate that it is the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and the impurities that controls the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency at the high reservoir temperature which will be discussed in detail below 3 4 2 non isothermal conditions the injection temperature for heat extraction purpose in this study is set to 25 c lower than reservoir temperature for this reason the density variation of brine is affected not only by the dissolution of injected fluids but also by the temperature difference the brine near injection well with low temperature can be much heavier than the brine with reservoir temperature table 1 the large temperature difference leading to great density difference of brine finally results in the occur of convection rolls at tr 150 c and tr 250 c but the impurity effect on the convection mixing in the non isothermal cases assembles those in isothermal cases the smaller density difference of brine caused by impurities leads to weaker convection mixing fig 7 a and b in section 3 1 and 3 2 the injection temperature has been proved of negligible effects on the distribution and migration of gas phase thus the impurity effect on the co2 dissolution efficiency in the non isothermal cases also assembles those in isothermal cases figs 6c and 7c but it is noteworthy that the lower injection temperature amplifies the impurity effect on the co2 dissolution efficiency when tr 250 c 3 5 possible mechanism of the impurity effects on d e for tr 250 c according to the discussion above the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency can be classified to 1 the positive effect due to the promotion on the migration velocity of gas phase and 2 the negative effect due to the inhibition on the convection mixing of brine however the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency at ti tr 250 c indicates that something might be ignored fig 8 a when the negative correlation of the impurity effect on gas phase migration and co2 dissolution efficiency occurs and no convection mixing happens the reason for the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency is directed to the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and impurities partitioning phenomenon is due to the solubility difference between co2 and the impurities the higher and lower solubility of h2s and n2 than that of co2 respectively results in more and less gaseous co2 accumulating at the leading edge of gas phase fig 9 the gas saturation contour of 0 8 can be regarded as a border line between the gas saturated zone and the gas phase leading edge since the residual water saturation set in this study is 0 2 the co2 dissolution efficiency in the gas saturated zone is almost uniform at the same ambient temperature while it is increased and decreased at the gas phase leading edge respectively by the impurity h2s and n2 fig 8b moreover the temperature drop in the non isothermal cases lowers the co2 solubility significantly at the near well zone especially for the injected fluid containing n2 thus the greater negative effect of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency is shown in non isothermal cases 4 conclusions in this work we have simulated the migration dissolution and thermal absorption of pure and impure co2 in the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs and investigate the feasibility of the co injection of co2 with two common impurities h2s and n2 for the geological sequestration and utilization in geothermal energy systems the major conclusions are as follows 1 the effects of the impurities h2s and n2 on the distribution and migration of the gas phase are determined by the impurity effects on the density of injected fluid while the 10 mol h2s shows negligible effects the same amount of n2 increases the migration velocity of gas phase by 25 at least at the low reservoir temperature the high reservoir temperature can decrease this value to 4 which significantly reduces the leakage risk of gaseous co2 brought by n2 2 the influence mechanisms of the impurities on co2 dissolution efficiency in this study can be classified to 1 the positive effect due to the promotion on the migration velocity of gas phase 2 the negative effect due to the inhibition on the convection mixing of brine and 3 the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and impurities with higher reservoir temperature the negative effect of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency is limited within about 10 3 when injecting cool co2 streams into warm reservoirs the impurity effects on the temperature field is highly related to the impurity effects on the migration of gas phase with the 10 mol n2 the temperature drop in reservoir is significantly accelerated and the total heat absorbed from reservoir is increased by 40 at least combining the limited effect showed by n2 on the gas phase migration velocity and co2 dissolution efficiency at higher reservoir temperature the impurity n2 might has the potential to benefit the co2 plume geothermal systems significantly without distinct risks in this work due to the great temperature span of the simulations very limited experimental data is available to verify the description of fluid density viscosity and solubility since the fluid properties are crucial for the reliability of simulation results the accuracy of the model still needs to be further verified and improved with more experimental data besides the geochemical processes and the effects of salinity will also be considered in the future credit authorship

4010,co2 geological storage is a key technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions but merely injecting co2 into sedimentary strata has high costs and no direct economic benefit a more cost effective and environment friendly way is storing and utilizing co2 in deep sedimentary reservoirs for heat extraction however the effects of ubiquitous impurities on the sequestration safety and heat extraction performance of co2 in high temperature reservoirs are unclear in this study we have performed numerical simulations of multiphase flow solute transport and heat conduction at reservoir temperature 50 250 c to reveal the effects of two common impurities i e h2s and n2 on the migration dissolution and thermal absorption of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs it is found that for higher reservoir temperature the impurity n2 leads to smaller promotion on the migration of gas phase but retains the acceleration effect on the cooling in reservoir above 150 c the deviations on the gas phase migration velocity and the co2 dissolution efficiency caused by 10 mol n2 are less than 12 meanwhile the 10 mol n2 can increase the total heat absorbed from reservoir by about 40 at least it means that n2 has the potential to benefit a co2 plume geothermal system significantly without distinct risks besides it is also found that the co2 dissolution efficiency can be increased and decreased by h2s and n2 through partitioning phenomenon respectively keywords co2 geological storage impurity co2 migration co2 dissolution sedimentary geothermal reservoirs numerical modeling

intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 world meteorological organization 2020a 2020b among the anthropogenic greenhouse gases co2 is responsible for nearly 78 of the increase in the total greenhouse gas emissions from 1970 and contributes approximately 82 of the increase in global radiative forcing over the past decade world meteorological organization 2020a intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 in this context co2 geological storage cgs is widely approved as one of the most promising options for reducing co2 emissions international energy agency 2008 xu et al 2020 however merely storing co2 in geological body does not generate direct economic benefit and has to bear high costs a more cost effective way is utilizing the deposited co2 for energy exploitation which can be mainly divided into two categories 1 oil and gas recovery enhancement and 2 geothermal energy extraction by comparison geothermal energy is renewable and sustainable which is more conducive to co2 emission reduction atrens et al 2009 2010 xu et al 2018 moreover by virtue of innovative equipment and system layouts arslan 2011 baik et al 2012 low temperature geothermal resources can also be converted into electronic power therefore potential subsurface space that suitable for co2 sequestration and heat extraction is substantially enlarged randolph and saar 2011 chen et al 2020 according to different geothermal reservoir medium co2 based geothermal systems can be mainly divided into two patterns 1 enhanced geothermal systems egs brown 2000 pruess 2006 and 2 co2 plume geothermal cpg systems randolph and saar 2011 although co2 egs shows more efficient for electricity generation due to the high temperature hot dry rock the artificial high permeable reservoir might also result in limited storage capacity and potential leakage risk of co2 esteves et al 2019 on the other hand the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs considered in co2 plume geothermal cpg systems are ubiquitously worldwide with high co2 storage capacity and abundant geothermal reserves adams et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 however due to the variety of reservoir conditions and the uncertainty in sealing effectiveness the two common concerns still remain 1 the heat extraction performance of co2 and 2 the leakage risk of co2 the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs are usually at depths 1 5 km naturally porous and permeable overlain by low permeability caprock brine saturated and with temperature 50 250 c randolph and saar 2011 allis et al 2012 the injected co2 in these reservoirs will mainly exist in three states free phase co2 dissolved co2 and mineralized co2 huppert and neufeld 2014 zhang et al 2017 li and yu 2020 the free phase co2 is the actual working fluid in geothermal reservoirs which can provide effective heat advection by similar thermal properties to water and a significantly low viscosity garapati et al 2015 pruess 2008 zhang et al 2014 the dissolved co2 is the premise of geochemical reactions to mineralize co2 for geological timescale and generally moves with brine at a velocity less than 0 1 cm year which plays a critical role for the security of sequestrating large amounts of co2 in brine saturated reservoirs bachu et al 1994 that is to say the heat extraction performance and leakage risk of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs are highly related to the migration and dissolution of free phase co2 generally hydrogeological conditions in specific project sites are the major factors that affects the migration and dissolution of co2 birkholzer et al 2008 wigand et al 2008 yu et al 2017 the simulation study of adams et al 2015 has demonstrated that in cpg systems higher reservoir permeability and temperature makes free phase co2 migrate faster and hence leads to more effective electronic power production meanwhile due to the larger migration distance and greater solubility of free phase co2 by the higher reservoir permeability and temperature the dissolution efficiency of co2 defined as the ratio of dissolved co2 amount to total injected co2 amount can also be promoted li et al 2017 duan and sun 2003 mao et al 2013 besides the density driven convection mixing which plays a dominant role during co2 dissolution in brine islam et al 2013 slim 2014 also has been shown related to reservoir permeability temperature capillary entry pressure and so forth emami meybodi and hassanzadeh 2015 singh et al 2019 2020 however it should be noted that since the purification of captured co2 can significantly raise the total cost de visser et al 2008 impurities are co injected with co2 in most practical operations which can also influence the migration and dissolution of co2 by affecting the fluid properties of injected co2 streams fig 1 li and yan 2009 talman 2015 li et al 2019 in other words the impurities might impact the heat extraction performance and leakage risk of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs either but to our best knowledge there has no published study investigating the impurity effects on co2 storage and utilization in cpg systems apart from some impurities e g n2 and ar allowed for reducing the costs some hazardous gases like h2s and so2 even have been co injected with co2 deliberately because their emission into atmosphere would cause the formation of acid rain and damage to human health bachu and gunter 2005 bachu et al 2005 the light impurity species such as n2 by decreasing the density and viscosity of injected co2 streams would increase the buoyancy force of free phase co2 and accelerate its migration wang et al 2011 ieaghg 2011 yu et al 2021 this would also promote the co2 dissolution efficiency lei et al 2016 li et al 2017 but most impurities have been found unfavorable for the convection mixing process li et al 2015 mahmoodpour et al 2017 mahmoodpour et al 2018 by decreasing the density difference between the pure brine and brine with dissolved co2 ennis king and paterson 2005 ji and zhu 2013 these researches have provided references for understanding the impurity effects on co2 geological storage in brine saturated reservoirs at low reservoir temperature conditions below 75 c however different from the conventional co2 geological storage in widely distributed deep saline aquifers the temperature of brine saturated geothermal reservoirs can be up to 250 c which would be significantly higher than the temperature of injected co2 streams thus high reservoir temperature and non isothermal conditions are necessary to be considered when investigate the impurity effects on the migration and dissolution of co2 in sedimentary geothermal reservoirs the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of two common impurities i e n2 and h2s on the dissolution efficiency of co2 and the heat extraction performance of injected fluid with reservoir temperature varying from 50 to 250 c we have aimed to capture the difference caused by the impurities in three main aspects 1 the migration process of supercritical plume 2 the evolution of temperature field in non isothermal cases 3 the spreading of dissolved co2 to this end we have simulated two phase fluid flow in a deep brine saturated geothermal reservoir with large extension distance under impermeable caprock and convective diffusive flow with relatively high resolution at near well zone the impurity effects of n2 and h2s are compared for different reservoir temperature and injection temperature 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model the flow and transport of fluids and heat in porous media can be modeled by solving the following mass and energy balance equations 1 d dt v β ϕ s β ρ β x β κ d v γ β ρ β x β κ u β n d γ γ β ϕ s β ρ β d β κ x β κ n d γ v q κ d v 2 d dt v 1 ϕ ρ r c r t

vinsome and westerveld 1980 the conservation equations are discretized in space with the integral finite difference method while time is discretized using the first order finite difference method fully implicitly then the coupled discrete equations can be linearized and solved by newton raphson iteration method the maximum scaled residual allowed for any single governing conservation equation at convergence dimensionless is set as 5 0 10 5 in this study the fluid systems altogether involve four components co2 h2s n2 and h2o and two phases gas and aqueous based on the thermodynamic equilibrium the mutual solubilities of the components are calculated from the fugacity fugacity model f g κ f aq κ we can have the fugacity of components in gas phase f g κ by using the peng robinson equation of state pr eos peng and robinson 1976 while the fugacity of co2 h2s and n2 in aqueous phase is calculated using henry s law considering the large temperature difference when injecting cool co2 streams into geothermal reservoirs the henry s constants are obtained from the following semiempirical correlation harvey 1996 5 ln h i ln p h 2 o s a 1 t t c h 2 o b 1 1 t t c h 2 o 0 355 t c h 2 o t c 1 exp 1 t t c h 2 o t t c h 2 o 0 41 1 rt p h 2 o s p v i d p where the saturation pressure of h2o p h 2 o s and the partial molar volume of gaseous component i v i in the aqueous phase are calculated from corresponding empirical functions saul and wagner 1987 garcia 2001 heidemann and prausnitz 1977 perez and heidemann 2006 for the fluid properties of the gas and aqueous phases the calculation of density and viscosity involves pr eos and other correlations reid et al 1977 kestin et al 1981 rowe and chou 1970 these correlations that taken into consideration both the effects of pressure and temperature are necessary in our non isothermal simulations moreover the calculation of fluid enthalpy is also required for the non isothermal conditions the enthalpy of aqueous phase can be obtained from a steam table while the gas enthalpy is calculated as followed 6 h h re h ig where h ig denotes the enthalpy of ideal gas at zero pressure and temperature and the residual enthalpy h re is calculated from the pr eos 2 2 physical model the geometry of the modeled reservoir is shown in fig 2 a with a depth of 3 km and a height of 150 m we idealized this system as a symmetric two dimensional domain and performed simulations in the right half the top and bottom boundaries are respectively set as impermeable caprock and bedrock the right boundary is set 10 km away from the injection well which is determined by the preliminary simulation results in order not to affect the spreading of the injected fluids also the right boundary is set dirichlet condition by assigning large volumes i e 1050 m3 so that the hydrostatic pressure and the initial reservoir temperature are unchanged the injection well is shown as a red point 30 m below the caprock fig 2a three injected fluids including impure co2 with 10 mol h2s impure co2 with 10 mol n2 and pure co2 are injected at the same constant rate of q 0 002 kg s to minimize the effect of injection pressure on the spreading of supercritical and dissolved co2 the injection temperature of the fluids is maintained constant throughout the entire injection period in order to capture the differences in the migration and dissolution processes between the pure and impure co2 we performed high resolution modeling of fluid flow near well the dimension of the grids is shown in fig 2a in the z direction the model is divided into 75 layers and each layer is 2 m high in the x direction the gridding starts with 2 m increments for the first 500 m and then becomes coarser with increasing distance the thickness of the grids is 2 m which is the smallest gridding increment in the x direction and also same as the height of each layer in the z direction to focus on the impurity effects on the flow dissolution and thermal absorption of co2 we have made some assumptions including the homogenization of porosity and the simplification of permeability details besides considering the small injection rate 0 002 kg s in this study we have activated the modeling of molecular diffusion in the simulations since li and jiang 2020 demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients of impurities n2 and h2s 10 mol would not have distinct effects on the occurrence and development of density driven convection we assumed the same diffusion coefficients for the three injected fluids the model parameters used in this study includes ϕ 0 15 k 10 13 m2 ρ r 2560 kg m3 c r 1010 j kg oc λ r 1 w m oc d β κ 10 9 m2 s s rw 0 2 s rg 0 2 which are within common range of co2 geological storage projects the correlations of relative permeability are taken from corey 1954 the simulations are performed using the compositional and unconventional reservoir simulator cmg gem cmg 2012 2 3 analysis method to quantify the migration velocity of gas phase we define the gas phase plume tip as the intersection point of the gas saturation contour of 0 5 and the top boundary fig 2b it means that the time the gas phase plume tip reaches a grid at x m in the horizontal direction below the caprock t x is the time the gas saturation of this grid reaches 0 5 the horizontal location of the gas plume tip in the coordinate system shown in fig 2b is denoted as x tip then the average migration velocity of gas phase can be calculated as v g x tip t x the heat extraction performance of the injected fluids in the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs corresponds to the temperature dropping speed in reservoir since the principle of cpg systems is using co2 as working fluid for heat extraction from host rock the heat absorbed from reservoir after time t can be calculated as 7 q 1 ϕ ρ r c r 1 n v n t n t t n 0 the co2 dissolution efficiency in high temperature reservoirs is the third focus point in this study we define the ratio of dissolved co2 amount to total injected co2 amount as co2 dissolution efficiency de since solute fingering is an important mechanism of co2 dissolution trapping we estimate the onset and growth of solute fingers for each case in this study the onset time of solute fingering is estimated from the procedures shown in fig 2c the grid dimension is 2 m in both the x and z directions at the near well zone in our work thus we specify that the solute fingering onsets when the fluctuation of the contour with a dissolved co2 concentration of 0 02 is no less than 4 m and the fluctuation amplitude of the contour is defined as the length of solute fingering taking the pure co2 system as reference the impurity effects on the v g q and de are quantified as relative deviations between the simulation results of impure and pure co2 systems 3 results and discussion the simulation results of 18 cases for the three injected fluids under different reservoir temperature tr and injection temperature ti conditions are presented and discussed in this section for tr we have chosen 50 150 and 250 c respectively to represent the low moderate and high reservoir temperature it is noteworthy that at the high reservoir temperature 250 c the density of brine with dissolved co2 is lower than that of pure brine which is just the opposite of the cases with the low and moderate reservoir temperature singh et al 2020 hnedkovsky et al 1996 for each case two injection temperatures ti tr and ti 25 c are considered when ti 25 c the injected liquid co2 will be warmed up quickly and turns to supercritical therefore in this study both the liquid and supercritical co2 are regarded as a single non wetting phase and sometimes written as gaseous co2 the simulations in this study contain two stages the first 100 years is the injection period and the last 100 years is the storage period in table 1 the fluid properties at corresponding conditions and some simulation results are presented to assist the analysis 3 1 validation of the fluid thermophysical properties since fluid thermophysical property is crucial for the reliability of simulations we compared the calculated fluid properties to the values taken from nist lemmon et al 2019 and the available experimental data listed in tables 2 and 3 the relative deviation and average absolute deviation between the calculated results and the reference data are defined as 8 rd m cal m ref m ref 100 a a d a b s r d n 100 where n is the number of data points using the pr eos correlations and steam table mentioned in section 2 1 we obtained the densities viscosities and enthalpies of pure co2 h2s n2 and h2o at 30 mpa and 25 250 c with a temperature step of 1 c these calculated results are compared to the values from nist in fig 3 a for the pure component densities the relative deviations are less than 10 which suggest the calculated results are reasonable for the pure component viscosities 95 of the relative deviations for co2 n2 and h2o are less than 10 while those for h2s reach about 25 the calculation of h2s viscosity can be further improved but 75 of the relative deviations for h2s are less than 10 and the average absolute relative difference is 7 thus the viscosity models used in this study can be considered reliable preliminarily meanwhile the relative deviations of the enthalpies for pure co2 h2s and n2 are less than 10 while the average absolute relative deviation of the water enthalpy is 15 45 but the accuracy of the water enthalpy is still regarded enough since the focus of this study is the effect of the impurities in co2 streams on the migration dissolution and heat extraction performance of the injected fluids due to the lack of experimental viscosity data of co2 h2s or co2 n2 mixtures only the calculated densities of co2 h2s and co2 n2 mixtures were compared to experimental data table 2 in fig 3b although the relative deviations can reach about 20 in the vicinity of co2 critical pressure and temperature almost 95 of the relative deviations are less than 10 moreover the average absolute relative deviations are less than 4 05 it indicates that the calculation of co2 mixture densities in this study is reliable meanwhile the predicted gas solubilities are also compared to available experimental data listed in table 3 fig 3c shows that the relative deviations of gas solubilities range from 50 to 75 however for the solubilities of co2 and n2 in water large gaps only exist between calculated results and a few experimental data sources it shows that 95 of the relative deviations are less than 20 and 75 of the relative deviations are less than 10 moreover the average absolute deviations for the co2 h2o n2 h2o and co2 n2 h2o systems are 4 85 7 87 and 4 08 respectively for the system of h2s h2o limited experimental solubility data are found especially for the conditions of high pressure and high temperature based on a few of data sources the average absolute relative deviation is up to 14 7 since the calculation precision of models generally depends on the availability of experimental data the capability of the model calculating h2s solubility in water can be further optimized with more experimental data 3 2 impurity effects on the distribution and migration of gas phase the distribution of gas saturation in fig 4 a is taken when the gas phase plume tip reaches x 50 m below the caprock for isothermal cases it can be seen that the impurity effect of 10 mol n2 on the gas phase distribution is negligible when tr equals 150 and 250 c while trivial effects of 10 mol h2s are shown under three reservoir temperature conditions in this study we quantified the gas phase distribution by non dimensionalizing the arrival time of gas phase reaching x 2000 m below the caprock t 2000 as t 2000 1 d e q l 2000 δ h ctz ρ f ϕ 1 s rw singh et al 2020 the numerator is the total mass of gaseous co2 in the reservoir at time t 2000 while the denominator is the mass of gaseous co2 in an assumed triangular capillary transition zone sg greater than 0 5 as can be seen in fig 4d the dimensionless values of t 2000 for different injected fluids make clusters when tr 150 c and tr 250 c and they are close to unity which means the capillary transition zones of these cases are all approximately triangular for tr 50 c the dimensionless t 2000 of the cases injecting pure co2 and impure co2 containing h2s are greater than 1 2 which results from the horizontal spread of gas phase near the injection well out of the triangular zone the buoyancy due to the density difference between injected fluid and ambient brine is the driven force controlling the spread of gas phase when the buoyancy is greater enough the gas phase of the injected fluids nearly does not spread horizontally during the upward migration but rises directly to accumulate below the caprock since the decrease in density of injected fluid caused by impurities gets smaller with higher reservoir temperature table 1 the impurity effects on the gas phase distribution also become weaker the impurities affect the gas phase distribution by affecting the density of injected fluid fig 1a b the impurity effects on the density of injected fluid determines not only the impurity effects on the distribution of gas phase but also the impurity effects on the migration velocity of gas phase fig 4b shows the location variation of the gas phase plume tips with time fig 4c is the average moving velocities of the tips during injection period and storage period for tr 50 c it is clear that the impurity n2 accelerates the migration of gas phase most significantly then the increase in average velocities caused by n2 decreases with increasing reservoir temperature by comparison the effects of the impurity h2s on the gas phase plume is almost negligible but for tr 150 c and tr 250 c instead of accelerating the lateral migration of gas phase like that in the cases of tr 50 c the impurity h2s shrinks the gas phase plume slightly considering the solubilities of co2 and h2s are both greatly promoted in the cases of moderate and high reservoir temperature we speculate that it is the increased dissolved mass of injected fluid that decreases the amount of gas phase and hence results in the shrinkage of the gas phase plume 3 3 impurity effects on the heat absorption from reservoir in section 3 2 the injection temperature shows negligible effects on the distribution of gas phase plume it has been explained by the much smaller thermal disturbed area than the migration range of the gas phase plume zhao and cheng 2015 as shown in fig 5 a the thermal disturbed areas in all cases are within 150 m from the injection well at 100 years while the gas phase plume tip has already reached about 2 6 km the injected fluids are lighter than brine and mainly rises in the form of gas phase hence the prominent temperature drop is shown above the injection area singh et al 2020 besides the thermal disturbance spreading along with the injected fluid is also affected by the specific heat capacity of the injected fluid since the difference in the specific heat capacity of the three injected fluids is negligible fig 1 the impurity effects on the temperature field are mainly controlled by the impurity effects on the migration of injected fluid it can be seen that the cooling both below and above the injection area is significantly accelerated by the impurity n2 while the impurity h2s shows negligible effects figure 5b and c compare the heat absorbed from reservoir by the three injected fluids after 50 and 100 years the 10 mol n2 not only increases the total absorbed heat by about 40 80 and 120 for reservoir temperature 50 150 and 250 c respectively but also improves the heat extraction below the injection area in contrast the 10 mol h2s decreases the both the cooling below the injection area is caused by the convection mixing of brine the density driven convection mixing during co2 dissolution is discussed in the next section 3 4 impurity effects on the dissolution trapping of co2 the convection mixing due to the gravity instability near the co2 diffusion boundary results in a much higher dissolution rate of co2 and hence is regarded as an important mechanism of co2 dissolution trapping in brine saturated reservoirs xu et al 2006 here we mainly focus on the effects of the impurities h2s and n2 on the solute fingering and the co2 dissolution efficiency de for different temperature conditions when the injection area is located in the middle of aquifers it has been demonstrated that the convection mixing of brine near injection well can be significantly affected by the injection temperature singh et al 2020 thus the simulation results of isothermal and non isothermal conditions ti tr and ti 25 c are presented separately in the following subsections 3 4 1 isothermal conditions figure 6 a illustrates the evolution of dissolved co2 in the near well zone within 50 m from the injection well for isothermal cases when tr 50 c and tr 150 c not only the solute fingers convection trunks stretched out from the injection area also can be seen moving downward the impurities slow down the falling of convection trunks delay the onset of solute fingers and also narrow the fingers fig 6a and b the reason is that the density difference between the brine with dissolved co2 and pure brine the driven force of convection mixing is decreased by the impurities meanwhile the impurity h2s and n2 slightly decreases and increases the growth rate of fingers respectively overall the impurities have adverse effects on the convection mixing at the low and moderate reservoir temperature according to the negligible effect of h2s and the promotion effect of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency de at tr 50 c it can be concluded that the impurity effect on de is mainly controlled by the impurity effect on the migration of gas phase for the low reservoir temperature because larger migration extent of gaseous co2 increasing the gas aqueous contact area implies higher co2 dissolution efficiency when the increment in the migration velocity of gas phase caused by n2 decrease from 40 at tr 50 c to 10 at tr 150 c the effect of n2 on co2 dissolution efficiency also becomes trivial or even negative when tr ti 250 c the dissolved co2 only migrates laterally below the caprock and no convection trunks or solute fingers develop fig 6a the dissolution of the injected fluids decreases the brine density which prevents the density driven convection mixing fig 6c shows that the impurity h2s and n2 increases and decreases the co2 dissolution efficiency respectively at this time the impurity effect on de can not be related to the impurity effects on the gas phase migration because the migration velocity of gas phase is decreased 2 by h2s and increased 8 by n2 we speculate that it is the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and the impurities that controls the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency at the high reservoir temperature which will be discussed in detail below 3 4 2 non isothermal conditions the injection temperature for heat extraction purpose in this study is set to 25 c lower than reservoir temperature for this reason the density variation of brine is affected not only by the dissolution of injected fluids but also by the temperature difference the brine near injection well with low temperature can be much heavier than the brine with reservoir temperature table 1 the large temperature difference leading to great density difference of brine finally results in the occur of convection rolls at tr 150 c and tr 250 c but the impurity effect on the convection mixing in the non isothermal cases assembles those in isothermal cases the smaller density difference of brine caused by impurities leads to weaker convection mixing fig 7 a and b in section 3 1 and 3 2 the injection temperature has been proved of negligible effects on the distribution and migration of gas phase thus the impurity effect on the co2 dissolution efficiency in the non isothermal cases also assembles those in isothermal cases figs 6c and 7c but it is noteworthy that the lower injection temperature amplifies the impurity effect on the co2 dissolution efficiency when tr 250 c 3 5 possible mechanism of the impurity effects on d e for tr 250 c according to the discussion above the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency can be classified to 1 the positive effect due to the promotion on the migration velocity of gas phase and 2 the negative effect due to the inhibition on the convection mixing of brine however the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency at ti tr 250 c indicates that something might be ignored fig 8 a when the negative correlation of the impurity effect on gas phase migration and co2 dissolution efficiency occurs and no convection mixing happens the reason for the impurity effect on co2 dissolution efficiency is directed to the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and impurities partitioning phenomenon is due to the solubility difference between co2 and the impurities the higher and lower solubility of h2s and n2 than that of co2 respectively results in more and less gaseous co2 accumulating at the leading edge of gas phase fig 9 the gas saturation contour of 0 8 can be regarded as a border line between the gas saturated zone and the gas phase leading edge since the residual water saturation set in this study is 0 2 the co2 dissolution efficiency in the gas saturated zone is almost uniform at the same ambient temperature while it is increased and decreased at the gas phase leading edge respectively by the impurity h2s and n2 fig 8b moreover the temperature drop in the non isothermal cases lowers the co2 solubility significantly at the near well zone especially for the injected fluid containing n2 thus the greater negative effect of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency is shown in non isothermal cases 4 conclusions in this work we have simulated the migration dissolution and thermal absorption of pure and impure co2 in the sedimentary geothermal reservoirs and investigate the feasibility of the co injection of co2 with two common impurities h2s and n2 for the geological sequestration and utilization in geothermal energy systems the major conclusions are as follows 1 the effects of the impurities h2s and n2 on the distribution and migration of the gas phase are determined by the impurity effects on the density of injected fluid while the 10 mol h2s shows negligible effects the same amount of n2 increases the migration velocity of gas phase by 25 at least at the low reservoir temperature the high reservoir temperature can decrease this value to 4 which significantly reduces the leakage risk of gaseous co2 brought by n2 2 the influence mechanisms of the impurities on co2 dissolution efficiency in this study can be classified to 1 the positive effect due to the promotion on the migration velocity of gas phase 2 the negative effect due to the inhibition on the convection mixing of brine and 3 the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and impurities with higher reservoir temperature the negative effect of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency is limited within about 10 3 when injecting cool co2 streams into warm reservoirs the impurity effects on the temperature field is highly related to the impurity effects on the migration of gas phase with the 10 mol n2 the temperature drop in reservoir is significantly accelerated and the total heat absorbed from reservoir is increased by 40 at least combining the limited effect showed by n2 on the gas phase migration velocity and co2 dissolution efficiency at higher reservoir temperature the impurity n2 might has the potential to benefit the co2 plume geothermal systems significantly without distinct risks in this work due to the great temperature span of the simulations very limited experimental data is available to verify the description of fluid density viscosity and solubility since the fluid properties are crucial for the reliability of simulation results the accuracy of the model still needs to be further verified and improved with more experimental data besides the geochemical processes and the effects of salinity will also be considered in the future credit authorship

4011,systematic model error is caused by the unreasonable simplification of real groundwater system which damages the reliability of groundwater model prediction gaussian process regression gpr is a popular data driven method used to build a statistical complementary model to correct systematic prediction error and improve model prediction kernel function is a crucial component of gpr it represents the assumptions on systematic prediction error that we want to learn in order to evaluate the influence of gpr kernel on capturing systematic prediction error we compared the performances of gpr with nine kernels in groundwater predictions these kernels include three commonly used single kernels i e squared exponential se matérn class mt and rational quadratic rq kernels and six new kernels formed by combining these single kernels as sum or product of pairs se mt s se rq s mt rq s se mt p se rq p and mt rq p moreover three groundwater case studies including two analytical cases

the ability of the gpr based complementary model to capture the systematic prediction error of groundwater model the single kernel rq based gpr yields the best performance in improving groundwater predictions among the nine kernels for all case studies the combined kernels mt rq s se rq s also perform well in groundwater predictions and the commonly used se kernel has mediocre performance in

has been well studied by the groundwater hydrology community and some general methods are currently available such as the least square methods lsm hill and tiedeman 2007 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 hassan et al 2008 and formal bayesian methods vrugt et al 2009a the observation error is always quantified using residual analysis the residual is assumed to be either a simple function e g an uncorrelated gaussian distribution demissie et al 2009 or a complex function e g a correlated heteroscedastic non gaussian function schoups and vrugt 2010 smith et al 2010 finsterle and zhang 2011 model structure error is one of the important sources of systematic prediction error these is a consensus that model structure error can t be well compensated by parameter calibration doherty and welter 2010 xu and valocchi 2015 multi model framework is first used to address groundwater model structure uncertainty by building a set of plausible models that have different conceptualizations of hydrogeological conditions then this unknown system is represented by the optimal ensemble of these alternative models the commonly used multi model methods include bayesian model selection raftery 1995 pande 2013a 2013b bayesian model averaging draper 1997 and bayesian model combination monteith et al 2011 these methods incorporate the study area s prior information to quantify model structure uncertainty through bayesian theory höge et al 2019 however the reliability of multi model methods is compromised in practical implementations due to difficulties in defining model space alternative models and prior weights and estimating posterior model weights or marginal likelihood which limit the widespread use of the multi model methods enemark et al 2019 parasuraman and elshorbagy 2008 developed an ensemble based genetic programming framework to explore the model space using a large number of competing models this method provides a feasible way to build model space the systematic prediction error may contain some useful information about the physical process which is missed in the conceptualization of model demissie et al 2009 based on this idea the data driven methods ddm are recently introduced to process systematic prediction error through complementary modeling approach pianosi and raso 2012 marker et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 kasiviswanathan et al 2019 ddm does not quantify model structure uncertainty a statistical model is used to describe the systematic prediction error and then the model outputs or predictions are represented by the sum of the physical model the statistical model and the observation error model demissie et al 2009 investigated the potential of complementary modeling approach in predicting groundwater head and the results demonstrated that this approach could lead to apparent improvement in prediction e g up to 64 reduction in root mean square error rmse gaussian process regression gpr is a popular machine learning technique with excellent flexibility and convenience that has been widely used for the complementary modeling of groundwater hydrology models xu and valocchi 2015 xu et al 2017 lal and datta 2018 roshni et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 combined gpr and the ensemble kalman filter to solve the systematic model error inherent in using soil layer conceptualization to model dynamical soil moisture they found that gpr significantly reduces parameter compensation issues lal and datta 2018 applied gpr to predict the salinity concentrations in a coastal aquifer system under uncertain groundwater pumping conditions they found that the predictions with gpr are more accurate than those using genetic programming roshni et al 2019 compared several machine learning techniques in predicting sea level under climate change uncertainty and the results demonstrated that gpr has the best performance among these techniques gpr is one of the nonparametric kernel based learning algorithms developed from the bayesian linear regression model it assumes that the learning samples follow the gaussian process prior probability and then infers the corresponding posterior probability using the bayes theorem the gaussian process is uniquely defined by a mean function μ and a covariance function c i e the systematic prediction error obeys a gaussian distribution n μ c the covariance function c is also known as the kernel function the kernel function is a crucial component of gpr because it represents the assumptions on the object e g systematic prediction error that we wish to learn specifically the kernel function defines the closeness and similarity among the samples under the assumption that close input data will probably result in close output data rasmussen and williams 2006 chen and wang 2018 therefore kernel function determines gpr s performance in handling systematic prediction error the squared exponential se function is the most widely used kernel function in gpr xu et al 2017 shuang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the se kernel function is infinitely differentiable which means that the gaussian process with se kernel has mean square derivatives of all orders and thus this gpr is very smooth however the strong assumption of se kernel smoothness may be unreasonable for complex systematic prediction error there are other types of kernel functions that can be used in gpr e g the matérn class mt of kernel functions sun et al 2014 and the rational quadratic rq reggente et al 2014 mt is characterized by the positive smoothing parameter ν which controls the gliding property of gpr the mt kernel is k times differentiable as ν k if ν tends to infinity mt converges to se rq is characterized by a positive valued scale mixture parameter α it is infinitely mean square differentiable for each α if α tends to infinity the rq kernel converges to the se kernel with a characteristic length scale pandit and infield 2019 applied gpr to predict a wind turbine power curve and four kernels including se mt and rq were tested they found that the predictions using mt kernel with ν 5 2 had a lower root mean square error as well as a higher coefficient of determination than those obtained using se predictions with the rq kernel were similar in accuracy to those obtained using se but a triple training time was required generally a real groundwater system has complex aquifer structures and strong spatial variability of parameters that may lead to a highly nonlinear systematic prediction error it may be difficult to accurately describe the unknown and complex systematic prediction error using a single kernel function combining or modifying the available kernel functions to form new ones is a feasible way to address this difficulty this is because the combined kernels with multiple features are more flexible and can handle the complex systematic prediction error more accurately david et al 2013 according to rasmussen and williams 2006 the sum or product of two kernels is also a kernel denniston et al 2018 constructed an additive mt kernel from two single mt kernels whose ν were 3 2 and 5 2 and then used this new kernel to build models for mapping the sea floor from complicated seabed data the results showed that this combined mt kernel outperforms the single kernels e g se mt in mapping the sea floor longman et al 2018 built a new kernel by forming the product of an intrinsically sparse kernel and an rq kernel and then modeled oil spills using a synthetic aperture radar satellite system in this paper nine kernels including three traditional single kernels se mt and rq kernels and six new combined kernels i e the sum or product of two single kernels were used in three groundwater case studies two analytical and one real to capture the systematic prediction error and improve groundwater predictions after that four metrics the mean absolute error mae the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and log score were used to evaluate the performances of these kernels the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the framework of gpr and define the nine kernels and four evaluation metrics in section 3 the three groundwater cases are described in section 4 the application of the methods is described the results of the three groundwater case studies are presented in section 5 section 6 contains the discussion and section 7 is the conclusion 2 methods 2 1 bayesian inference the observation data d is defined as the sum of the groundwater model output m ϑ observation error ε and systematic prediction error f which can be described as kennedy and o hagan 2001 1 d m ϑ f y ϕ ε where ϑ is groundwater model parameters f is the complementary model which represents systematic prediction error y represents the input of model f e g the time location and other relevant information ϕ are the tuning parameters hyperparameters and ε represents the observation error based on bayesian inference the physical parameter ϑ and gpr hyperparameter ϕ are jointly calibrated the prior distribution p ϑ ϕ is specified as the product of p ϑ and p ϕ which are assumed to be independent the posterior distribution p ϑ ϕ d is described as xu et al 2017 2 p ϑ ϕ d p d ϑ ϕ p ϑ p ϕ where p ϑ and p ϕ represent the prior distributions of ϑ and ϕ respectively the priors are commonly specified by experts or via pilot experiments p d ϑ ϕ is the likelihood function generally it is impossible to derive an analytical expression for posterior distributions due to the complexity of likelihood function mcmc method provides an effective way to obtain the posterior distributions via an evolving markov chain mcmc simulation incorporates observation information to search the parameter space and evolve the markov chain from prior distributions to posterior distributions the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs algorithm which has been implemented to calibrate the model parameters in many high dimensional and complex groundwater cases eric and laloy 2012 wöhling et al 2012 hernández and francés 2015 zhang et al 2018 is applied to perform mcmc simulation in this work more details about the dreamzs algorithm can be found in laloy and vrugt 2012 and vrugt et al 2009b commonly the logarithmic form of gaussian likelihood function is applied in mcmc simulation which is defined as hoeting et al 1999 3 log p d ϑ ϕ 1 2 d m ϑ μ t c 1 d m ϑ μ 1 2 log c n 2 log 2 π where n is the number of observed data μ is the mean of systematic prediction error and c is the error covariance matrix the details of μ and c are presented in section 2 2 2 2 gaussian process regression gpr

function c determined by a kernel function k y y e f y μ y f y μ y specify the gaussian process the hyperparameters ϕ contain the mean parameter μ and covariance parameters described in section 2 3 based on the mcmc simulation the posterior samples of ϑ and ϕ are generated from the markov chains for a new input y the predictions of m and f can be obtained where the asterisk denotes predictions the probability distribution of f obeys the gaussian distribution n f c y f xu et al 2017 where 4 f e f d m ϑ ϕ μ c t c 1 d m ϑ μ 5 c f f c c t c 1 c μ represents the prior mean μ y c represents the prior covariance matrix which is calculated as c i j k yi yj and c is calculated as c i j k yi yj hence the predicted output at y can be written as 6 s m f ε the steps of integrating gpr into mcmc simulation are summarized in fig 1 2 3 kernel functions the kernel function is used to define the covariance c of the complementary model f y ϕ in this study three commonly used single kernel functions i e se mt and rq and their combinations are used and tested the se kernel is defined as rasmussen and williams 2006 7 k se y i y j σ s 2 exp y i y j t y i y j λ s 2 σ ε 2 x i j 1 2 n where σs λs and σε are three hyperparameters σs 2 controls the marginal variance of f y and is referred to as variance parameter λs is the relative characteristic length scale and σε 2 represents the measurement error χ is the indicator function and χ 1 when i j otherwise χ 0 n is the number of observed data the mt kernel is named by stein 1999 after the work of matérn 1986 it can be written as 8 k mt y i y j σ m 2 exp 2 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m γ p 1 γ 2 p 1 l 0 p p l l p l 8 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m p l σ ε 2 x i j 1 2 n where υ is a chosen parameter that equals p 1 2 the definition of σm and λm are similar to those of σs and λs γ is the gamma function the mt kernel is characterized by the parameter υ according to rasmussen and williams 2006 we set υ 5 2 i e p 2 in this work the rq kernel can be treated as a scale mixture of se kernels with the different characteristic length scales rasmussen and williams 2006 9 k rq y i y j σ r 2 1 y i y j t y i y j 2 α r λ r 2 α r σ ε 2 x i j 1 2 n the hyperparameters σr λr and σε are similar to those in the definition of se and mt rq has a positive valued scale mixture parameter αr that can determine the relative weighting of large scale and small scale variances rq kernel is equivalent to a scale mixture of se kernels with different relative characteristic length scales roberts et al 2013 thus compared with the se kernel rq seems to fit data with different length scales more flexible the combined kernel functions used in this study consist of the sum or product of three pairs of single kernels the combined kernel functions are the sum of se and mt se mt s the sum of se and rq se rq s the sum of mt and rq mt rq s the product of se and mt se mt p the product of se and rq se rq p and the product of mt and rq mt rq p they can be defined as follows rasmussen and williams 2006 10 k se mt s y i y j σ s 2 exp y i y j t y i y j λ s 2 σ m 2 exp 2 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m γ p 1 γ 2 p 1 l 0 p p l l p l 8 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m p l σ

kernel functions the gpr with different kernel functions are used to capture the systematic prediction error for each groundwater case the kernel function s performance is evaluated by comparing the predictions with validation observations that are not used for calibration process four metrics are used in this study mae mre rmse and log score the metrics are defined below 16 mae 1 n i 1 n s i d i 17 mre 1 n i 1 n s i d i d 18 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i d i 2 19 log score i 1 n log p d i d where n is the number of observations si and di represent the simulated predictions and observations in validation period respectively the average of the observations is denoted by d p di d is the predictive probability of di i 1 n under calibration data d the better performance of the predictions can be recognized by the lower value of mae mre rmse and log score for the calculation of mae mre and rmse the mean values of the predictive distributions and the predictions corresponding to the parameters with the maximum posterior density are used to represent the si in this study respectively 3 description of the three groundwater model cases three groundwater model cases are used to evaluate the performances of these nine kernel functions in terms of their ability to improve prediction the first case is an analytical groundwater drawdown model of a partially penetrated well in a leaky aquifer the second case is an analytical solute transport model with nonequilibrium sorption the third case is a polystyrene nanoplastics psnps black soil column transport experiment which is simulated by a numerical transport model 3 1 groundwater drawdown model the drawdown caused by pumping through a partially penetrating well in a leaky aquifer is measured by a piezometer the initial and boundary conditions are hantush 1961a 20 k r 2 s r 2 1 r s r k z 2 s z 2 s m m b k b μ s t s r z 0 0 s z t 0 s z r 0 t 0 s z r m t 0 lim r 0 r s r 0 0 z d q 2 π k r l d d z l 0 l z m the solution can be

the drawdowns at the observation wells after pumping for eight days are used as observation data the r and z of the different wells vary as shown in fig 2 b the observations are divided into two parts model calibration represented by the black dots and model validation represented by the blue dots fig 2 b shows the details of the observations points in practice it is difficult to characterize the structure of aquifer accurately due to the limited availability of information in this case study a defective pumping drawdown model in which the leaky aquifer is neglected is used to perform the model calibration and validation the defective drawdown model with the initial and boundary conditions can be described as hantush 1961b 22 k r 2 s r 2 1 r s r k z 2 s z 2 μ s t s r z 0 0 s z t 0 s z

in groundwater always involves complex biochemical reaction processes here we consider a one dimensional convective dispersive solute transport problem with nonequilibrium sorption and degradation in the uniform flow condition the transport model with the initial and boundary conditions can be formulated as 24 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x μ c γ c x 0 c i d c x v c x 0 v c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 c x t 0 where c mol l represents the solution concentration which is related to the time t d and the distance m from the source zone c 0 mol l represents the solution concentration at boundary condition γ mol ld is the rate constant for zero order production μ d represents the rate constant for first order decay v m d represents the pore water velocity d m2 d represents the dispersion coefficient ci mol l

located five meters apart in the region defined by 5 m to 255 m and the observations are taken once a day for the first ten days the black dots in fig 3 b represent the observations used for model calibration and the blue ones represent the data used for model validation the details of observation points are presented in fig 3 b it is common practice to simplify the model of solute transport process by making certain assumptions allowing one to simplify the equations describing its complex biochemical reactions here we use a simplified linear sorption model to represent the solute transport in groundwater with no production and decay that is 29 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x c x 0 c i c 0 t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 c x t 0 where r is described by linear sorption equation r 1 ρ k d θ we use this simplified solute transport model to perform model calibration and validation the solution of this simplified model is as follows van genuchten and alves 1982 30 c x t c i c 0 c i a x t 0 t t 0 c

the polystyrene nanoplastics column transport experiment a one dimensional column experiment is performed to observe the transport of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps in black soil wu et al 2020 this column has an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and is 10 cm long black soil is uniformly packed in the column the velocity of flow in this up flow model is 1 ml min the velocity is controlled by a peristaltic pump the black soil contains 11 9 clay 75 silt and 13 1 sand the effective porosity is 0 42 and the value of the hydrodynamic dispersion α which is obtained via a tracer column experiment is 0 16 cm the psnps transport experiment can be divided into two stages first three pore volumes of a psnps suspension solution are pumped into the column next three pore volumes of a psnps free background solution are pumped into the column the concentrations of psnps are measured at 3 7 11 15 147 min 37 observations the first 26 observations are used to calibrate the psnps transport model while the remaining 11 are used for model validation because the colloidal mobility and surface area to volume ratio of nanoplastic particles are high and they have a strong adsorption affinity for contaminants psnps can act as contaminant carriers to facilitate their transport currently it is difficult to accurately describe the complex kinetic processes of psnps transport in groundwater here the first order irreversible kinetic reaction function is applied to simulate the psnps absorption desorption process 32 ρ b c s t β c c s k d where ρb g cm3 represents the bulk density cs g cm3 represents the sorbed concentration β min represents the first order mass transfer rate between the dissolved and sorbed phases c g cm3 represents the dissolved concentration and kd represents the dissolved coefficient for the sorbed phase in this case study the systematic model error is introduced by using the first order irreversible kinetic function to describe the chemical reactions and assuming the sand column is uniformly packed the psnps transport model is numerical solved by using modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 4 application of the methods gpr with different kernel functions are used to handle the systematic prediction error in the three groundwater cases and these nine kernel functions including se mt rq se mt s se mt p se rq s se rq p mt rq s and mt rq p are evaluated by their efficacy in groundwater predictions mcmc simulation is used to jointly calibrate groundwater model parameters and hyperparameters the details of the mcmc simulation for the three cases are presented below 4 1 gpr for the groundwater drawdown prediction by looking at equations 20 and 21 one observes that the systematic model error lies in neglecting the leakage flow in the aquifer using nine kernel functions gpr is used to build the complementary model statistically in this case study after that this simplified groundwater model and gpr are combined to perform the model calibration and validation based on mcmc simulation three groundwater model parameters i e the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kr the thickness of aquifer m and the storage coefficient μ s are assumed as random variables moreover the hyperparameters of gpr are also treated as random variables the prior information about these random variables is defined in table 3 and their posterior distributions are calibrated through mcmc simulation the dreamzs algorithm is used to search for the probability space of the parameters in mcmc simulation we set three parallel chains with a burn in period of 6 000 iterations for each chain the after burn in period has the same iteration length as the burn in period does the total number of observations is 100 of which 72 are used in this mcmc simulation and the remaining 28 are used to validate the predictions as presented in fig 2 b 4 2 gpr for the solute transport prediction the systematic model error of the solute transport model is introduced by assuming that the adsorption isotherm is linear and that there are no degradation or production processes equations 29 to 31 similar to section 4 1 the gpr with different kernel functions are used to build the complementary model which is then combined with groundwater model to perform model prediction based on mcmc simulation three groundwater model parameters are set to random variables the solution concentration at the boundary condition c 0 the pore water velocity v and the dispersion coefficient d moreover the hyperparameters of kernels in gpr are also treated as random variables the prior information about the groundwater model parameters and gpr hyperparameters is displayed in table 4 their posterior distributions are generated by mcmc simulations the setup of the mcmc simulation is the same as that described in section 4 1 there are 260 observation data in this case 188 of them are used in this mcmc simulation i e model calibration and 72 of them are used for validation as shown in fig 3 b the model s predictive performance is evaluated by comparing predictions with the validation data 4 3 gpr for the polystyrene nanoplastics transport prediction the systematic model error of psnps transport model is introduced by simplifying the chemical reactions that take place in column experiment as well as porous media s heterogeneity as described in section 4 1 and 4 2 mcmc is used to calibrate the complementary model and groundwater model four groundwater model parameters i e the partition coefficient kd the first order mass transfer rate coefficient β the hydraulic conductivity k the dispersion α and the hyperparameters of gpr are set as random variables the prior information about these parameters is listed in table 5 three markov chains are used in the mcmc simulation the burn in period is 9 000 iterations for each chain as is the after burn in period the groundwater model parameters and the hyperparameters are calibrated by using the 26 concentration observations and then the model predictions are validated through the 11 observations 5 results based on the three groundwater model cases we evaluate the ability of nine gpr kernels to capture the systematic prediction error four metrics described in section 2 4 are used to evaluate the performances of these kernels quantitatively by comparing model predictions with observations in validation period in addition the calibrated posterior distributions of parameters for the three case studies are presented in supplementary material 5 1 the groundwater drawdown prediction the groundwater drawdown predictions are calculated by the posterior distributions of parameters using equation 24 we choose three typical observation points to display the predictive performance of different gpr kernels as shown in fig 4 the prediction distributions with the single kernel rq and the combined kernels mt rq s and mt rq p are more concentrated and have higher probability densities at the observations the prediction obtained using the se kernel has mediocre probability densities at the true values the four metrics mae mre rmse and log score are used to measure the predictive performances of gpr kernels for all observations in validation period as shown in table 6 two types of prediction data are used to calculate the first three metrics respectively including the mean values of posterior predictive distributions and the predictions corresponding to the parameters with the maximum posterior density and these two evaluations are denoted as mean and optimal respectively in table 6 the same as in tables 7 and 8 the lower metrics indicate the better performance of predictions we can find that the evaluations of mean and optimal are similar for these kernels moreover it is easy to see that the commonly used se kernel does not perform best among these nine kernels rq kernel has the best performance in predicting groundwater drawdown because it obtains the lowest mae mre rmse and log score for the six combined kernels the combinations of mt and rq obtain good performance of groundwater drawdown predictions while the combinations of se and mt perform poorly in prediction moreover the additive ones generally outperform the multiplied ones 5 2 the solute transport prediction based on the obtained posterior parameters samples the predictions of the solute concentration are generated by combining the solute transport model and gpr the mean value and 95 credible interval of the posterior predictions are used to validate the performances of the nine kernels fig 5 a total of 72 observations are used for model validation they are located within 145 m to 255 m at the intervals of 10 m at one day intervals between day 5 and day 10 as shown in fig 3 b due to space limitations the observation series at three locations are shown here and a locally enlarged plot is used to highlight the differences between predictions and observations for each kernel it is clear that the basic characteristics of observation series can be well captured by these kernels and most observations fall within the 95 credible intervals except that the observations at day 5 and day 6 are not well predicted for most kernels among these nine kernels the 95 credible intervals of rq has the highest inclusion rate approximately 95 to the all concentration observations in validation period in addition the observation points closer to the source zone have narrower predictive intervals which shows the points far away from the source have larger predictive uncertainties the quantitative evaluation results of the nine kernels are listed in table 7 according to the two evaluations mean and optimal rq has the best predictive performance of solute transport and the combined kernels se rq s and mt rq s also obtain good predictive performances among these nine kernels specifically rq has the best performance in all evaluations except that se rq s obtains the smallest mae and mre in the evaluations of mean and optimal respectively the combinations of se and mt obtain the poor performances in solute transport predictions among these kernels similar to the above groundwater drawdown case the additive combined kernels slightly outperform the multiplied ones at solute concentration prediction 5 3 the polystyrene nanoplastics transport prediction in fig 6 the 95 credible intervals of the predictions of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps concentrations are presented for the nine kernels the black dots are the observations used for calibration and the blue ones are for validation all the observations are contained in the 95 credible intervals for these nine kernels generally the ranges of 95 credible intervals obtained by the single kernels are narrower than those by the combined ones and the combination of se and mt kernels have wider credible intervals than the other five combined kernels the four metrics used to quantify the predictive performances of these kernels are listed in table 8 it is outstanding that all kernels perform well in psnps concentration predictions as shown by the small values of mae and rmse however we can find that there is an apparently difference between the predictive performances of well performed and poorly performed kernels e g rq and se mt p consist with the above two groundwater cases rq kernel has the best performance of psnps concentration prediction and the combined kernels se rq s and mt rq s also have acceptable predictive performances among these nine kernels specifically rq obtains the best performance in all evaluations except that mt rq s obtains the smallest mre and rmse in the evaluations of optimal and mean respectively moreover se mt p has the poor performance and the additive kernels obtain a relatively better performance than the multiplied ones 6 discussion in order to highlight the improvement of model predictions using gpr we compare the predictions without gpr and with the best performing gpr i e rq kernel for the three case studies respectively the results can be found from figs 7 9 it is clear that for all case studies the groundwater predictions could be improved significantly by using gpr the groundwater predictions e g groundwater drawdowns solute concentrations and psnps concentrations by using gpr have significantly higher posterior densities and smaller prediction deviations than those without gpr moreover the superiority of gpr in improving groundwater model prediction have been well demonstrated by the researches of xu and valocchi 2015 pan et al 2020 etc based on the results of three groundwater case studies i e the groundwater drawdown prediction solute transport prediction and psnps transport prediction it is clear that kernel function has a non negligible impact on the ability of gpr to describe systematic prediction error moreover among the nine kernels considered the performance of the commonly used kernel se is mediocre in predicting groundwater drawdown or concentration this is because se kernel function is infinitely differentiable the strong assumption of smoothness may be unrealistic and inaccurate at describing the groundwater systematic error the single kernel rq has the best predictive performance among the nine kernels for the three groundwater cases this is because the hyperparameter αr in the rq kernel behaves like a scale mixture of se with different relative characteristic length scales rq kernel can be seen as the sum up of a series of se with different relative characteristic length scales which describe different scales of local input output correlation thus rq can describe both the local features and the global features of input output correlation well david et al 2013 the two hyperparameters αr and λr describe the correlations of the input output data with different characteristic length scales allowing for more flexibility in describing the complex model system error the single kernel mt does not perform very well in predicting groundwater flow and solute transport mt kernel is k times k 2 in this study square differentiable as the smoothing parameters v k v 5 2 in this study according to chen et al 2014 mt kernel can describe a more obvious local feature of input output correlation compared with se kernel due to it contains a modified bessel function of the second kind bessel function is the solution of bessel equation bessel 1825 it behaves like a decaying sine or cosine function indicating a well description of the local relationships between data arfken and weber 2001 hence the mt kernel based gpr is good at capturing local smoothness of the data chen et al 2014 the common performance of mt kernel indicate that the strong ability of local correlation description is inadequate to capture the complex groundwater models systematic errors the predictive performance of the combined kernels shows that the additive combinations obtain higher accuracy in groundwater predictions than those by the multiplied combinations the sum of two kernels can be treated as two independent kernels describing a set of data separately and the product of two kernels can be seen as a modification of one kernel by the other david et al 2013 james et al 2014 thus the additive combinations of single kernels show the higher flexibility in building the complementary model to capture the system error of groundwater predictions in addition although the combined kernels have higher flexibility in learning systematic error than the single kernels the double hyperparameters would apparently increase parameter uncertainty in model prediction especially for the validation period and that s why the combined kernels do not obtain the best performance in groundwater prediction for the three case studies according to the quantitative evaluations of the predictive performances of gpr kernels tables 6 8 several well performed kernels e g rq mt rq s se rq s have similar predictive performances e g mae mre and rmse however the differences between the well performed and poorly performed kernels e g rq and se mt p are relatively significant especially when using the metric of log score to compare their predictive performances the definition of hyperparameters prior distribution has a significant influence on the calibration of the gpr based complementary model chen and wang 2018 for se and mt kernels they have four hyperparameters μ σ σs or σm σr λ λs or λm λr σε and rq kernel has one more hyperparameter αr the hyperparameter μ indicates the expectation of systematical prediction error in some studies the mean function μ is assumed as zero offset however the zero mean assumption maybe not reasonable for the groundwater model with unknown systematic error which may result in inaccurate and unreliable complementary model in data driven methods ddm the hyperparameter σ can be considered as the scale amplitude of systematic prediction error roberts et al 2013 σ indicates that systematic error would vary in the range μ 2σ in this work we roughly estimate the prior ranges of μ and σ by comparing observations and the outputs of physical based groundwater model the hyperparameter λ represents the relative characteristic length scale of input data it determines the smoothness of the complementary model the higher λ indicates a smoother relationship between the inputs and outputs if λ has a small value the outputs of complementary model could be significantly different even if the inputs are close to each other roberts et al 2013 generally the lower bound of the prior range of λ is larger than 0 and upper bound is smaller than 3 brynjarsdottir and o hagan 2014 xu and valocchi 2015 moreover it is generally assumed that measurement error obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and diagonal covariance matrix hyperparameter σε 2 represents the variance of measurement error in this work we assume that σε 2 is smaller than 1 of the observed data except for the three hyperparameters in se and mt rq kernel has one more positive valued scale mixture parameter αr rq kernel can be considered as an infinite sum of se kernel with different relative scales when αr tends to be infinite rq kernel gradually degenerates into se kernel with scale λ rasmussen and williams 2006 thus the value of αr should not be set too large according to the work of roberts et al 2013 we set the prior of αr as 0 05 1 5 in this work in addition the mass balance of the combination of gpr and groundwater flow and solute or psnps transport model is not enforced during the mcmc simulation in this study the predictions are produced by summing physical model the systematic error model and residual error the physical model i e the groundwater model follows mass balance equations and the residual always obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean however the systematic error model built by machine learning methods do not always satisfy the mass balance condition possession of constrained prior gpr information brynjarsdottir and o hagan 2014 or the recalibration strategy xu and valocchi 2015 could be beneficial to improve the predictive performances for model predictions and these will be the focus of our future work 7 conclusion the systematic model error gravely impairs the reliability of groundwater prediction and decision making based on this gpr is used to build a statistical complementary model to correct systematic prediction error and improve groundwater model prediction in order to evaluate the influence of gpr kernel on capturing systematic error we compared the performances of gpr with nine kernels in groundwater model predictions these kernels include the three commonly used single kernels i e se mt and rq and six new kernels formed by combining these single kernels three groundwater cases are used to evaluate these kennels a groundwater drawdown model a solute transport model and a psnps black soil column transport model whose systematic model error is caused by the unreasonable simplification of aquifer s distribution and or chemical reaction these gpr kernels are evaluated based on their corresponding performances in predicting groundwater observations validation period and four metrics are applied to measure their predictive performances the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 kernel functions have apparent influence on the ability of the gpr based complementary model to capture the systematic prediction error of groundwater model and the gpr with different kernels has different performances in groundwater prediction 2 the single kernel rq based gpr yields the best ability in describing the systematic prediction error of groundwater models which has the best performance in groundwater predictions among the nine kernels for all case studies 3 the combined kernels mt rq s se

4011,systematic model error is caused by the unreasonable simplification of real groundwater system which damages the reliability of groundwater model prediction gaussian process regression gpr is a popular data driven method used to build a statistical complementary model to correct systematic prediction error and improve model prediction kernel function is a crucial component of gpr it represents the assumptions on systematic prediction error that we want to learn in order to evaluate the influence of gpr kernel on capturing systematic prediction error we compared the performances of gpr with nine kernels in groundwater predictions these kernels include three commonly used single kernels i e squared exponential se matérn class mt and rational quadratic rq kernels and six new kernels formed by combining these single kernels as sum or product of pairs se mt s se rq s mt rq s se mt p se rq p and mt rq p moreover three groundwater case studies including two analytical cases and one real case are used to test these kernels and four metrics are applied to measure the performances of these kernels the evaluation results show that kernel functions have apparent influence on the ability of the gpr based complementary model to capture the systematic prediction error of groundwater model the single kernel rq based gpr yields the best performance in improving groundwater predictions among the nine kernels for all case studies the combined kernels mt rq s se rq s also perform well in groundwater predictions and the commonly used se kernel has mediocre performance in predicting groundwater observations keywords groundwater model systematic error gaussian process regression kernel function prediction 1 introduction numerical models have become indispensable in the study of many groundwater issues e g groundwater resources evaluation groundwater contamination risk assessment and remediation karatzas 2017 white 2017 building a reliable groundwater model is crucial for decision makers in practice the limited observation information on groundwater flow and aquifer s lithology distribution leads to both random and systematic model error which results in the systematic error in groundwater model prediction this is particularly true when the model is designed to simulate complex hydrogeological conditions for forecasting or extrapolation purposes delottier et al 2017 mustafa et al 2018 the systematic prediction error arises from three aspects model parameter model structure and observation gupta et al 2012 dean et al 2020 parameter calibration has been well studied by the groundwater hydrology community and some general methods are currently available such as the least square methods lsm hill and tiedeman 2007 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 hassan et al 2008 and formal bayesian methods vrugt et al 2009a the observation error is always quantified using residual analysis the residual is assumed to be either a simple function e g an uncorrelated gaussian distribution demissie et al 2009 or a complex function e g a correlated heteroscedastic non gaussian function schoups and vrugt 2010 smith et al 2010 finsterle and zhang 2011 model structure error is one of the important sources of systematic prediction error these is a consensus that model structure error can t be well compensated by parameter calibration doherty and welter 2010 xu and valocchi 2015 multi model framework is first used to address groundwater model structure uncertainty by building a set of plausible models that have different conceptualizations of hydrogeological conditions then this unknown system is represented by the optimal ensemble of these alternative models the commonly used multi model methods include bayesian model selection raftery 1995 pande 2013a 2013b bayesian model averaging draper 1997 and bayesian model combination monteith et al 2011 these methods incorporate the study area s prior information to quantify model structure uncertainty through bayesian theory höge et al 2019 however the reliability of multi model methods is compromised in practical implementations due to difficulties in defining model space alternative models and prior weights and estimating posterior model weights or marginal likelihood which limit the widespread use of the multi model methods enemark et al 2019 parasuraman and elshorbagy 2008 developed an ensemble based genetic programming framework to explore the model space using a large number of competing models this method provides a feasible way to build model space the systematic prediction error may contain some useful information about the physical process which is missed in the conceptualization of model demissie et al 2009 based on this idea the data driven methods ddm are recently introduced to process systematic prediction error through complementary modeling approach pianosi and raso 2012 marker et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 kasiviswanathan et al 2019 ddm does not quantify model structure uncertainty a statistical model is used to describe the systematic prediction error and then the model outputs or predictions are represented by the sum of the physical model the statistical model and the observation error model demissie et al 2009 investigated the potential of complementary modeling approach in predicting groundwater head and the results demonstrated that this approach could lead to apparent improvement in prediction e g up to 64 reduction in root mean square error rmse gaussian process regression gpr is a popular machine learning technique with excellent flexibility and convenience that has been widely used for the complementary modeling of groundwater hydrology models xu and valocchi 2015 xu et al 2017 lal and datta 2018 roshni et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 combined gpr and the ensemble kalman filter to solve the systematic model error inherent in using soil layer conceptualization to model dynamical soil moisture they found that gpr significantly reduces parameter compensation issues lal and datta 2018 applied gpr to predict the salinity concentrations in a coastal aquifer system under uncertain groundwater pumping conditions they found that the predictions with gpr are more accurate than those using genetic programming roshni et al 2019 compared several machine learning techniques in predicting sea level under climate change uncertainty and the results demonstrated that gpr has the best performance among these techniques gpr is one of the nonparametric kernel based learning algorithms developed from the bayesian linear regression model it assumes that the learning samples follow the gaussian process prior probability and then infers the corresponding posterior probability using the bayes theorem the gaussian process is uniquely defined by a mean function μ and a covariance function c i e the systematic prediction error obeys a gaussian distribution n μ c the covariance function c is also known as the kernel function the kernel function is a crucial component of gpr because it represents the assumptions on the object e g systematic prediction error that we wish to learn specifically the kernel function defines the closeness and similarity among the samples under the assumption that close input data will probably result in close output data rasmussen and williams 2006 chen and wang 2018 therefore kernel function determines gpr s performance in handling systematic prediction error the squared exponential se function is the most widely used kernel function in gpr xu et al 2017 shuang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the se kernel function is infinitely differentiable which means that the gaussian process with se kernel has mean square derivatives of all orders and thus this gpr is very smooth however the strong assumption of se kernel smoothness may be unreasonable for complex systematic prediction error there are other types of kernel functions that can be used in gpr e g the matérn class mt of kernel functions sun et al 2014 and the rational quadratic rq reggente et al 2014 mt is characterized by the positive smoothing parameter ν which controls the gliding property of gpr the mt kernel is k times differentiable as ν k if ν tends to infinity mt converges to se rq is characterized by a positive valued scale mixture parameter α it is infinitely mean square differentiable for each α if α tends to infinity the rq kernel converges to the se kernel with a characteristic length scale pandit and infield 2019 applied gpr to predict a wind turbine power curve and four kernels including se mt and rq were tested they found that the predictions using mt kernel with ν 5 2 had a lower root mean square error as well as a higher coefficient of determination than those obtained using se predictions with the rq kernel were similar in accuracy to those obtained using se but a triple training time was required generally a real groundwater system has complex aquifer structures and strong spatial variability of parameters that may lead to a highly nonlinear systematic prediction error it may be difficult to accurately describe the unknown and complex systematic prediction error using a single kernel function combining or modifying the available kernel functions to form new ones is a feasible way to address this difficulty this is because the combined kernels with multiple features are more flexible and can handle the complex systematic prediction error more accurately david et al 2013 according to rasmussen and williams 2006 the sum or product of two kernels is also a kernel denniston et al 2018 constructed an additive mt kernel from two single mt kernels whose ν were 3 2 and 5 2 and then used this new kernel to build models for mapping the sea floor from complicated seabed data the results showed that this combined mt kernel outperforms the single kernels e g se mt in mapping the sea floor longman et al 2018 built a new kernel by forming the product of an intrinsically sparse kernel and an rq kernel and then modeled oil spills using a synthetic aperture radar satellite system in this paper nine kernels including three traditional single kernels se mt and rq kernels and six new combined kernels i e the sum or product of two single kernels were used in three groundwater case studies two analytical and one real to capture the systematic prediction error and improve groundwater predictions after that four metrics the mean absolute error mae the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and log score were used to evaluate the performances of these kernels the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the framework of gpr and define the nine kernels and four evaluation metrics in section 3 the three groundwater cases are described in section 4 the application of the methods is described the results of the three groundwater case studies are presented in section 5 section 6 contains the discussion and section 7 is the conclusion 2 methods 2 1 bayesian inference the observation data d is defined as the sum of the groundwater model output m ϑ observation error ε and systematic prediction error f which can be described as kennedy and o hagan 2001 1 d m ϑ f y ϕ ε where ϑ is groundwater model parameters f is the complementary model which represents systematic prediction error y represents the input of model f e g the time location and other relevant information ϕ are the tuning parameters hyperparameters and ε represents the observation error based on bayesian inference the physical parameter ϑ and gpr hyperparameter ϕ are jointly calibrated the prior distribution p ϑ ϕ is specified as the product of p ϑ and p ϕ which are assumed to be independent the posterior distribution p ϑ ϕ d is described as xu et al 2017 2 p ϑ ϕ d p d ϑ ϕ p ϑ p ϕ where p ϑ and p ϕ represent the prior distributions of ϑ and ϕ respectively the priors are commonly specified by experts or via pilot experiments p d ϑ ϕ is the likelihood function generally it is impossible to derive an analytical expression for posterior distributions due to the complexity of likelihood function mcmc method provides an effective way to obtain the posterior distributions via an evolving markov chain mcmc simulation incorporates observation information to search the parameter space and evolve the markov chain from prior distributions to posterior distributions the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs algorithm which has been implemented to calibrate the model parameters in many high dimensional and complex groundwater cases eric and laloy 2012 wöhling et al 2012 hernández and francés 2015 zhang et al 2018 is applied to perform mcmc simulation in this work more details about the dreamzs algorithm can be found in laloy and vrugt 2012 and vrugt et al 2009b commonly the logarithmic form of gaussian likelihood function is applied in mcmc simulation which is defined as hoeting et al 1999 3 log p d ϑ ϕ 1 2 d m ϑ μ t c 1 d m ϑ μ 1 2 log c n 2 log 2 π where n is the number of observed data μ is the mean of systematic prediction error and c is the error covariance matrix the details of μ and c are presented in section 2 2 2 2 gaussian process regression gpr is used to build the complementary model f y ϕ in equation 1 the f assumes that the prior distribution obeys a multivariate gaussian distribution n μ c a mean function μ μ y e f y and a covariance function c determined by a kernel function k y y e f y μ y f y μ y specify the gaussian process the hyperparameters ϕ contain the mean parameter μ and covariance parameters described in section 2 3 based on the mcmc simulation the posterior samples of ϑ and ϕ are generated from the markov chains for a new input y the predictions of m and f can be obtained where the asterisk denotes predictions the probability distribution of f obeys the gaussian distribution n f c y f xu et al 2017 where 4 f e f d m ϑ ϕ μ c t c 1 d m ϑ μ 5 c f f c c t c 1 c μ represents the prior mean μ y c represents the prior covariance matrix which is calculated as c i j k yi yj and c is calculated as c i j k yi yj hence the predicted output at y can be written as 6 s m f ε the steps of integrating gpr into mcmc simulation are summarized in fig 1 2 3 kernel functions the kernel function is used to define the covariance c of the complementary model f y ϕ in this study three commonly used single kernel functions i e se mt and rq and their combinations are used and tested the se kernel is defined as rasmussen and williams 2006 7 k se y i y j σ s 2 exp y i y j t y i y j λ s 2 σ ε 2 x i j 1 2 n where σs λs and σε are three hyperparameters σs 2 controls the marginal variance of f y and is referred to as variance parameter λs is the relative characteristic length scale and σε 2 represents the measurement error χ is the indicator function and χ 1 when i j otherwise χ 0 n is the number of observed data the mt kernel is named by stein 1999 after the work of matérn 1986 it can be written as 8 k mt y i y j σ m 2 exp 2 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m γ p 1 γ 2 p 1 l 0 p p l l p l 8 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m p l σ ε 2 x i j 1 2 n where υ is a chosen parameter that equals p 1 2 the definition of σm and λm are similar to those of σs and λs γ is the gamma function the mt kernel is characterized by the parameter υ according to rasmussen and williams 2006 we set υ 5 2 i e p 2 in this work the rq kernel can be treated as a scale mixture of se kernels with the different characteristic length scales rasmussen and williams 2006 9 k rq y i y j σ r 2 1 y i y j t y i y j 2 α r λ r 2 α r σ ε 2 x i j 1 2 n the hyperparameters σr λr and σε are similar to those in the definition of se and mt rq has a positive valued scale mixture parameter αr that can determine the relative weighting of large scale and small scale variances rq kernel is equivalent to a scale mixture of se kernels with different relative characteristic length scales roberts et al 2013 thus compared with the se kernel rq seems to fit data with different length scales more flexible the combined kernel functions used in this study consist of the sum or product of three pairs of single kernels the combined kernel functions are the sum of se and mt se mt s the sum of se and rq se rq s the sum of mt and rq mt rq s the product of se and mt se mt p the product of se and rq se rq p and the product of mt and rq mt rq p they can be defined as follows rasmussen and williams 2006 10 k se mt s y i y j σ s 2 exp y i y j t y i y j λ s 2 σ m 2 exp 2 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m γ p 1 γ 2 p 1 l 0 p p l l p l 8 υ y i y j t y i y j λ m p l σ

kernel functions the gpr with different kernel functions are used to capture the systematic prediction error for each groundwater case the kernel function s performance is evaluated by comparing the predictions with validation observations that are not used for calibration process four metrics are used in this study mae mre rmse and log score the metrics are defined below 16 mae 1 n i 1 n s i d i 17 mre 1 n i 1 n s i d i d 18 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i d i 2 19 log score i 1 n log p d i d where n is the number of observations si and di represent the simulated predictions and observations in validation period respectively the average of the observations is denoted by d p di d is the predictive probability of di i 1 n under calibration data d the better performance of the predictions can be recognized by the lower value of mae mre rmse and log score for the calculation of mae mre and rmse the mean values of the predictive distributions and the predictions corresponding to the parameters with the maximum posterior density are used to represent the si in this study respectively 3 description of the three groundwater model cases three groundwater model cases are used to evaluate the performances of these nine kernel functions in terms of their ability to improve prediction the first case is an analytical groundwater drawdown model of a partially penetrated well in a leaky aquifer the second case is an analytical solute transport model with nonequilibrium sorption the third case is a polystyrene nanoplastics psnps black soil column transport experiment which is simulated by a numerical transport model 3 1 groundwater drawdown model the drawdown caused by pumping through a partially penetrating well in a leaky aquifer is measured by a piezometer the initial and boundary

screen d m represents the depth from the top of the aquifer to the top of the well screen kz m d denotes vertical hydraulic conductivity the parameters used in this case study are listed in table 1 the drawdowns at the observation wells after pumping for eight days are used as observation data the r and z of the different wells vary as shown in fig 2 b the observations are divided into two parts model calibration represented by the black dots and model validation represented by the blue dots fig 2 b shows the details of the observations points in practice it is difficult to characterize the structure of aquifer accurately due to the limited availability of information in this case study a defective pumping drawdown model in which the leaky aquifer is neglected is used to perform the model calibration and validation the defective drawdown model with the initial and boundary conditions can be described as hantush 1961b 22 k r 2 s r 2 1 r s r k z 2 s z 2 μ s t s r z 0 0 s z t 0 s z

in groundwater always involves complex biochemical reaction processes here we consider a one dimensional convective dispersive solute transport problem with nonequilibrium sorption and degradation in the uniform flow condition the transport model with the initial and boundary conditions can be formulated as 24 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x μ c γ c x 0 c i d c x v c x 0 v c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 c x t 0 where

located five meters apart in the region defined by 5 m to 255 m and the observations are taken once a day for the first ten days the black dots in fig 3 b represent the observations used for model calibration and the blue ones represent the data used for model validation the details of observation points are presented in fig 3 b it is common practice to simplify the model of solute transport process by making certain assumptions allowing one to simplify the equations describing its complex biochemical reactions here we use a simplified linear sorption model to represent the solute

the psnps transport experiment can be divided into two stages first three pore volumes of a psnps suspension solution are pumped into the column next three pore volumes of a psnps free background solution are pumped into the column the concentrations of psnps are measured at 3 7 11 15 147 min 37 observations the first 26 observations are used to calibrate the psnps transport model while the remaining 11 are used for model validation because the colloidal mobility and surface area to volume ratio of nanoplastic particles are high and they have a strong adsorption affinity for contaminants psnps can act as contaminant carriers to facilitate their transport currently it is difficult to accurately describe the complex kinetic processes of psnps transport in groundwater here the first order irreversible kinetic reaction function is applied to simulate the psnps absorption desorption process 32 ρ b c s t β c c s k d where ρb g cm3 represents the bulk density cs g cm3 represents the sorbed concentration β min represents the first order mass transfer rate between the dissolved and sorbed phases c g cm3 represents the dissolved concentration and kd represents the dissolved coefficient for the sorbed phase in this case study the systematic model error is introduced by using the first order irreversible kinetic function to describe the chemical reactions and assuming the sand column is uniformly packed the psnps transport model is numerical solved by using modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 4 application of the methods gpr with different kernel functions are used to handle the systematic prediction error in the three groundwater cases and these nine kernel functions including se mt rq se mt s se mt p se rq s se rq p mt rq s and mt rq p are evaluated by their efficacy in groundwater predictions mcmc simulation is used to jointly calibrate groundwater model parameters and hyperparameters the details of the mcmc simulation for the three cases are presented below 4 1 gpr for the groundwater drawdown prediction by looking at equations 20 and 21 one observes that the systematic model error lies in neglecting the leakage flow in the aquifer using nine kernel functions gpr is used to build the complementary model statistically in this case study after that this simplified groundwater model and gpr are combined to perform the model calibration and validation based on mcmc simulation three groundwater model parameters i e the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kr the thickness of aquifer m and the storage coefficient μ s are assumed as random variables moreover the hyperparameters of gpr are also treated as random variables the prior information about these random variables is defined in table 3 and their posterior distributions are calibrated through mcmc simulation the dreamzs algorithm is used to search for the probability space of the parameters in mcmc simulation we set three parallel chains with a burn in period of 6 000 iterations for each chain the after burn in period has the same iteration length as the burn in period does the total number of observations is 100 of which 72 are used in this mcmc simulation and the remaining 28 are used to validate the predictions as presented in fig 2 b 4 2 gpr for the solute transport prediction the systematic model error of the solute transport model is introduced by assuming that the adsorption isotherm is linear and that there are no degradation or production processes equations 29 to 31 similar to section 4 1 the gpr with different kernel functions are used to build the complementary model which is then combined with groundwater model to perform model prediction based on mcmc simulation three groundwater model parameters are set to random variables the solution concentration at the boundary condition c 0 the pore water velocity v and the dispersion coefficient d moreover the hyperparameters of kernels in gpr are also treated as random variables the prior information about the groundwater model parameters and gpr hyperparameters is displayed in table 4 their posterior distributions are generated by mcmc simulations the setup of the mcmc simulation is the same as that described in section 4 1 there are 260 observation data in this case 188 of them are used in this mcmc simulation i e model calibration and 72 of them are used for validation as shown in fig 3 b the model s predictive performance is evaluated by comparing predictions with the validation data 4 3 gpr for the polystyrene nanoplastics transport prediction the systematic model error of psnps transport model is introduced by simplifying the chemical reactions that take place in column experiment as well as porous media s heterogeneity as described in section 4 1 and 4 2 mcmc is used to calibrate the complementary model and groundwater model four groundwater model parameters i e the partition coefficient kd the first order mass transfer rate coefficient β the hydraulic conductivity k the dispersion α and the hyperparameters of gpr are set as random variables the prior information about these parameters is listed in table 5 three markov chains are used in the mcmc simulation the burn in period is 9 000 iterations for each chain as is the after burn in period the groundwater model parameters and the hyperparameters are calibrated by using the 26 concentration observations and then the model predictions are validated through the 11 observations 5 results based on the three groundwater model cases we evaluate the ability of nine gpr kernels to capture the systematic prediction error four metrics described in section 2 4 are used to evaluate the performances of these kernels quantitatively by comparing model predictions with observations in validation period in addition the calibrated posterior distributions of parameters for the three case studies are presented in supplementary material 5 1 the groundwater drawdown prediction the groundwater drawdown predictions are calculated by the posterior distributions of parameters using equation 24 we choose three typical observation points to display the predictive performance of different gpr kernels as shown in fig 4 the prediction distributions with the single kernel rq and the combined kernels mt rq s and mt rq p are more concentrated and have higher probability densities at the observations the prediction obtained using the se kernel has mediocre probability densities at the true values the four metrics mae mre rmse and log score are used to measure the predictive performances of gpr kernels for all observations in validation period as shown in table 6 two types of prediction data are used to calculate the first three metrics respectively including the mean values of posterior predictive distributions and the predictions corresponding to the parameters with the maximum posterior density and these two evaluations are denoted as mean and optimal respectively in table 6 the same as in tables 7 and 8 the lower metrics indicate the better performance of predictions we can find that the evaluations of mean and optimal are similar for these kernels moreover it is easy to see that the commonly used se kernel does not perform best among these nine kernels rq kernel has the best performance in predicting groundwater drawdown because it obtains the lowest mae mre rmse and log score for the six combined kernels the combinations of mt and rq obtain good performance of groundwater drawdown predictions while the combinations of se and mt perform poorly in prediction moreover the additive ones generally outperform the multiplied ones 5 2 the solute transport prediction based on the obtained posterior parameters samples the predictions of the solute concentration are generated by combining the solute transport model and gpr the mean value and 95 credible interval of the posterior predictions are used to validate the performances of the nine kernels fig 5 a total of 72 observations are used for model validation they are located within 145 m to 255 m at the intervals of 10 m at one day intervals between day 5 and day 10 as shown in fig 3 b due to space limitations the observation series at three locations are shown here and a locally enlarged plot is used to highlight the differences between predictions and observations for each kernel it is clear that the basic characteristics of observation series can be well captured by these kernels and most observations fall within the 95 credible intervals except that the observations at day 5 and day 6 are not well predicted for most kernels among these nine kernels the 95 credible intervals of rq has the highest inclusion rate approximately 95 to the all concentration observations in validation period in addition the observation points closer to the source zone have narrower predictive intervals which shows the points far away from the source have larger predictive uncertainties the quantitative evaluation results of the nine kernels are listed in table 7 according to the two evaluations mean and optimal rq has the best predictive performance of solute transport and the combined kernels se rq s and mt rq s also obtain good predictive performances among these nine kernels specifically rq has the best performance in all evaluations except that se rq s obtains the smallest mae and mre in the evaluations of mean and optimal respectively the combinations of se and mt obtain the poor performances in solute transport predictions among these kernels similar to the above groundwater drawdown case the additive combined kernels slightly outperform the multiplied ones at solute concentration prediction 5 3 the polystyrene nanoplastics transport prediction in fig 6 the 95 credible intervals of the predictions of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps concentrations are presented for the nine kernels the black dots are the observations used for calibration and the blue ones are for validation all the observations are contained in the 95 credible intervals for these nine kernels generally the ranges of 95 credible intervals obtained by the single kernels are narrower than those by the combined ones and the combination of se and mt kernels have wider credible intervals than the other five combined kernels the four metrics used to quantify the predictive performances of these kernels are listed in table 8 it is outstanding that all kernels perform well in psnps concentration predictions as shown by the small values of mae and rmse however we can find that there is an apparently difference between the predictive performances of well performed and poorly performed kernels e g rq and se mt p consist with the above two groundwater cases rq kernel has the best performance of psnps concentration prediction and the combined kernels se rq s and mt rq s also have acceptable predictive performances among these nine kernels specifically rq obtains the best performance in all evaluations except that mt rq s obtains the smallest mre and rmse in the evaluations of optimal and mean respectively moreover se mt p has the poor performance and the additive kernels obtain a relatively better performance than the multiplied ones 6 discussion in order to highlight the improvement of model predictions using gpr we compare the predictions without gpr and with the best performing gpr i e rq kernel for the three case studies respectively the results can be found from figs 7 9 it is clear that for all case studies the groundwater predictions could be improved significantly by using gpr the groundwater predictions e g groundwater drawdowns solute concentrations and psnps concentrations by using gpr have significantly higher posterior densities and smaller prediction deviations than those without gpr moreover the superiority of gpr in improving groundwater model prediction have been well demonstrated by the researches of xu and valocchi 2015 pan et al 2020 etc based on the results of three groundwater case studies i e the groundwater drawdown prediction solute transport prediction and psnps transport prediction it is clear that kernel function has a non negligible impact on the ability of gpr to describe systematic prediction error moreover among the nine kernels considered the performance of the commonly used kernel se is mediocre in predicting groundwater drawdown or concentration this is because se kernel function is infinitely differentiable the strong assumption of smoothness may be unrealistic and inaccurate at describing the groundwater systematic error the single kernel rq has the best predictive performance among the nine kernels for the three groundwater cases this is because the hyperparameter αr in the rq kernel behaves like a scale mixture of se with different relative characteristic length scales rq kernel can be seen as the sum up of a series of se with different relative characteristic length scales which describe different scales of local input output correlation thus rq can describe both the local features and the global features of input output correlation well david et al 2013 the two hyperparameters αr and λr describe the correlations of the input output data with different characteristic length scales allowing for more flexibility in describing the complex model system error the single kernel mt does not perform very well in predicting groundwater flow and solute transport mt kernel is k times k 2 in this study square differentiable as the smoothing parameters v k v 5 2 in this study according to chen et al 2014 mt kernel can describe a more obvious local feature of input output correlation compared with se kernel due to it contains a modified bessel function of the second kind bessel function is the solution of bessel equation bessel 1825 it behaves like a decaying sine or cosine function indicating a well description of the local relationships between data arfken and weber 2001 hence the mt kernel based gpr is good at capturing local smoothness of the data chen et al 2014 the common performance of mt kernel indicate that the strong ability of local correlation description is inadequate to capture the complex groundwater models systematic errors the predictive performance of the combined kernels shows that the additive combinations obtain higher accuracy in groundwater predictions than those by the multiplied combinations the sum of two kernels can be treated as two independent kernels describing a set of data separately and the product of two kernels can be seen as a modification of one kernel by the other david et al 2013 james et al 2014 thus the additive combinations of single kernels show the higher flexibility in building the complementary model to capture the system error of groundwater predictions in addition although the combined kernels have higher flexibility in learning systematic error than the single kernels the double hyperparameters would apparently increase parameter uncertainty in model prediction especially for the validation period and that s why the combined kernels do not obtain the best performance in groundwater prediction for the three case studies according to the quantitative evaluations of the predictive performances of gpr kernels tables 6 8 several well performed kernels e g rq mt rq s se rq s have similar predictive performances e g mae mre and rmse however the differences between the well performed and poorly performed kernels e g rq and se mt p are relatively significant especially when using the metric of log score to compare their predictive performances the definition of hyperparameters prior distribution has a significant influence on the calibration of the gpr based complementary model chen and wang 2018 for se and mt kernels they have four hyperparameters μ σ σs or σm σr λ λs or λm λr σε and rq kernel has one more hyperparameter αr the hyperparameter μ indicates the expectation of systematical prediction error in some studies the mean function μ is assumed as zero offset however the zero mean assumption maybe not reasonable for the groundwater model with unknown systematic error which may result in inaccurate and unreliable complementary model in data driven methods ddm the hyperparameter σ can be considered as the scale amplitude of systematic prediction error roberts et al 2013 σ indicates that systematic error would vary in the range μ 2σ in this work we roughly estimate the prior ranges of μ and σ by comparing observations and the outputs of physical based groundwater model the hyperparameter λ represents the relative characteristic length scale of input data it determines the smoothness of the complementary model the higher λ indicates a smoother relationship between the inputs and outputs if λ has a small value the outputs of complementary model could be significantly different even if the inputs are close to each other roberts et al 2013 generally the lower bound of the prior range of λ is larger than 0 and upper bound is smaller than 3 brynjarsdottir and o hagan 2014 xu and valocchi 2015 moreover it is generally assumed that measurement error obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and diagonal covariance matrix hyperparameter σε 2 represents the variance of measurement error in this work we assume that σε 2 is smaller than 1 of the observed data except for the three hyperparameters in se and mt rq kernel has one more positive valued scale mixture parameter αr rq kernel can be considered as an infinite sum of se kernel with different relative scales when αr tends to be infinite rq kernel gradually degenerates into se kernel with scale λ rasmussen and williams 2006 thus the value of αr should not be set too large according to the work of roberts et al 2013 we set the prior of αr as 0 05 1 5 in this work in addition the mass balance of the combination of gpr and groundwater flow and solute or psnps transport model is not enforced during the mcmc simulation in this study the predictions are produced by summing physical model the systematic error model and residual error the physical model i e the groundwater model follows mass balance equations and the residual always obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean however the systematic error model built by machine learning methods do not always satisfy the mass balance condition possession of constrained prior gpr information brynjarsdottir and o hagan 2014 or the recalibration strategy xu and valocchi 2015 could be beneficial to improve the predictive performances for model predictions and these will be the focus of our future work 7 conclusion the systematic model error gravely impairs the reliability of groundwater prediction and decision making based on this gpr is used to build a statistical complementary model to correct systematic prediction error and improve groundwater model prediction in order to evaluate the influence of gpr kernel on capturing systematic error we compared the performances of gpr with nine kernels in groundwater model predictions these kernels include the three commonly used single kernels i e se mt and rq and six new kernels formed by combining these single kernels three groundwater cases are used to evaluate these kennels a groundwater drawdown model a solute transport model and a psnps black soil column transport model whose systematic model error is caused by the unreasonable simplification of aquifer s distribution and or chemical reaction these gpr kernels are evaluated based on their corresponding performances in predicting groundwater observations validation period and four metrics are applied to measure their predictive performances the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 kernel functions have apparent influence on the ability of the gpr based complementary model to capture the systematic prediction error of groundwater model and the gpr with different kernels has different performances in groundwater prediction 2 the single kernel rq based gpr yields the best ability in describing the systematic prediction error of groundwater models which has the best performance in groundwater predictions among the nine kernels for all case studies 3 the combined kernels mt rq s se rq s also perform well in groundwater prediction and the commonly used se kernel has mediocre performance in predicting groundwater observations declaration of competing interest the authors declare

4012,streamflow and baseflow dynamics are driven by complex interconnected catchment properties a national study was conducted to assess the relationship between surface flow climate and intrinsic catchment attributes in australia subcatchments were delineated based on horton s 5th stream order and were characterised by identifying parameters that influence streamflow and flood behaviour because observational datasets like rainfall and streamflow commonly have a non normal distribution the method of l moments was applied to several time series surface hydrology and baseflow patterns were represented by twenty indices which were statistically summarised via principal component pc analysis yielding six pcs forty catchment descriptors from the themes of climate topography surface condition and hydrogeology were used to investigate their link with runoff patterns among these is the land surface value a newly defined index incorporating soil properties and land use to estimate the capacity for water infiltration all metrics were explored via correlation and regression analysis against the surface hydrology pcs and their influence on runoff discussed the predictive skill of the regression models is improved when non perennial waterways are excluded although rainfall characteristics dominate streamflow behaviour topographical and surface conditions also greatly impact on runoff especially during low flow periods keywords climate variability non perennial streams surface hydrology topography soil field capacity water infiltration 1 introduction streamflow behaviour and associated flood risk are influenced by a multitude of competing factors both extrinsic e g climate and intrinsic e g geology soil topography land use and size on a global scale beck et al 2015 indicated that climate related variables exhibited the strongest links to streamflow properties conversely finer scale studies suggested more nuanced links highlighting the influence of soils trancoso et al 2017 zimmer and gannon 2018 and topography karlsen et al 2019 further although precipitation patterns dominate high flow events carlier et al 2018 demonstrated the importance of geology in attenuating flow volumes by modifying subsurface water storage and consequently the flow duration curve ultimately also affecting baseflow properties similarly lacey and grayson 1998 determined a strong link between baseflow and both geology and vegetation whereas topographical features were deemed irrelevant despite the complex influence of inherent catchment attributes on low flows climate associated characteristics such as rainfall and humidity still tend to explain a large proportion of baseflow variability and recession peña arancibia et al 2010 van dijk 2010 saft et al 2016 in turn emphasised that the partitioning of rainfall runoff does not remain stationary with the proportional runoff decreasing during drought periods catchments can be characterised by wide ranging combinations of attributes stein et al 2009 analysed australia s stream network based on 48 ecohydrological traits ranging from climate and water balance to topography substrate and vegetation kennard et al 2010b investigated 120 ecologically relevant metrics to assess flow regime types in australia trancoso et al 2017 explored 24 diverse biophysical properties to streamflow signatures in eastern australia emphasising the importance of soils on a regional scale in a regional study of three tropical catchments in northern australia erskine et al 2017 focussed on geomorphological attributes to classify rivers in subcatchments a new zealand article categorised rivers according to climate topography geology and land cover characteristics snelder and biggs 2002 in europe kuentz et al 2017 compared 16 flow signatures with 35 catchment descriptors identifying the primary importance of geology for baseflow and the controlling influence of topography on streamflow flashiness whereas countries like new zealand snelder and booker 2013 and the united kingdom national river flow archive dixon et al 2013 have relatively dense and more evenly distributed stream gauge networks australia s vast dry interior is scarcely monitored similarly rainfall data availability in australia is significantly biased towards populated regions with much higher observational network densities in the coastal southwest and southeastern regions of the country jaffrés et al 2018 variables with poor translational properties including catchment specific streamflow characteristics cannot be meaningfully applied to neighbouring drainage basins without extensive knowledge of relevant factors impacting on the attribute for instance rain shadows can produce vastly dissimilar runoff properties in two neighbouring catchments potentially compounded by differing geology and land surface features hence for large scale nationwide studies of streamflow traits reliance on alternative datasets is required albeit individually not fully representative of streamflow dynamics these datasets can in combination provide information about flow characteristics and associated exposure to extreme flow events the overarching aim of this study is to assess whether a set of catchment descriptors is sufficiently representative of surface flow characteristics to warrant its use in ungauged sites to fulfil this aim the objectives of this article entail 1 the derivation of forty metrics for every subcatchment throughout mainland australia and tasmania covering the themes of climate topography land surface condition and hydrogeology and 2 to analyse their relationship with twenty streamflow variables ranging from baseflow attributes to high flow properties at unregulated stream gauge sites across australia a description of each of the core datasets and any transposition or processing of data used is presented in section 2 the statistical results are summarised in section 3 whereas the relationship with aggregated streamflow properties is discussed in detail in section 4 several recommended avenues for future research are offered with the conclusions section 5 a more detailed explanation of statistical methods appendix a and soil classification appendix b is provided in the supplementary file 2 methods in the australian landscape land use soil characteristics and permeability strongly influence overland flow and are therefore included in this analysis for this study australian subcatchments were summarised by forty variables the parameters chosen cover five themes climate topography surface condition hydrogeology and surface hydrology each theme comprises several variables obtained from processing one or more datasets in contrast to some other studies e g merz and blöschl 2005 wagener et al 2004 metrics of geographic proximity were not considered this exclusion was rationalised to avoid unwarranted bias of similarity derived solely from proximity many australian catchments are ungauged especially in more remote regions therefore hydrological data were used independently to determine the relevance of selected catchment properties to streamflow response in ungauged drainage basins conventional use of statistical parameters is confounded by the non normal distribution of climate and hydrological data the method of l moments describes the shape of a probability distribution without assuming normality hosking and wallis 2005 l moments were developed as a form of distributional analysis specifically for hydrological investigations castellarin et al 2012 l moments provide a more realistic estimation of extreme values from climate and hydrological data more typical of the australian setting where extreme events and non normal data distributions are common rahman et al 2012 consequently l moments hosking and wallis 2005 were derived to summarise these data including rainfall evaporation mean sea level pressure mslp and streamflow variables for l moments l r 3 where r is the moment of interest l moment ratios τ r l r l 2 were also calculated a detailed description of the derivation method is available in appendix a 1 l moments are analogous to mean l 1 standard deviation sd l 2 skewness τ 3 kurtosis τ 4 and super skewness τ 5 henceforth l moment ratios τ 3 to τ 5 are also referred to as l moments for simplicity 2 1 surface hydrology streamflow data from hydrological stations were incorporated to investigate the relationship between the catchment variables and flow characteristics average daily flow volumes from the australian network of 4676 stream gauges were downloaded from the bureau of meteorology bom water data online wdo http www bom gov au waterdata website in july 2018 the network is heavily weighted towards well defined river networks in contrast some large regions with low annual rainfall totals e g the nullarbor plain and central australia have little to no data possibly owing to the perceived low risk of flooding to people and infrastructure further the wdo database does not contain all stations publicly available from the relevant regional department eighteen stations from the northern territory were missing from the wdo database at the time of data download even though those time series were available on the regional website https water nt gov au the quality of stream gauge data is highly varied and is dependent on numerous factors for the purpose of this study stations with long reliable data records that are minimally impacted by anthropogenic changes were targeted the bom has compiled two lists of stations deemed of superior quality the list of bom hydrologic reference stations hrs 31 august 2020 version http www bom gov au water hrs catalogues 467 stations with long data records 30 years located in unregulated catchments that underwent minimal land use change of these stations 460 are accessible from wdo table 1 a second more extensive register was compiled by the bom for modelling purposes to identify gauges with high quality data that cover at least ten years zhang et al 2013 similarly to the hrs selected sites were also characterised as unregulated and unimpaired limited irrigation and non intensive land use this dataset is henceforth referred to as the unregulated modelling stations ums of the 786 ums listed 714 were accessible from wdo table 1 in total 397 stations are contained in both hrs and the ums datasets a further 380 stations were contained only in hrs or the ums amounting to 777 stream gauges deemed of good quality wdo stations were removed if the length of their record was less than fifteen years or if they never recorded any flow records shorter than fifteen years are unlikely to include a large rainfall event significantly underestimating the potential for flooding kennard et al 2010a although more extensive time series are preferable to capture streamflow variability over longer timescales the application of a more stringent threshold would further reduce the already limited spatial spread of the dataset because of the relative brevity of historic data records at many sites of the 777 hrs and ums gauges 27 had less than 15 years of available data and were thus omitted from further analysis the remaining river gauging stations n 750 fig 1 were used in this study to derive twenty surface hydrology variables surface flow data were summarised by considering data distributions for different regions across australia for example flow data in queensland fig 1 are typically characterised by high flow including flood events followed by extended periods with little to zero flows conversely victorian sites tend to have consistent flows for most of the year with only occasional peaks in flow consequently a flow peak was defined as any event with a flow rate above the 80th percentile in australia non perennial streams are widespread with flows ceasing at times in approximately 70 of river channels busch et al 2020 vidal abarca et al 2020 many of these seasonally dry non perennial streams are classified as intermittent waterways fed by groundwater that permits more prolonged flows other non perennial channels are more ephemeral in nature only flowing briefly in direct and fast response to precipitation without connectivity to groundwater busch et al 2020 vidal abarca et al 2020 because of highly sporadic flow at many gauged sites twenty stations with a minimum record of 15 years returned 80th percentiles of 0 ml day hence every flow event contributed a flow peak for those stations for two peaks to be considered separate events the flow had to return to below the 80th percentile or to no flow if multiple peaks were registered within a 6 day window only the main peak was selected maximum and minimum recorded flow average peak value and average number of peaks in a year are among the variables derived from the hydrological data the 1st to 5th l moments of daily flow were also extracted the 5th l moment super skewness is potentially relevant in instances of extreme skewness for example in some regions of queensland many streams are without flows for most of the year and this pattern may be more noticeable in the 5th l moment the logarithmic log10 x 1 forms were also produced for variables with positively skewed distribution with the exception of 3rd to 5th l moments this equates to a total of twenty indices for surface hydrology table 2 2 2 hydrogeology this study used two hydrogeological types of variables as numerical inputs the first the dimensionless baseflow index bfi describes streamflow properties during low flow periods providing an estimate of water security the second subsurface permeability measures how well subsurface rocks within a catchment transmit water these two indices were chosen for their importance in controlling catchment flow behaviour and the relevance of the data obtainable from national datasets the inconsistency of data availability throughout australia restricted the use of other hydrogeology signatures e g seasonal water table fluctuation depth to water table or seasonal lag response to rainfall 2 2 1 baseflow index bfi baseflow is long term discharge to the river from natural storages including groundwater soil moisture or bank storage hill et al 2013 baseflow is best defined as the component of streamflow that is not allocated to quickflow e g overland runoff interflow and direct precipitation the bfi is the ratio of baseflow volume to total streamflow volume for a specified time period groundwater typically contributes the largest volume to baseflow bfi is therefore an indicator of stream reliance on groundwater input baseflow is recognised as an important component of the total flood hydrograph particularly in areas of high bfi and for smaller or frequent flood events hill et al 2013 this is especially applicable when catchments contain aquifers with high yield brown et al 2011 many methods for bfi derivation exist most of which involve analyses of hydrographs to separate the baseflow component for project 7 of the updated australian rainfall and runoff guidelines methods were developed to estimate bfi values for ungauged catchments from catchment characteristics such as geological conditions soil type climate and topography brown et al 2011 murphy et al 2011 those characteristics are used independently in the multivariate analysis of this study therefore the bfi is calculated from the hydrographs available streamflow data section 2 1 recursive digital filters are among the commonly applied approaches to derive baseflow characteristics singh et al 2019 su et al 2016 including the low pass filtering technique by lyne and hollick 1979 their popularity at least partially stems from their ease of automation and the reproducibility of results however the pertinence of the lyne hollick method is regionally dependent and may also vary for individual events kinkela and pearce 2014 quickflow and baseflow components of streamflow were separated from hydrograph data by applying the recursive digital filter method lyne and hollick 1979 f k a f k 1 1 a 2 y k y k 1 y k f k 0 where fk is the filtered quick response at the k th sampling instant yk is the original streamflow a is the filter parameter and yk fk is the filtered baseflow a filter value a of 0 98 was adopted following the recommendation by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and skm csiro and skm 2010 the filter was applied to the streamflow data three times 1 forward pass filtering yk original streamflow initial quickflow f1 set to zero 2 reverse pass filtering to nullify any phase distortion of the data because of the forward pass of the filter yk filtered baseflow derived in step 1 and 3 forward pass filtering for further flow separation yk filtered baseflow calculated in step 2 lyne and hollick 1979 short streamflow data gaps 7 days were filled via linear interpolation longer gaps were treated as breaks in the data unbroken interpolated streamflow records covering a minimum period of four years were individually utilised to derive baseflow estimates for each gauging site the bfi for that stream gauge was then obtained by dividing the combined total baseflow of all these periods by the corresponding total streamflow fig 2 a to obtain seasonal indices the baseflow estimates were split into austral summer november to april fig 2c and winter may to october fig 2d periods with bfis derived by dividing the relevant seasonal total baseflow by the analogous total streamflow the ratio of the two seasonal bfis ratio of winter to summer bfi singh et al 2019 was also calculated fig 2b the distribution of the resulting bfi ratios was distinctly right skewed therefore the logarithmic form was extracted as well the bfi was included in the surface hydrology analysis table 2 to determine subcatchment predictors significantly correlated with streamflow dynamics regulated releases make river levels artificially higher in the dry months the calculation of baseflow indices in regulated rivers is thus problematic with bfis for such streams overestimating baseflow the bfi may be computed from data spanning as little as two years meyboom 1961 but if results are intended as direct inputs for rainfall runoff or flood models ten years of data or more are recommended hill et al 2013 for hydrological studies such as this it is preferable to include as many sites as feasible to maximise catchment characterisation without compromising the quality of the variables 2 2 2 subsurface permeability permeability k m2 is a property of soils rocks and sediments the attribute describes how quickly water flows into or through an aquifer or aquitard and the volume of such flux this study focused on permeability of near surface aquifers rather than hydraulic conductivity because the latter can be derived from the former permeability allocation was obtained from the australian hydrological geospatial fabric ahgf or geofabric http www bom gov au water geofabric index shtml groundwater cartography product v2 1 1 this database contains the greatest detail for the australian continent cf global datasets of dürr et al 2005 hartmann and moosdorf 2012 the geofabric contains a map of

national aquifer framework naf http www bom gov au water groundwater naf table 3 shows a list of relevant complexes surface lithology most commonly reflects subsurface lithology at shallow depth hence it is assumed that the surface lithology is representative of the shallow subsurface 50 m however subsurface permeability is often very heterogeneous in nature and reliable estimates are difficult to obtain even for individual subcatchments calver 2001 shanafield and cook 2014 surface lithology types were then allocated a permeability category table 3 and table 4 gleeson et al 2011 collated 230

4 the mean permeability values are expressed as logarithmic permeability log ks in table 4 and represent saturated permeability at a regional scale 5 km for this study the hydrogeological complexes of the geofabric were allocated a ks value according to their lithological descriptions refer to ks group numbers table 3 and table 4 for example both upper tertiary quaternary aquifer porous media unconsolidated and lower tertiary aquifer porous media unconsolidated are allocated as ks group 1 coarse grain unconsolidated because they are termed aquifers as opposed to aquitards denoting higher permeability and unconsolidated sediment 2 3 topography and subcatchment delineation the continent scale national river basin boundary nrbb dataset geoscience australia 1997 based on topographical and hydrological interpretation provides a commonly adopted definition of 233 river basins catchments across mainland australia and tasmania however the spatial scale of these river basins is too coarse to be sensitive to the full range of flood related parameters used in this study therefore the river basins of the nrbb dataset were further divided into subcatchments determined from the horton 1945 5th order stream definition and the national topographic vector database geoscience australia 2006 resulting in subcatchments large enough to enable meaningful comparisons and small enough to allow for computing power and timeframe constraints the upstream area of 6th and higher order waterways i e downstream subcatchments does account for upstream subcatchment areas the nrbb dataset was used as the primary layer to clip both the topographical vector database geoscience australia 2006 and the digital elevation model dem geoscience australia 2011 into 233 separate basins via the arcgis software v9 3 1 an external buffer zone of 10 km was applied to each river basin when clipping the dem to ensure reliable identification of the catchment margin the buffer zone was specifically required because the nrbb dataset is not based on the dem with the applied basin boundaries therefore not necessarily agreeing with the elevation data the centroid of each river basin was used to determine its appropriate map grid of australia mga zone zones 50 to 56 the basin data including dems were then projected into their relevant mga zone the gis based software package catchmentsim version 3 0 3 1 was employed to divide the river basins into subcatchments on a horton s 5th order stream basis and a 3 arc second raster dem fig 3 this involved the generation of streams within the software from stream initiation points derived from the existing mapped stream networks the catchmentsim catchment breakup approach used a horton stream ordering algorithm which delineates subcatchments of a particular horton order based on the vector stream network every segment of 6th and higher order streams is defined as a separate subcatchment however if multiple 5th and higher order streams entered the ocean within the same nrbb defined catchment these were treated as the same subcatchment by the software fig 3c in total 2816 subcatchments were obtained in addition to the delineation of the river basin subcatchments catchmentsim was also used to calculate topographical variables for each subcatchment these derived datasets were reprojected from their mga zone to a geographic coordinate system the geocentric datum of australia 1994 gda94 to enable merging into a single coherent national dataset in total eighteen catchmentsim indices were utilised in this study cf topography predictors in table 5 basin boundaries of the nationally defined river basin dataset geoscience australia 1997 provided the initial spatial division for the analysis in some instances e g the murray darling river basin the defined river basins flow from one into another within a larger drainage network stream orders are reset within each river basin despite channels being part of a continuing larger drainage network this resetting affects the determination of the bifurcation ratio in larger catchments incorporating multiple basins because a large watercourse is re assigned a stream order of 1 when flowing between basins this effect highlights a limitation of using river basins to define the spatial areas for a nation wide study likewise the river basin boundaries in the geoscience australia 1997 dataset can adversely impact calculation of total upstream area for each subcatchment when these river basins are part of a larger drainage network hence the total upstream area may be underestimated for the murray darling river system catchmentsim derived upstream areas of affected subcatchments were manually adjusted to include relevant areas from adjacent basins catchmentsim identifies main channel flow while ignoring braided and anabranching channels therefore horton s drainage density hdd a measure of the total stream channel length per unit area may be underestimated in low gradient catchments 2 4 climate rainfall data are available across australia with the bom weather station network consisting of over 17 700 sites all rainfall station records were accessed directly from bom s climate data online cdo http www bom gov au climate data website in october 2017 by default the cdo database only includes data that are deemed of acceptable quality or were not yet quality checked once downloaded multi day rainfall totals covering a 2 to 4 day period were transformed into a daily average over the relevant period conversely multi day rainfall values over 5 day or longer periods were removed to reduce a potential positive bias in annual rain days rainfall stations with at least 30 years of data n 8539 fig 4 a were used to extract six variables for this study table 5 two of these indices required the additional stipulation of a minimum of thirty years with near complete 350 days of yearly rainfall records at individual stations reducing the data subset to n 7880 rainfall has a distinct non uniform seasonal pattern in many australian regions for instance winter rainfall is prevalent in the southwest and tasmania conversely in most parts of the country including northern australia and the eastern coast of the mainland rainfall is summer dominant australia s tropical regions are characterised by a summer wet season defined by the bom as november to april this period was applied to define a rainfall seasonality variable rainfall for the period november to april was divided by the total yearly rainfall to obtain rainfall percentage in summer season the index average number of rain days is defined as any day with a minimum precipitation of 0 2 mm both predictors were calculated from data of years with near complete records 350 days with data australian rainfall data are characterised by a large number of days without rainfall and a right hand skew representing several extreme events four variables were derived by applying the method of l moments based on the reduced rainfall dataset rain days only for each rainfall station the first four l moments were computed the bom network of stations with evaporation n 632 or mslp n 930 data is significantly smaller than the rainfall dataset fig 4 after removal of records flagged by the bom s internal quality control the remaining values were used if the station record exceeded two years n 532 for evaporation and n 799 for mslp fig 4b c the evaporation and mslp data were split into summer november april and winter seasons may october the first three l moments were then applied to both seasons separately producing six descriptors for both evaporation and mslp table 5 values for each of the eighteen climate variables were assigned to individual subcatchments in a multi step process for every subcatchments with relevant station measurements each climate statistic within the polygon was averaged to assign a single value to that subcatchment a radial basis function interpolation was applied using arcgis v10 4 to allocate values to catchments without climate stations 2 5 surface condition the surface effect of either absorbing or repelling water is the greatest impact soil geology and land use have on catchment response to rainfall the term surface condition is used to incorporate the key variables of soil geology and land use influencing flood response to determine a numerical value useful in later statistical analysis a method representative of australian surface conditions or the relative surface state between absorbent and repellent was developed the diverse soil descriptions were aggregated into a simple relative rank land surface value lsv incorporating key parameters such as permeability texture and absorbance clay content and behaviour depth of soil profile incorporating geological outcrop and anthropogenic land use effects fig 5 the simplicity of this ranking approach in contrast to detailed soil description aligns with the australia wide resolution of catchment response analysis for this study to calculate lsvs national soils and geology data were first assessed to allocate a field capacity score fcs based on soil classification depth and texture fig 5 field capacity is defined as the maximum bulk water content retained in soil at 33 j kg of hydraulic head veihmeyer and hendrickson 1931 more generally the term is used to indicate the volume of stored water within a soil profile necessary to initiate permanent surface pooling or runoff this measurement is an indication of the potential for soil to absorb water low field capacity reflects limited ability to absorb water whereas high field capacity suggests the reverse field capacity is controlled largely by soil texture and composition and these characteristics are accounted for in the soil classification depth of soil profile and texture ranks as described in the australian soil classification asc ashton and mckenzie 2001 a more detailed description of field capacity score determination is provided in section 2 5 1 land use was characterised with a scoring range of 7 to 7 this land use score lus was allocated based on land use practices that improve or diminish soil field capacity section 2 5 2 outlines lus determination in more detail a final lsv was then assigned to the land surface by aggregating the fcs and lus section 2 5 3 fig 6 2 5 1 field capacity score fcs determination soil and geology throughout australia were assessed by evaluating the soil classification and distribution of csiro s digital atlas of australian soils daas https www asris csiro au themes atlas html atlas digital the soil codes of the atlas classification 3000 soil descriptions were converted into the asc as per ashton and mckenzie 2001 grouping the data into thirteen soil types fig 5 permeability and water holding property descriptions from widely used sources australian soil club http www soil org au mckenzie et al 2004 victorian resources online http vro agriculture vic gov au dpi vro vrosite nsf pages soil home were utilised to conduct an initial assessment of soil field capacity to address the thirteen major soil groups this evaluation assigned a rank score of 1 to 5 describing the permeability of the thirteen soil units by averaging the ranks used in the three available categorisation systems fig 5 assigning fcs on the basis of the asc ashton and mckenzie 2001 alone has its limitations general descriptions do not consider factors such as the depth of the profile to bed rock which in some instances may be minimal to account for this the descriptions in daas were reviewed to determine the depth to rock and the amount of rock outcrop within each mapped unit for each map unit the soil profile was categorised as class a rock outcrop geology class b rock outcrop skeletal shallow soil cover over rock class c rock outcrop moderated soil cover over rock or class d soil fig 5 to define the overall fcs further assessment of the soil texture was also required daas descriptions give thirteen classes of soil texture these were converted to a rank score of 1 to 7 assigned on the basis of textural classes from the existing classification as per charman 1978 the three ranks derived from each of the three categories described earlier i e soil classification depth and texture were combined into a three point soil code with a sequential nomenclature for example a calcarasol with thick soil profile and calcareous earth texture would code 3d4 there are 676 possible permutations of code combinations but only 80 of these were identified across australia hence only these 80 codes or map units are used in further analysis cf table b 1 for the full list of soil codes allocation of fcs for each of the 80 codes was based on interpreting a significance weighting for each component of the soil code by applying a priori knowledge of their context composition and soil profile arrangement for each soil code the three ranked factors may have varying degrees of dominance strong interactions or in some instances conflicting interactions therefore the relative weighting of factors was considered for each individual code resulting in nine characteristic weighting trends that formed the basis of fcs allocation see appendix b 2 for fcs allocation rationale final fcs ranged from 1 to 7 with 1 representing high field capacity and 7 low field capacity 2 5 2 land use score lus determination national land use data version 4 2005 06 were obtained from the national department of agriculture scale land use https www agriculture gov au abares aclump land use data download detailed vector land use data for each state and territory were merged into single coverage for the entire country all land uses table b 3 were assigned a unique lus value based on whether the land use would negatively affect field capacity i e reduce field capacity values 1 to 7 positively affect field capacity i e increase field capacity 1 to 7 or make no difference 0 a complete list of land use and allocated lus is provided in appendix b 3 2 5 3 land surface value lsv determination scores from the soil field capacity and the land use analyses were combined to allocate an lsv between 7 and 14 fig 6 this step reveals the impact of land use on field capacity as positive low field capacity negative high field capacity or neutral there are several situations however when the end members of both soil geology field capacity and land use may dominate the impact on absolute field capacity consequently soil codes allocated an fcs of 7 rocky areas excluding sandstones or land use allotted an lus of 7 high density urban and industrial areas were assigned an lsv of 14 conversely land use allocated an lus of 7 water bodies such as dams and reservoirs were assigned an lsv of 7 regardless of the fcs value 2 6 numerical methods a principal component analysis pca based on a correlation matrix and varimax rotation was performed on the twenty surface hydrology and bfi variables reducing these to six surface hydrology principal components pcs the bfi was derived from surface water information therefore reflecting streamflow conditions thus the index was included with the surface hydrological data one stream gauge is situated on an island a5130501 kangaroo island this site was excluded from further statistical analyses because the subcatchment delineation is limited to mainland australia and tasmania a correlation analysis based on the pearson correlation coefficient was performed between each subcatchment variable and the six surface hydrology pcs representing streamflow with the aim of determining the relative significance of the relationship between these descriptors cf section 2 and appendix a the correlation analysis may identify significantly related indices but is unable to establish whether there is a causal link between the two variables hence a false positive type i error may occur especially when the total number of compared indices is high the šidák correction factor αs šidák 1967 was applied to reduce the false positive error rate α s 1 1 α 1 n p for np equal to forty catchment descriptors and significance level α of 0 05 a šidák correction factor of 0 0013 is obtained thus the correlation is deemed significant at the šidák correction level if the p value does not exceed 0 0013 the results provide context for the relative importance of each index in predicting streamflow dynamics a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using software xlstat its linear regression tool permits the extraction of the best model per predictor number along with associated criteria such as the bayesian information criterion bic the akaike s information criterion aic and the adjusted r2 r2 adj the bic penalises overfitting more heavily than the aic whereas the r2 adj is most lenient henceforth the xlstat output is referred to as the best regression model brm results an additional more detailed regression analysis was then applied in matlab to explore all possible combinations with up to six input variables similar to saft et al 2016 this computationally demanding method equates to 4 6 million regression models per pc these 6max predictor regression models were then assessed using several criteria including the r2 adj penalising for extra predictors aic the aicc correcting for small sample size and the bic to evaluate the proportion of evidence for each predictor the relative difference was calculated for three criteria aic aicc bic δ aic i aic i aic min where aicmin is the model with the lowest best aic value and i refers to the ith model the model weights w for each pc were then calculated as follows w i p c e δ a i c i p c 2 e δ a i c all p c 2 finally the combined total proportion of evidence tpe of every predictor p was obtained for each pc by adding all weights of models that contained the predictor t p e p p c w p p c a large proportion 76 7 of the selected station network is located in non perennial waterways and these sites therefore have a uniform low flow of 0 m3 s yet these locations are characterised by diverse catchment properties their link to streamflow potentially masked by their non perennial status that are intermittent to ephemeral in nature cf vidal abarca et al 2020 thus the correlation and regression analyses were repeated for a subset n 175 that excludes all non perennial systems 3 results six pcs summarise the twenty surface hydrology variables table a 2 and fig a 1 accounting for a combined total of 91 4 of the variance pc1 relates to the severity of extreme flow events the probability of extreme flow events and baseflow attributes are characterised by pc2 the low flow conditions are summarised with pc3 whereas the frequency of high flow events is represented by pc4 pc5 explains the difference ratio between baseflow during summer and winter whereas pc6 refers to general seasonal and long term baseflow conditions the correlation analysis between subcatchment variables and the six surface hydrology pcs fig 7 revealed distinct links between catchment characteristics and streamflow these pc specific connections are subsequently discussed in more detail among the applied criteria the bic most heavily penalises overfitting thus the smallest brm sizes are consistently attributed to the bic the difference in selected predictor numbers between the various selection criteria aic bic and r2 adj is generally greater when the model strength is lower i e lower r2 adj in addition the increase in fitting performance tends to plateau after about four predictors for most pcs comparable to the result by saft et al 2016 however the fitting pattern is pc and sample dependent for pc1 the predictive gain is reduced after the inclusion of the second variable when all streams are considered whereas the perennial stream subset exhibits a strong preference for six predictors in agreement with the bic selected brm conversely the fitting performance for pc2 suggests a relatively large predictor number minimum of seven regardless of whether non perennial sites are excluded the 6max predictor regression models yielded comparable tpe results independently of the applied criterion aic aicc or bic for the better performing predictors bic fig a 2 tends to have slightly lower tpe values subsequently the lowest tpe result for individual predictors will be presented 3 1 pc1 pc1 predominantly characterises extreme maximum mean peak and mean flow conditions and flow variability sd both the linear variables and their logarithmic counterparts are represented in pc1 fig a 1 this pc is more closely associated with climatic characteristics rather than intrinsic catchment properties fifteen out of 18 climate metrics are significantly correlated with pc1 based on the more stringent šidák correction factor p values 0 0013 including all mslp indices fig 7 among the non climatic predictors variability of subsurface permeability and lsv average lsv and main stream slope are the variables with the strongest association with pc1 the brm test in xlstat returned linear equations of distinctly different size n dependent on whether the aic n 25 or bic n 8 were applied as the decisive criterion table 6 their respective r2 adj values are moderately high at 0 399 and 0 375 all predictors in the bic model are also included in the more complex aic selection among these are mean summer evaporation and mslp all winter mslp characteristics main stream slope and variability of subsurface permeability the greatest tpe for pc1 was obtained by variability of subsurface permeability 0 999aic followed by mean summer mslp 0 916aic mean winter 0 470bic and mean summer evaporation 0 380bic 3 2 pc2 pc2 mainly embodies the probability of extreme flow events l moments 3 5 and to a lesser extent baseflow attributes similar to pc1 the list of predictors significantly correlated with pc2 is also dominated by climate variables 16 indices slope related attributes including slope of the main stream channel are among significantly linked intrinsic catchment properties p values 0 0013 compared with the other pcs the brm provided the most optimal results for pc2 in terms of both r2 adj 0 600 and 0 596 and level of agreement between the aic and bic preferred output n of 19 and 15 respectively table 6 both aic and bic mostly incorporated climate metrics including annual rainfall days rainfall percentage in summer all mslp variables and most evaporation characteristics in addition variability of elevation and subsurface permeability are deemed significant predictors of pc2 for pc2 six variables have tpe greater than 0 970 variability of subsurface permeability mean winter mslp mslp variability in both seasons the number of rain days and rainfall kurtosis whereas the remainder have tpe below 0 030 3 3 pc3 pc3 characterising low flow conditions represented by minimum flow has the fewest number of predictors that are significantly correlated p values 0 0013 these include slope hdd the bifurcation ratio and the number of annual rain days the brm indicates a relatively poor fit when a linear relationship between catchment characteristics and pc3 is assumed table 6 the bic preferred model size is four r2 adj 0 122 whereas the aic produces a much more complex output without notable gain in explanatory power n 28 r2 adj 0 167 the predictors in the bic model are average slope bifurcation ratio main stream slope and annual rain days the tpes for pc3 are dominated by bifurcation ratio average slope main stream slope and annual rain days all above 0 990 whereas hdd reached a tpebic of 0 530 3 4 pc4 a broad range of predictors is significantly linked to pc4 representative of the frequency of high flow events p values 0 0013 twenty eight catchment variables are significantly related to pc4 at the šidák correction level p value 0 0013 fig 7 and table a 3 notably absent from the 28 significant predictors are most rainfall indices except for annual rain days the r2 adj values of the brm are quite high for both the aic r2 adj 0 452 n 29 and bic r2 adj 0 423 n 15 table 6 stream density hdd lsv properties annual rain days rainfall skewness and various evaporation and mslp features are among the variables significantly linked to pc4 variability of evaporation in both seasons and summer mslp explains most of pc4 tpe 0 980 whereas hdd lsv variability and rainfall kurtosis have tpe values ranging from 0 699bic to 0 752bic 3 5 pc5 pc5 exemplifies the ratio of winter to summer bfi climate metrics are again the most prominent indices significantly associated with pc5 p values 0 0013 relevant non climatic intrinsic predictors are limited to elevation characteristics and variability of subsurface permeability along with pc2 the brm fits are among the poorest of the six pcs table 6 in addition both aic n 12 r2 adj 0 143 and bic n 4 r2 adj 0 127 produced the smallest model size compared to the other pcs the bic preferred model incorporated variability of subsurface permeability skewness of winter evaporation and summer mslp and mean winter mslp for pc5 the skewness of winter evaporation tpe of 0 837bic is the most relevant predictor followed by subsurface permeability 0 441bic and mean winter mslp 0 410bic 3 6 pc6 baseflow conditions are summarised by pc6 twenty nine predictors are significantly connected to pc6 p values 0 0013 including a wide range of climatic and in situ properties the brm analysis produced a moderate fit for both aic r2 adj 0 350 n 28 and bic r2 adj 0 303 n 5 bic relevant metrics are maximum elevation lsv variability annual rain days rainfall kurtosis and mslp variability in winter annual rain days 0 989bic and maximum elevation 0 892bic have the highest tpe for pc6 with winter mslp and lsv variability summer rainfall proportion and rainfall kurtosis all having tpes greater than 0 5 4 discussion forty subcatchment specific metrics were investigated for their connection to australian streamflow properties that were summarised with six pcs all examined catchment variables exhibited significant links to surface hydrology table 7 rainfall attributes have an overwhelming influence on extreme flow events and their likelihood conversely low flow periods are more dependent on in situ conditions including topographical features and subsurface permeability these results are thus in close agreement with previous studies that explored controls of streamflow patterns e g kuentz et al 2017 out of the forty catchment descriptors upstream area and channel skewness were the only attributes not significantly correlated with one of the six surface hydrology pcs at the more stringent šidák correction factor 0 0013 when the full dataset was investigated nevertheless with p values of 0 021 channel skewness vs pc4 and 0 0016 upstream area vs pc6 significant connections were still evident at more traditional cut off levels further upstream area is significantly correlated with four pcs at the šidák correction level when non perennial waterways are removed streams in upper subcatchments have a greater tendency to be non perennial and their exclusion leads to greater prevalence of higher order streams in relative terms consequently upstream area becomes more pertinent the link between channel skewness and pc4 is mainly attributable to the variable s correlation with the average number of flow peaks in a year p value 0 013 this link between channel skewness and annual number of flow peaks may partially be of an indirect nature because both features are significantly related to topographical attributes pertaining to stream length e g average flow length and elevation e g median elevation catchments with lower vertical relief or shorter stream lengths have a greater tendency for higher channel skewness higher channel skewness synonymous with a more asymmetrical drainage pattern results in less efficient flows into streams in some areas thus impacting on local flow conditions hence the positive relationship between channel skewness and pc4 suggests a greater propensity for more frequent flow peaks when channel skewness is high the statistical findings are subsequently discussed separately for each pc 4 1 extreme flow severity higher mean daily rainfall 1st l moment rainfall variability and summer rain percentage are all strongly linked to extreme streamflow represented by pc1 fig 8 a conversely the number of rain days per year is negatively correlated with the occurrence of extreme flood events with more rain days less likely to result in extreme flood events subcatchments with few rainy days per year tend to be associated with high mean daily rainfall 1st l moment and therefore higher probability of extreme flow events the positive relationship between seasonal mean daily evaporation 1st l moment and pc1 is expected because evaporation is inversely related to the number of rain days rain free days have a greater propensity for cloud free conditions and increased evaporation the negative association of mean mslp conditions 1st l moment with pc1 indicates the importance of low pressure systems and the consequential enhancement of rainfall associated with these weather patterns e g tropical lows east coast lows and troughs the relevance of mean summer mslp is also reflected by its high tpe for pc1 0 916aic figure a 2 variability of subsurface permeability and lsv along with average lsv are the non climatic metrics with the strongest association with pc1 the 6max predictor regression model test identified subsurface permeability variability as the index with the highest tpe 0 999 this attribute is negatively correlated with pc1 suggesting that greater variability in subsurface property permits a greater proportion of runoff to infiltrate underground potentially reducing the severity of extreme flow events only one topographical trait main stream slope exhibits a correlation significant at the šidák correction level p value 0 0013 table a 3 however several additional topographical descriptors relating to elevation longest flow path slope maximum elevation vertical range and average slope have p values below 0 01 all five topographical indices are positively correlated with the annual number of rain days whereas the three slope attributes have an inverse relation to mean daily rainfall consequently the negative correlation between these topographical variables and pc1 is partially attributable to the propensity for more frequent light rainfall events e g drizzly conditions in elevated terrain compared with areas closer to sea level in addition a significant proportion of the strong relationships will stem from the applied method basins with stream orders greater than five were further subdivided into subcatchments fig 3 thus upper subcatchments will generally be characterised by higher topography steeper slopes and usually also more varied elevation in contrast to the lower subcatchments that will mostly typify a more uniform low relief landscape because upstream flows will ultimately accumulate and reach the lower subcatchment higher flow volumes are expected in the latter hence producing a negative relationship with topographical elevation variability and gradient 4 2 extreme flow event probability and baseflow properties pc2 embodies both the probability of extreme flow events l moments 3 to 5 and to a lesser degree baseflow attributes when streamflow is highly variable as reflected by larger values for l moments 3 5 baseflow yield tends to be lower particularly during summer comparable to pc1 pc2 is most strongly linked to climate indices fig 7 consequently most of the climatic description for pc1 section 3 1 also applies to pc2 however contrary to pc1 l moments 3 and 4 of daily rainfall both exhibit significant positively correlated relationships with pc2 this result is not unexpected when the robust link between rainfall and runoff is considered with pc2 to a large extent defined by streamflow l moments 3 to 5 greater positive skewness and kurtosis both indicate heavier more pronounced tails translating to a greater prominence of days with extreme rainfall and elevated streamflow the strong correlation between percent summer rainfall november april and average daily flow describes non perennial watercourses in areas with highly seasonal rainfall further more extreme rainfall tends to be experienced in regions with predominant summer rainfall a pattern confirmed by the correlation analysis consequently a concomitant increase in potential extreme flows is expected fig 8b to an even greater extent than for pc1 topographical descriptor main stream slope is also significantly connected to pc2 in addition to longest flow path slope mean slope and elevation variability low vertical relief general absence of steep slopes and dominance of flood plains particularly if in conjunction with large area in steeper upstream subcatchments can result in water backing up or flows slowing especially when constriction points are present consequently streamflow levels tend to be elevated for extended periods in areas of poor drainage leading to a larger proportion of days with elevated flows i e more highly skewed flow patterns among non climate variables lsv has the strongest connection with pc2 p value 0 0013 table a 3 high lsvs particularly in conjunction with low subsurface permeability denote a larger proportion of rainfall converting to runoff because of low infiltration rates hence lsv is strongly associated with extreme flow probability pc2 also strongly represents bfi the higher the pc2 value the lower the expected bfi bfi has a strong negative association with evaporation whereas regular rainfall higher number of annual rain days promotes baseflow by increasing soil saturation in addition steeper topography facilitates soil water drainage encouraging elevated baseflow in these areas price 2011 hale and mcdonnell 2016 have specifically linked more permeable subsurfaces to longer mean transit times of baseflow buffering the river system to rainfall variability here we have found that subsurface permeability and its extent of spatial uniformity are inversely linked to mean seasonal and long term bfi thus greater subsurface permeability and heterogeneity thereof are suggested to result in reduced baseflow potentially a reaction to increased infiltration to deeper groundwater systems the correlation results for perennial streams confirmed the negative relationship between long term and seasonal bfis and subsurface permeability whereas the link with variability of subsurface permeability was less conclusive 4 3 low flow conditions a relatively small number of catchment variables is significantly linked to pc3 low flow represented by flow minima fig 7 based on the šidák correction level although the number increases more than threefold when the more lenient threshold level is applied α 0 05 table a 3 in contrast to the preceding pcs climate variables have a subordinate role in determining pc3 values and accordingly minimum flow levels although the number of annual rain days is important as also evidenced by its incorporation into the brms fig 8d pc3 has the strongest connection with bifurcation ratio with its link to hdd also significant at the šidák correction factor 0 0013 higher values for these morphometric parameters suggest a shorter time for the discharge to exit the catchment although this can amplify flood risk by increasing peak discharge streamflow can also more quickly return to low levels after high flow events thus encouraging lower flow minima and explaining the inverse relationship between bifurcation ratios and pc3 previous studies in mountainous regions of puerto rico garcia martinó et al 1996 and the southeastern unites states price et al 2011 have also highlighted hdd as a key predictor of low flow behaviour with a reverse association between low flow and hdd in agreement with our findings however contrary to our result price et al 2011 have found a positive relationship between low flow and bifurcation ratio the contrasting results can possibly be attributed to differences in low flow definitions low flow threshold over a certain period vs absolute flow minimum along with dissimilarities in study scale and location the connection with mean slope is more complex although steeper slopes encourage rapid runoff thus permitting a more rapid reversion to low flows these regions are also commonly associated with a greater number of rainfall days per annum such rainy conditions are not conducive to low flow minima explaining the positive relationship between mean slope and pc3 low flow conditions the relatively poor performance of the pc3 regression models and low number of predictors that are significantly correlated with this pc can at least partially be ascribed to the large number of non perennial streams i e minimum streamflow values of 0 m3 s in australia of the 750 gauges used for this analysis 76 7 are situated in sites of intermittent or ephemeral flow the diverse catchment properties of these non perennial settings result in overall poorer performance of the statistical tests when the correlation analysis is repeated by omitting the non perennial streams upstream area and mean mslp in winter in addition to bifurcation ratio and hdd exhibit a significantly positive relationship with pc3 p value 0 0013 and thus low flow conditions even though the statistical power is reduced by the smaller dataset n 175 larger catchment areas will permit greater accumulation of flows thus increasing the minimum runoff volume conversely lower mean mslps suggest a higher propensity for rainfall in the cooler months thus producing runoff during a period when a large proportion of australia receives limited precipitation upstream area and bifurcation ratio are also among the indices incorporated into the reduced perennial only brms with the r2 adj for aic bic augmenting from 0 167 0 122 to 0 344 0 334 in addition whereas the bic model size remained unchanged four with upstream area substituting annual number of rain days the aic model decreased from 28 to 6 thus reducing likely overparameterisation 4 3 1 the problematic case of ephemeral waterways a large proportion of australian streams is non perennial in nature some of these watercourses are classified as intermittent their seasonal flows sustained longer by groundwater supply ephemeral sites however are only recording flows for a brief duration e g a few days immediately following significant precipitation these extended periods of zero flow have substantial impacts on a range of attributes specifically the rainfall runoff relationship can be altered considerably by antecedent conditions dry spells produce crusting of soils via chemical processes hampering water infiltration in the absence of gentle pre wetting and enhancing erosion and flood risk surface crusting can also be produced by clay deposition after a significant flow event further zhang et al 2017 highlighted that the lyne hollick method applied here is not recommended for ephemeral streams because of the brief flow periods and prolonged absence of a slow flow component thus when more reliable estimates are required for ephemeral systems alternative baseflow derivation methods should be considered 4 4 high flow frequency high flow events related to pc4 are defined as any periods when streamflow surpassed the 80th percentile at that site the frequency of high flow events is predominantly dictated by the annual number of rain days as also evidenced by the negative relationship between pc4 and mean evaporation in both seasons fig 8c topography also greatly impacts on the high flow recurrence interval because of the tendency for orographic enhancement of precipitation at higher altitudes catchments with higher and more varied elevation are predisposed to a greater number of high flow events aided by the faster passage of the runoff this view is supported by the strong association between pc4 and hdd positive and flow distance negative hdd is a measure of how effectively runoff travels within a catchment all these connections suggest short duration high flow events that occur more regularly in drainage basins with high pc4 values extreme runoff events are prone to be more significant in terms of speed and instantaneous volume in catchments with a greater capacity to transmit water although the flow events also tend to be of shorter duration although the lsv metrics are not significantly correlated with pc4 they are both incorporated into the brms in addition the 6max predictor regression models attributed the highest tpe among non climatic indicators to the variability of lsv 0 742bic when the regression analysis was repeated with non perennial streams removed n 175 table a 5 the aic bic r2 adj for the brms improved from 0 452 0 423 to 0 667 0 551 despite the reduction in statistical power and a decrease in model size from 29 15 to 26 7 the regression models for perennial streams incorporated mean lsv inverse relationship and variability of subsurface permeability direct regardless of whether the aic or bic was applied as the criterion with mean lsv scoring a tpe of 0 432bic lower lsvs and their variability enhanced water infiltration or chance thereof correspond to higher pc4 and greater number of flow peaks this connection can be explained by water infiltration and consequently a more rapid reduction in streamflow this permits water levels to drop below the 80th percentile faster and thus the potential for a new flow peak to arise 4 5 seasonal baseflow difference pc5 summarises the seasonal bfi difference represented by the ratio of the winter to summer bfi values climate predictors dominate variables significantly associated with baseflow seasonality fig 8f among these predictors the 3rd l moment of winter season evaporation is the most prominent index based on the strongest inverse correlation and highest tpe 0 837bic the more extreme right skewed the distribution of evaporation the lower pc5 ratio of winter to summer bfi evaporation reduces streamflow volume consequently a more right skewed evaporation pattern during the cooler months is expected to diminish winter baseflow yields thus decreasing the winter summer bfi ratio variability of subsurface permeability has the second highest tpe 0 441bic for pc5 whereas elevation related attributes have the most significant negative correlations among the non climatic predictors with subsurface permeability inversely linked to elevation attributes a more variable permeability in lower subcatchments encourages localised water infiltration where surface flow would otherwise be more dominant further rainfall in australian catchments tends to be summer dominant hence the proportion of runoff diverting to baseflow is expected to be greater in the winter period at most sites that permit water infiltration thus potentially increasing the bfi ratio previous studies indicate that watersheds at higher altitudes tend to produce greater baseflow yields e g rumsey et al 2015 these results are confirmed here with the altitude parameters positively correlated with seasonal and long term bfi conversely elevation related predictors are inversely linked to the winter summer bfi ratio pc5 is negatively connected to summer baseflow levels therefore the derived negative relationship of elevation metrics with the winter summer bfi ratio is attributable to a more enhanced increase in mean summer baseflow with height relative to winter conditions thus reducing the ratio when the correlation and brm were repeated with the perennial watercourses n 175 table a 5 pc5 showed the most striking improvement in predictive strength the aic bic results increasing from 0 143 0 127 to 0 542 0 516 despite model sizes remaining nearly constant changing from 12 4 to 11 4 for these additional models upstream area and proportion of summer rain are important whereas elevation attributes were not significantly related these differences can be explained by several aspects firstly the full dataset of 750 gauges is much more disparate encompassing a greater diversity in terms of climate and coastal proximity making the derivation of a high performing predictive model more challenging conversely perennial streams are mostly limited to sites that are relatively near coastal including ranges feeding these coastal catchments and typified by wet conditions fig 1 these regions include southeast australia and to a lesser extent the wet tropics and southwest australia secondly lower order streams have a greater tendency to be non perennial and a comparatively large proportion of gauges in upper watersheds were thus excluded from the perennial subset with higher order waterways more prevalent in relative terms upstream area becomes more relevant and because the remaining sites are less diverse the predictive power of the brms improved 4 6 baseflow pc6 relates to winter baseflow and to a lesser degree long term and summer bfi characteristics the annual number of rain days has the weakest correlation with pc6 p value 0 730 yet this predictor has the highest tpe 0 989bic and is also incorporated into both the aic and bic brms in addition the correlation does become significant at the šidák correction level p value 0 0013 when non perennial streams are removed although atmospheric characteristics are important the influence of topography and surface condition is more pronounced when streamflow is not extremely high during extreme precipitation events most rainfall will convert to runoff because of fully saturated soils regardless of topography whereas the catchment response will be more nuanced for less intense rainfall events variables that describe elevation are the most influential topographical features with slope related traits also significantly linked to pc6 and baseflow fig 7 and fig 8e although some of these indices are also strongly connected to pc2 their relationship is reversed long term and seasonal bfis are positively related to these predictors because baseflow attributes are incorporated into pc6 with a positive trend and reversely with pc2 the connection between the elevation and slope descriptors and pc6 changed accordingly various catchment properties were previously linked to baseflow for instance post and jakeman 1996 related baseflow recession in victoria to catchment shape and slope confirming our result conversely lacey and grayson 1998 determined that the bfi is independent of topographical features in victoria with baseflow more closely associated with geology and vegetation two attributes not directly included in our investigation however mean subsurface permeability an indirect representative of geology exhibited significant inverse correlation with pc6 and bfi regardless of whether non perennial streams were excluded fig 7 and figure a 3 substantiating the importance of geology 4 7 frequency distributions the sensitivity of the l moments method to climatic extremes in seasonally arid and monsoonal zones is uncertain in the seasonally arid tropics many of the daily rainfall and streamflow values are zero with intense rainfall maxima often occurring after prolonged dry periods the recorded values will have significant influence on the 3rd and 4th l moments but the impact of these factors on the 5th l moment super skewness needs more research the method of l moments is intrinsically related to the fundamental underlying frequency distribution that is used to describe the data in australia a log pearson iii lp3 distribution was previously favoured to determine the frequency of intense rainfall events and is still widely used for australian catchment studies e g flood frequency analysis ball et al 2019 the low probability extreme rainfall events are represented in the right hand tail of these distributions and the nature of the tail varies between distributions the generalised extreme value gev distribution fitted using l moments is now the recommended method to perform frequency analysis for rainfall in most circumstances ball et al 2019 ball et al 2019 also declared however that neither gev nor lp3 may adequately embody rainfall patterns in regions affected by tropical cyclones tcs the goodness of fit of the right hand portion of the distribution and in some circumstances the left hand portion of the distribution may significantly influence the probability values obtained and the positions of the l moments for the distribution consequently if flood frequency is to be added to flood heights and velocity then research is necessary into the underlying distributions that best describe the australian rainfall data because of the large size and disparate nature of the australian landmass and varied climate no frequency distribution is expected to consistently perform best throughout the continent yet regional adjustments of frequency distributions for national scale studies are not necessarily recommended because of the difficulty in defining adequate similarity criteria for grouping catchments and climatic zones and the potential for reduced reproducibility of the scientific results 5 conclusions a variety of variables were examined to distinguish catchment types within australia that may influence runoff regimes a diverse dataset sourced from miscellaneous government agencies or sub agencies was collated for this project to derive forty catchment characteristics from the themes of climate topography land surface condition and hydrogeology table 5 their links to streamflow behaviour represented by twenty descriptors summarised by six pcs in australian drainage basins was scrutinised archive inconsistencies between agencies and states required numerical assessment and standardisation before analysis data collation aimed to provide a consistent and robust framework for the interpretation of catchments within australia the lack of geographically consistent long term rainfall and river runoff records throughout australia required methods that accommodate inconsistencies in the datasets while still producing reliable and reproducible results the correlation and regression analyses confirmed that climate variables tend to dictate streamflow behaviour especially during high flow periods this outcome is in agreement with earlier studies that attributed a relatively small role to other index types such as soils and geological attributes e g beck et al 2015 during low flow however intrinsic catchment properties like upstream area bifurcation ratio and average topographical slope within the catchment and along the main waterway become important smakhtin 2001 further investigations are required to define the relative roles of the climatic and geomorphological drivers particularly in subcatchments where they significantly interact both factors ultimately control the frequency and severity of flood response across the australian continent a degree of uncertainty in clarifying the relative influence of these factors comes from limitations in data availability because a large proportion of drainage basins remain ungauged in addition some catchment parameters such as antecedent soil moisture and temporal aspects of water table levels were recognised as important but their dynamic spatial and temporal variability disqualified their inclusion in this study these dynamic catchment attributes pertain to individual events with large spatial or temporal variability e g storm type and duration and are highlighted as an area of future focus to refine flood studies the difference in results depending on whether non perennial waterways are incorporated illustrates that streamflow response to climatic and in situ properties is regionally highly varied thus grouping of similar streams is recommended to create tailored regional models for stronger predictive performance this notion was also discussed by trancoso et al 2017 who found regional and scale dependent connections between streamflow and catchment properties several caveats are associated with this study only linearity was considered except for the logarithmic transformation of some variables when exploring the connection between catchment characteristics and streamflow properties however some catchment descriptors are likely linked to streamflow in a non linear fashion providing avenues for further research the extreme seasonality of climate and accordingly streamflow is also problematic a large proportion 76 7 of the examined streamflow gauges are situated in non perennial waterways many of these watercourses are classified as ephemeral such sites typically flow only for brief periods and are thus characterised by extended dry periods in the absence of a sustained slow flow component zhang et al 2017 highlighted that the lyne hollick method is not recommended for ephemeral streams further soil crusting is a common occurrence during prolonged dry periods affecting surface permeability and therefore infiltration rates in the absence of gentle pre wetting prior to a significant rainfall event these soil crusts enhance surface runoff ultimately elevating flood risk while these changes can be observed on a seasonal scale australia is also notorious for its interannual climate extremes jaffrés et al 2018 and extended multi annual periods of wet or drought conditions taschetto et al 2016 this variability further complicates estimations of streamflow and groundwater recharge thus also hampering management of water resources a further issue is the biased data distribution with the arid interior and tropical north underrepresented by the network of stream gauges in addition temporal records tend to be relatively brief hampering the capture of extreme events with low recurrence rates as data availability for exogenous factors like rainfall and intrinsic basin properties is more extensive their association with streamflow properties can be utilised to infer catchment response to various flow scenarios the study outcomes represent the amalgamation interpretation and summary of a large number of environmental descriptors that influence drive and interact with the distribution of water across the australian landscape the parameters chosen for statistical analyses resulted from a multidisciplinary approach to statistical methods combined with expert understanding of climatic geomorphological and hydrological systems to best interpret the results the strong connection between catchment properties and streamflow characteristics provide opportunity for regionalisation in the absence of a dense stream gauge network that leaves most subcatchments essentially ungauged credit authorship contribution

4012,streamflow and baseflow dynamics are driven by complex interconnected catchment properties a national study was conducted to assess the relationship between surface flow climate and intrinsic catchment attributes in australia subcatchments were delineated based on horton s 5th stream order and were characterised by identifying parameters that influence streamflow and flood behaviour because observational datasets like rainfall and streamflow commonly have a non normal distribution the method of l moments was applied to several time series surface hydrology and baseflow patterns were represented by twenty indices which were statistically summarised via principal component pc analysis yielding six pcs forty catchment descriptors from the themes of climate topography surface condition and hydrogeology were used to investigate their link with runoff patterns among these is the land surface value a newly defined index incorporating soil properties and land use to estimate the capacity for water infiltration all metrics were explored via correlation and regression analysis against the surface hydrology pcs and their influence on runoff discussed the predictive skill of the regression models is improved when non perennial waterways are excluded although rainfall characteristics dominate streamflow behaviour topographical and surface conditions also greatly impact on runoff especially during low flow periods keywords climate variability non perennial streams surface hydrology topography soil field capacity water infiltration 1 introduction streamflow behaviour and associated flood risk are influenced by a multitude of competing factors both extrinsic e g climate and intrinsic e g geology soil topography land use and size on a global scale beck et al 2015 indicated that climate related variables exhibited the strongest links to streamflow properties conversely finer scale studies suggested more nuanced links highlighting the influence of soils trancoso et al 2017 zimmer and gannon 2018 and topography karlsen et al 2019 further although precipitation patterns dominate high flow events carlier et al 2018 demonstrated the importance of geology in attenuating flow volumes by modifying subsurface water storage and consequently the flow duration curve ultimately also affecting baseflow properties similarly lacey and grayson 1998 determined a strong link between baseflow and both geology and vegetation whereas topographical features were deemed irrelevant despite the complex influence of inherent catchment attributes on low flows climate associated characteristics such as rainfall and humidity still tend to explain a large proportion of baseflow variability and recession peña arancibia et al 2010 van dijk 2010 saft et al 2016 in turn emphasised that the partitioning of rainfall runoff does not remain stationary with the proportional runoff decreasing during drought periods catchments can be characterised by wide ranging combinations of attributes stein et al 2009 analysed australia s stream network based on 48 ecohydrological traits ranging from climate and water balance to topography substrate and vegetation kennard et al 2010b investigated 120 ecologically relevant metrics to assess flow regime types in australia trancoso et al 2017 explored 24 diverse biophysical properties to streamflow signatures in eastern australia emphasising the importance of soils on a regional scale in a regional study of three tropical catchments in northern australia erskine et al 2017 focussed on geomorphological attributes to classify rivers in subcatchments a new zealand article categorised rivers according to climate topography geology and land cover characteristics snelder and biggs 2002 in europe kuentz et al 2017 compared 16 flow signatures with 35 catchment descriptors identifying the primary importance of geology for baseflow and the controlling influence of topography on streamflow flashiness whereas countries like new zealand snelder and booker 2013 and the united kingdom national river flow archive dixon et al 2013 have relatively dense and more evenly distributed stream gauge networks australia s vast dry interior is scarcely monitored similarly rainfall data availability in australia is significantly biased towards populated regions with much higher observational network densities in the coastal southwest and southeastern regions of the country jaffrés et al 2018 variables with poor translational properties including catchment specific streamflow characteristics cannot be meaningfully applied to neighbouring drainage basins without extensive knowledge of relevant factors impacting on the attribute for instance rain shadows can produce vastly dissimilar runoff properties in two neighbouring catchments potentially compounded by differing geology and land surface features hence for large scale nationwide studies of streamflow traits reliance on alternative datasets is required albeit individually not fully representative of streamflow dynamics these datasets can in combination provide information about flow characteristics and associated exposure to extreme flow events the overarching aim of this study is to assess whether a set of catchment descriptors is sufficiently representative of surface flow characteristics to warrant its use in ungauged sites to fulfil this aim the objectives of this article entail 1 the derivation of forty metrics for every subcatchment throughout mainland australia and tasmania covering the themes of climate topography land surface condition and hydrogeology and 2 to analyse their relationship with twenty streamflow variables ranging from baseflow attributes to high flow properties at unregulated stream gauge sites across australia a description of each of the core datasets and any transposition or processing of data used is presented in section 2 the statistical results are summarised in section 3 whereas the relationship with aggregated streamflow properties is discussed in detail in section 4 several recommended avenues for future research are offered with the conclusions section 5 a more detailed explanation of statistical methods appendix a and soil classification appendix b is provided in the supplementary file 2 methods in the australian landscape land use soil characteristics and permeability strongly influence overland flow and are therefore included in this analysis for this study australian subcatchments were summarised by forty variables the parameters chosen cover five themes climate topography surface condition hydrogeology and surface hydrology each theme comprises several variables obtained from processing one or more datasets in contrast to some other studies e g merz and blöschl 2005 wagener et al 2004 metrics of geographic proximity were not considered this exclusion was rationalised to avoid unwarranted bias of similarity derived solely from proximity many australian catchments are ungauged especially in more remote regions therefore hydrological data were used independently to determine the relevance of selected catchment properties to streamflow response in ungauged drainage basins conventional use of statistical parameters is confounded by the non normal distribution of climate and hydrological data the method of l moments describes the shape of a probability distribution without assuming normality hosking and wallis 2005 l moments were developed as a form of distributional analysis specifically for hydrological investigations castellarin et al 2012 l moments provide a more realistic estimation of extreme values from climate and hydrological data more typical of the australian setting where extreme events and non normal data distributions are common rahman et al 2012 consequently l moments hosking and wallis 2005 were derived to summarise these data including rainfall evaporation mean sea level pressure mslp and streamflow variables for l moments l r 3 where r is the moment of interest l moment ratios τ r l r l 2 were also calculated a detailed description of the derivation method is available in appendix a 1 l moments are analogous to mean l 1 standard deviation sd l 2 skewness τ 3 kurtosis τ 4 and super skewness τ 5 henceforth l moment ratios τ 3 to τ 5 are also referred to as l moments for simplicity 2 1 surface hydrology streamflow data from hydrological stations were incorporated to investigate the relationship between the catchment variables and flow characteristics average daily flow volumes from the australian network of 4676 stream gauges were downloaded from the bureau of meteorology bom water data online wdo http www bom gov au waterdata website in july 2018 the network is heavily weighted towards well defined river networks in contrast some large regions with low annual rainfall totals e g the nullarbor plain and central australia have little to no data possibly owing to the perceived low risk of flooding to people and infrastructure further the wdo database does not contain all stations publicly available from the relevant regional department eighteen stations from the northern territory were missing from the wdo database at the time of data download even though those time series were available on the regional website https water nt gov au the quality of stream gauge data is highly varied and is dependent on numerous factors for the purpose of this study stations with long reliable data records that are minimally impacted by anthropogenic changes were targeted the bom has compiled two lists of stations deemed of superior quality the list of bom hydrologic reference stations hrs 31 august 2020 version http www bom gov au water hrs catalogues 467 stations with long data records 30 years located in unregulated catchments that underwent minimal land use change of these stations 460 are accessible from wdo table 1 a second more extensive register was compiled by the bom for modelling purposes to identify gauges with high quality data that cover at least ten years zhang et al 2013 similarly to the hrs selected sites were also characterised as unregulated and unimpaired limited irrigation and non intensive land use this dataset is henceforth referred to as the unregulated modelling stations ums of the 786 ums listed 714 were accessible from wdo table 1 in total 397 stations are contained in both hrs and the ums datasets a further 380 stations were contained only in hrs or the ums amounting to 777 stream gauges deemed of good quality wdo stations were removed if the length of their record was less than fifteen years or if they never recorded any flow records shorter than fifteen years are unlikely to include a large rainfall event significantly underestimating the potential for flooding kennard et al 2010a although more extensive time series are preferable to capture streamflow variability over longer timescales the application of a more stringent threshold would further reduce the already limited spatial spread of the dataset because of the relative brevity of historic data records at many sites of the 777 hrs and ums gauges 27 had less than 15 years of available data and were thus omitted from further analysis the remaining river gauging stations n 750 fig 1 were used in this study to derive twenty surface hydrology variables surface flow data were summarised by considering data distributions for different regions across australia for example flow data in queensland fig 1 are typically characterised by high flow including flood events followed by extended periods with little to zero flows conversely victorian sites tend to have consistent flows for most of the year with only occasional peaks in flow consequently a flow peak was defined as any event with a flow rate above the 80th percentile in australia non perennial streams are widespread with flows ceasing at times in approximately 70 of river channels busch et al 2020 vidal abarca et al 2020 many of these seasonally dry non perennial streams are classified as intermittent waterways fed by groundwater that permits more prolonged flows other non perennial channels are more ephemeral in nature only flowing briefly in direct and fast response to precipitation without connectivity to groundwater busch et al 2020 vidal abarca et al 2020 because of highly sporadic flow at many gauged sites twenty stations with a minimum record of 15 years returned 80th percentiles of 0 ml day hence every flow event contributed a flow peak for those stations for two peaks to be considered separate events the flow had to return to below the 80th percentile or to no flow if multiple peaks were registered within a 6 day window only the main peak was selected maximum and minimum recorded flow average peak value and average number of peaks in a year are among the variables derived from the hydrological data the 1st to 5th l moments of daily flow were also extracted the 5th l moment super skewness is potentially relevant in instances of extreme skewness for example in some regions of queensland many streams are without flows for most of the year and this pattern may be more noticeable in the 5th l moment the logarithmic log10 x 1 forms were also produced for variables with positively skewed distribution with the exception of 3rd to 5th l moments this equates to a total of twenty indices for surface hydrology table 2 2 2 hydrogeology this study used two hydrogeological types of variables as numerical inputs the first the dimensionless baseflow index bfi describes streamflow properties during low flow periods providing an estimate of water security the second subsurface permeability measures how well subsurface rocks within a catchment transmit water these two indices were chosen for their importance in controlling catchment flow behaviour and the relevance of the data obtainable from national datasets the inconsistency of data availability throughout australia restricted the use of other hydrogeology signatures e g seasonal water table fluctuation depth to water table or seasonal lag response to rainfall 2 2 1 baseflow index bfi baseflow is long term discharge to the river from natural storages including groundwater soil moisture or bank storage hill et al 2013 baseflow is best defined as the component of streamflow that is not allocated to quickflow e g overland runoff interflow and direct precipitation the bfi is the ratio of baseflow volume to total streamflow volume for a specified time period groundwater typically contributes the largest volume to baseflow bfi is therefore an indicator of stream reliance on groundwater input baseflow is recognised as an important component of the total flood hydrograph particularly in areas of high bfi and for smaller or frequent flood events hill et al 2013 this is especially applicable when catchments contain aquifers with high yield brown et al 2011 many methods for bfi derivation exist most of which involve analyses of hydrographs to separate the baseflow component for project 7 of the updated australian rainfall and runoff guidelines methods were developed to estimate bfi values for ungauged catchments from catchment characteristics such as geological conditions soil type climate and topography brown et al 2011 murphy et al 2011 those characteristics are used independently in the multivariate analysis of this study therefore the bfi is calculated from the hydrographs available streamflow data section 2 1 recursive digital filters are among the commonly applied approaches to derive baseflow characteristics singh et al 2019 su et al 2016 including the low pass filtering technique by lyne and hollick 1979 their popularity at least partially stems from their ease of automation and the reproducibility of results however the pertinence of the lyne hollick method is regionally dependent and may also vary for individual events kinkela and pearce 2014 quickflow and baseflow components of streamflow were separated from hydrograph data by applying the recursive digital filter method lyne and hollick 1979 f k a f k 1 1 a 2 y k y k 1 y k f k 0 where fk is the filtered quick response at the k th sampling instant yk is the original streamflow a is the filter parameter and yk fk is the filtered baseflow a filter value a of 0 98 was adopted following the recommendation by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and skm csiro and skm 2010 the filter was applied to the streamflow data three times 1 forward pass filtering yk original streamflow initial quickflow f1 set to zero 2 reverse pass filtering to nullify any phase distortion of the data because of the forward pass of the filter yk filtered baseflow derived in step 1 and 3 forward pass filtering for further flow separation yk filtered baseflow calculated in step 2 lyne and hollick 1979 short streamflow data gaps 7 days were filled via linear interpolation longer gaps were treated as breaks in the data unbroken interpolated streamflow records covering a minimum period of four years were individually utilised to derive baseflow estimates for each gauging site the bfi for that stream gauge was then obtained by dividing the combined total baseflow of all these periods by the corresponding total streamflow fig 2 a to obtain seasonal indices the baseflow estimates were split into austral summer november to april fig 2c and winter may to october fig 2d periods with bfis derived by dividing the relevant seasonal total baseflow by the analogous total streamflow the ratio of the two seasonal bfis ratio of winter to summer bfi singh et al 2019 was also calculated fig 2b the distribution of the resulting bfi ratios was distinctly right skewed therefore the logarithmic form was extracted as well the bfi was included in the surface hydrology analysis table 2 to determine subcatchment predictors significantly correlated with streamflow dynamics regulated releases make river levels artificially higher in the dry months the calculation of baseflow indices in regulated rivers is thus problematic with bfis for such streams overestimating baseflow the bfi may be computed from data spanning as little as two years meyboom 1961 but if results are intended as direct inputs for rainfall runoff or flood models ten years of data or more are recommended hill et al 2013 for hydrological studies such as this it is preferable to include as many sites as feasible to maximise catchment characterisation without compromising the quality of the variables 2 2 2 subsurface permeability permeability k m2 is a property of soils rocks and sediments the attribute describes how quickly water flows into or through an aquifer or aquitard and the volume of such flux this study focused on permeability of near surface aquifers rather than hydraulic conductivity because the latter can be derived from the former permeability allocation was obtained from the australian hydrological geospatial fabric ahgf or geofabric http www bom gov au water geofabric index shtml groundwater cartography product v2 1 1 this database contains the greatest detail for the australian continent cf global datasets of dürr et al 2005 hartmann and moosdorf 2012 the geofabric contains a map of surface hydrogeological units based on the 1 1 000 000 scale surface geology map geoscience australia 2012 these units fall within the categories hydrogeological complexes nmax 48 defined in the national aquifer framework naf http www bom gov au water groundwater naf table 3 shows a list of relevant complexes surface lithology most commonly reflects subsurface lithology at shallow depth hence it is assumed that the surface lithology is representative of the shallow subsurface 50 m however subsurface permeability is often very heterogeneous in nature and reliable estimates are difficult to obtain even for individual subcatchments calver 2001 shanafield and cook 2014 surface lithology types were then allocated a permeability category table 3 and table 4 gleeson et al 2011 collated 230 regional saturated permeability ks values from global calibrated groundwater models predominantly from north america none from australia to produce averages for generalised hydrolithology groups table 4 the mean permeability values are expressed as logarithmic permeability log ks in table 4 and represent saturated permeability at a regional scale 5 km for this study the hydrogeological complexes of the geofabric were allocated a ks value according to their lithological descriptions refer to ks group numbers table 3 and table 4 for example both upper tertiary quaternary aquifer porous media unconsolidated and lower tertiary aquifer porous media unconsolidated are allocated as ks group 1 coarse grain unconsolidated because they are termed aquifers as opposed to aquitards denoting higher permeability and unconsolidated sediment 2 3 topography and subcatchment delineation the continent scale national river basin boundary nrbb dataset geoscience australia 1997 based on topographical and hydrological interpretation provides a commonly adopted definition of 233 river basins catchments across mainland australia and tasmania however the spatial scale of these river basins is too coarse to be sensitive to the full range of flood related parameters used in this study therefore the river basins of the nrbb dataset were further divided into subcatchments determined from the horton 1945 5th order stream definition and the national topographic vector database geoscience australia 2006 resulting in subcatchments large enough to enable meaningful comparisons and small enough to allow for computing power and timeframe constraints the upstream area of 6th and higher order waterways i e downstream subcatchments does account for upstream subcatchment areas the nrbb dataset was used as the primary layer to clip both the topographical vector database geoscience australia 2006 and the digital elevation model dem geoscience australia 2011 into 233 separate basins via the arcgis software v9 3 1 an external buffer zone of 10 km was applied to each river basin when clipping the dem to ensure reliable identification of the catchment margin the buffer zone was specifically required because the nrbb dataset is not based on the dem with the applied basin boundaries therefore not necessarily agreeing with the elevation data the centroid of each river basin was used to determine its appropriate map grid of australia mga zone zones 50 to 56 the basin data including dems were then projected into their relevant mga zone the gis based software package catchmentsim version 3 0 3 1 was employed to divide the river basins into subcatchments on a horton s 5th order stream basis and a 3 arc second raster dem fig 3 this involved the generation of streams within the software from stream initiation points derived from the existing mapped stream networks the catchmentsim catchment breakup approach used a horton stream ordering algorithm which delineates subcatchments of a particular horton order based on the vector stream network every segment of 6th and higher order streams is defined as a separate subcatchment however if multiple 5th and higher order streams entered the ocean within the same nrbb defined catchment these were treated as the same subcatchment by the software fig 3c in total 2816 subcatchments were obtained in addition to the delineation of the river basin subcatchments catchmentsim was also used to calculate topographical variables for each subcatchment these derived datasets were reprojected from their mga zone to a geographic coordinate system the geocentric datum of australia 1994 gda94 to enable merging into a single coherent national dataset in total eighteen catchmentsim indices were utilised in this study cf topography predictors in table 5 basin boundaries of the nationally defined river basin dataset geoscience australia 1997 provided the initial spatial division for the analysis in some instances e g the murray darling river basin the defined river basins flow from one into another within a larger drainage network stream orders are reset within each river basin despite channels being part of a continuing larger drainage network this resetting affects the determination of the bifurcation ratio in larger catchments incorporating multiple basins because a large watercourse is re assigned a stream order of 1 when flowing between basins this effect highlights a limitation of using river basins to define the spatial areas for a nation wide study likewise the river basin boundaries in the geoscience australia 1997 dataset can adversely impact calculation of total upstream area for each subcatchment when these river basins are part of a larger drainage network hence the total upstream area may be underestimated for the murray darling river system catchmentsim derived upstream areas of affected subcatchments were manually adjusted to include relevant areas from adjacent basins catchmentsim identifies main channel flow while ignoring braided and anabranching channels therefore horton s drainage density hdd a measure of the total stream channel length per unit area may be underestimated in low gradient catchments 2 4 climate rainfall data are available across australia with the bom weather station network consisting of over 17 700 sites all rainfall station records were accessed directly from bom s climate data online cdo http www bom gov au climate data website in october 2017 by default the cdo database only includes data that are deemed of acceptable quality or were not yet quality checked once downloaded multi day rainfall totals covering a 2 to 4 day period were transformed into a daily average over the relevant period conversely multi day rainfall values over 5 day or longer periods were removed to reduce a potential positive bias in annual rain days rainfall stations with at least 30 years of data n 8539 fig 4 a were used to extract six variables for this study table 5 two of these indices required the additional stipulation of a minimum of thirty years with near complete 350 days of yearly rainfall records at individual stations reducing the data subset to n 7880 rainfall has a distinct non uniform seasonal pattern in many australian regions for instance winter rainfall is prevalent in the southwest and tasmania conversely in most parts of the country including northern australia and the eastern coast of the mainland rainfall is summer dominant australia s tropical regions are characterised by a summer wet season defined by the bom as november to april this period was applied to define a rainfall seasonality variable rainfall for the period november to april was divided by the total yearly rainfall to obtain rainfall percentage in summer season the index average number of rain days is defined as any day with a minimum precipitation of 0 2 mm both predictors were calculated from data of years with near complete records 350 days with data australian rainfall data are characterised by a large number of days without rainfall and a right hand skew representing several extreme events four variables were derived by applying the method of l moments based on the reduced rainfall dataset rain days only for each rainfall station the first four l moments were computed the bom network of stations with evaporation n 632 or mslp n 930 data is significantly smaller than the rainfall dataset fig 4 after removal of records flagged by the bom s internal quality control the remaining values were used if the station record exceeded two years n 532 for evaporation and n 799 for mslp fig 4b c the evaporation and mslp data were split into summer november april and winter seasons may october the first three l moments were then applied to both seasons separately producing six descriptors for both evaporation and mslp table 5 values for each of the eighteen climate variables were assigned to individual subcatchments in a multi step process for every subcatchments with relevant station measurements each climate statistic within the polygon was averaged to assign a single value to that subcatchment a radial basis function interpolation was applied using arcgis v10 4 to allocate values to catchments without climate stations 2 5 surface condition the surface effect of either absorbing or repelling water is the greatest impact soil geology and land use have on catchment response to rainfall the term surface condition is used to incorporate the key variables of soil geology and land use influencing flood response to determine a numerical value useful in later statistical analysis a method representative of australian surface conditions or the relative surface state between absorbent and repellent was developed the diverse soil descriptions were aggregated into a simple relative rank land surface value lsv incorporating key parameters such as permeability texture and absorbance clay content and behaviour depth of soil profile incorporating geological outcrop and anthropogenic land use effects fig 5 the simplicity of this ranking approach in contrast to detailed soil description aligns with the australia wide resolution of catchment response analysis for this study to calculate lsvs national soils and geology data were first assessed to allocate a field capacity score fcs based on soil classification depth and texture fig 5 field capacity is defined as the maximum bulk water content retained in soil at 33 j kg of hydraulic head veihmeyer and hendrickson 1931 more generally the term is used to indicate the volume of stored water within a soil profile necessary to initiate permanent surface pooling or runoff this measurement is an indication of the potential for soil to absorb water low field capacity reflects limited ability to absorb water whereas high field capacity suggests the reverse field capacity is controlled largely by soil texture and composition and these characteristics are accounted for in the soil classification depth of soil profile and texture ranks as described in the australian soil classification asc ashton and mckenzie 2001 a more detailed description of field capacity score determination is provided in section 2 5 1 land use was characterised with a scoring range of 7 to 7 this land use score lus was allocated based on land use practices that improve or diminish soil field capacity section 2 5 2 outlines lus determination in more detail a final lsv was then assigned to the land surface by aggregating the fcs and lus section 2 5 3 fig 6 2 5 1 field capacity score fcs determination soil and geology throughout australia were assessed by evaluating the soil classification and distribution of csiro s digital atlas of australian soils daas https www asris csiro au themes atlas html atlas digital the soil codes of the atlas classification 3000 soil descriptions were converted into the asc as per ashton and mckenzie 2001 grouping the data into thirteen soil types fig 5 permeability and water holding property descriptions from widely used sources australian soil club http www soil org au mckenzie et al 2004 victorian resources online http vro agriculture vic gov au dpi vro vrosite nsf pages soil home were utilised to conduct an initial assessment of soil field capacity to address the thirteen major soil groups this evaluation assigned a rank score of 1 to 5 describing the permeability of the thirteen soil units by averaging the ranks used in the three available categorisation systems fig 5 assigning fcs on the basis of the asc ashton and mckenzie 2001 alone has its limitations general descriptions do not consider factors such as the depth of the profile to bed rock which in some instances may be minimal to account for this the descriptions in daas were reviewed to determine the depth to rock and the amount of rock outcrop within each mapped unit for each map unit the soil profile was categorised as class a rock outcrop geology class b rock outcrop skeletal shallow soil cover over rock class c rock outcrop moderated soil cover over rock or class d soil fig 5 to define the overall fcs further assessment of the soil texture was also required daas descriptions give thirteen classes of soil texture these were converted to a rank score of 1 to 7 assigned on the basis of textural classes from the existing classification as per charman 1978 the three ranks derived from each of the three categories described earlier i e soil classification depth and texture were combined into a three point soil code with a sequential nomenclature for example a calcarasol with thick soil profile and calcareous earth texture would code 3d4 there are 676 possible permutations of code combinations but only 80 of these were identified across australia hence only these 80 codes or map units are used in further analysis cf table b 1 for the full list of soil codes allocation of fcs for each of the 80 codes was based on interpreting a significance weighting for each component of the soil code by applying a priori knowledge of their context composition and soil profile arrangement for each soil code the three ranked factors may have varying degrees of dominance strong interactions or in some instances conflicting interactions therefore the relative weighting of factors was considered for each individual code resulting in nine characteristic weighting trends that formed the basis of fcs allocation see appendix b 2 for fcs allocation rationale final fcs ranged from 1 to 7 with 1 representing high field capacity and 7 low field capacity 2 5 2 land use score lus determination national land use data version 4 2005 06 were obtained from the national department of agriculture scale land use https www agriculture gov au abares aclump land use data download detailed vector land use data for each state and territory were merged into single coverage for the entire country all land uses table b 3 were assigned a unique lus value based on whether the land use would negatively affect field capacity i e reduce field capacity values 1 to 7 positively affect field capacity i e increase field capacity 1 to 7 or make no difference 0 a complete list of land use and allocated lus is provided in appendix b 3 2 5 3 land surface value lsv determination scores from the soil field capacity and the land use analyses were combined to allocate an lsv between 7 and 14 fig 6 this step reveals the impact of land use on field capacity as positive low field capacity negative high field capacity or neutral there are several situations however when the end members of both soil geology field capacity and land use may dominate the impact on absolute field capacity consequently soil codes allocated an fcs of 7 rocky areas excluding sandstones or land use allotted an lus of 7 high density urban and industrial areas were assigned an lsv of 14 conversely land use allocated an lus of 7 water bodies such as dams and reservoirs were assigned an lsv of 7 regardless of the fcs value 2 6 numerical methods a principal component analysis pca based on a correlation matrix and varimax rotation was performed on the twenty surface hydrology and bfi variables reducing these to six surface hydrology principal components pcs the bfi was derived from surface water information therefore reflecting streamflow conditions thus the index was included with the surface hydrological data one stream gauge is situated on an island a5130501 kangaroo island this site was excluded from further statistical analyses because the subcatchment delineation is limited to mainland australia and tasmania a correlation analysis based on the pearson correlation coefficient was performed between each subcatchment variable and the six surface hydrology pcs representing streamflow with the aim of determining the relative significance of the relationship between these descriptors cf section 2 and appendix a the correlation analysis may identify significantly related indices but is unable to establish whether there is a causal link between the two variables hence a false positive type i error may occur especially when the total number of compared indices is high the šidák correction factor αs šidák 1967 was applied to reduce the false positive error rate α s 1 1 α 1 n p for np equal to forty catchment descriptors and significance level α of 0 05 a šidák correction factor of 0 0013 is obtained thus the correlation is deemed significant at the šidák correction level if the p value does not exceed 0 0013 the results provide context for the relative importance of each index in predicting streamflow dynamics a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using software xlstat its linear regression tool permits the extraction of the best model per predictor number along with associated criteria such as the bayesian information criterion bic the akaike s information criterion aic and the adjusted r2 r2 adj the bic penalises overfitting more heavily than the aic whereas the r2 adj is most lenient henceforth the xlstat output is referred to as the best regression model brm results an additional more detailed regression analysis was then applied in matlab to explore all possible combinations with up to six input variables similar to saft et al 2016 this computationally demanding method equates to 4 6 million regression models per pc these 6max predictor regression models were then assessed using several criteria including the r2 adj penalising for extra predictors aic the aicc correcting for small sample size and the bic to evaluate the proportion of evidence for each predictor the relative difference was calculated for three criteria aic aicc bic δ aic i aic i aic min where aicmin is the model with the lowest best aic value and i refers to the ith model the model weights w for each pc were then calculated as follows w i p c e δ a i c i p c 2 e δ a i c all p c 2 finally the combined total proportion of evidence tpe of every predictor p was obtained for each pc by adding all weights of models that contained the predictor t p e p p c w p p c a large proportion 76 7 of the selected station network is located in non perennial waterways and these sites therefore have a uniform low flow of 0 m3 s yet these locations are characterised by diverse catchment properties their link to streamflow potentially masked by their non perennial status that are intermittent to ephemeral in nature cf vidal abarca et al 2020 thus the correlation and regression analyses were repeated for a subset n 175 that excludes all non perennial systems 3 results six pcs summarise the twenty surface hydrology variables table a 2 and fig a 1 accounting for a combined total of 91 4 of the variance pc1 relates to the severity of extreme flow events the probability of extreme flow events and baseflow attributes are characterised by pc2 the low flow conditions are summarised with pc3 whereas the frequency of high flow events is represented by pc4 pc5 explains the difference ratio between baseflow during summer and winter whereas pc6 refers to general seasonal and long term baseflow conditions the correlation analysis between subcatchment variables and the six surface hydrology pcs fig 7 revealed distinct links between catchment characteristics and streamflow these pc specific connections are subsequently discussed in more detail among the applied criteria the bic most heavily penalises overfitting thus the smallest brm sizes are consistently attributed to the bic the difference in selected predictor numbers between the various selection criteria aic bic and r2 adj is generally greater when the model strength is lower i e lower r2 adj in addition the increase in fitting performance tends to plateau after about four predictors for most pcs comparable to the result by saft et al 2016 however the fitting pattern is pc and sample dependent for pc1 the predictive gain is reduced after the inclusion of the second variable when all streams are considered whereas the perennial stream subset exhibits a strong preference for six predictors in agreement with the bic selected brm conversely the fitting performance for pc2 suggests a relatively large predictor number minimum of seven regardless of whether non perennial sites are excluded the 6max predictor regression models yielded comparable tpe results independently of the applied criterion aic aicc or bic for the better performing predictors bic fig a 2 tends to have slightly lower tpe values subsequently the lowest tpe result for individual predictors will be presented 3 1 pc1 pc1 predominantly characterises extreme maximum mean peak and mean flow conditions and flow variability sd both the linear variables and their logarithmic counterparts are represented in pc1 fig a 1 this pc is more closely associated with climatic characteristics rather than intrinsic catchment properties fifteen out of 18 climate metrics are significantly correlated with pc1 based on the more stringent šidák correction factor p values 0 0013 including all mslp indices fig 7 among the non climatic predictors variability of subsurface permeability and lsv average lsv and main stream slope are the variables with the strongest association with pc1 the brm test in xlstat returned linear equations of distinctly different size n dependent on whether the aic n 25 or bic n 8 were applied as the decisive criterion table 6 their respective r2 adj values are moderately high at 0 399 and 0 375 all predictors in the bic model are also included in the more complex aic selection among these are mean summer evaporation and mslp all winter mslp characteristics main stream slope and variability of subsurface permeability the greatest tpe for pc1 was obtained by variability of subsurface permeability 0 999aic followed by mean summer mslp 0 916aic mean winter 0 470bic and mean summer evaporation 0 380bic 3 2 pc2 pc2 mainly embodies the probability of extreme flow events l moments 3 5 and to a lesser extent baseflow attributes similar to pc1 the list of predictors significantly correlated with pc2 is also dominated by climate variables 16 indices slope related attributes including slope of the main stream channel are among significantly linked intrinsic catchment properties p values 0 0013 compared with the other pcs the brm provided the most optimal results for pc2 in terms of both r2 adj 0 600 and 0 596 and level of agreement between the aic and bic preferred output n of 19 and 15 respectively table 6 both aic and bic mostly incorporated climate metrics including annual rainfall days rainfall percentage in summer all mslp variables and most evaporation characteristics in addition variability of elevation and subsurface permeability are deemed significant predictors of pc2 for pc2 six variables have tpe greater than 0 970 variability of subsurface permeability mean winter mslp mslp variability in both seasons the number of rain days and rainfall kurtosis whereas the remainder have tpe below 0 030 3 3 pc3 pc3 characterising low flow conditions represented by minimum flow has the fewest number of predictors that are significantly correlated p values 0 0013 these include slope hdd the bifurcation ratio and the number of annual rain days the brm indicates a relatively poor fit when a linear relationship between catchment characteristics and pc3 is assumed table 6 the bic preferred model size is four r2 adj 0 122 whereas the aic produces a much more complex output without notable gain in explanatory power n 28 r2 adj 0 167 the predictors in the bic model are average slope bifurcation ratio main stream slope and annual rain days the tpes for pc3 are dominated by bifurcation ratio average slope main stream slope and annual rain days all above 0 990 whereas hdd reached a tpebic of 0 530 3 4 pc4 a broad range of predictors is significantly linked to pc4 representative of the frequency of high flow events p values 0 0013 twenty eight catchment variables are significantly related to pc4 at the šidák correction level p value 0 0013 fig 7 and table a 3 notably absent from the 28 significant predictors are most rainfall indices except for annual rain days the r2 adj values of the brm are quite high for both the aic r2 adj 0 452 n 29 and bic r2 adj 0 423 n 15 table 6 stream density hdd lsv properties annual rain days rainfall skewness and various evaporation and mslp features are among the variables significantly linked to pc4 variability of evaporation in both seasons and summer mslp explains most of pc4 tpe 0 980 whereas hdd lsv variability and rainfall kurtosis have tpe values ranging from 0 699bic to 0 752bic 3 5 pc5 pc5 exemplifies the ratio of winter to summer bfi climate metrics are again the most prominent indices significantly associated with pc5 p values 0 0013 relevant non climatic intrinsic predictors are limited to elevation characteristics and variability of subsurface permeability along with pc2 the brm fits are among the poorest of the six pcs table 6 in addition both aic n 12 r2 adj 0 143 and bic n 4 r2 adj 0 127 produced the smallest model size compared to the other pcs the bic preferred model incorporated variability of subsurface permeability skewness of winter evaporation and summer mslp and mean winter mslp for pc5 the skewness of winter evaporation tpe of 0 837bic is the most relevant predictor followed by subsurface permeability 0 441bic and mean winter mslp 0 410bic 3 6 pc6 baseflow conditions are summarised by pc6 twenty nine predictors are significantly connected to pc6 p values 0 0013 including a wide range of climatic and in situ properties the brm analysis produced a moderate fit for both aic r2 adj 0 350 n 28 and bic r2 adj 0 303 n 5 bic relevant metrics are maximum elevation lsv variability annual rain days rainfall kurtosis and mslp variability in winter annual rain days 0 989bic and maximum elevation 0 892bic have the highest tpe for pc6 with winter mslp and lsv variability summer rainfall proportion and rainfall kurtosis all having tpes greater than 0 5 4 discussion forty subcatchment specific metrics were investigated for their connection to australian streamflow properties that were summarised with six pcs all examined catchment variables exhibited significant links to surface hydrology table 7 rainfall attributes have an overwhelming influence on extreme flow events and their likelihood conversely low flow periods are more dependent on in situ conditions including topographical features and subsurface permeability these results are thus in close agreement with previous studies that explored controls of streamflow patterns e g kuentz et al 2017 out of the forty catchment descriptors upstream area and channel skewness were the only attributes not significantly correlated with one of the six surface hydrology pcs at the more stringent šidák correction factor 0 0013 when the full dataset was investigated nevertheless with p values of 0 021 channel skewness vs pc4 and 0 0016 upstream area vs pc6 significant connections were still evident at more traditional cut off levels further upstream area is significantly correlated with four pcs at the šidák correction level when non perennial waterways are removed streams in upper subcatchments have a greater tendency to be non perennial and their exclusion leads to greater prevalence of higher order streams in relative terms consequently upstream area becomes more pertinent the link between channel skewness and pc4 is mainly attributable to the variable s correlation with the average number of flow peaks in a year p value 0 013 this link between channel skewness and annual number of flow peaks may partially be of an indirect nature because both features are significantly related to topographical attributes pertaining to stream length e g average flow length and elevation e g median elevation catchments with lower vertical relief or shorter stream lengths have a greater tendency for higher channel skewness higher channel skewness synonymous with a more asymmetrical drainage pattern results in less efficient flows into streams in some areas thus impacting on local flow conditions hence the positive relationship between channel skewness and pc4 suggests a greater propensity for more frequent flow peaks when channel skewness is high the statistical findings are subsequently discussed separately for each pc 4 1 extreme flow severity higher mean daily rainfall 1st l moment rainfall variability and summer rain percentage are all strongly linked to extreme streamflow represented by pc1 fig 8 a conversely the number of rain days per year is negatively correlated with the occurrence of extreme flood events with more rain days less likely to result in extreme flood events subcatchments with few rainy days per year tend to be associated with high mean daily rainfall 1st l moment and therefore higher probability of extreme flow events the positive relationship between seasonal mean daily evaporation 1st l moment and pc1 is expected because evaporation is inversely related to the number of rain days rain free days have a greater propensity for cloud free conditions and increased evaporation the negative association of mean mslp conditions 1st l moment with pc1 indicates the importance of low pressure systems and the consequential enhancement of rainfall associated with these weather patterns e g tropical lows east coast lows and troughs the relevance of mean summer mslp is also reflected by its high tpe for pc1 0 916aic figure a 2 variability of subsurface permeability and lsv along with average lsv are the non climatic metrics with the strongest association with pc1 the 6max predictor regression model test identified subsurface permeability variability as the index with the highest tpe 0 999 this attribute is negatively correlated with pc1 suggesting that greater variability in subsurface property permits a greater proportion of runoff to infiltrate underground potentially reducing the severity of extreme flow events only one topographical trait main stream slope exhibits a correlation significant at the šidák correction level p value 0 0013 table a 3 however several additional topographical descriptors relating to elevation longest flow path slope maximum elevation vertical range and average slope have p values below 0 01 all five topographical indices are positively correlated with the annual number of rain days whereas the three slope attributes have an inverse relation to mean daily rainfall consequently the negative correlation between these topographical variables and pc1 is partially attributable to the propensity for more frequent light rainfall events e g drizzly conditions in elevated terrain compared with areas closer to sea level in addition a significant proportion of the strong relationships will stem from the applied method basins with stream orders greater than five were further subdivided into subcatchments fig 3 thus upper subcatchments will generally be characterised by higher topography steeper slopes and usually also more varied elevation in contrast to the lower subcatchments that will mostly typify a more uniform low relief landscape because upstream flows will ultimately accumulate and reach the lower subcatchment higher flow volumes are expected in the latter hence producing a negative relationship with topographical elevation variability and gradient 4 2 extreme flow event probability and baseflow properties pc2 embodies both the probability of extreme flow events l moments 3 to 5 and to a lesser degree baseflow attributes when streamflow is highly variable as reflected by larger values for l moments 3 5 baseflow yield tends to be lower particularly during summer comparable to pc1 pc2 is most strongly linked to climate indices fig 7 consequently most of the climatic description for pc1 section 3 1 also applies to pc2 however contrary to pc1 l moments 3 and 4 of daily rainfall both exhibit significant positively correlated relationships with pc2 this result is not unexpected when the robust link between rainfall and runoff is considered with pc2 to a large extent defined by streamflow l moments 3 to 5 greater positive skewness and kurtosis both indicate heavier more pronounced tails translating to a greater prominence of days with extreme rainfall and elevated streamflow the strong correlation between percent summer rainfall november april and average daily flow describes non perennial watercourses in areas with highly seasonal rainfall further more extreme rainfall tends to be experienced in regions with predominant summer rainfall a pattern confirmed by the correlation analysis consequently a concomitant increase in potential extreme flows is expected fig 8b to an even greater extent than for pc1 topographical descriptor main stream slope is also significantly connected to pc2 in addition to longest flow path slope mean slope and elevation variability low vertical relief general absence of steep slopes and dominance of flood plains particularly if in conjunction with large area in steeper upstream subcatchments can result in water backing up or flows slowing especially when constriction points are present consequently streamflow levels tend to be elevated for extended periods in areas of poor drainage leading to a larger proportion of days with elevated flows i e more highly skewed flow patterns among non climate variables lsv has the strongest connection with pc2 p value 0 0013 table a 3 high lsvs particularly in conjunction with low subsurface permeability denote a larger proportion of rainfall converting to runoff because of low infiltration rates hence lsv is strongly associated with extreme flow probability pc2 also strongly represents bfi the higher the pc2 value the lower the expected bfi bfi has a strong negative association with evaporation whereas regular rainfall higher number of annual rain days promotes baseflow by increasing soil saturation in addition steeper topography facilitates soil water drainage encouraging elevated baseflow in these areas price 2011 hale and mcdonnell 2016 have specifically linked more permeable subsurfaces to longer mean transit times of baseflow buffering the river system to rainfall variability here we have found that subsurface permeability and its extent of spatial uniformity are inversely linked to mean seasonal and long term bfi thus greater subsurface permeability and heterogeneity thereof are suggested to result in reduced baseflow potentially a reaction to increased infiltration to deeper groundwater systems the correlation results for perennial streams confirmed the negative relationship between long term and seasonal bfis and subsurface permeability whereas the link with variability of subsurface permeability was less conclusive 4 3 low flow conditions a relatively small number of catchment variables is significantly linked to pc3 low flow represented by flow minima fig 7 based on the šidák correction level although the number increases more than threefold when the more lenient threshold level is applied α 0 05 table a 3 in contrast to the preceding pcs climate variables have a subordinate role in determining pc3 values and accordingly minimum flow levels although the number of annual rain days is important as also evidenced by its incorporation into the brms fig 8d pc3 has the strongest connection with bifurcation ratio with its link to hdd also significant at the šidák correction factor 0 0013 higher values for these morphometric parameters suggest a shorter time for the discharge to exit the catchment although this can amplify flood risk by increasing peak discharge streamflow can also more quickly return to low levels after high flow events thus encouraging lower flow minima and explaining the inverse relationship between bifurcation ratios and pc3 previous studies in mountainous regions of puerto rico garcia martinó et al 1996 and the southeastern unites states price et al 2011 have also highlighted hdd as a key predictor of low flow behaviour with a reverse association between low flow and hdd in agreement with our findings however contrary to our result price et al 2011 have found a positive relationship between low flow and bifurcation ratio the contrasting results can possibly be attributed to differences in low flow definitions low flow threshold over a certain period vs absolute flow minimum along with dissimilarities in study scale and location the connection with mean slope is more complex although steeper slopes encourage rapid runoff thus permitting a more rapid reversion to low flows these regions are also commonly associated with a greater number of rainfall days per annum such rainy conditions are not conducive to low flow minima explaining the positive relationship between mean slope and pc3 low flow conditions the relatively poor performance of the pc3 regression models and low number of predictors that are significantly correlated with this pc can at least partially be ascribed to the large number of non perennial streams i e minimum streamflow values of 0 m3 s in australia of the 750 gauges used for this analysis 76 7 are situated in sites of intermittent or ephemeral flow the diverse catchment properties of these non perennial settings result in overall poorer performance of the statistical tests when the correlation analysis is repeated by omitting the non perennial streams upstream area and mean mslp in winter in addition to bifurcation ratio and hdd exhibit a significantly positive relationship with pc3 p value 0 0013 and thus low flow conditions even though the statistical power is reduced by the smaller dataset n 175 larger catchment areas will permit greater accumulation of flows thus increasing the minimum runoff volume conversely lower mean mslps suggest a higher propensity for rainfall in the cooler months thus producing runoff during a period when a large proportion of australia receives limited precipitation upstream area and bifurcation ratio are also among the indices incorporated into the reduced perennial only brms with the r2 adj for aic bic augmenting from 0 167 0 122 to 0 344 0 334 in addition whereas the bic model size remained unchanged four with upstream area substituting annual number of rain days the aic model decreased from 28 to 6 thus reducing likely overparameterisation 4 3 1 the problematic case of ephemeral waterways a large proportion of australian streams is non perennial in nature some of these watercourses are classified as intermittent their seasonal flows sustained longer by groundwater supply ephemeral sites however are only recording flows for a brief duration e g a few days immediately following significant precipitation these extended periods of zero flow have substantial impacts on a range of attributes specifically the rainfall runoff relationship can be altered considerably by antecedent conditions dry spells produce crusting of soils via chemical processes hampering water infiltration in the absence of gentle pre wetting and enhancing erosion and flood risk surface crusting can also be produced by clay deposition after a significant flow event further zhang et al 2017 highlighted that the lyne hollick method applied here is not recommended for ephemeral streams because of the brief flow periods and prolonged absence of a slow flow component thus when more reliable estimates are required for ephemeral systems alternative baseflow derivation methods should be considered 4 4 high flow frequency high flow events related to pc4 are defined as any periods when streamflow surpassed the 80th percentile at that site the frequency of high flow events is predominantly dictated by the annual number of rain days as also evidenced by the negative relationship between pc4 and mean evaporation in both seasons fig 8c topography also greatly impacts on the high flow recurrence interval because of the tendency for orographic enhancement of precipitation at higher altitudes catchments with higher and more varied elevation are predisposed to a greater number of high flow events aided by the faster passage of the runoff this view is supported by the strong association between pc4 and hdd positive and flow distance negative hdd is a measure of how effectively runoff travels within a catchment all these connections suggest short duration high flow events that occur more regularly in drainage basins with high pc4 values extreme runoff events are prone to be more significant in terms of speed and instantaneous volume in catchments with a greater capacity to transmit water although the flow events also tend to be of shorter duration although the lsv metrics are not significantly correlated with pc4 they are both incorporated into the brms in addition the 6max predictor regression models attributed the highest tpe among non climatic indicators to the variability of lsv 0 742bic when the regression analysis was repeated with non perennial streams removed n 175 table a 5 the aic bic r2 adj for the brms improved from 0 452 0 423 to 0 667 0 551 despite the reduction in statistical power and a decrease in model size from 29 15 to 26 7 the regression models for perennial streams incorporated mean lsv inverse relationship and variability of subsurface permeability direct regardless of whether the aic or bic was applied as the criterion with mean lsv scoring a tpe of 0 432bic lower lsvs and their variability enhanced water infiltration or chance thereof correspond to higher pc4 and greater number of flow peaks this connection can be explained by water infiltration and consequently a more rapid reduction in streamflow this permits water levels to drop below the 80th percentile faster and thus the potential for a new flow peak to arise 4 5 seasonal baseflow difference pc5 summarises the seasonal bfi difference represented by the ratio of the winter to summer bfi values climate predictors dominate variables significantly associated with baseflow seasonality fig 8f among these predictors the 3rd l moment of winter season evaporation is the most prominent index based on the strongest inverse correlation and highest tpe 0 837bic the more extreme right skewed the distribution of evaporation the lower pc5 ratio of winter to summer bfi evaporation reduces streamflow volume consequently a more right skewed evaporation pattern during the cooler months is expected to diminish winter baseflow yields thus decreasing the winter summer bfi ratio variability of subsurface permeability has the second highest tpe 0 441bic for pc5 whereas elevation related attributes have the most significant negative correlations among the non climatic predictors with subsurface permeability inversely linked to elevation attributes a more variable permeability in lower subcatchments encourages localised water infiltration where surface flow would otherwise be more dominant further rainfall in australian catchments tends to be summer dominant hence the proportion of runoff diverting to baseflow is expected to be greater in the winter period at most sites that permit water infiltration thus potentially increasing the bfi ratio previous studies indicate that watersheds at higher altitudes tend to produce greater baseflow yields e g rumsey et al 2015 these results are confirmed here with the altitude parameters positively correlated with seasonal and long term bfi conversely elevation related predictors are inversely linked to the winter summer bfi ratio pc5 is negatively connected to summer baseflow levels therefore the derived negative relationship of elevation metrics with the winter summer bfi ratio is attributable to a more enhanced increase in mean summer baseflow with height relative to winter conditions thus reducing the ratio when the correlation and brm were repeated with the perennial watercourses n 175 table a 5 pc5 showed the most striking improvement in predictive strength the aic bic results increasing from 0 143 0 127 to 0 542 0 516 despite model sizes remaining nearly constant changing from 12 4 to 11 4 for these additional models upstream area and proportion of summer rain are important whereas elevation attributes were not significantly related these differences can be explained by several aspects firstly the full dataset of 750 gauges is much more disparate encompassing a greater diversity in terms of climate and coastal proximity making the derivation of a high performing predictive model more challenging conversely perennial streams are mostly limited to sites that are relatively near coastal including ranges feeding these coastal catchments and typified by wet conditions fig 1 these regions include southeast australia and to a lesser extent the wet tropics and southwest australia secondly lower order streams have a greater tendency to be non perennial and a comparatively large proportion of gauges in upper watersheds were thus excluded from the perennial subset with higher order waterways more prevalent in relative terms upstream area becomes more relevant and because the remaining sites are less diverse the predictive power of the brms improved 4 6 baseflow pc6 relates to winter baseflow and to a lesser degree long term and summer bfi characteristics the annual number of rain days has the weakest correlation with pc6 p value 0 730 yet this predictor has the highest tpe 0 989bic and is also incorporated into both the aic and bic brms in addition the correlation does become significant at the šidák correction level p value 0 0013 when non perennial streams are removed although atmospheric characteristics are important the influence of topography and surface condition is more pronounced when streamflow is not extremely high during extreme precipitation events most rainfall will convert to runoff because of fully saturated soils regardless of topography whereas the catchment response will be more nuanced for less intense rainfall events variables that describe elevation are the most influential topographical features with slope related traits also significantly linked to pc6 and baseflow fig 7 and fig 8e although some of these indices are also strongly connected to pc2 their relationship is reversed long term and seasonal bfis are positively related to these predictors because baseflow attributes are incorporated into pc6 with a positive trend and reversely with pc2 the connection between the elevation and slope descriptors and pc6 changed accordingly various catchment properties were previously linked to baseflow for instance post and jakeman 1996 related baseflow recession in victoria to catchment shape and slope confirming our result conversely lacey and grayson 1998 determined that the bfi is independent of topographical features in victoria with baseflow more closely associated with geology and vegetation two attributes not directly included in our investigation however mean subsurface permeability an indirect representative of geology exhibited significant inverse correlation with pc6 and bfi regardless of whether non perennial streams were excluded fig 7 and figure a 3 substantiating the importance of geology 4 7 frequency distributions the sensitivity of the l moments method to climatic extremes in seasonally arid and monsoonal zones is uncertain in the seasonally arid tropics many of the daily rainfall and streamflow values are zero with intense rainfall maxima often occurring after prolonged dry periods the recorded values will have significant influence on the 3rd and 4th l moments but the impact of these factors on the 5th l moment super skewness needs more research the method of l moments is intrinsically related to the fundamental underlying frequency distribution that is used to describe the data in australia a log pearson iii lp3 distribution was previously favoured to determine the frequency of intense rainfall events and is still widely used for australian catchment studies e g flood frequency analysis ball et al 2019 the low probability extreme rainfall events are represented in the right hand tail of these distributions and the nature of the tail varies between distributions the generalised extreme value gev distribution fitted using l moments is now the recommended method to perform frequency analysis for rainfall in most circumstances ball et al 2019 ball et al 2019 also declared however that neither gev nor lp3 may adequately embody rainfall patterns in regions affected by tropical cyclones tcs the goodness of fit of the right hand portion of the distribution and in some circumstances the left hand portion of the distribution may significantly influence the probability values obtained and the positions of the l moments for the distribution consequently if flood frequency is to be added to flood heights and velocity then research is necessary into the underlying distributions that best describe the australian rainfall data because of the large size and disparate nature of the australian landmass and varied climate no frequency distribution is expected to consistently perform best throughout the continent yet regional adjustments of frequency distributions for national scale studies are not necessarily recommended because of the difficulty in defining adequate similarity criteria for grouping catchments and climatic zones and the potential for reduced reproducibility of the scientific results 5 conclusions a variety of variables were examined to distinguish catchment types within australia that may influence runoff regimes a diverse dataset sourced from miscellaneous government agencies or sub agencies was collated for this project to derive forty catchment characteristics from the themes of climate topography land surface condition and hydrogeology table 5 their links to streamflow behaviour represented by twenty descriptors summarised by six pcs in australian drainage basins was scrutinised archive inconsistencies between agencies and states required numerical assessment and standardisation before analysis data collation aimed to provide a consistent and robust framework for the interpretation of catchments within australia the lack of geographically consistent long term rainfall and river runoff records throughout australia required methods that accommodate inconsistencies in the datasets while still producing reliable and reproducible results the correlation and regression analyses confirmed that climate variables tend to dictate streamflow behaviour especially during high flow periods this outcome is in agreement with earlier studies that attributed a relatively small role to other index types such as soils and geological attributes e g beck et al 2015 during low flow however intrinsic catchment properties like upstream area bifurcation ratio and average topographical slope within the catchment and along the main waterway become important smakhtin 2001 further investigations are required to define the relative roles of the climatic and geomorphological drivers particularly in subcatchments where they significantly interact both factors ultimately control the frequency and severity of flood response across the australian continent a degree of uncertainty in clarifying the relative influence of these factors comes from limitations in data availability because a large proportion of drainage basins remain ungauged in addition some catchment parameters such as antecedent soil moisture and temporal aspects of water table levels were recognised as important but their dynamic spatial and temporal variability disqualified their inclusion in this study these dynamic catchment attributes pertain to individual events with large spatial or temporal variability e g storm type and duration and are highlighted as an area of future focus to refine flood studies the difference in results depending on whether non perennial waterways are incorporated illustrates that streamflow response to climatic and in situ properties is regionally highly varied thus grouping of similar streams is recommended to create tailored regional models for stronger predictive performance this notion was also discussed by trancoso et al 2017 who found regional and scale dependent connections between streamflow and catchment properties several caveats are associated with this study only linearity was considered except for the logarithmic transformation of some variables when exploring the connection between catchment characteristics and streamflow properties however some catchment descriptors are likely linked to streamflow in a non linear fashion providing avenues for further research the extreme seasonality of climate and accordingly streamflow is also problematic a large proportion 76 7 of the examined streamflow gauges are situated in non perennial waterways many of these watercourses are classified as ephemeral such sites typically flow only for brief periods and are thus characterised by extended dry periods in the absence of a sustained slow flow component zhang et al 2017 highlighted that the lyne hollick method is not recommended for ephemeral streams further soil crusting is a common occurrence during prolonged dry periods affecting surface permeability and therefore infiltration rates in the absence of gentle pre wetting prior to a significant rainfall event these soil crusts enhance surface runoff ultimately elevating flood risk while these changes can be observed on a seasonal scale australia is also notorious for its interannual climate extremes jaffrés et al 2018 and extended multi annual periods of wet or drought conditions taschetto et al 2016 this variability further complicates estimations of streamflow and groundwater recharge thus also hampering management of water resources a further issue is the biased data distribution with the arid interior and tropical north underrepresented by the network of stream gauges in addition temporal records tend to be relatively brief hampering the capture of extreme events with low recurrence rates as data availability for exogenous factors like rainfall and intrinsic basin properties is more extensive their association with streamflow properties can be utilised to infer catchment response to various flow scenarios the study outcomes represent the amalgamation interpretation and summary of a large number of environmental descriptors that influence drive and interact with the distribution of water across the australian landscape the parameters chosen for statistical analyses resulted from a multidisciplinary approach to statistical methods combined with expert understanding of climatic geomorphological and hydrological systems to best interpret the results the strong connection between catchment properties and streamflow characteristics provide opportunity for regionalisation in the absence of a dense stream gauge network that leaves most subcatchments essentially ungauged credit authorship contribution

4013,tracing decomposition of organic carbon sources can balance carbon budget and reduce soil erosion targetedly however tracers may provide inaccurate source information possibly due to the instability of organic matter under different land use types little is known about which stable tracer to choose based on different erosion scenarios we therefore evaluated the availability of three commonly used tracers techniques i e bulk stable isotopes fluorescence proxies and stoichiometric ratios under different mixed end members i e woodland arable land and grassland via a laboratory scale controlled experiment combining fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem parallel factor analysis parafac bayesian isotope mixing model and three evaluation criteria bulk stable isotopes δ13c δ15n were considered to be the most suitable tracers for terrestrial organic matter sources tracing most of the r2 0 85 difference 10 especially under arable land woodland a w mixed end member followed by traditional tracers c n doc unfortunately the fluorescent indices were not suitable for terrestrial organic matter sources tracing due to the similarities between different terrestrial organic matter sources especially under grassland woodland g w mixed end member most of the p value 0 05 difference 10 our results recommend that when selecting a tracer not only the stability of the tracer should be considered but also the difference among eroded organic matter sources this study provides new insights into the validation of commonly used tracers in identifying eroded organic matter sources

soil c exported from the terrestrial sources to river quinton et al 2010 high sediment loads reduce water quality decrease aquatic biodiversity and increase water treatment costs brosinsky et al 2014 cooper et al 2015 moreover the loss of organic carbon has affected terrestrial organic carbon pool thereby exacerbating global climate change and reducing agricultural production bond lamberty and thomson 2010 waterson and canuel 2008 hence identifying the som sources of sediment is crucial brosinsky et al 2014 collins et al 2010 which can effectively support catchment management and soil and water resources conservation gaspar et al 2019 porto et al 2013 wallbrink 2004 walling 2005 tracing the sources of som require robust source tracing tools collins and walling 2002 pulley et al 2017 fluorescent indices bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios are the most commonly used som source tracers bianchi and canuel 2011 derrien et al 2017 previous studies have shown that carbon c and nitrogen n isotopes of organic matter are effective tracers for identifying the source of decomposed organic matter hu et al 2006 lambert et al 2016 liu et al 2019b mccorkle et al 2016 as the most active component of soil organic carbon saadi et al 2006 dissolved organic carbon doc has been widely used in soil organic carbon source tracing garzongarcia et al 2017 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017 due to its high source heterogeneity chantigny 2003 and low analysis cost liu et al 2021 in addition elemental concentrations ratios i e total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ratios as a simple and convenient tracer has also been used to determine the contribution ratio of organic matter sources in the catchment liu et al 2019b meanwhile the fluorescent indices have been widely used in the analysis of organic matter contribution in catchment due to the minimal labor and time for sample pre treatments the rapid analysis and low measurement cost carter et al 2003 chen et al 2004 derrien et al 2019a overall these tools have been applied in diverse environments including soils sediments pore water river lakes and oceans for several decades amiotte suchet et al 2007 benner et al 1997 derrien et al 2015 ficken et al 2000 meyers and ishiwatari 1993 toming et al 2013 wakeham 1995 zimmerman and canuel 2001 nevertheless due to the complex nature of the dynamics of most tracers in the environment their applicability in determining som source contributions have received less scrutiny guan et al 2017 zhifei et al 2016 as outlined by evrard et al 2010 franks and rowan 2000 pulley et al 2015 palazón and navas 2017 the proportion of organic matter sources in the sediments may have different results when different tracers are used uber et al 2019 in addition there is no universal recommendation on which tracers to include for different source making parameter retrieval often time consuming and costly brosinsky et al 2014 the applicability evaluation of tracers is the key to improve the accuracy of organic matter source identification li et al 2020b the following two points are the core of the evaluation 1 considering the relationship between source heterogeneity and tracer selection pulley et al 2017 uber et al 2019 and 2 considering conservative behavior of tracer including source mixing and diagenetic processes derrien shin and hur 2019b in recent years studies have begun to evaluate the applicability of tracers collins et al 2010 gaspar et al 2019 based on a series of controlled degradation experiment previous studies have fully studied the applicability of the fluorescence index biomarker to the internal and external sources of rivers lakes derrien et al 2019a derrien et al 2019b lee et al 2017 however it ignores the effect of source heterogeneity on tracer selection only using simply end members i e algae and soil which are easy to distinguish with tracers under different mixed end members the source identification accuracy of the tracer may change li et al 2020b terrestrial organic matter sources especially organic matter of different land use types have little difference which brings greater challenges to the selection of tracers and the accuracy of source identification therefore in this context we added three allochthonous som source end members i e woodland arable land grassland to form organic rich sediments artificially at known mixing ratios nevertheless the biochemical activity of the som before entering the river has a much lower impact on the tracer than the river environment uber et al 2019 thus this study only examines the conservative behavior in source mixing overall this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of three commonly used tracers techniques i e fluorescent indices bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios in identifying eroded organic matter sources therefore the following aspects are explored i to analyze chemical composition of commonly used tracers i e fluorescent indices bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios under different eroded organic matter sources and ii to study the influence of tracer selection on source identification results under different som sources mixing and iii to determine the reliable tracer under different mixed end members 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples preparation three end members i e woodland arable land and grassland characterized by different land use types as the major terrestrial organic carbon sources of artificial mixtures were selected at an eroded area in the institute of soil and water conservation of shaoyang city 111 22 e and 27 03 n hunan province south central china the soil type is zonal red soil derived from the quaternary red clay which is classified as ultisols based on the us soil taxonomy the woodland was planted with pinus massoniana c3 plant which was a type of coniferous forest with a wide distribution and abundant resources in the subtropical region epron et al 2015 the pinus massoniana accounts for 50 of the subtropical forest area which is a typical representation of woodland the grassland belongs to the great white thatch c3 plant which is not artificially planted and interfered potatoes c3 plant were planted on the arable land all year round and fertilization was carried out once in a fixed cycle each source sample was collected along 5 5 m grid transect from 0 to 5 cm depth to form a single composite sample in the field all samples are collected with a non metallic spatula and cleaned repeatedly to avoid contamination between samples the three source soils were mixed in pairs according to the mass mixing ratios of 100 0 90 10 50 50 10 90 and 0 100 respectively it is noteworthy that the sample does not add additional water during the mixing process in order to reduce the influence of other biochemical reactions on the mixture because this study only considers the influence of tracers during the mixing process of different terrestrial sources based on the above processing a total of 13 samples source and mixture were prepared the mixing experiment was conducted in triplicate finally the mixed source samples were lyophilized ground and homogenized for further analysis 2 2 analysis of tracers 2 2 1 bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios before the determination the sample was acidified with 1 m hcl to remove the inorganic carbon components and washed with deionized water until the filtrate ph was neutral all samples were analyzed connected to the isotopic ratio mass spectrometer by elemental analyzer flash 2000 ht thermo fisher scientific inc us and mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific inc us for determining the stable isotopic content of organic carbon and nitrogen and stable isotopic composition 2 2 2 fluorescent indices the concentration of doc was determined by toc analyzer shimadzu corp kyoto japan the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were determined with a f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan their relative abundances and ratios were estimated using the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the corresponding identified fractions in eem parafac the fluorescence intensity of individual identified components i e fmax of c1 c2 and c3 was used as a quantitative indicator of their concentration c1 and c2 belong to the humic like substance among them c1 be categorized as a terrestrial humic like substance zhou et al 2017 and c2 showed an excitation and emission 230 428 nm similar to those of agricultural humic like materials zhou et al 2017 unlike it c3 was characterized as representing microbial protein component the percentages of individual components in the total fluorescence i e c1 c2 and c3 are used as their quality indicator in addition the relative ratios e g c1 c2 c1 c3 c2 c3 fluorescence index fi and biological index bix were calculated from fluorescence eem huguet et al 2009 fi is considered as an indicator to distinguish terrestrial and microbial sources mainly based on structural characteristics and aromaticity differences mcknight et al 2001 the bix is primarily an indicator of the relative contribution of recent microorganisms huguet et al 2009 liao et al 2021 2 3 analysis of applicability assessment in order to evaluate the suitability of different tracers at different mixed end members we adjusted them based on previous research criteria and considering the complexity of tracing different terrigenous sources derrien et al 2019b the linear variation of individual end member abundance e g woodland arable land or grassland with artificial mixing ratio was first examined when the correlation coefficient r2 0 8 and associated p value 0 01 the tracer is considered to be linear under the mixed end member in addition the sensitivity of source identification using the tracer can be evaluated by the ratio of the measured values sm regression slope to the measured standard sd deviation a value of sm sd 0 2 is considered to be an acceptable sensitivity for source identification using this tracer derrien et al 2020 in addition this study also supplement evaluation criteria with mixing stable isotope analysis in r mixsiar model mixsiar is a bayesian mixing model which was first applied in ecological food web studies now it is increasingly being applied in tracing the source of organic matter in river basin sediments based on the mixsiar model we calculated the organic matter source contribution ratio of the samples with different mixing ratios under different mixing end members the difference between the calculated contribution ratio and the actual known contribution ratio as the degree of difference when the degree of difference is 10 it is regarded as high tracing accuracy 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of tracers under different end members the values of c n and doc showed significant differences under different end members p values 0 05 for each proxy due to the different types and amounts of organic matter input fig 1a overall c n and doc values of all end members ranged from 9 to 15 from 9 mg kg 1 to 35 mg kg 1 respectively which were consistent with previous studies garzongarcia et al 2017 liu et al 2019b the doc concentration was highest in arable land mean 32 60 1 88 mg kg 1 and lowest in woodland mean 9 27 0 25 mg kg 1 the content of doc in grassland was 11 67 0 12 mg kg 1 meanwhile the c n ratio ranged from 9 67 0 19 for woodland to 14 28 0 16 for arable land the c n ratio of grassland was between the two source types mean 11 44 0 16 the values of three source types were statistically significant as the p values were 0 05 i e p values 0 0249 and 0 0257 for c n and doc table 1 among them the significant difference in c n and doc values were observed between woodland and arable land whereas the difference between grassland and woodland was the least significant fig 1a the differences in soil vegetation and atmospheric environments involved in biogeochemical processes under different tillage systems resulted in the above differences guan et al 2017 briefly the difference between c n and doc is reflecting the organic matter input and the decomposition rate liu et al 2017 the vegetation characteristics of three soil end members showed difference leading to various organic matter decomposition rates which in turn affected the final soil organic matter content in this study the pinus massoniana was artificially planted coniferous tree species which leaves are mostly thick leathery and the cuticle is relatively developed it contains more difficult to decompose substances than broad leaved trees such as lignin cellulose tannins etc epron et al 2015 these substances formed a barrier to the decomposition of the whole cellulose compound in the litter which inhibited the decomposition of litter thus the organic matter of woodland showed a low input on the contrary liu et al 2019a showed that grassland and arable land had more fine root systems than pinus massoniana and thus higher biomass moreover the higher the nitrogen content of soil end member the stronger the microbial metabolic activity and the faster the decomposition rate chen et al 2009 the input of anthropogenic organic fertilizer such as manure and wastewater in the arable land increase the soil microbial activities and the organic matter decomposition rate thus the organic carbon content of arable land showed high abundance the values of δ13c and δ15n showed significant differences under different end members e g p values 0 0249 and 0 0249 for δ13c and δ15n due to the different photosynthetic pathways and fractionation fig 1a briefly the δ13c and δ15n of all end members ranged from 26 to 23 from 2 to 6 respectively which were consistent with previous studies bouloubassi and saliot 1993 garzongarcia et al 2017 the grassland showed relative enrichment values of δ13c 23 71 0 11 followed by slight depletion in arable land 24 47 0 09 and woodland showed the lowest abundance values 25 90 0 12 all these values indicating the c3 plants photosynthesis pathway which is depleted in δ13c the above differences were attributed to the input of new plant residues and overall isotopic fractionation during microbial decomposition zhao et al 2020 different plant residues may experience different carbon cycle paths tue et al 2011 showed that the c4 pathway δ13c 13 was easier to enrich isotope than the c3 pathway δ13c 25 in our study the woodland follow the calvin benson cycle c3 photosynthetic pathway while some grassland rely on hatch slack cycle c4 pathway werth and kuzyakov 2010 in addition zhao et al 2020 showed that older and more microbially processed som was enriched in δ13c compared to less decomposed substrates the value of δ13c from the masson pine forest was more barren due to it contained difficult to decompose substrates the δ15n concentration was enriched in arable land mean 5 93 0 11 and depleted in grassland mean 2 95 0 05 the value of δ15n was mainly affected by anthropogenic impact and agricultural activities guan et al 2017 mukundan et al 2010 mukundan et al 2012 therefore the high levels of δ15n in arable land may source from crop rotations or manure and wastewater in this study the value of fluorescent indices showed a slight difference between different end members due to similar fluorescent conjugate structures figs 1b and c birdwell and engel 2010 based on the eem model three fluorescent components were identified including c1 ex em 260 360 466 c2 ex em 250 406 and c3 ex em 220 280 420 among them the c2 accounted for the highest proportion of all components under all end members woodland accounted for 73 03 2 37 arable land accounted for 63 34 4 78 grassland accounted for 71 06 1 87 and no difference among all soil end members p 0 0539 0 05 the c1 of arable land was the highest compared to other soil end members which was 35 42 6 12 whereas the c3 was the lowest only 1 24 1 38 based on the above the c3 c1 and c3 c2 values of arable land were also the lowest compared to other end members table 1 the reason for the above phenomenon was that the chemical properties of the three soil end members only showed a subtle difference which thus influence the ecological role of fulvic acids derrien et al 2017 the high c2 confirmed that the three soil end members present high humified with high aromaticity the arable land showed the highest c1 c2 c3 c1 and c3 c1 indicated that there were more substances with aromatic conjugate structure and strong protein like fluorescence which were the result of the interaction between microorganisms and litter the humic acid in terrestrial litter and soil contained a large amount of conjugated aromatic structure under the decomposition of microorganisms the protein like fluorescence c3 was preferentially decomposed and the terrestrial organic compounds lignin etc were degraded into quinone like structures c1 or c2 huguet et al 2009 however the arable land accelerateed this decomposition and transformation process due to the influence of anthropogenic input in addition two tracers related to microbial fluorescence characteristics were tested in this study including fi and bix the abundances of fi and bix of the three end members ranged from 1 8 to 2 4 0 8 to 1 5 respectively the abundance values of fi and bix were high for all soil end members which was consistent with that for forested tropical watersheds huguet et al 2009 by contrast the high abundance of fi and bix indicated high microbial activities of soil end members liu et al 2019a soil end members contain a large amount of fulvic acid related to microbial production or transformation which is the fluorescence water solubility extracellular material and detritus produced by cell death birdwell and engel 2010 3 2 the mixing conservative behavior of tracers under different end members the value of c n changed linearly with the change of the mixing ratio p 0 05 and the linear fit was high r2 0 85 fig 2a among them the linear fit under the a w arable land woodland mixed end member was the highest r2 0 9839 followed by the a g arable land grassland mixed end member r2 0 9258 and the lowest linear fitting degree of the g w grassland woodland mixed end member r2 0 8544 for source sensitivity the sensitivity to changes of the mixing ratio the a w mixed end member was also the most prominent sm sd 0 2567 whereas the c n under the other two mixed end members was not sensitive to the change of the organic matter mixed source sm sd 0 2 in contrast the linear fit of doc was not as high as that of c n although r2 were all higher than 0 85 the linear fit of doc under the a g mixed end member was the highest r2 0 9202 fig 2a while the linear fit r2 under the other two mixed end members was about 0 86 the source sensitivity of doc was greatly affected by mixed end members specifically the source sensitivity of the doc under the a w mixed end member was the highest with a sm sd value of 0 4160 followed by the a g mixed end member sm sd 0 2090 and the sm sd value under the g w mixed end member was the lowest only 0 1288 table 2 in general the mixed conservative behavior of c n was better than that of doc which was consistent with the results of previous studies garzongarcia et al 2017 this further confirmed the stability of c n as a tracer while doc as the most active and most mobile component of soil organic carbon was not as stable as c n in addition the study showed that the source sensitivity of c n and doc were the highest under the a w mixed end member which was mainly related to the large source heterogeneity between arable land and woodland the linear fitting degree of different fluorescence indices with mixing ratio was not as high as that of doc and c n figs 2b c d e the linear fit of c2 and fi with the mixing ratio was low r2 0 7 whereas c3 c1 showed relatively high abundance r2 0 75 fig 2d in addition the linear fit of the same fluorescent indices under different mixed end members showed obvious differences the linear fitting degree of the fluorescent indices under the a w mixed end member was the highest especially c3 c1 r2 0 9497 and bix r2 0 9052 on the contrary the fluorescent indices had the lowest linear fit under the mixed g w end member among them c2 c3 c2 fi and bix did not show linear changes with the mixing ratio p 0 05 indicating these fluorescent indices did not have mixed conservative behavior for source sensitivity the sm sd of the fluorescent indices was generally low especially for c2 and fi whose sm sd 0 1 table 2 in addition the source sensitivity of fluorescent indices under the a w mixed end member was higher than that of other mixed end members the sm sd of c3 under the a w mixed end member was 0 3091 while the sm sd under other mixed end members was 0 1 in general fluorescent indices was not as conservative as other tracers during source mixing indicating that they were prone to change during the mixing process which is inconsistent with the results of previous studies on fluorescence indices in aquatic environments weom is a heterogeneous mixture of aliphatic and aromatic polymers the degree to which its composition changes over time or the process of degradation depends on the distance to the source and the time of exposure to the surface liu et al 2019b in the terrestrial environment the mixing of soils from different land use types intensifies the flow of microorganisms which in turn accelerates the degradation of the fluorescent indices in the soil the bulk stable isotopes changed linearly with the change of the mixing ratio p 0 05 and the linear fit was very high r2 0 85 fig 2f the linear fit of δ13c under the g w mixed end member r2 0 9746 was significantly the highest followed by the a w mixed end member r2 0 9377 whereas the lowest linear fit of δ13c was showed under the a g mixed end member r2 0 8716 for δ15n the linear fit of δ15n changing with the mixing ratio was also high but lower than that of δ13c the linear fitting degree of δ15n under a g mixed end member with mixing ratio was the highest r2 0 9084 by contrast there is no linear relationship of δ15n with the change of mixing ratio under the g w mixed end member p 0 05 fig 2f in general the mixed conservative behavior of bulk stable isotopes was better than other tracers this showed that bulk stable isotopes were not easy to change during the mixing process and were relatively stable tracers 3 3 the identification accuracy of tracers under different mixed end members based on the mixsiar model the source contribution ratio of each end member under different mixed end members was calculated and the difference between it and the actual contribution ratio was regarded as the contribution deviation to assess the accuracy of the tracer source identification tracers with a contribution deviation of 10 have higher source identification accuracy based on previous studies for c n the c n contribution deviations under all mixed end members were low among them the c n under the a w mixed end member and the a g mixed end member had higher identification accuracy and the contribution deviations were 5 30 10 and 8 30 10 respectively table 2 however for doc the accuracy of identifying organic matter sources for all doc under all mixed end members was low contribution deviations 10 among which the contribution deviation value of g w mixed end members was the highest which was 20 73 indicating that it misidentified the source of organic carbon contribution in general for the tracer the contribution deviation value of doc was generally higher than c n meanwhile for all the mixed end member the contribution deviation value of c n and doc under the g w mixed end member was the highest fig 3 for δ15n the calculated contribution ratio of δ15n under the g w mixed end member seriously deviates from the actual contribution ratio that is the contribution deviation reaches 42 57 in contrast the contribution deviations of the a w mixed end member and a g mixed end member were both lower which were 4 37 and 6 83 respectively compared with the instability of the contribution deviation of δ15n in different mixed end members the contribution deviation of δ13c under all mixed end members was lower among them the contribution deviation of δ13c under the g w mixed end member was only 4 23 for the fluorescent indices the contribution deviations of tracers under different properties showed obvious differences fig 3 3 4 implications for the applicability of tracers under different mixed end members in this study the identification accuracy of common tracers under different mixing end members was evaluated and compared with the artificial sediments composed of different terrestrial organic matter sources at different mixing ratios the tracers mentioned above all have the potential to identify eroded organic matter sources however the tracers showed different tracing accuracy based on different mixed organic mater sources this study provides strong evidence for the selection of tracers under different mixed end members bulk stable isotopes δ13c δ15n had a strong ability and robustness in estimating the contribution of terrestrial artificial mixtures due to their high level of mixing conservation and degradation resistance followed by traditional tracers c n doc due to the different characteristics of organic matter input and microbial decomposition rate amon g different end members the δ13c under g w mixed end member p value of source heterogeneity 0 05 r2 of linearity 0 9746 sm sd 0 3531 difference 4 23 respectively however the fluorescent indices were not suitable for terrestrial organic matter sources tracing fluorescent indices were derived from a mobile carbon source in the soil which was easily degraded by soil microorganisms kowalczuk et al 2009 on the other hand different terrestrial organic matter was rich in humic like fluorescence compared to protein rich endogenous sources which leads to poor heterogeneity of fluorescent indices among different terrestrial sources ran et al 2021 4 conclusion the study found that there are significant differences in the identification accuracy of the tracer under different erosion scenarios which is mainly related to the conservative behavior of the tracer and the heterogeneity of the selected end member based on controlled experiments we found that there was no significant difference in the organic matter characteristics between grassland end member and forest end member so the discrimination accuracy of most tracers was not high in the g w

4013,tracing decomposition of organic carbon sources can balance carbon budget and reduce soil erosion targetedly however tracers may provide inaccurate source information possibly due to the instability of organic matter under different land use types little is known about which stable tracer to choose based on different erosion scenarios we therefore evaluated the availability of three commonly used tracers techniques i e bulk stable isotopes fluorescence proxies and stoichiometric ratios under different mixed end members i e woodland arable land and grassland via a laboratory scale controlled experiment combining fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem parallel factor analysis parafac bayesian isotope mixing model and three evaluation criteria bulk stable isotopes δ13c δ15n

be considered but also the difference among eroded organic matter sources this study provides new insights into the validation of commonly used tracers in identifying eroded organic matter sources

cooper et al 2015 moreover the loss of organic carbon has affected terrestrial organic carbon pool thereby exacerbating global climate change and reducing agricultural production bond lamberty and thomson 2010 waterson and canuel 2008 hence identifying the som sources of sediment is crucial brosinsky et al 2014 collins et al 2010 which can effectively support catchment management and soil and water resources conservation gaspar et al 2019 porto et al 2013 wallbrink 2004 walling 2005 tracing the sources of som require robust source tracing tools collins and walling 2002 pulley et al 2017 fluorescent indices bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios are the most commonly used som source tracers bianchi and canuel 2011 derrien et al 2017 previous studies have shown that carbon c and nitrogen n isotopes of organic matter are effective tracers for identifying the source of decomposed organic matter hu et al 2006 lambert et al 2016 liu et al 2019b mccorkle et al 2016 as the most active component of soil organic carbon saadi et al 2006 dissolved organic carbon doc has been widely used in soil organic carbon source tracing garzongarcia et al 2017 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2017 due to its high source heterogeneity chantigny 2003 and low analysis cost liu et al 2021 in addition elemental concentrations ratios i e total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ratios as a simple and convenient tracer has also been used to determine the contribution ratio of organic matter sources in the catchment liu et al 2019b meanwhile the fluorescent indices have been widely used in the analysis of organic matter contribution in catchment due to the minimal labor and time for sample pre treatments the rapid analysis and low measurement cost carter et al 2003 chen et al 2004 derrien et al 2019a overall these tools have been applied in diverse environments including soils sediments pore water river lakes and oceans for several decades amiotte suchet et al 2007 benner et al 1997 derrien et al 2015 ficken et al 2000 meyers and ishiwatari 1993 toming et al 2013 wakeham 1995 zimmerman and canuel 2001 nevertheless due to the complex nature of the dynamics of most tracers in the environment their applicability in determining som source contributions have received less scrutiny guan et al 2017 zhifei et al 2016 as outlined by evrard et al 2010 franks and rowan 2000 pulley et al 2015 palazón and navas 2017 the proportion of organic matter sources in the sediments may have different results when different tracers are used uber et al 2019 in addition there is no universal recommendation on which tracers to include for different source making parameter retrieval often time consuming and costly brosinsky et al 2014 the applicability evaluation of tracers is the key to improve the accuracy of organic matter source identification li et al 2020b the following two points are the core of the evaluation 1 considering the relationship between source heterogeneity and tracer selection pulley et al 2017 uber et al 2019 and 2 considering conservative behavior of tracer including source mixing and diagenetic processes derrien shin and hur 2019b in recent years studies have begun to evaluate the applicability of tracers collins et al 2010 gaspar et al 2019 based on a series of controlled degradation experiment previous studies have fully studied the applicability of the fluorescence index biomarker to the internal and external sources of rivers lakes derrien et al 2019a derrien et al 2019b lee et al 2017 however it ignores the effect of source heterogeneity on tracer selection only using simply end members i e algae and soil which are easy to distinguish with tracers under different mixed end members the source identification accuracy of the tracer may change li et al 2020b terrestrial organic matter sources especially organic matter of different land use types have little difference which brings greater challenges to the selection of tracers and the accuracy of source identification therefore in this context we added three allochthonous som source end members i e woodland arable land grassland to form organic rich sediments artificially at known mixing ratios nevertheless the biochemical activity of the som before entering the river has a much lower impact on the tracer than the river environment uber et al 2019 thus this study only examines the conservative behavior in source mixing overall this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of three commonly used tracers techniques i e fluorescent indices bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios in identifying eroded organic matter sources therefore the following aspects are explored i to analyze chemical composition of commonly used tracers i e fluorescent indices bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios under different eroded organic matter sources and ii to study the influence of tracer selection on source identification results under different som sources mixing and iii to determine the reliable tracer under different mixed end members 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples preparation three end members i e woodland arable land and grassland characterized by different land use types as the major terrestrial organic carbon sources of artificial mixtures were selected at an eroded area in the institute of soil and water conservation of shaoyang city 111 22 e and 27 03 n hunan province south central china the soil type is zonal red soil derived from the quaternary red clay which is classified as ultisols based on the us soil taxonomy the woodland was planted with pinus massoniana c3 plant which was a type of coniferous forest with a wide distribution and abundant resources in the subtropical region epron et al 2015 the pinus massoniana accounts for 50 of the subtropical forest area which is a typical representation of woodland the grassland belongs to the great white thatch c3 plant which is not artificially planted and interfered potatoes c3 plant were planted on the arable land all year round and fertilization was carried out once in a fixed cycle each source sample was collected along 5 5 m grid transect from 0 to 5 cm depth to form a single composite sample in the field all samples are collected with a non metallic spatula and cleaned repeatedly to avoid contamination between samples the three source soils were mixed in pairs according to the mass mixing ratios of 100 0 90 10 50 50 10 90 and 0 100 respectively it is noteworthy that the sample does not add additional water during the mixing process in order to reduce the influence of other biochemical reactions on the mixture because this study only considers the influence of tracers during the mixing process of different terrestrial sources based on the above processing a total of 13 samples source and mixture were prepared the mixing experiment was conducted in triplicate finally the mixed source samples were lyophilized ground and homogenized for further analysis 2 2 analysis of tracers 2 2 1 bulk stable isotopes and stoichiometric ratios before the determination the sample was acidified with 1 m hcl to remove the inorganic carbon components and washed with deionized water until the filtrate ph was neutral all samples were analyzed connected to the isotopic ratio mass spectrometer by elemental analyzer flash 2000 ht thermo fisher scientific inc us and mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific inc us for determining the stable isotopic content of organic carbon and nitrogen and stable isotopic composition 2 2 2 fluorescent indices the concentration of doc was determined by toc analyzer shimadzu corp kyoto japan the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were determined with a f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan their relative abundances and ratios were estimated using the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the corresponding identified fractions in eem parafac the fluorescence intensity of individual identified components i e fmax of c1 c2 and c3 was used as a quantitative indicator of their concentration c1 and c2 belong to the humic like substance among them c1 be categorized as a terrestrial humic like substance zhou et al 2017 and c2 showed an excitation and emission 230 428 nm similar to those of agricultural humic like materials zhou et al 2017 unlike it c3 was characterized as representing microbial protein component the percentages of individual components in the total fluorescence i e c1 c2 and c3 are used as their quality indicator in addition the relative ratios e g c1 c2 c1 c3 c2 c3 fluorescence index fi and biological index bix were calculated from fluorescence eem huguet et al 2009 fi is considered as an indicator to distinguish terrestrial and microbial sources mainly based on structural characteristics and aromaticity differences mcknight et al 2001 the bix is primarily an indicator of the relative contribution of recent microorganisms huguet et al 2009 liao et al 2021 2 3 analysis of applicability assessment in order to evaluate the suitability of different tracers at different mixed end members we adjusted them based on previous research criteria and considering the complexity of tracing different terrigenous sources derrien et al 2019b the linear variation of individual end member abundance e g woodland arable land or grassland with artificial mixing ratio was first examined when the correlation coefficient r2 0 8 and associated p value 0 01 the tracer is considered to be linear under the mixed end member in addition the sensitivity of source identification using the tracer can be evaluated by the ratio of the measured values sm regression slope to the measured standard sd deviation a value of sm sd 0 2 is considered to be an acceptable sensitivity for source identification using this tracer derrien et al 2020 in addition this study also supplement evaluation criteria with mixing stable isotope analysis in r mixsiar model mixsiar is a bayesian mixing model which was first applied in ecological food web studies now it is increasingly being applied in tracing the source of organic matter in river basin sediments based on the mixsiar model we calculated the organic matter source contribution ratio of the samples with different mixing ratios under different mixing end members the difference between the calculated contribution ratio and the actual known contribution ratio as the degree of difference when the degree of difference is 10 it is regarded as high tracing accuracy 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of tracers under different end members the values of c n and doc showed significant differences under different end members p values 0 05 for each proxy due to the different types and amounts of organic matter input fig 1a overall c n and doc values of all end members ranged from 9 to 15 from 9 mg kg 1 to 35 mg kg 1 respectively which were consistent with previous studies garzongarcia et al 2017 liu et al 2019b the doc concentration was highest in arable land mean 32 60 1 88 mg kg 1 and lowest in woodland mean 9 27 0 25 mg kg 1 the content of doc in grassland was 11 67 0 12 mg kg 1 meanwhile the c n ratio ranged from 9 67 0 19 for woodland to 14 28 0 16 for arable land the c n ratio of grassland was between the two source types mean 11 44 0 16 the values of three source types were statistically significant as the p values were 0 05 i e p values 0 0249 and 0 0257 for c n and doc table 1 among them the significant difference in c n and doc values were observed between woodland and arable land whereas the difference between grassland and woodland was the least significant fig 1a the differences in soil vegetation and atmospheric environments involved in biogeochemical processes under different tillage systems resulted in the above differences guan et al 2017 briefly the difference between c n and doc is reflecting the organic matter input and the decomposition rate liu et al 2017 the vegetation characteristics of three soil end members showed difference leading to various organic matter decomposition rates which in turn affected the final soil organic matter content in this study the pinus massoniana was artificially planted coniferous tree species which leaves are mostly thick leathery and the cuticle is relatively developed it contains more difficult to decompose substances than broad leaved trees such as lignin cellulose tannins etc epron et al 2015 these substances formed a barrier to the decomposition of the whole cellulose compound in the litter which inhibited the decomposition of litter thus the organic matter of woodland showed a low input on the contrary liu et al 2019a showed that grassland and arable land had more fine root systems than pinus massoniana and thus higher biomass moreover the higher the nitrogen content of soil end member the stronger the microbial metabolic activity and the faster the decomposition rate chen et al 2009 the input of anthropogenic organic fertilizer such as manure and wastewater in the arable land increase the soil microbial activities and the organic matter decomposition rate thus the organic carbon content of arable land showed high abundance the values of δ13c and δ15n showed significant differences under different end members e g p values 0 0249 and 0 0249 for δ13c and δ15n due to the different photosynthetic pathways and fractionation fig 1a briefly the δ13c and δ15n of all end members ranged from 26 to 23 from 2 to 6 respectively which were consistent with previous studies bouloubassi and saliot 1993 garzongarcia et al 2017 the grassland showed relative enrichment values of δ13c 23 71 0 11 followed by slight depletion in arable land 24 47 0 09 and woodland showed the lowest abundance values 25 90 0 12 all these values indicating the c3 plants photosynthesis pathway which is depleted in δ13c the above differences were attributed to the input of new plant residues and overall isotopic fractionation during microbial decomposition zhao et al 2020 different plant residues may experience different carbon cycle paths tue et al 2011 showed that the c4 pathway δ13c 13 was easier to enrich isotope than the c3 pathway δ13c 25 in our study the woodland follow the calvin benson cycle c3 photosynthetic pathway while some grassland rely on hatch slack cycle c4 pathway werth and kuzyakov 2010 in addition zhao et al 2020 showed that older and more microbially processed som was enriched in δ13c compared to less decomposed substrates the value of δ13c from the masson pine forest was more barren due to it contained difficult to decompose substrates the δ15n concentration was enriched in arable land mean 5 93 0 11 and depleted in grassland mean 2 95 0 05 the value of δ15n was mainly affected by anthropogenic impact and agricultural activities guan et al 2017 mukundan et al 2010 mukundan et al 2012 therefore the high levels of δ15n in arable land may source from crop rotations or manure and wastewater in this study the value of fluorescent indices showed a slight difference between different end members due to similar fluorescent conjugate structures figs 1b and c birdwell and engel 2010 based on the eem model three fluorescent components were identified including c1 ex em 260 360 466 c2 ex em 250 406 and c3 ex em 220 280 420 among them the c2 accounted for the highest proportion of all components under all end members woodland accounted for 73 03 2 37 arable land accounted for 63 34 4 78 grassland accounted for 71 06 1 87 and no difference among all soil end members p 0 0539 0 05 the c1 of arable land was the highest compared to other soil end members which was 35 42 6 12 whereas the c3 was the lowest only 1 24 1 38 based on the above the c3 c1 and c3 c2 values of arable land were also the lowest compared to other end members table 1 the reason for the above phenomenon was that the chemical properties of the three soil end members only showed a subtle difference which thus influence the ecological role of fulvic acids derrien et al 2017 the high c2 confirmed that the three soil end members present high humified with high aromaticity the arable land showed the highest c1 c2 c3 c1 and c3 c1 indicated that there were more substances with aromatic conjugate structure and strong protein like fluorescence which were the result of the interaction between microorganisms and litter the humic acid in terrestrial litter and soil contained a large amount of conjugated aromatic structure under the decomposition of microorganisms the protein like fluorescence c3 was preferentially decomposed and the terrestrial organic compounds lignin etc were degraded into quinone like structures c1 or c2 huguet et al 2009 however the arable land accelerateed this decomposition and transformation process due to the influence of anthropogenic input in addition two tracers related to microbial fluorescence characteristics were tested in this study including fi and bix the abundances of fi and bix of the three end members ranged from 1 8 to 2 4 0 8 to 1 5 respectively the abundance values of fi and bix were high for all soil end members which was consistent with that for forested tropical watersheds huguet et al 2009 by contrast the high abundance of fi and bix indicated high microbial activities of soil end members liu et al 2019a soil end members contain a large amount of fulvic acid related to microbial production or transformation which is the fluorescence water solubility extracellular material and detritus produced by cell death birdwell and engel 2010 3 2 the mixing conservative behavior of tracers under different end members the value of c n changed linearly with the change of the mixing ratio p 0 05 and the linear fit was high r2 0 85 fig 2a among them the linear fit under the a w arable land woodland mixed end member was the highest r2 0 9839 followed by the a g arable land grassland mixed end member r2 0 9258 and the lowest linear fitting degree of the g w grassland woodland mixed end member r2 0 8544 for source sensitivity the sensitivity to changes of the mixing ratio the a w mixed end member was also the most prominent sm sd 0 2567 whereas the c n under the other two mixed end members was not sensitive to the change of the organic matter mixed source sm sd 0 2 in contrast the linear fit of doc was not as high as that of c n although r2 were all higher than 0 85 the linear fit of doc under the a g mixed end member was the highest r2 0 9202 fig 2a while the linear fit r2 under the other two mixed end members was about 0 86 the source sensitivity of doc was greatly affected by mixed end members specifically the source sensitivity of the doc under the a w mixed end member was the highest with a sm sd value of 0 4160 followed by the a g mixed end member sm sd 0 2090 and the sm sd value under the g w mixed end member was the lowest only 0 1288 table 2 in general the mixed conservative behavior of c n was better than that of doc which was consistent with the results of previous studies garzongarcia et al 2017 this further confirmed the stability of c n as a tracer while doc as the most active and most mobile component of soil organic carbon was not as stable as c n in addition the study showed that the source sensitivity of c n and doc were the highest under the a w mixed end member which was mainly related to the large source heterogeneity between arable land and woodland the linear fitting degree of different fluorescence indices with mixing ratio was not as high as that of doc and c n figs 2b c d e the linear fit of c2 and fi with the mixing ratio was low r2 0 7 whereas c3 c1 showed relatively high abundance r2 0 75 fig 2d in addition the linear fit of the same fluorescent indices under different mixed end members showed obvious differences the linear fitting degree of the fluorescent indices under the a w mixed end member was the highest especially c3 c1 r2 0 9497 and bix r2 0 9052 on the contrary the fluorescent indices had the lowest linear fit under the mixed g w end member among them c2 c3 c2 fi and bix did not show linear changes with the mixing ratio p 0 05 indicating these fluorescent indices did not have mixed conservative behavior for source sensitivity the sm sd of the fluorescent indices was generally low especially for c2 and fi whose sm sd 0 1 table 2 in addition the source sensitivity of fluorescent indices under the a w mixed end member was higher than that of other mixed end members the sm sd of c3 under the a w mixed end member was 0 3091 while the sm sd under other mixed end members was 0 1 in general fluorescent indices was not as conservative as other tracers during source mixing indicating that they were prone to change during the mixing process which is inconsistent with the results of previous studies on fluorescence indices in aquatic environments weom is a heterogeneous mixture of aliphatic and aromatic polymers the degree to which its composition changes over time or the process of degradation depends on the distance to the source and the time of exposure to the surface liu et al 2019b in the terrestrial environment the mixing of soils from different land use types intensifies the flow of microorganisms which in turn accelerates the degradation of the fluorescent indices in the soil the bulk stable isotopes changed linearly with the change of the mixing ratio p 0 05 and the linear fit was very high r2 0 85 fig 2f the linear fit of δ13c under the g w mixed end member r2 0 9746 was significantly the highest followed by the a w mixed end member r2 0 9377 whereas the lowest linear fit of δ13c was showed under the a g mixed end member r2 0 8716 for δ15n the linear fit of δ15n changing with the mixing ratio was also high but lower than that of δ13c the linear fitting degree of δ15n under a g mixed end member with mixing ratio was the highest r2 0 9084 by contrast there is no linear relationship of δ15n with the change of mixing ratio under the g w mixed end member p 0 05 fig 2f in general the mixed conservative behavior of bulk stable isotopes was better than other tracers this showed that bulk stable isotopes were not easy to change during the mixing process and were relatively stable tracers 3 3 the identification accuracy of tracers under different mixed end members based on the mixsiar model the source contribution ratio of each end member under different mixed end members was calculated and the difference between it and the actual contribution ratio was regarded as the contribution deviation to assess the accuracy of the tracer source identification tracers with a contribution deviation of 10 have higher source identification accuracy based on previous studies for c n the c n contribution deviations under all mixed end members were low among them the c n under the a w mixed end member and the a g mixed end member had higher identification accuracy and the contribution deviations were 5 30 10 and 8 30 10 respectively table 2 however for doc the accuracy of identifying organic matter sources for all doc under all mixed end members was low contribution deviations 10 among which the contribution deviation value of g w mixed end members was the highest which was 20 73 indicating that it misidentified the source of organic carbon contribution in general for the tracer the contribution deviation value of doc was generally higher than c n meanwhile for all the mixed end member the contribution deviation value of c n and doc under the g w mixed end member was the highest fig 3 for δ15n the calculated contribution ratio of δ15n under the g w mixed end member seriously deviates from the actual contribution ratio that is the contribution deviation reaches 42 57 in contrast the contribution deviations of the a w mixed end member and a g mixed end member were both lower which were 4 37 and 6 83 respectively compared with the instability of the contribution deviation of δ15n in different mixed end members the contribution deviation of δ13c under all mixed end members was lower among them the contribution deviation of δ13c under the g w mixed end member was only 4 23 for the fluorescent indices the contribution deviations of tracers under different properties showed obvious differences fig 3 3 4 implications for the applicability of tracers under different mixed end members in this study the identification accuracy of common tracers under different mixing end members was evaluated and compared with the artificial sediments composed of different terrestrial organic matter sources at different mixing ratios the tracers mentioned above all have the potential to identify eroded organic matter sources however the tracers showed different tracing accuracy based on different mixed organic mater sources this study provides strong evidence for the selection of tracers under different mixed end members bulk stable isotopes δ13c δ15n had a strong ability and robustness in estimating the contribution of terrestrial artificial mixtures due to their high level of mixing conservation and degradation resistance followed by traditional tracers c n doc due to the different characteristics of organic matter input and microbial decomposition rate amon g different end members the δ13c under g w mixed end member p value of source heterogeneity 0 05 r2 of linearity 0 9746 sm sd 0 3531 difference 4 23 respectively however the fluorescent indices were not suitable for terrestrial organic matter sources tracing fluorescent indices were derived from a mobile carbon source in the soil which was easily degraded by soil microorganisms kowalczuk et al 2009 on the other hand different terrestrial organic matter was rich in humic like fluorescence compared to protein rich endogenous sources which leads to poor heterogeneity of fluorescent indices among different terrestrial sources ran et al 2021 4 conclusion the study found that there are significant differences in the identification accuracy of the tracer under different erosion scenarios which is mainly related to the conservative behavior of the tracer and the heterogeneity of the selected end member based on controlled experiments we found that there was no significant difference in the organic matter characteristics between grassland end member and forest end member so the discrimination accuracy of most tracers was not high in the g w mixed end member in addition the fluorescent indices were not suitable for terrestrial organic matter sources tracing due to the similarities between different terrestrial organic matter sources this study provides a new perspective for the verification of commonly used som source tracers in sediments and points out the direction for more targeted prevention and control of land sourced sediment input future studies need to consider more organic matter end members such as lake algae plant litter etc and other tracers such as biomarkers etc to evaluate tracers rigorously credit authorship

4014,the widely used feddes reduction function frf was reviewed in the context of its merits and shortcomings for modeling root water uptake rwu crop transpiration and soil water balance components the empirical nature of the frf was contrasted to few calibrations reported in the literature and the conditions where the correct operation of the frf was of limited importance were discussed some alerts regarding the feasibility of this function in hydrological studies were provided and reinforced by a case study with sugarcane under subtropical conditions available modifications of the frf can improve rwu predictions under aeration stress but some conceptual imperfections make it inaccurate under drought stress and high compensated uptake in such cases the use of mechanistic rwu models in replacement of the frf is recommended to accurately predict the actual transpiration dynamics the calibration of the frf by inverse modeling is feasible although some of the frf parameters are insensitive to model outputs keywords svat processes drought stress model sensitivity hydrological modeling inverse modeling 1 introduction transpiration the evaporation of water from stomata in plant leaves is one of the key processes in soil vegetation atmosphere transfer of water it is preceded and strongly linked to the uptake of water by the plant root system under relatively wet soil conditions the transpiration rate is usually sink limited i e it depends on the atmospheric conditions and on the shape and the properties of the boundary layer between the plant and the atmosphere when the soil water content is below a certain threshold the process turns into source limited and soil hydraulic properties together with rooting characteristics will determine the transpiration rate de jong van lier et al 2013 dos santos et al 2017 quantitative studies with hydrological models are useful tools for a better understanding of these complex interactions between soil plant and atmosphere and the involved driving factors most models dealing with root water uptake rwu and transpiration rate consider both to be numerically the same rwu may be considered at two scales referred to as macroscopic and microscopic scales green et al 2006 on a macroscopic scale rwu is modeled as a sink term in the richards equation and the dependence of rwu on the soil hydraulic status is usually represented by empirical reduction functions describing the relative decrease in rwu and consequently of transpiration or evapotranspiration as a function of soil water content or pressure head examples of such empirical reduction functions are presented by dirksen and augustijn 1988 doorenbos and kassam 1979 feddes et al 1976 1978 li et al 2006 tiktak and bouten 1992 and van genuchten 1987 the feddes et al 1978 transpiration reduction function here referred to as frf stands out for its wide use and incorporation in classical hydrological softwares such as swap kroes et al 2017 hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 and wave vanclooster et al 1996 and is also used in recently developed tools e g by difonzo et al 2021 the frf was developed in 1977 and first published in 1978 feddes et al 1978 the main objective according to the authors was to overcome the shortcomings and difficulties regarding the application of other more exact models for rwu zaradny 1992 the frf is a piecewise linear function that describes a root water uptake reduction factor α between 0 and 1 five stages of water uptake are described bounded by four values of pressure head h1 h2 h3 h4 the value of h1 delimits the phase of complete aeration deficiency and null uptake in a near saturated soil anoxic phase between h1 and h2 the hypoxic phase the rwu increases linearly as air filled porosity increases in the range between h2 and h3 constant rate phase there is no water stress or aeration stress and rwu equals the potential rwu between h3 and h4 falling rate phase rwu decreases linearly to zero below h4 delimiting the permanent wilting phase rwu equals zero fig 1 parameter h3 may be considered to correspond to the irrigation trigger point used in irrigation management its value is commonly considered to depend on the atmospheric evaporative demand and model performance may increase if its value is defined as a function of the rate of potential transpiration tp the most common assumption is that h3 decreases linearly with decreasing tp a common parameterization kroes et al 2017 considers an upper bound h3h for tp 5 mmd 1 high atmospheric demand a lower bound h3l for tp 1 mmd 1 low atmospheric demand and a linear variation for tp between 1 and 5 mmd 1 fig 1 ideally the values of h3h and h3l must be calibrated for different plants growth stages root system size and distribution climatic conditions and soil types cai et al 2017 dos santos et al 2017 homaee et al 2002 vandoorne et al 2012 parameter h4 which corresponds to the classical permanent wilting point is also crop specific but it is commonly fixed at a value of 15 000 cm despite criticism metselaar and de jong van lier 2007 savage et al 1996 many authors alert about the fact that the frf may over simplify one of the most complex processes in the soil vegetation atmosphere system cai et al 2017 de jong van lier et al 2013 dos santos et al 2017 durigon et al 2012 egea et al 2016 javaux et al 2013 nguyen et al 2020 vandoorne et al 2012 verhoef and egea 2014 the function does not explicitly include the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the soil root interface the compensation mechanisms between stressed and non stressed roots and the plant internal resistance to water flow which are well known factors affecting rwu both soil physical and root physiological factors are important for the proper modeling of rwu de willigen et al 2012 hence to understand and interrelate all these factors a mechanistic approach is more suitable de jong van lier et al 2013 wu et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 one of the first attempts to develop a process based rwu model is attributed to gardner 1960 who presented an analytical solution for water movement towards a single root a scale commonly referred to as microscopic although mesoscopic would be more appropriate raats 2007 since then several models have been developed on the microscopic scale with simulations and detailed descriptions of water flows on the absorbent root surface and in the soil root interface cowan 1965 de jong van lier et al 2006 de willigen and van noordwijk 1987 raats 2007 these single root models are not readily applicable to practical situations but they provide information to develop mechanistic macroscopic models dos santos et al 2017 like those proposed by couvreur et al 2012 de jong van lier et al 2013 2008 doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2013 2008 schneider et al 2010 and vogel et al 2013 even with the wide availability of mechanistic macroscopic models to describe rwu the empirical frf has been widely used for modeling water uptake due to its relative simplicity and lower data requirements homaee et al 2002 wu et al 2021 in this review paper we address the merits and the shortcomings of the frf for modeling rwu crop transpiration and soil water balance components the objectives are 1 to discuss the use and feasibility of the frf to study different processes related to transpiration and rwu 2 to present shortcomings and modifications of the frf to simulate rwu in drought reduced and aeration reduced conditions 3 to discuss the calibration of the frf reported in literature added by an own case study under subtropical conditions 2 scientific reports referring to the feddes reduction function more than one hundred peer reviewed papers published between 1978 and 2021 were found in which the frf was applied for modeling transpiration or rwu reductions caused by water stress in most of them the values of the feddes parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l and h4 were not obtained experimentally nor optimized in some way in such cases the authors used values retrieved from literature sometimes with adjustments but without giving further details e g brunetti et al 2019 busoni et al 1983 dash et al 2015 durigon et al 2012 gabiri et al 2018 kambale et al 2017 karandish and šimůnek 2018 2017 klosterhalfen et al 2017 luo et al 2003 lv et al 2014 patle et al 2018 phogat et al 2019 2018 2017 2010 pinheiro et al 2019 salehi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 wine et al 2015 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2010 žydelis et al 2018 in contrast only a few attempts at the optimization of the feddes parameters were made e g cai et al 2017 dainese and tarantino 2020 dos santos et al 2017 homaee et al 2002 hopmans and guttièrez ravé 1988 massoud et al 2019 sela et al 2015 vandoorne et al 2012 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2013 some of these attempts are discussed later in this paper the usual procedure to apply the frf mainly for modeling drought stress is using reference values of the feddes parameters from taylor and ashcroft 1972 and wesseling et al 1991 these two references are the basis of the hydrus database of those parameters for different plants šejna et al 2011 the former is also cited in the swap documentation for the same purpose kroes et al 2017 while the latter corresponds to the input instructions manual of swatre a precursor of swap belmans et al 1983 therefore it can be stated that when the source of the feddes parameters was one out of wesseling et al 1991 the swap database or the hydrus database e g berezniak et al 2018 fernandez bou et al 2020 garcía morillo et al 2017 gliege et al 2016 groh et al 2016 gubiani and mentges 2020 karandish and šimůnek 2016 lugli and mahler 2015 miller et al 2020 palermo et al 2019 qasemi et al 2016 rieckh et al 2014 wongkaew et al 2018 in fact all of these derived from taylor and ashcroft 1972 the values compiled by taylor and ashcroft 1972 were either obtained by soil pressure head integration or water depletion fractions conversions over the entire rooting depth some refer to observations below the depth of maximum root concentration and many others refer to unpublished works van den berg and driessen 2002 besides their compilation did not include aspects of root length density or soil hydraulic properties that strongly affect the determination of limiting soil hydraulic conditions de jong van lier et al 2013 2008 the fact that this sole source is repeated over and over since 1972 suggests a weak experimental basis of indicative values van den berg and driessen 2002 indeed few experimental studies have been devoted to determining the onset of the falling rate phase of water uptake e g casaroli et al 2010 dainese and tarantino 2020 garg et al 2015 rabbel et al 2018 thus there is no evidence that the frf is suitable for application to a broad spectrum of environments without onsite calibration given the empirical nature of the frf contrasting to few calibrations one may question why it has been applied successfully and usefully molz 1981 in different kinds of weather soil plant conditions adane et al 2018 bai et al 2020 busoni et al 1983 de willigen et al 2012 eitzinger et al 2004 feddes et al 1988 luo et al 2003 ren et al 2016 utset et al 2000 zaradny 1992 it is important to emphasize that the frf is commonly included in hydrological models with several subroutines thus the good performance of these models does not mean that each of their subsections such as the rwu function performed well in an absolute sense but only that within the context of the overall model it was operating successfully molz 1981 one can even state that such success is more likely related to other model subsections such as the soil hydraulic functions usually performed by discretization of the richards equation van dam and feddes 2000 due to the relative insensitivity to rwu parameters bai et al 2020 dafny and šimůnek 2016 de jong van lier et al 2015 hupet et al 2003 2002 rabbel et al 2018 stahn et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 in fact the importance of rwu might be lower or higher depending on the process of interest 2 1 adaptations for modeling root water uptake most of the successful applications of the frf used adapted approaches for modeling rwu when compared to the original study published in 1978 in the original model published by feddes et al 1978 the sink term s in the richards equation is equal to the maximum water uptake smax calculated as the ratio between tp and the rooting depth multiplied by the transpiration reduction factor α h hence the distribution of tp is considered uniform over depth one of the first modifications was proposed by hoogland et al 1981 who considered that smax is a decreasing function with depth while the α h function described by the frf is left unchanged such consideration accounts for both compensatory effects and a shift in time of maximum water uptake from the surface downward van den berg and driessen 2002 later hayhoe and de jong 1988 and prasad 1988 adapted this approach and incorporated linear root density distribution functions over the rooting depth in the sink term since the publication of these studies several models that include the frf with non homogeneous root distributions over depth were reported either using linear hupet et al 2002 zuo et al 2004 nonlinear li et al 2001 1999 ojha and rai 1996 wu et al 1999 or flexible root density distributions feddes et al 2001 luo et al 2003 the latter corresponds to one of the current swap approaches for modeling rwu which can handle any distribution of the root length density over depth kroes et al 2017 the frf has been used with several of these rooting density profiles either calibrated from field observations of the root system or taken from previous studies under similar conditions e g brunetti et al 2021 durigon et al 2012 egea et al 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 klement et al 2016 phogat et al 2019 2018 2017 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2010 other adaptations of the feddes model account for compensation and the hysteresis effect on water uptake some hydrological softwares such as swap and hydrus include a modified version of the jarvis model for rwu jarvis 1989 using the frf with a root adaptability factor this factor represents a threshold value above which the reduction of rwu in stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by increased uptake from other parts šejna et al 2011 this approach is usually referred to as the feddes jarvis model cai et al 2018 2017 lei et al 2019 and can provide good predictions for low and medium root length density scenarios dos santos et al 2017 given some inconsistencies of the jarvismodel peters 2016 proposed a simple modification that limits compensated rwu to a better justified maximum value peters et al 2017 regarding the hysteresis effect a water stress recovery coefficient was recently proposed by wu et al 2020 to improve predictions by the frf during wetting drying cycles in the soil this was achieved by quantifying the dynamic effects of water stress on winter wheat recovery from lysimetric experiments significant improvements in predictions of actual transpiration and soil water content were obtained using their approach consideration of the hysteresis effect can also improve the parameterization of rwu reduction functions like the frf as demonstrated by wu et al 2021 in another approach carminati 2012 proposed a model in which the delay of soil wetting and drying after irrigation is ascribed to the mucilage exuded by roots the polymeric mucilage is able to hold considerable volumes of water but turns hydrophobic when it dries difonzo et al 2021 consideration of these effects of mucilage may be crucial for setting the right parameters of the frf and is an interesting subject for further studies 2 2 is the feddes reduction function feasible in general the frf as a subroutine in hydrological models seems to be feasible for reasonable predictions of cumulative values of transpiration or evapotranspiration de willigen et al 2012 molz 1981 sela et al 2015 deep drainage wine et al 2015 groundwater discharge kambale et al 2017 patle et al 2018 and crop yields busoni et al 1983 eitzinger et al 2004 feddes et al 1988 ren et al 2016 the frf has also been useful as a background subroutine to simulate nutrient uptake and leaching eltarabily et al 2019a 2019b karandish and šimůnek 2017 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 yang et al 2017 uptake of chemicals brunetti et al 2021 2019 saline stress berezniak et al 2018 hong et al 2017 phogat et al 2010 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2013 and both water saline and nutrient stresses babazadeh et al 2021 on the other hand for the accurate prediction of transpiration dynamics and root water uptake profiles the frf tends to fail cai et al 2017 casaroli et al 2010 dos santos et al 2017 durigon et al 2012 molz 1981 vogel et al 2013 in such cases the use of mechanistic models accompanied by informative measurements is strongly recommended to simulate soil water content profiles using robust hydrological softwares such as swap or hydrus the correct operation of the frf seems to be of limited importance de jong van lier et al 2015 jhorar et al 2004 lv et al 2014 pinheiro et al 2019 stahn et al 2017 in many cases soil water content dynamics are shown to be insensitive to root water uptake parameters compared to soil hydraulic parameters bai et al 2020 dafny and šimůnek 2016 de jong van lier et al 2015 hupet et al 2003 2002 rabbel et al 2018 stahn et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 this explains why a proper calibration of the frf is hardly ever emphasized when soil water balance components are studied de jong van lier et al 2015 3 shortcomings and modifications some conceptual shortcomings of the frf were addressed by a detailed analysis of the plant transpiration behavior under water stress conditions in a review of soil water thresholds for modeling drought stress sadras and milroy 1996 showed that in 10 out of 18 studies a piecewise linear function was used to describe evapo transpiration reduction functions while in the other 7 studies a nonlinear function was used predominantly a convex concave type function the question regarding the theoretical shape of the transpiration reduction function was handled by de jong van lier et al 2009 and metselaar and de jong van lier 2007 who analyzed transpiration rates in the falling rate phase by numerical experiments they concluded that a combined convex concave reduction function is a more likely shape for the reduction function than a linear function they also verified that under limiting hydraulic conditions relative transpiration equals relative matric flux potential regardless of soil type these conclusions were experimentally corroborated by casaroli et al 2010 who compared predictions of relative transpiration of common bean using linear reduction functions with water content pressure head h or matric flux potential m and verified that the m based function and the h based function had the best and the worst performance respectively explicit microscopic functions derived for m during both the constant rate and the falling rate phase de jong van lier et al 2006 metselaar and de jong van lier 2007 were extended by de jong van lier et al 2008 to a layered soil profile with distinct hydraulic properties according to the authors their proposed model does not increase the number of parameters to predict rwu and allows simulating boundary conditions as found in the field vertical soil water redistribution and compensated rwu restrictions this more process based reduction function was incorporated into swap and it is currently available to predict drought reduced rwu as an alternative to the frf kroes et al 2017 this function was further improved to account for internal plant resistances to water flow by de jong van lier et al 2013 some modifications of the frf were proposed to improve the calculation of water uptake during the hypoxic phase in which relative transpiration reduces due to aeration stress bartholomeus et al 2008 claimed that a detailed analysis of the hypoxic phase between h1 and h2 had never been performed in contrast to the falling rate phase between h3 and h4 as previously discussed furthermore as already recognized by feddes et al 1978 an identical value of h2 for all environmental conditions seems to be inappropriate because pressure heads do not provide direct information on the soil aeration status the flow of oxygen into the root zone physically does not depend on the pressure head but on the amount of air filled pores and their connectivity in space peters et al 2017 to address this shortcoming of the frf bartholomeus et al 2008 developed a process based model to compute plant aeration stress considering the oxygen consumption by roots respiration described by plant physiological processes and the oxygen transport through the soil described by physical laws both relevant biotic and abiotic factors related to aeration stress were taken into account simulation of the actual root respiration for a crop requires actual data on soil type daily soil temperature and daily gas filled porosity in each soil layer provided the necessary data the bartholomeus model can replace the frf for rwu predictions under aeration reduced conditions as available in the current version of swap kroes et al 2017 in contrast to the complex approach of bartholomeus et al 2008 peters et al 2017 suggested a simple improvement of the frf to predict aeration stress they described rwu in the hypoxic phase by a reduction scheme as a function of air content whereas rwu in the falling rate phase was kept described by the original approach of feddes the authors advocated that the proposed model is a conceptually more consistent representation of water stress in the hypoxic phase although the assumption of a homogeneous root distribution is certainly over simplified for homogeneous fine textured soils predicted rwu by the modified frf did not achieve its potential rate while in stochastic heterogeneous soil predicted rwu was more pronounced at the interfaces between fine and coarse regions with potential implications for plant growth as emphasized by peters et al 2017 their approach is particularly relevant under wet climatic conditions in irrigated agriculture or for soils with a high water table 4 calibration of the feddes reduction function as mentioned before the frf needs calibration for each scenario of weather climate conditions together with soil and crop properties but such calibration is performed only rarely following feddes et al 1978 the first calibration report comes from hopmans and guttièrez ravé 1988 who proposed a procedure to calibrate the frf considering the variability of soil hydraulic properties in a 650 ha watershed in thenetherlands based on field data they used a monte carlo analysis in combination with a trial and error procedure to optimize the five feddes parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 in this analysis the swatre software belmans et al 1983 was used to simulate unsaturated soil water transport several times thereby generating spatially variable soil hydraulic properties in each simulation the feddes parameters were optimized using various parameter combinations and comparing predicted values of actual evapotranspiration eta with two year averages of measured eta from an energy balance and a mass balance of the watershed according to the authors they obtained an rwu model that was valid for the whole area and independent of the choice of one particular calibration site in the watershed using a more sophisticated calibration technique sela et al 2015 optimized h1 h2 h3h h3l and h4 for a shrub species sarcopoterium spinosum based on measured cumulative eta from lysimeter experiments and the hydrus software a plausible range of each parameter was estimated based on literature and divided into a vector of 20 000 intervals to allow a high resolution search across the variable parameter space the parameter set leading to the best fit between measured and simulated cumulative eta values rmse 2 5 mm r2 0 96 was chosen and validated using independent datasets cai et al 2017 also used inverse modeling to derive parameter values of rwu models including the frf with compensated uptake feddes jarvis model they used measurements of soil water content soil water potential and cumulative daily actual transpiration of winter wheat both in absolute and differential values the obtained rwu parameters of the feddes jarvis model were consistent with data reported in the literature although h3h and h3l could not be uniquely identified other authors applied inverse modeling techniques to obtain the feddes parameters for tree species using sap flux and stem water potential dainese and tarantino 2020 massoud et al 2019 the inverse modeling method to optimize rwu parameters is attractive because few restrictions are imposed on the experimental conditions and the method provides parameter estimates for which the uncertainty ranges can be quantified hupet et al 2003 on the other hand this approach has some well known limitations which are mainly related to the non uniqueness of the optimized parameter set and the insensitivity of rwu parameters to some model outputs dafny and šimůnek 2016 hupet et al 2003 2002 stahn et al 2017 vandoorne et al 2012 in literature both successful ren et al 2016 xu et al 2013 and unsuccessful dafny and šimůnek 2016 homaee et al 2002 attempts to calibrate the frf by inverse modeling can be found some authors claimed that the inverse modeling method to derive the feddes parameters is only feasible for some soils e g coarse and very fine textured and this feasibility is strongly improved if the rwu parameters are optimized simultaneously with additional parameters hupet et al 2003 using multiple measured variables massoud et al 2019 and when soil hydraulic properties are known with high accuracy de jong van lier et al 2015 4 1 inverse modeling to calibrate the frf a case study to make an additional contribution regarding the feasibility of the inverse modeling approach to calibrate the frf a case study with sugarcane under subtropical conditions was performed and will be presented in the following 4 1 1 field experiment the study area is

measurements in each plot the measurements were considered in a daily time step by selecting the h values written at 00 00 h before the installation of the fdr sensors undisturbed soil samples were collected at the same depths and locations to determine the soil hydraulic properties according to the mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 equation system 1 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 n 1 2 k k s θ l 1 1 θ

inversely the parameter estimation suite pest doherty 2016 was linked with swap v 3 2 26 kroes et al 2008 the pest suite comprises the nonlinear pest program two pest compatible global optimizers six utility programs for building and checking pest input files and a sensitivity analysis sensan program which applies multiple running of the model using different parameter values for each run given the uncertainties in the soil hydraulic parameters and the root density parameters the feddes parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 were optimized together with the van genuchten mualem parameters θ r θ s α n ks l and the root parameter rdcz relative root density as a function of relative rooting depth z using the sceua p global optimizer sceua p implements the sce shuffled complex evolution algorithm described by duan 1991 and duan et al 1994 1992 1993 the sce method does not require the computation of derivatives of model outputs for the adjustable parameters hence it can operate successfully even where the relation between model parameters and model outputs is discontinuous or when it is contaminated by model generated numerical noise it can also perform well where the objective function features local optima in parameter space doherty 2016 the latter was a problem in this case study identified in previous attempts at optimization using the method executed by the pest program levenberg marquardt algorithm lm on the other hand the linear parameter uncertainty and identifiability statistics are not available in global methods thus to calculate the confidence intervals and the sensitivities of the optimized parameters the final global optima provided by sceua p were used as initial parameter values to run pest lm the fact that sceua p uses the same input files as pest lm favored the execution of this sequence of optimization methods the optimization procedure was carried out by using constraints in the parameter bounds to obtain a correct problem definition table 2 for instance the upper and lower bounds of the feddes parameters were defined avoiding overlapping of the parameter bounds as their physical meaning suggests h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 table 2 the initial values of h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 and rdcz were defined according to the previous calibration of the swap crop module for sugarcane scarpare 2011 and field observations of the root system in a nearby experimental area scarpare et al 2019 while the initial values of θ s θ r α n ks and l were those presented in table 1 and reproduced in table 2 the optimum parameters were obtained by systematically minimizing the deviations between observed obs and simulated sim variables the considered variables were the logarithmically transformed absolute pressure head pf log10 h cm at depths of 0 2 0 4 and 1 0 m and the actual crop evapotranspiration eta cmd 1 the numerical transformation of the pressure head was necessary to achieve stability of the inversion process since the default swap outputs are non transformed a simple software was programmed in fortran and linked to swap and pest suite by a batch file the comparison between observed and simulated values of pf and eta was applied only to the periods when the potential transpiration simulated by swap was greater than zero allowing to calculate the rwu reduction factor α h the following objective function ϕ was minimized by sceua p and pest lm 5 ϕ j 1 j i 1 n j sim i j obs i j 2 w i j where j is the number of variables in this case two variables pf and eta i is the number of the observation in the dataset of variable j that contains nj observations here 1 725 observations of pf and 553 observations of eta and wi j is the observation weight considered equal to 0 1 for pf observations and 1 0 for eta observations according to their magnitudes sceua p and pest lm were programmed to cease execution if the objective function was not reduced by more than one percent over five and three successive iterations respectively after optimization the residuals were evaluated by the root mean squared error of prediction rmsep and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse according to 6 rmsep i 1 n j sim i j obs i j 2 n j 7 nse 1 i 1 n j sim i j obs i j 2 i 1 n j obs i j obs j 2 where obs j is the average observed value for variable j 4 1 3 results and discussion the global optimum values of the five threshold pressure heads of the frf were h1 7 95 cm h2 13 52 cm h3h 806 cm h3l 2 164 cm and h4 15 880 cm table3 for h1 h2 and h3h the optimum values were higher than the initial values before h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3h 1 000 cm while for h3l and h4 the optimum values were lower before h3l 2 000 cm h4 10 000 cm being the optimum h3l close to the initial value these results indicate that after the parameter optimization the predicted aeration stress as well as the water stress under low evaporative demands tended to be lower and the constant rate phase of rwu was wider in general the 95 confidence limits range of the optimum parameters was wide and the parameter sensitivity was low mainly for h3h h3l and h4 table 3 it can be inferred that few observations were actually used to derive h4 which increased the uncertainties while h3h h3l were relatively insensitive to the variables observed regarding the van genuchten mualem parameters the global optima of θ r α and ks were lower than their initial values while the global optima of θ s n and l were higher the behavior of the 95 confidence limits range and the sensitivity was specific for each parameter but except for ks the parameter sensitivities were higher than those verified for the feddes parameters table3 the most important effect on the soil hydraulic properties was that the optimum values implied higher water contents in the low suction range of the soil water retention curve this also affected the hydraulic conductivity function which declined more gradually as the soil dried fig 2 the optimum values of the root density parameters rdcz were lower than the initial values for the relative rooting depths of 0 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 and higher for the relative rooting depths of 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 1 0 the 95 confidence limits ranges were generally wide and the parameter sensitivities were comparable to those of the soil hydraulic parameters l and θ s table3 after optimization the root density distribution over depth changed significantly fig 3 the deeper layers had the highest root densities instead of the top layers with implications that are discussed later before optimization although the model performance was satisfactory for simulation of soil water dynamics there were frequent underestimations of the pressure head values which revealed a systematic error in the soil hydraulic parameters fig 4 this error likely arose from the determination of such parameters by the traditional one step outflow method which assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium between an initially saturated soil sample and a pressure plate which is not always warranted bittelli and flury 2009 the water retention curves determined by inverse modeling of a transient nonequilibrium conditions may be considered more reliable de jong van lier et al 2019 indeed after optimization of the soil hydraulic parameters by inverse modeling the frequency of underestimations was reduced and in general the model predicted the pressure head values at the three analyzed depths more accurately fig 4 small errors in the soil hydraulic parameters may result in large errors in the transpiration fluxes hupet et al 2004 2002 certainly before optimization the model performance was unsatisfactory for the simulation of eta dynamics fig 5 large deviations 2mmd 1 between observed and simulated values of eta were obtained mainly in dry periods during the two cropping cycles in which eta was considerably underestimated after optimization these deviations were minimized and in general the eta values were better predicted fig 5 nevertheless frequent underestimations remained present and indicate some room for improvement in the model performance this could be achieved by using a mechanistic approach to predict transpiration reductions caused by water stress the use of a reduction function that accounts for compensation in replacement of the frf in the swap crop module e g the functions of jarvis 1989 de jong van lier et al 2008 and jarvis 2010 may mitigate reductions in rwu and transpiration rates as shown by durigon et al 2012 and dos santos et al 2017 a mechanistic rwu model would require more informative measurements the improvements in the prediction of pressure head expressed as pf at depths of 0 2 0 4 and 1 0 m and actual evapotranspiration eta were corroborated by the statistical indexes before optimization the nse was negative for pf0 4 m and eta which means that the observations averages had greater predictive power than the model used the rmsep for eta was above 2 mmd 1 which denoted a poor model performance after optimization the rmsep reduced and the nse increased and expressed positive values for all observation groups table 4 the rmsep for eta reduced by 40 from 2 15 to 1 28 mmd 1 which means that a reasonable model performance was achieved for simulation of eta dynamics the comparison of the actual transpiration ta dynamics simulated before and after optimization revealed that the optimum parameters generally led to increments in simulated daily ta values mainly during dry periods fig 6 this result shows that the crop was more resilient to drought stress by a combined effect of less limiting threshold pressure heads of the frf more water availability in the soil fig 2 and higher root densities in deeper layers fig 3 the root redistribution in the soil profile directly impacted the predicted root water uptake rwu over time and depth before optimization the rwu was concentrated in the top layers fig 7 higher initial water uptake from the top layers led to quick depletion and reduction of rwu from these layers after optimization the rwu was concentrated in deeper layers fig 7 where the soil water availability was greater allowing higher and relatively more persistent rwu rates the strong correlation between root density distribution and rwu is expect when the frf is applied since there is no uptake compensation in this model and the potential rwu and transpiration rates are weighted by the root length density regarding the crop yield the predictions of sugarcane yield at harvest were satisfactory for the two cropping cycles although the values were underestimated before and overestimated after optimization fig 8 it is important to emphasize that the swap crop module does not consider possible losses due to suboptimal crop nutrition pests weeds and harvest operation so a certain level of yield overestimation could be expected before optimization the difference between simulated and observed values of yield at harvest was 6 9 mg ha 1 for the first year and 8 4 mg ha 1 for the ratoon after optimization this difference was 4 3 mg ha 1 and 7 5 mg ha 1 respectively fig 8 based on these results the imperfections in the frf seemed to be of limited importance for the simulation of crop yield which corroborates the findings from the literature review 4 2 sensitivity of model outputs to the feddes parameters because of the low sensitivities obtained in the optimization procedure table 3 a sensitivity analysis sa was performed to quantify the variability of model outputs explained by each threshold pressure head of the frf the sensan program doherty 2016 was linked to the swap software kroes et al 2008 and executed several times using different values of h1 h2 h3h h3l and h4 for each parameter a base value equal to the initial value in the optimization procedure and another 100 values uniformly distributed between rational limits were defined table 5 for each run one parameter was varied while the other four parameters were fixed at their base values the following model outputs were considered the water balance represented by cumulative values of actual transpiration actual soil evaporation runoff and deep drainage mm and the actual crop yield mg ha 1 these outputs were quantified for each cropping cycle first year and ratoon for a 31 day rainy period rp from january 1 to january 31 and for a 31 day dry period dp from june 15 to july 15 obviously higher sensitivities are expected for h1 and h2 during rainy periods and for h3h h3l and h4 during dry periods because of the expected soil water status the values of the water balance variables and the actual crop yield did not vary significantly with the values of h1 h3h and h3l fig 9 regardless of the period considered first year ratoon rp and dp yet more evident in rp and dp higher variabilities were obtained for actual transpiration and actual crop yield as a function of h2 and h4 respectively fig 9 these two variables are more related to crop type than actual soil evaporation runoff and deep drainage so the calibration efforts may be concentrated in h2 and h4 for proper simulation of crop growth and consequently the water balance on the other hand the values of h1 h3h and h3l can be retrieved from literature however it is important to emphasize that the parameter ranges defined for h2 and h4 may be too wide i e h2 50 cm and h4 8 000 cm are unlikely to be used for sugarcane hence all results of this case study point to conceptual imperfections in the frf and reinforce the alerts regarding the feasibility of this function in hydrological studies 5 conclusions 1 the empirical function of feddes frf feddes et al 1978 is widely used for modeling transpiration and root water uptake rwu reductions caused by water stress but the limited number of calibration efforts performed with this model raises doubt about the applicability of the frf to a broad spectrum of environments and scenarios 2 the frf is feasible to make reasonable predictions of cumulative crop yield and water balance components when it is applied as a subroutine in calibrated robust hydrological softwares such as swap and hydrus 3 the frf is unfeasible to study actual transpiration dynamics since it cannot predict accurately rwu when drought stress and compensated uptake are important factors in such cases the use of mechanistic rwu models instead of the frf is recommended 4 available modifications of the frf can improve rwu predictions under aeration stress but they increase the number of required parameters or rely on simplifications of the rooting density profile 5 the calibration of the frf by inverse modeling is attractive and feasible when the soil hydraulic parameters and the root parameters are included in the calibration process executed by a global optimizer 6 the water balance represented by crop transpiration soil evaporation runoff and deep drainage and the crop yield simulated by the swap model with the frf for a sugarcane scenario in brazil showed sensitive to h2 and h4 but insensitive to h1 h3h and h3l pointing to conceptual imperfections in the frf 7 further studies should be carried out to better evaluate the applicability of modified versions of the frf and mechanistic macroscopic models as alternatives to the original frf to predict rwu and crop transpiration in drought limited and

4014,the widely used feddes reduction function frf was reviewed in the context of its merits and shortcomings for modeling root water uptake rwu crop transpiration and soil water balance components the empirical nature of the frf was contrasted to few calibrations reported in the literature and the conditions where the correct operation of the frf was of limited importance were discussed some alerts regarding the feasibility of this function in hydrological studies were provided and reinforced by a case study with sugarcane under subtropical conditions available modifications of the frf can improve rwu predictions under aeration stress but some conceptual imperfections make it inaccurate under drought stress and high compensated uptake in such cases the use of mechanistic rwu models in replacement of the frf is recommended to accurately predict the actual transpiration dynamics the calibration of the frf by inverse modeling is feasible although some of the frf parameters are insensitive to model outputs keywords svat processes drought stress model sensitivity hydrological modeling inverse modeling 1 introduction transpiration the evaporation of water from stomata in plant leaves is one of the key processes in soil vegetation atmosphere transfer of water it is preceded and strongly linked to the uptake of water by the plant root system under relatively wet soil conditions the transpiration rate is usually sink limited i e it depends on the atmospheric conditions and on the shape and the properties of the boundary layer between the plant and the atmosphere when the soil water content is below a certain threshold the process turns into source limited and soil hydraulic properties together with rooting characteristics will determine the transpiration rate de jong van lier et al 2013 dos santos et al 2017 quantitative studies with hydrological models are useful tools for a better understanding of these complex interactions between soil plant and atmosphere and the involved driving factors most models dealing with root water uptake rwu and transpiration rate consider both to be numerically the same rwu may be considered at two scales referred to as macroscopic and microscopic scales green et al 2006 on a macroscopic scale rwu is modeled as a sink term in the richards equation and the dependence of rwu on the soil hydraulic status is usually represented by empirical reduction functions describing the relative decrease in rwu and consequently of transpiration or evapotranspiration as a function of soil water content or pressure head examples of such empirical reduction functions are presented by dirksen and augustijn 1988 doorenbos and kassam 1979 feddes et al 1976 1978 li et al 2006 tiktak and bouten 1992 and van genuchten 1987 the feddes et al 1978 transpiration reduction function here referred to as frf stands out for its wide use and incorporation in classical hydrological softwares such as swap kroes et al 2017 hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 and wave vanclooster et al 1996 and is also used in recently developed tools e g by difonzo et al 2021 the frf was developed in 1977 and first published in 1978 feddes et al 1978 the main objective according to the authors was to overcome the shortcomings and difficulties regarding the application of other more exact models for rwu zaradny 1992 the frf is a piecewise linear function that describes a root water uptake reduction factor α between 0 and 1 five stages of water uptake are described bounded by four values of pressure head h1 h2 h3 h4 the value of h1 delimits the phase of complete aeration deficiency and null uptake in a near saturated soil anoxic phase between h1 and h2 the hypoxic phase the rwu increases linearly as air filled porosity increases in the range between h2 and h3 constant rate phase there is no water stress or aeration stress and rwu equals the potential rwu between h3 and h4 falling rate phase rwu decreases linearly to zero below h4 delimiting the permanent wilting phase rwu equals zero fig 1 parameter h3 may be considered to correspond to the irrigation trigger point used in irrigation management its value is commonly considered to depend on the atmospheric evaporative demand and model performance may increase if its value is defined as a function of the rate of potential transpiration tp the most common assumption is that h3 decreases linearly with decreasing tp a common parameterization kroes et al 2017 considers an upper bound h3h for tp 5 mmd 1 high atmospheric demand a lower bound h3l for tp 1 mmd 1 low atmospheric demand and a linear variation for tp between 1 and 5 mmd 1 fig 1 ideally the values of h3h and h3l must be calibrated for different plants growth stages root system size and distribution climatic conditions and soil types cai et al 2017 dos santos et al 2017 homaee et al 2002 vandoorne et al 2012 parameter h4 which corresponds to the classical permanent wilting point is also crop specific but it is commonly fixed at a value of 15 000 cm despite criticism metselaar and de jong van lier 2007 savage et al 1996 many authors alert about the fact that the frf may over simplify one of the most complex processes in the soil vegetation atmosphere system cai et al 2017 de jong van lier et al 2013 dos santos et al 2017 durigon et al 2012 egea et al 2016 javaux et al 2013 nguyen et al 2020 vandoorne et al 2012 verhoef and egea 2014 the function does not explicitly include the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the soil root interface the compensation mechanisms between stressed and non stressed roots and the plant internal resistance to water flow which are well known factors affecting rwu both soil physical and root physiological factors are important for the proper modeling of rwu de willigen et al 2012 hence to understand and interrelate all these factors a mechanistic approach is more suitable de jong van lier et al 2013 wu et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 one of the first attempts to develop a process based rwu model is attributed to gardner 1960 who presented an analytical solution for water movement towards a single root a scale commonly referred to as microscopic although mesoscopic would be more appropriate raats 2007 since then several models have been developed on the microscopic scale with simulations and detailed descriptions of water flows on the absorbent root surface and in the soil root interface cowan 1965 de jong van lier et al 2006 de willigen and van noordwijk 1987 raats 2007 these single root models are not readily applicable to practical situations but they provide information to develop mechanistic macroscopic models dos santos et al 2017 like those proposed by couvreur et al 2012 de jong van lier et al 2013 2008 doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2013 2008 schneider et al 2010 and vogel et al 2013 even with the wide availability of mechanistic macroscopic models to describe rwu the empirical frf has been widely used for modeling water uptake due to its relative simplicity and lower data requirements homaee et al 2002 wu et al 2021 in this review paper we address the merits and the shortcomings of the frf for modeling rwu crop transpiration and soil water balance components the objectives are 1 to discuss the use and feasibility of the frf to study different processes related to transpiration and rwu 2 to present shortcomings and modifications of the frf to simulate rwu in drought reduced and aeration reduced conditions 3 to discuss the calibration of the frf reported in literature added by an own case study under subtropical conditions 2 scientific reports referring to the feddes reduction function more than one hundred peer reviewed papers published between 1978 and 2021 were found in which the frf was applied for modeling transpiration or rwu reductions caused by water stress in most of them the values of the feddes parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l and h4 were not obtained experimentally nor optimized in some way in such cases the authors used values retrieved from literature sometimes with adjustments but without giving further details e g brunetti et al 2019 busoni et al 1983 dash et al 2015 durigon et al 2012 gabiri et al 2018 kambale et al 2017 karandish and šimůnek 2018 2017 klosterhalfen et al 2017 luo et al 2003 lv et al 2014 patle et al 2018 phogat et al 2019 2018 2017 2010 pinheiro et al 2019 salehi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 wine et al 2015 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2010 žydelis et al 2018 in contrast only a few attempts at the optimization of the feddes parameters were made e g cai et al 2017 dainese and tarantino 2020 dos santos et al 2017 homaee et al 2002 hopmans and guttièrez ravé 1988 massoud et al 2019 sela et al 2015 vandoorne et al 2012 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2013 some of these attempts are discussed later in this paper the usual procedure to apply the frf mainly for modeling drought stress is using reference values of the feddes parameters from taylor and ashcroft 1972 and wesseling et al 1991 these two references are the basis of the hydrus database of those parameters for different plants šejna et al 2011 the former is also cited in the swap documentation for the same purpose kroes et al 2017 while the latter corresponds to the input instructions manual of swatre a precursor of swap belmans et al 1983 therefore it can be stated that when the source of the feddes parameters was one out of wesseling et al 1991 the swap database or the hydrus database e g berezniak et al 2018 fernandez bou et al 2020 garcía morillo et al 2017 gliege et al 2016 groh et al 2016 gubiani and mentges 2020 karandish and šimůnek 2016 lugli and mahler 2015 miller et al 2020 palermo et al 2019 qasemi et al 2016 rieckh et al 2014 wongkaew et al 2018 in fact all of these derived from taylor and ashcroft 1972 the values compiled by taylor and ashcroft 1972 were either obtained by soil pressure head integration or water depletion fractions conversions over the entire rooting depth some refer to observations below the depth of maximum root concentration and many others refer to unpublished works van den berg and driessen 2002 besides their compilation did not include aspects of root length density or soil hydraulic properties that strongly affect the determination of limiting soil hydraulic conditions de jong van lier et al 2013 2008 the fact that this sole source is repeated over and over since 1972 suggests a weak experimental basis of indicative values van den berg and driessen 2002 indeed few experimental studies have been devoted to determining the onset of the falling rate phase of water uptake e g casaroli et al 2010 dainese and tarantino 2020 garg et al 2015 rabbel et al 2018 thus there is no evidence that the frf is suitable for application to a broad spectrum of environments without onsite calibration given the empirical nature of the frf contrasting to few calibrations one may question why it has been applied successfully and usefully molz 1981 in different kinds of weather soil plant conditions adane et al 2018 bai et al 2020 busoni et al 1983 de willigen et al 2012 eitzinger et al 2004 feddes et al 1988 luo et al 2003 ren et al 2016 utset et al 2000 zaradny 1992 it is important to emphasize that the frf is commonly included in hydrological models with several subroutines thus the good performance of these models does not mean that each of their subsections such as the rwu function performed well in an absolute sense but only that within the context of the overall model it was operating successfully molz 1981 one can even state that such success is more likely related to other model subsections such as the soil hydraulic functions usually performed by discretization of the richards equation van dam and feddes 2000 due to the relative insensitivity to rwu parameters bai et al 2020 dafny and šimůnek 2016 de jong van lier et al 2015 hupet et al 2003 2002 rabbel et al 2018 stahn et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 in fact the importance of rwu might be lower or higher depending on the process of interest 2 1 adaptations for modeling root water uptake most of the successful applications of the frf used adapted approaches for modeling rwu when compared to the original study published in 1978 in the original model published by feddes et al 1978 the sink term s in the richards equation is equal to the maximum water uptake smax calculated as the ratio between tp and the rooting depth multiplied by the transpiration reduction factor α h hence the distribution of tp is considered uniform over depth one of the first modifications was proposed by hoogland et al 1981 who considered that smax is a decreasing function with depth while the α h function described by the frf is left unchanged such consideration accounts for both compensatory effects and a shift in time of maximum water uptake from the surface downward van den berg and driessen 2002 later hayhoe and de jong 1988 and prasad 1988 adapted this approach and incorporated linear root density distribution functions over the rooting depth in the sink term since the publication of these studies several models that include the frf with non homogeneous root distributions over depth were reported either using linear hupet et al 2002 zuo et al 2004 nonlinear li et al 2001 1999 ojha and rai 1996 wu et al 1999 or flexible root density distributions feddes et al 2001 luo et al 2003 the latter corresponds to one of the current swap approaches for modeling rwu which can handle any distribution of the root length density over depth kroes et al 2017 the frf has been used with several of these rooting density profiles either calibrated from field observations of the root system or taken from previous studies under similar conditions e g brunetti et al 2021 durigon et al 2012 egea et al 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 klement et al 2016 phogat et al 2019 2018 2017 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2010 other adaptations of the feddes model account for compensation and the hysteresis effect on water uptake some hydrological softwares such as swap and hydrus include a modified version of the jarvis model for rwu jarvis 1989 using the frf with a root adaptability factor this factor represents a threshold value above which the reduction of rwu in stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by increased uptake from other parts šejna et al 2011 this approach is usually referred to as the feddes jarvis model cai et al 2018 2017 lei et al 2019 and can provide good predictions for low and medium root length density scenarios dos santos et al 2017 given some inconsistencies of the jarvismodel peters 2016 proposed a simple modification that limits compensated rwu to a better justified maximum value peters et al 2017 regarding the hysteresis effect a water stress recovery coefficient was recently proposed by wu et al 2020 to improve predictions by the frf during wetting drying cycles in the soil this was achieved by quantifying the dynamic effects of water stress on winter wheat recovery from lysimetric experiments significant improvements in predictions of actual transpiration and soil water content were obtained using their approach consideration of the hysteresis effect can also improve the parameterization of rwu reduction functions like the frf as demonstrated by wu et al 2021 in another approach carminati 2012 proposed a model in which the delay of soil wetting and drying after irrigation is ascribed to the mucilage exuded by roots the polymeric mucilage is able to hold considerable volumes of water but turns hydrophobic when it dries difonzo et al 2021 consideration of these effects of mucilage may be crucial for setting the right parameters of the frf and is an interesting subject for further studies 2 2 is the feddes reduction function feasible in general the frf as a subroutine in hydrological models seems to be feasible for reasonable predictions of cumulative values of transpiration or evapotranspiration de willigen et al 2012 molz 1981 sela et al 2015 deep drainage wine et al 2015 groundwater discharge kambale et al 2017 patle et al 2018 and crop yields busoni et al 1983 eitzinger et al 2004 feddes et al 1988 ren et al 2016 the frf has also been useful as a background subroutine to simulate nutrient uptake and leaching eltarabily et al 2019a 2019b karandish and šimůnek 2017 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 yang et al 2017 uptake of chemicals brunetti et al 2021 2019 saline stress berezniak et al 2018 hong et al 2017 phogat et al 2010 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2013 and both water saline and nutrient stresses babazadeh et al 2021 on the other hand for the accurate prediction of transpiration dynamics and root water uptake profiles the frf tends to fail cai et al 2017 casaroli et al 2010 dos santos et al 2017 durigon et al 2012 molz 1981 vogel et al 2013 in such cases the use of mechanistic models accompanied by informative measurements is strongly recommended to simulate soil water content profiles using robust hydrological softwares such as swap or hydrus the correct operation of the frf seems to be of limited importance de jong van lier et al 2015 jhorar et al 2004 lv et al 2014 pinheiro et al 2019 stahn et al 2017 in many cases soil water content dynamics are shown to be insensitive to root water uptake parameters compared to soil hydraulic parameters bai et al 2020 dafny and šimůnek 2016 de jong van lier et al 2015 hupet et al 2003 2002 rabbel et al 2018 stahn et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 this explains why a proper calibration of the frf is hardly ever emphasized when soil water balance components are studied de jong van lier et al 2015 3 shortcomings and modifications some conceptual shortcomings of the frf were addressed by a detailed analysis of the plant transpiration behavior under water stress conditions in a review of soil water thresholds for modeling drought stress sadras and milroy 1996 showed that in 10 out of 18 studies a piecewise linear function was used to describe evapo transpiration reduction functions while in the other 7 studies a nonlinear function was used predominantly a convex concave type function the question regarding the theoretical shape of the transpiration reduction function was handled by de jong van lier et al 2009 and metselaar and de jong van lier 2007 who analyzed transpiration rates in the falling rate phase by numerical experiments they concluded that a combined convex concave reduction function is a more likely shape for the reduction function than a linear function they also verified that under limiting hydraulic conditions relative transpiration equals relative matric flux potential regardless of soil type these conclusions were experimentally corroborated by casaroli et al 2010 who compared predictions of relative transpiration of common bean using linear reduction functions with water content pressure head h or matric flux potential m and verified that the m based function and the h based function had the best and the worst performance respectively explicit microscopic functions derived for m during both the constant rate and the falling rate phase de jong van lier et al 2006 metselaar and de jong van lier 2007 were extended by de jong van lier et al 2008 to a layered soil profile with distinct hydraulic properties according to the authors their proposed model does not increase the number of parameters to predict rwu and allows simulating boundary conditions as found in the field vertical soil water redistribution and compensated rwu restrictions this more process based reduction function was incorporated into swap and it is currently available to predict drought reduced rwu as an alternative to the frf kroes et al 2017 this function was further improved to account for internal plant resistances to water flow by de jong van lier et al 2013 some modifications of the frf were proposed to improve the calculation of water uptake during the hypoxic phase in which relative transpiration reduces due to aeration stress bartholomeus et al 2008 claimed that a detailed analysis of the hypoxic phase between h1 and h2 had never been performed in contrast to the falling rate phase between h3 and h4 as previously discussed furthermore as already recognized by feddes et al 1978 an identical value of h2 for all environmental conditions seems to be inappropriate because pressure heads do not provide direct information on the soil aeration status the flow of oxygen into the root zone physically does not depend on the pressure head but on the amount of air filled pores and their connectivity in space peters et al 2017 to address this shortcoming of the frf bartholomeus et al 2008 developed a process based model to compute plant aeration stress considering the oxygen consumption by roots respiration described by plant physiological processes and the oxygen transport through the soil described by physical laws both relevant biotic and abiotic factors related to aeration stress were taken into account simulation of the actual root respiration for a crop requires actual data on soil type daily soil temperature and daily gas filled porosity in each soil layer provided the necessary data the bartholomeus model can replace the frf for rwu predictions under aeration reduced conditions as available in the current version of swap kroes et al 2017 in contrast to the complex approach of bartholomeus et al 2008 peters et al 2017 suggested a simple improvement of the frf to predict aeration stress they described rwu in the hypoxic phase by a reduction scheme as a function of air content whereas rwu in the falling rate phase was kept described by the original approach of feddes the authors advocated that the proposed model is a conceptually more consistent representation of water stress in the hypoxic phase although the assumption of a homogeneous root distribution is certainly over simplified for homogeneous fine textured soils predicted rwu by the modified frf did not achieve its potential rate while in stochastic heterogeneous soil predicted rwu was more pronounced at the interfaces between fine and coarse regions with potential implications for plant growth as emphasized by peters et al 2017 their approach is particularly relevant under wet climatic conditions in irrigated agriculture or for soils with a high water table 4 calibration of the feddes reduction function as mentioned before the frf needs calibration for each scenario of weather climate conditions together with soil and crop properties but such calibration is performed only rarely following feddes et al 1978 the first calibration report comes from hopmans and guttièrez ravé 1988 who proposed a procedure to calibrate the frf considering the variability of soil hydraulic properties in a 650 ha watershed in thenetherlands based on field data they used a monte carlo analysis in combination with a trial and error procedure to optimize the five feddes parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 in this analysis the swatre software belmans et al 1983 was used to simulate unsaturated soil water transport several times thereby generating spatially variable soil hydraulic properties in each simulation the feddes parameters were optimized using various parameter combinations and comparing predicted values of actual evapotranspiration eta with two year averages of measured eta from an energy balance and a mass balance of the watershed according to the authors they obtained an rwu model that was valid for the whole area and independent of the choice of one particular calibration site in the watershed using a more sophisticated calibration technique sela et al 2015 optimized h1 h2 h3h h3l and h4 for a shrub species sarcopoterium spinosum based on measured cumulative eta from lysimeter experiments and the hydrus software a plausible range of each parameter was estimated based on literature and divided into a vector of 20 000 intervals to allow a high resolution search across the variable parameter space the parameter set leading to the best fit between measured and simulated cumulative eta values rmse 2 5 mm r2 0 96 was chosen and validated using independent datasets cai et al 2017 also used inverse modeling to derive parameter values of rwu models including the frf with compensated uptake feddes jarvis model they used measurements of soil water content soil water potential and cumulative daily actual transpiration of winter wheat both in absolute and differential values the obtained rwu parameters of the feddes jarvis model were consistent with data reported in the literature although h3h and h3l could not be uniquely identified other authors applied inverse modeling techniques to obtain the feddes parameters for tree species using sap flux and stem water potential dainese and tarantino 2020 massoud et al 2019 the inverse modeling method to optimize rwu parameters is attractive because few restrictions are imposed on the experimental conditions and the method provides parameter estimates for which the uncertainty ranges can be quantified hupet et al 2003 on the other hand this approach has some well known limitations which are mainly related to the non uniqueness of the optimized parameter set and the insensitivity of rwu parameters to some model outputs dafny and šimůnek 2016 hupet et al 2003 2002 stahn et al 2017 vandoorne et al 2012 in literature both successful ren et al 2016 xu et al 2013 and unsuccessful dafny and šimůnek 2016 homaee et al 2002 attempts to calibrate the frf by inverse modeling can be found some authors claimed that the inverse modeling method to derive the feddes parameters is only feasible for some soils e g coarse and very fine textured and this feasibility is strongly improved if the rwu parameters are optimized simultaneously with additional parameters hupet et al 2003 using multiple measured variables massoud et al 2019 and when soil hydraulic properties are known with high accuracy de jong van lier et al 2015 4 1 inverse modeling to calibrate the frf a case study to make an additional contribution regarding the feasibility of the inverse modeling approach to calibrate the frf a case study with sugarcane under subtropical conditions was performed and will be presented in the following 4 1 1 field experiment the study area is

inversely the parameter estimation suite pest doherty 2016 was linked with swap v 3 2 26 kroes et al 2008 the pest suite comprises the nonlinear pest program two pest compatible global optimizers six utility programs for building and checking pest input files and a sensitivity analysis sensan program which applies multiple running of the model using different parameter values for each run given the uncertainties in the soil hydraulic parameters and the root density parameters the feddes parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 were optimized together with the van genuchten mualem parameters θ r θ s α n ks l and the root parameter rdcz relative root density as a function of relative rooting depth z using the sceua p global optimizer sceua p implements the sce shuffled complex evolution algorithm described by duan 1991 and duan et al 1994 1992 1993 the sce method does not require the computation of derivatives of model outputs for the adjustable parameters hence it can operate successfully even where the relation between model parameters and model outputs is discontinuous or when it is contaminated by model generated numerical noise it can also perform well where the objective function features local optima in parameter space doherty 2016 the latter was a problem in this case study identified in previous attempts at optimization using the method executed by the pest program levenberg marquardt algorithm lm on the other hand the linear parameter uncertainty and identifiability statistics are not available in global methods thus to calculate the confidence intervals and the sensitivities of the optimized parameters the final global optima provided by sceua p were used as initial parameter values to run pest lm the fact that sceua p uses the same input files as pest lm favored the execution of this sequence of optimization methods the optimization procedure was carried out by using constraints in the parameter bounds to obtain a correct problem definition table 2 for instance the upper and lower bounds of the feddes parameters were defined avoiding overlapping of the parameter bounds as their physical meaning suggests h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 table 2 the initial values of h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 and rdcz were defined according to the previous calibration of the swap crop module for sugarcane scarpare 2011 and field observations of the root system in a nearby experimental area scarpare et al 2019 while the initial values of θ s θ r α n ks and l were those presented in table 1 and reproduced in table 2 the optimum parameters were obtained by systematically minimizing the deviations between observed obs and simulated sim variables the considered variables were the logarithmically transformed absolute pressure head pf log10 h cm at depths of 0 2 0 4 and 1 0 m and the actual crop evapotranspiration eta cmd 1 the numerical transformation of the pressure head was necessary to achieve stability of the inversion process since the default swap outputs are non transformed a simple software was programmed in fortran and linked to swap and pest suite by a batch file the comparison between observed and simulated values of pf and eta was applied only to the periods when the potential transpiration simulated by swap was greater than zero allowing to calculate the rwu reduction factor α h the following objective function ϕ was minimized by sceua p and pest lm 5 ϕ j 1 j i 1 n j sim i j obs i j 2 w i j where j is the number of variables in this case two variables pf and eta i is the number of the observation in the dataset of variable j that contains nj observations here 1 725 observations of pf and 553 observations of eta and wi j is the observation weight considered equal to 0 1 for pf observations and 1 0 for eta observations according to their magnitudes sceua p and pest lm were programmed to cease execution if the objective function was not reduced by more than one percent over five and three successive iterations respectively after optimization the residuals were evaluated by the root mean squared error of prediction rmsep and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse according to 6 rmsep i 1 n j sim i j obs i j 2 n j 7 nse 1 i 1 n j sim i j obs i j 2 i 1 n j obs i j obs j 2 where obs j is the average observed value for variable j 4 1 3 results and discussion the global optimum values of the five threshold pressure heads of the frf were h1 7 95 cm h2 13 52 cm h3h 806 cm h3l 2 164 cm and h4 15 880 cm table3 for h1 h2 and h3h the optimum values were higher than the initial values before h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3h 1 000 cm while for h3l and h4 the optimum values were lower before h3l 2 000 cm h4 10 000 cm being the optimum h3l close to the initial value these results indicate that after the parameter optimization the predicted aeration stress as well as the water stress under low evaporative demands tended to be lower and the constant rate phase of rwu was wider in general the 95 confidence limits range of the optimum parameters was wide and the parameter sensitivity was low mainly for h3h h3l and h4 table 3 it can be inferred that few observations were actually used to derive h4 which increased the uncertainties while h3h h3l were relatively insensitive to the variables observed regarding the van genuchten mualem parameters the global optima of θ r α and ks were lower than their initial values while the global optima of θ s n and l were higher the behavior of the 95 confidence limits range and the sensitivity was specific for each parameter but except for ks the parameter sensitivities were higher than those verified for the feddes parameters table3 the most important effect on the soil hydraulic properties was that the optimum values implied higher water contents in the low suction range of the soil water retention curve this also affected the hydraulic conductivity function which declined more gradually as the soil dried fig 2 the optimum values of the root density parameters rdcz were lower than the initial values for the relative rooting depths of 0 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 and higher for the relative rooting depths of 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 1 0 the 95 confidence limits ranges were generally wide and the parameter sensitivities were comparable to those of the soil hydraulic parameters l and θ s table3 after optimization the root density distribution over depth changed significantly fig 3 the deeper layers had the highest root densities instead of the top layers with implications that are discussed later before optimization although the model performance was satisfactory for simulation of soil water dynamics there were frequent underestimations of the pressure head values which revealed a systematic error in the soil hydraulic parameters fig 4 this error likely arose from the determination of such parameters by the traditional one step outflow method which assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium between an initially saturated soil sample and a pressure plate which is not always warranted bittelli and flury 2009 the water retention curves determined by inverse modeling of a transient nonequilibrium conditions may be considered more reliable de jong van lier et al 2019 indeed after optimization of the soil hydraulic parameters by inverse modeling the frequency of underestimations was reduced and in general the model predicted the pressure head values at the three analyzed depths more accurately fig 4 small errors in the soil hydraulic parameters may result in large errors in the transpiration fluxes hupet et al 2004 2002 certainly before optimization the model performance was unsatisfactory for the simulation of eta dynamics fig 5 large deviations 2mmd 1 between observed and simulated values of eta were obtained mainly in dry periods during the two cropping cycles in which eta was considerably underestimated after optimization these deviations were minimized and in general the eta values were better predicted fig 5 nevertheless frequent underestimations remained present and indicate some room for improvement in the model performance this could be achieved by using a mechanistic approach to predict transpiration reductions caused by water stress the use of a reduction function that accounts for compensation in replacement of the frf in the swap crop module e g the functions of jarvis 1989 de jong van lier et al 2008 and jarvis 2010 may mitigate reductions in rwu and transpiration rates as shown by durigon et al 2012 and dos santos et al 2017 a mechanistic rwu model would require more informative measurements the improvements in the prediction of pressure head expressed as pf at depths of 0 2 0 4 and 1 0 m and actual evapotranspiration eta were corroborated by the statistical indexes before optimization the nse was negative for pf0 4 m and eta which means that the observations averages had greater predictive power than the model used the rmsep for eta was above 2 mmd 1 which denoted a poor model performance after optimization the rmsep reduced and the nse increased and expressed positive values for all observation groups table 4 the rmsep for eta reduced by 40 from 2 15 to 1 28 mmd 1 which means that a reasonable model performance was achieved for simulation of eta dynamics the comparison of the actual transpiration ta dynamics simulated before and after optimization revealed that the optimum parameters generally led to increments in simulated daily ta values mainly during dry periods fig 6 this result shows that the crop was more resilient to drought stress by a combined effect of less limiting threshold pressure heads of the frf more water availability in the soil fig 2 and higher root densities in deeper layers fig 3 the root redistribution in the soil profile directly impacted the predicted root water uptake rwu over time and depth before optimization the rwu was concentrated in the top layers fig 7 higher initial water uptake from the top layers led to quick depletion and reduction of rwu from these layers after optimization the rwu was concentrated in deeper layers fig 7 where the soil water availability was greater allowing higher and relatively more persistent rwu rates the strong correlation between root density distribution and rwu is expect when the frf is applied since there is no uptake compensation in this model and the potential rwu and transpiration rates are weighted by the root length density regarding the crop yield the predictions of sugarcane yield at harvest were satisfactory for the two cropping cycles although the values were underestimated before and overestimated after optimization fig 8 it is important to emphasize that the swap crop module does not consider possible losses due to suboptimal crop nutrition pests weeds and harvest operation so a certain level of yield overestimation could be expected before optimization the difference between simulated and observed values of yield at harvest was 6 9 mg ha 1 for the first year and 8 4 mg ha 1 for the ratoon after optimization this difference was 4 3 mg ha 1 and 7 5 mg ha 1 respectively fig 8 based on these results the imperfections in the frf seemed to be of limited importance for the simulation of crop yield which corroborates the findings from the literature review 4 2 sensitivity of model outputs to the feddes parameters because of the low sensitivities obtained in the optimization procedure table 3 a sensitivity analysis sa was performed to quantify the variability of model outputs explained by each threshold pressure head of the frf the sensan program doherty 2016 was linked to the swap software kroes et al 2008 and executed several times using different values of h1 h2 h3h h3l and h4 for each parameter a base value equal to the initial value in the optimization procedure and another 100 values uniformly distributed between rational limits were defined table 5 for each run one parameter was varied while the other four parameters were fixed at their base values the following model outputs were considered the water balance represented by cumulative values of actual transpiration actual soil evaporation runoff and deep drainage mm and the actual crop yield mg ha 1 these outputs were quantified for each cropping cycle first year and ratoon for a 31 day rainy period rp from january 1 to january 31 and for a 31 day dry period dp from june 15 to july 15 obviously higher sensitivities are expected for h1 and h2 during rainy periods and for h3h h3l and h4 during dry periods because of the expected soil water status the values of the water balance variables and the actual crop yield did not vary significantly with the values of h1 h3h and h3l fig 9 regardless of the period considered first year ratoon rp and dp yet more evident in rp and dp higher variabilities were obtained for actual transpiration and actual crop yield as a function of h2 and h4 respectively fig 9 these two variables are more related to crop type than actual soil evaporation runoff and deep drainage so the calibration efforts may be concentrated in h2 and h4 for proper simulation of crop growth and consequently the water balance on the other hand the values of h1 h3h and h3l can be retrieved from literature however it is important to emphasize that the parameter ranges defined for h2 and h4 may be too wide i e h2 50 cm and h4 8 000 cm are unlikely to be used for sugarcane hence all results of this case study point to conceptual imperfections in the frf and reinforce the alerts regarding the feasibility of this function in hydrological studies 5 conclusions 1 the empirical function of feddes frf feddes et al 1978 is widely used for modeling transpiration and root water uptake rwu reductions caused by water stress but the limited number of calibration efforts performed with this model raises doubt about the applicability of the frf to a broad spectrum of environments and scenarios 2 the frf is feasible to make reasonable predictions of cumulative crop yield and water balance components when it is applied as a subroutine in calibrated robust hydrological softwares such as swap and hydrus 3 the frf is unfeasible to study actual transpiration dynamics since it cannot predict accurately rwu when drought stress and compensated uptake are important factors in such cases the use of mechanistic rwu models instead of the frf is recommended 4 available modifications of the frf can improve rwu predictions under aeration stress but they increase the number of required parameters or rely on simplifications of the rooting density profile 5 the calibration of the frf by inverse modeling is attractive and feasible when the soil hydraulic parameters and the root parameters are included in the calibration process executed by a global optimizer 6 the water balance represented by crop transpiration soil evaporation runoff and deep drainage and the crop yield simulated by the swap model with the frf for a sugarcane scenario in brazil showed sensitive to h2 and h4 but insensitive to h1 h3h and h3l pointing to conceptual imperfections in the frf 7 further studies should be carried out to better evaluate the applicability of modified versions of the frf and mechanistic macroscopic models as alternatives to the original frf to predict rwu and crop transpiration in drought limited and
