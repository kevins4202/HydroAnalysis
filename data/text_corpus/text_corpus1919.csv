9595,accurate quantification of semiarid energy partitioning and actual evapotranspiration et c is necessary to understand the variability in regional energy and the water cycle which is expected to intensify under climate change the seasonal and interannual variability in surface energy and et and its responses to environmental and biophysical factors of grassland and cropland with maize zea mays and ecosystems over the east asian summer monsoon transition zone of china were investigated using multiyear 2003 2008 eddy covariance measurements the study sites received 65 84 of the annual precipitation pr during the east asian summer monsoon easm june august with the lowest values in the weak easm years of 2004 and 2007 seasonal and interannual variations in the portioning of net radiation to turbulent fluxes were mainly controlled by pr via changes in soil water content swc and vegetation growth drastic changes in the bowen ratio vegetation growth and energy fluxes occurred after the onset of easm during the cool winter and dry spring and autumn the sensible heat flux was the largest component of the energy balance and the latent heat flux dominated during warm and wet periods of summer monthly et was 24 8 and 25 6 mm for the grassland and cropland respectively and they peaked at 89 0 mm and 113 9 mm respectively in july monthly et was positively correlated with monthly pr ta the soil water drought stress index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the surface conductance gs and the priestley taylor coefficient et et eq during the growing seasons april september annual et varied from 215 to 373 mm in grassland and from 227 to 390 mm in cropland with the lowest value during the severe drought year of 2007 interannual variations in et were primarily controlled by annual effective precipitation frequency and interannual variations in summer et were modulated by the summer monsoon duration period through changes in summer pr swc and vegetation growth keywords semiarid region effective precipitation frequency drought stress index bulk parameters summer monsoon period 1 introduction semiarid biomes cover a large portion of earth s terrestrial surface and the exchange of energy and water vapor between the land surface and the atmosphere in these regions is a driver of earth s climate from local to global scales krishnan et al 2012 the partitioning of net radiation to turbulent fluxes and soil heat flux is mainly dominated by factors such as climate land cover characteristics hydrological processes boundary layer development plant functional type and phenology and canopy succession stages wilson et al 2002 kutal et al 2012 eichelmann et al 2016 additionally water cycling is a primary component of ecosystems that links many biogeochemical and energy cycles wilson and baldocchi 2000 however the implications of the large scale production of grassland and cropland on local water and energy cycles are not well known in the east asian summer monsoon easm transition zone yue et al 2019 an effect of climate change is an increase in the frequency of droughts and dry spells across large parts of north china including many vital regions for grassland and agricultural production du and liu 2013 therefore investigating water vapor and energy exchange processes in different ecosystems is necessary information on seasonal and interannual variability in evapotranspiration et has been of particular importance because of its close link to ecosystem productivity and land surface atmosphere interactions wilson and baldocchi 2000 et is the second largest component of the global water cycle over land masses after precipitation pascolini campbell et al 2021 especially for terrestrial ecosystems et is a crucial variable involved in understanding interactions between precipitation and the atmosphere thomey et al 2011 kutal et al 2012 et also has significant impacts on regional climate extremes findell et al 2017 ren et al 2021 information on seasonal and interannual variations in et is particularly important because of its close link to ecosystem productivity water dynamics and regional climate via land surface interactions wang et al 2016 et is controlled by a combination of atmospheric evaporative demand the energy available at the surface and the water supply because of the complex interactions among soil air and plants allen et al 1998 advances in micrometeorological instrumentation that quantify et in different ecosystems such as grassland krishnan et al 2012 eichelmann et al 2016 cropland suyker and verma 2008 kimm et al 2020 and deserts ma et al 2015 via in situ observations have significantly promoted the understanding of interactions among soil vegetation and atmosphere as well as the effect of et in response to environmental changes within different ecosystems in semiarid regions ma et al 2015 adnan et al 2017 yue et al 2020 nearly 30 of earth s continental surface is semiarid yue et al 2019 and the regulation of hydrological processes by biological environmental and climatic factors in this region has long been a critical research topic scott et al 2006 li et al 2021 large scale changes in vegetation in water limited systems are an essential component of global change baldocchi et al 2004 li et al 2021 in addition to natural disturbances anthropogenic disturbances such as grazing and excessive cropping influence land surface processes which can affect surface albedo and radiation fluxes leading to local temperature changes and eventually vegetation responses pielke 2001 ren et al 2021 crop cultivation and grazing represent the two major land use practices in northeast china because of the rapidly increasing human population liu et al 2012 therefore investigating et in grassland and cropland ecosystems to improve the understanding of its link with other ecosystem processes wever et al 2002 and the water balance of terrestrial ecosystems yunusa et al 2004 miao et al 2009 would contribute to the literature studies have demonstrated that semiarid regions are usually limited by water huang et al 2015 yue et al 2020 the et of semiarid regions differs from that of humid and arid regions on seasonal and interannual scales for example the annual et in semiarid regions uses a large amount of rainfall on the land surface seddon et al 2016 brutsaert et al 2020 but actual et could be higher than pr due to the water storage in the soil and ground water contribution from shallow water table and dew events can also obviously affect surface water budgets zhang et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 in contrast with et reported in humid regions information on seasonal and interannual variability in et and its behavior in semiarid regions remains unclear particularly in northeast china furthermore annual pr in this region has an uneven spatiotemporal distribution and is strongly related to the easm zhang et al 2016a 2016b the summer monsoon dominates the pr variation and the seasonal drought in the easm transition zone zhang et al 2020 due to the interannual variation and interdecadal oscillation of the intensity the duration period and the northern edge of the easm the annual pr especially rainfall amount during the summer monsoon period fluctuates significantly zhang et al 2016a 2016b li et al 2021 therefore understanding how et exchange in grassland and cropland responds to environmental and biophysical factors is important however the controlling factors are interactively coupled with biosphere atmosphere system making it difficult to interpret the et as a result of the controlling factors bulk parameters including prestley taylor coefficient and surface conductance can be used to estimate the effects of these controls on et long term observations can help researchers obtain the magnitude and the seasonal interannual variations of these parameters thus it is possible to distinguish the impact of natural changes and human activities on the water cycle and improve the estimation of the land surface processes contribution used in hydrometeorological and climate models wilson and baldocchi 2000 in this study our main focus is on energy partitioning and et in the semiarid grassland of northeast china and cropland with rain fed maize in the easm transition zone between 2003 and 2008 the main objectives of this study were to 1 examine the seasonal and interannual variations in energy and water vapor fluxes 2 determine the effects of seasonal changes in environmental and canopy level biophysical factors on et and 3 understand the factors controlling the interannual variation in et in the easm transition zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description measurements analyzed in this study were performed between 2003 and 2008 at two flux towers in tongyu county 44 25 n 122 52 e northeastern china which is in the summer monsoon transition zone of china and has a continental climate fig 1 the area included two land types a grassland ecosystem and a maize cropland ecosystem the grassland is dominated by a chloris virgata community and the cropland ecosystem is a single maize cropping system the average air temperature for january and july were 15 7 c and 24 c respectively with the mean annual temperature 1961 2002 is 5 6 c the annual precipitation observed from tongyu weather station was 391 9 mm of which approximately 74 occurred during summer monsoon periods june august table 1 during the study period the six year annual average precipitation at the observation site was 296 mm which was approximately 24 lower than the long term average precipitation the soil is mainly composed of salty alkaline meadow soil and light chernozem the average field water capacity and wilting coefficient are 20 16 and 7 12 respectively the soil bulk densities are 1 39 1 42 and 1 55 g cm 3 for the depth of 10 40 and 80 cm respectively with an average value of 1 45 g cm 3 and the soil organic matter is approximately 6 84 g kg 1 the experimental site where the eddy covariance system was installed is located in the red triangle two types of ecosystems were selected for intercomparison namely a grassland ecosystem and a maize cropland ecosystem they were separated by 5 km the maximum canopy heights were 0 1 and 1 8 m for the grassland and cropland ecosystems respectively the semiarid grassland was mainly covered by chloris virgata and the annual weed communities in order to compare with the grassland the cropland was rainfed without extra irrigation both ecosystems extended more than 4 km2 and the terrain was flat liu et al 2008 the most frequent wind direction range are 180 210 southwest during the growing seasons and 280 310 west northwest during non growing seasons fig a the flux source areas around two sites under different conditions and stratification conditions were determined using the flux source area model schmid 1994 for 2003 2008 fig 2 for the area responsible for 90 of the surface effect under vegetation conditions fig 2a and b the maximum source location xm i e the upwind distance of the surface element with maximal effect on a given sensor is approximately 48 m and 39 m for the grassland and cropland respectively the distances from the near end a and far end e of the area to the sensor are approximately 23 m and 170 m for the grassland and 12 m and 162 m for the cropland respectively the maximum lateral half width d of the source area is approximately 35 m for the grassland and 32 m for the cropland respectively fig 2c and d show that in the areas responsible for 90 of the surface effect xm a e and d are approximately 45 22 160 and 21 m for the grassland and 41 20 120 and 19 m for the cropland respectively when the stratification is unstable 0 02 z l 1 z is the hight of the eddy covariance system above the ground l is the stability length which is adequate for eddy covariance measurements 2 2 energy fluxes and meteorological measurements the turbulent fluxes at the two sites were measured continuously using the eddy covariance ec technique ec instruments at each site were mounted at heights of 2 m for the grassland and 3 5 m for the cropland to measure water vapor and turbulent fluxes respectively the ec instruments consisted of a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific usa and an open path co2 h2o analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln usa which were taken at 10 hz via a computer controlled data logging system half hourly turbulent fluxes were calculated using the covariance of fluctuations in the vertical wind component and scalar quantities namely the air temperature for sensible heat and the density of water vapor for latent heat details are provided by liu et al 2008 the air temperature humidity hmp45c visalia inc helsinki finland and wind speed 034a metone inc were measured at heights of 2 4 8 12 and 17 m for the grassland and cropland ecosystems downward and upward radiations cm21 cg4 kipp zonen inc were measured at 2 and 3 m to avoid the impact of crops on radiation in peak growth seasons for the grassland and cropland respectively soil water content swc sc616 campbell

a cr 23x data logger table 2 sixteen day composite modis land surface reflectance mod09a1 data for single pixels mean value composite with 250 m spatial resolution containing the geo location coordinates of a flux tower were downloaded from the data portal of the earth observation and modeling facility of the university of oklahoma http eomf ou edu visualization 2 3 flux data processing the quality control of the raw observational data was similar to that yue et al 2015 before data calculation the data of sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le were treated with spike detection and removal and the wind coordinates were rotated using the double rotation method wilczak et al 2001 in addition sonic temperature fluctuation was considered to correct the sensible heat flux and the webb pearman leuning correction was used to adjust the density change resulting from fluctuations in latent heat webb et al 1980 we screened and eliminated the ec flux data for anomalous or spurious values caused by precipitation and system failure any value that exceeded four standard deviations in a window of 10 values was deleted approximately 23 and 26 of ec flux data for grassland and cropland with maize from 2003 to 2008 respectively were deleted data gaps shorter than 2 h were filled using linear interpolation and gaps longer than 2 h were filled using the mean diurnal variation method falge et al 2001 all data were converted to 30 min averaged data for analysis raw data within 30 min that did not fulfill the criteria were eliminated in the analysis and replaced via the gap filling strategy liu et al 2012 beijing time gmt 8 was used throughout the analyses before filling the data gaps the energy balance closure was estimated for each year via the linear regression of the sum of all half hourly turbulent fluxes h le against available energy rn g where rn is the net radiation h is sensible heat flux le is latent heat flux and g is soil heat flux g gz δ g where gz is the measured ground heat flux at 5 cm depth and δ g is the ground storage above soil heat plates yue et al 2011 ec measurement energy closure was checked using the energy balance ratio ebr and ordinary least squares methods wilson et al 2002 1 ebr h le rn g 2 rn g h le 2 4 additional data analysis 2 4 1 evapotranspiration surface daily et mm day 1 was calculated as follows 3 et le l ρ w where le is the latent heat flux mjm 2 day 1 l is the latent heat of vaporization of water 2 45 kj g 1 and ρ w is the water density 1 g cm 3 the daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation corrected by the food and agriculture organization on a daily scale allen et al 1998 4 et 0 0 48 s rn g γ 900 t a 273 u vpd s γ 1 0 34 u where rn is the net radiation mjm 2

curve at a certain temperature kpa k 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa k 1 2 4 2 bulk parameters to improve the understanding of seasonal and interannual variations in energy fluxes and et and its controlling factors we calculated several bulk parameters such as surface conductance g s m s 1 aerodynamic conductance g a m s 1 the priestley taylor coefficient et et eq and the decoupling coefficient ω which are indicative of ecosystem function were calculated g s representing the efficiency of exchange between the top vegetation surface and atmosphere was calculated using the actual data on le from the inverted penman monteith equation dolman et al 1991 5 g s γ g a 1 β s vpd c p g a p r rn g s γ aerodynamic conductance g a m s 1 was calculated using the following equation tang et al 2014 6 g a u u 2 6 2 u 0 67 1 where ρ is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure j kg 1 k 1 p r is the atmospheric pressure β is the midday bowen ratio and u is the friction velocity m s 1 the climatological conductance g i wilson et al 2002 is 7 g i γ r n g ρ c p v p d the ratio et et eq is known as the priestley taylor coefficient α and can represent the control of evaporation by atmospheric and physiological factors et eq is the equilibrium evaporation and is calculated using the following function 8 e t eq s s γ r n g the equilibrium rate is only dependent on the temperature and available energy rn g lower and higher values represent evaporation rates that are lower and higher than the equilibrium rate respectively wilson et al 2002 generally when α 1 the supply of soil water is sufficient such that et is controlled by the available energy rn g mcnaunhton and spriggs 1986 however the value is often below 1 in arid and semiarid ecosystems wilson and baldocchi 2000 tian et al 2016 indicating that et primarily depends on the supply of soil water the decoupling coefficient ω was calculated as follows jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 9 ω s γ s γ 1 r s r a in this case ω is a dimensionless factor that assumes values in the range of 0 1 depending on the size of the boundary layer and stomatal conductance when ω 0 the coupling is strong and the saturation deficit at the leaf surface is equal to that in the air outside the leaf boundary layer subsequently et is controlled by stomatal conductance through its response to vpd when ω 1 the conditions at the leaf surface are completely decoupled from the atmospheric boundary layer outside the leaf and the saturation deficit at the leaf surface tends toward a local equilibrium value which depends principally on the available energy receipt and the stomatal conductance evaporative fraction ef is a normalized value varying from 0 to1 suitable for temporal quantification of surface water deficit and balance roerink et al 2000 ef is the ratio of le to turbulent fluxes h le wang et al 2006 10 ef le le h to avoid numerical instability when the dominator approaches 0 we used the midday time values of some bulk parameters g s g a ω and ef from 10 00 16 00 h for calculations in this study 2 4 3 determination phenology from modis data due to the absence of long term field observations of vegetation development the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi modis mod13q1 with a temporal resolution of 16 days and spatial resolution of 250 m was applied to extract the phenology indices including the start of the growing season sos the end of the growing season eos and the length of the growing season gsl by using the dynamic threshold value method jansson and eklundh 2004 the seasonal variation in the curve is not obvious which affects land ecosystem monitoring the inversion of vegetation parameters and the accuracy of phonological information extraction therefore the fitting of time series ndvi data and the reconstruction of smooth time profiles are crucial tasks the asymmetric gaussian function fitting method was applied to smooth ndvi whose performance was proved superior to that of other fitting methods hird and mcdermid 2009 at our sites grass and crop growth extraction was based on the first order derivative of the fitting gaussian curve sos and eos were defined as the time point at 25 of the associated distance between the minimum and maximum values of the derivative for grassland and cropland respectively fig 3 illustrates the process of extracting vegetation phenological information from the ndvi the average sowing period jointing stage flowering period and maturing data of the maize in this region were 120 135 170 190 195 210 and 250 270 doy respectively 2 4 4 calculation of the drought stress index the soil drought stress index dsi was employed as an indicator of drought severity and is expressed as follows yue et al 2020 11 dsi 1 rwc dsi is a dimensionless factor that ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the water demand of an ecosystem a dsi value close to 0 indicates no water stress and a dsi close to 1 indicates an ecosystem experiencing water stress rwc is the relative extractable soil water content 0 40 cm depth and was calculated to evaluate the state of soil water in a given soil layer rwc is defined as follows 12 rwc swc swc min swc max swc min where swc is the soil water content at the time of measurement m3 m 3 and swc max and swc min are the maximum and minimum respectively of volumetric soil water content during the 6 year observation period 2 4 5 calculation of the summer monsoon duration periods the interannual response of aridity to variations in the easm northernmost marginal region is significant and the easm northernmost marginal index enmi is sensitive and stable over northeast china zhang et al 2016a enmi combines air mass precipitation and wind horizontal resolution reanalysis data era5 0 25 0 25 from the european center for medium range weather forecasts must fulfill the following three conditions to define the enmi zhang et al 2016a yue et al 2020 1 pentad mean wind at 850 hpa should be southwest u 0 m s 1 v 0 m s 1 2 pentad mean pseudo equivalent potential temperature at 850 hpa should be greater than 335 k and 3 pentad mean precipitation should be greater than 4 mm d 1 the cumulative number of days that pentad mean precipitation is greater than 4 mm d 1 is defined as the summer monsoon duration period smd tang et al 2008 yue et al 2019 the effective precipitation was defined as the daily precipitation amount that exceeded 0 5 mm in winter and 4 0 mm in other seasons wang et al 2013 to verify the reliability of the era5 data fig 4 shows the relationship between the annual summer precipitation and the summer average temperature from the era5 datasets plotted against the observations from the tongyu weather station from 1979 to 2008 the slope and correlation coefficient of the linear fitting line were 0 97 and 0 94 p 0 05 respectively for the era5 temperature versus the observations and 0 79 and 0 81 p 0 05 respectively for the summer precipitation versus the observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental conditions the two sites experienced similar weather conditions cool winters and warm wet summers fig 5 the monthly ta reached the maximum value in the grassland and cropland in july 2007 24 8 and 28 4 c respectively the lowest monthly mean ta was recorded in january 2005 15 9 c in the semiarid grassland and 11 2 c in the cropland the monthly average vpd for the six year study period was 0 57 kpa for the semiarid grassland and 0 61 kpa for the cropland with maize the lowest monthly mean vpd was recorded in january 2005 0 07 kpa in the semiarid grassland and 0 08 kpa in the cropland with maize the maximum monthly average swc varied from 0 17 to 0 26 m 3 m 3 in the semiarid grassland and from 0 16 to 0 29 m 3 m 3 in cropland with maize precipitation distribution was the single peak type with more than 65 of the annual pr received during the summer period june august annual pr had a large interannual variation with a standard deviation of 85 mm the mean annual pr was 296 mm for the six year period below the long term value from 1961 to 2002 391 9 mm by contrast the extremely dry years 2004 2007 and the dry year 2006 were approximately 44 and 24 lower than the long term annual mean pr respectively the years 2003 and 2005 were normal and the total pr was approximately 11 lower than the long term precipitation the wettest year was 2008 approximately 12 greater than the long term pr the highest monthly pr was recorded in july 2008 139 mm 3 2 energy partitioning we evaluated the surface energy closure at the sites by using eqs 1 and 2 based on 30 the min average fluxes table 3 the theoretical closure was represented by a slope of 1 and an intercept of 0 slopes of the linear regression at the study site ranged from 0 73 to 0 89 and from 0 73 to 0 80 for the grassland and cropland with maize respectively and the intercepts varied from 23 99 to 46 82 w m 2 and from 7 58 to 54 88 w m 2 for grassland and cropland with maize respectively however there is not a well defined pattern for the intercept found in other studies given that this value doesn t vary between 23 and 29 wm 2 wilson et al 2002 campos et al 2019 showing higher values than previous studies wilson et al 2002 wever et al 2002 scott 2010 the possible explanation for the strong positive intercept values and the large variation between 2003 and 2008 found in the present study is due to the high rn portion converted into g in tongyu sites during all seasons above 25 on the contrary campos et al 2019 reported that there was an obviously negative inception values lower than 17 wm 2 due to the low rn portion converted into g below 3 in a preserved area of a brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest still according to table 2 during 2003 2008 the intercept values varied from 23 99 to 46 82 w m 2 and from 7 58 to 54 88 w m 2 over the grassland and the cropland sites respectively the larger variations found in this study can be explained due to the seasonal drought which provide greater heterogeneity of vegetation cover contribute to the worse performance of ec souza et al 2012 campos et al 2019 besides vegetation characteristics atmospheric and soil water conditions also play a decisive role in the variations of h le and g values between the wet and dry seasons the linear regression values at our site was within the range reported for many flux sites 0 53 0 99 with an average of 0 97 including grassland and cropland wever et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 annual values of the ebr were calculated as σ h le σ r n g for half hourly data which ranged from 0 86 to 1 04 for grassland and from 0 78 to 1 03 for cropland with maize and was within the range 0 39 1 69 of those measured at many other flux sites wilson et al 2002 scott 2010 seasonal variations in the diurnal cycles of the energy balance components are shown in fig 6 partitioning of net radiation rn into the components of sensible h latent le and ground heat flux g showed similar patterns during the 6 year period at the grassland and cropland sites on the diurnal time scale no major differences were observed between the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize and the energy balance components gradually increased after sunrise and typically peaked at midday however a small lag of approximately 1 5 h was between maximum rn and maximum g at the cropland site during the growing seasons because the vegetation was denser and higher at the cropland site and extended heat flux transfer time from the canopy to the ground eichelmann et al 2016 in the daily average results of the 6 year period h and le played nearly equal roles in dispersing available energy in june this pattern shifted for july and august when et from the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize increased and le was approximately twice the magnitude of h in september h increased and le decreased slightly such that two became comparable in magnitude again during the non growing seasons h was always greater than le similar results were reported by eichelmann et al 2016 for switchgrass plants in southern ontario canada nevertheless yue et al 2019 and yang et al 2014 found that even during the main active growing season in summer the values of h and le were almost equal over the semiarid ecosystems in the loess plateau of china they concluded that latent heat exchange was limited to their field because the semiarid regions in the loess plateau always suffered from droughts our results of increased partitioning of energy toward le in july and august indicate that le was not drastically limited by reduction swc except for lower le values recorded during the dry years of 2004 and 2007 because pr in our study sites was mainly concentrated during the summer monsoon periods fig 5c a transition to increasing h and decreased le at the eos has been observed in grassland and cropland wever et al 2002 eichelmann et al 2016 yue et al 2019 and was probably caused by the onset of plant senescence and the associated decrease in canopy conductance in 2004 and 2007 the decrease in le was no more pronounced than in the other years and was probably aggravated by dry conditions in summer energy fluxes followed similar seasonal patterns in semiarid grassland and cropland with maize fig 7 rn increased in january march and reached its highest values in july august h was typically greater in cropland with maize than in semiarid grassland consistent with the higher available energy at the cropland site it reached peak values in april june when swc and ndvi values were lowest figs 5c and 8 le values increased from nearly zero in winter to 165 w m 2 in summer and accounted for 35 and 38 of rn in summer in the semiarid grassland and cropland respectively the 16 day midday bowen ratio generally reached values of approximately 4 in september may of the following year and decreased to approximately 1 0 in the summer monsoon months under dry conditions the bowen ratio exceeded 5 with the highest values of above 6 during the dry periods of january february 2003 and october 2007 february 2008 annual g did not show great changes and varied from 25 to 46 w m 2 and 22 30 w m 2 for grassland and cropland with maize respectively 3 3 evapotranspiration and midday ef in grassland and cropland et varied considerably throughout the six year study the variability was similar between the two sites fig 9a b and corresponded closely with that of pr and associated changes in swc and vegetation ndvi figs 5c and 8b daily et in january april and october december of year 6 was 0 26 0 08 mm and 0 26 0 10 mm day 1 average standard error respectively the highest values of daily et generally occurred during the summer seasons particularly in july which was the wettest month with the highest ndvi the peak et values were 4 6 and 5 4 mm day 1 at the grassland and cropland sites respectively and were observed following several consecutive rainfall events e g day 188 in 2008 in grassland and cropland daily et decreased to approximately 1 8 mm day 1 within 1 week as the soil dried out unless there was another rainfall event these measured values compare well with non growing seasons daily values for semiarid grassland in the loess plateau yue et al 2019 but are smaller than the daily values for switchgrass in oklahoma and pennsylvania 0 5 mm day 1 eichelmann et al 2016 skinner and adler 2010 in the literature the growth peak periods values are within the 2 5 6 0 mm day 1 range for semiarid grassland and cropland yue et al 2019 jia et al 2016 yang et al 2014 except for lower values observed during a severe drought in july of 2004 1 47 and 1 55 mm day 1 for grassland and cropland respectively and a severe drought from mid june to july of 2007 2 07 and 1 73 mm day 1 for grassland and cropland respectively the average total et was similar between the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize sites both sites reached the highest annual et of 373 3 mm in the grassland and 390 0 mm in the cropland in 2008 and the average et during the six years is in the middle range of et reported for grassland 163 513 mm and cropland 194 1 725 2 mm in semiarid regions wever et al 2002 aires et al 2008 zha et al 2010 krishnan et al 2012 yue et al 2019 bai et al 2020 marques et al 2020 the annual et varied by 23 4 298 1 in the grassland and by 22 6 306 6 in the cropland in 2003 2008 et varied considerably by year because of large variations in pr fig 9 the severe drought year of 2004 215 mm at the grassland and 227 mm at the cropland sites lies in the lower end range of et reported for grassland 163 513 mm and cropland 194 1 725 2 mm in semiarid regions from january to mid june et consistently exceeded pr resulting in negative pr et by the end of june in 2003 and 2005 this finding indicates that the northeastern part of the easm transition zone is generally under water stress in the extremely dry 2004 2007 and dry 2006 years et was greater than pr year round fig 9d which is attributed to scarce rainfall and dew studies have shown that dew events occur more frequently than precipitation events in early spring and late autumn which can significantly affect surface water budgets over semiarid regions krishnan et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 reported that dew provides a feasible water source for semiarid ecosystems during droughts and can significantly affect diurnal soil moisture during evenings with above average nightly dew yields 0 2 l m 2 day 1 et more often exceeded pr at our sites especially in the winter to pre monsoon periods characterized by high potential et and little water loss via runoff during the study period midday ef varied considerably throughout the summer monsoon seasons at the grassland and cropland sites fig 9a b and the variability was similar between the two sites plateau ef values were approximately 0 85 and 0 9 respectively and were usually observed after the largest rainfall events each year fig 9c at both sites ef decreased to less than 0 35 within 1 week as the soil dried out unless another rainfall event occurred before the onset of the easm rainfall in july 2007 days 171 173 low values of ef 0 20 were observed the similarity between the et time series of cropland and grassland was measure using linear regression fig 10a the plot of et at the cropland versus et in the grassland showed little scatter r2 0 82 p 0 01 similar to et the time series of ef from cropland and grassland was similar fig 10b the slope of the regression 0 90 primarily indicated that et was greater in cropland than in grassland the regression between midday ef at the two sites had less scatter r2 0 83 p 0 01 than the equivalent regression for daily et 3 4 seasonal variation in bulk parameters the seasonal patterns of gs monthly average midday are shown in fig 11a with the lowest gs values found during non growing seasons with mean values of 1 96 and 2 13 mm s 1 in the grassland and cropland respectively the monthly average gs generally rapidly increased from june and peaked in july or august as the wetness of the environment increased and the opposite was observed from august to october the gs parameter was higher during the stable periods of the growing seasons when ndvi reached its maximum value therefore increased rainfall and soil moisture contributed to higher gs values with a mean value of 7 26 and 8 43 mm s 1 in the grassland and cropland respectively in 2003 2008 in 2004 and 2007 gs values were 25 and 20 lower than the six year mean value in the grassland and 28 and 37 lower than the six year mean value in the cropland seasonal increases and decreases in gs are related to leaf growth and wilting krishnan et al 2012 jia e al 2016 the reduction in gs values was associated with the leaf senescence mechanism as a response to soil water limitation avoiding the excessive loss of water by plants and reducing et mcnaughton and spring 1986 wever et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 during the weak summer monsoon years of 2004 and 2007 the peak growing season gs values were 25 and 20 and 29 and 37 respectively lower than the six year mean value for the grassland and cropland respectively indicating that the plants were occasionally under water stress however gs peaked at the beginning of the summer monsoon with the expansion of leaf cover figs 8 and 11 and marques et al 2020 reported similar results in caatinga in the brazilian semiarid region the results indicate that the increase in gs might have been affected by the morphophysiological states at the leaf scale the monthly average et et eq and ω had generally similar variations to gs whereas the monthly variation of ga presented a bimodal distribution the highest values of ω and et et eq typically occurred during the growth peak periods with higher ndvi when the canopy was wet and vegetation activity peaked figs 11 and 8b the growth peak periods indicate that ω and et et eq were generally lower in grassland than in cropland for the semiarid easm transition zone et et eq is expected to have a smaller value than the et et eq of saturated surfaces mcnaughton and spring 1986 on an annual timescale the average et et eq were 0 45 and 0 47 for the semiarid grassland and cropland respectively even in the most vigorous growing seasons the average et et eq were 0 73 and 0 73 respectively the lower value of determined et et eq compared with the theoretical value of 1 26 also suggests that seasonal growth control of transpiration must have been prevalent brümmer et al 2012 yue et al 2019 however peak vegetation growth of the grassland and cropland ecosystems occurred simultaneously during the rainy season figs 10c and 11d 3 5 controls on seasonal and interannual variations in et the relationship between mid daily et et eq and gs in each six year period in the grassland and cropland is shown in fig 12 et et eq decreased non linearly with the increase in gs and approximately followed results from theoretical studies on gs in 10 5 and 11 4 mm s 1 for the grassland and cropland in this study the significantly positive relationship between et et eq and gs is consistent with that of studies on grassland and cropland krishnan et al 2012 yue et al 2019 suggesting that et is significantly influenced by gs obviously the nonlinear relationship roughly followed results from theoretical studies on surface et except that et et eq became insensitive to gs values greater than 10 5 and 11 4 mm s 1 respectively for the grassland and cropland this result is similar to the gs values of less than 13 mm s 1 estimated for an alpine steppe over the tibetan plateau ma et al 2015 and the maize agroecosystems in a desert oasis region of northwest china approximately 10 mm s 1 zhang et al 2016b however the threshold values at our sites are greater than those of mediterranean grassland approximately 6 mm s 1 in north america krishnan et al 2012 these results indicate that et is strongly influenced by gs when the values are lower than the threshold values the equilibrium et et eq 1 was reached when gs 10 7 and 9 5 mm s 1 over grassland and cropland respectively which occurred in all six years but with less frequency in 2004 and 2007 which were the driest years these results indicate that high equilibrium et et eq is strongly influenced by water vapor advection in the direction of southwest northeast during summer monsoon periods et and gs were significantly correlated r2 0 9 at both sites p 0 001 and these results are also consistent with those of yue et al 2019 and jia et al 2016 this similarity is probably because high et values can be explained by low vpd which indicates an increase in the stomatal opening as a response to the water vapor transfer gradient fig 13 shows that gs decreased exponentially with an increase in vpd in the dry period vpd 2 0 kpa resulted in close to zero gs values this effect was most noticeable for vpd 2 0 kpa for periods of water stress indicating stomatal control of transpiration however the effects of vpd on gs were clearer for the semiarid grassland than for the semiarid cropland ecosystem r2 0 73 and 0 61 respectively p 0 001 when the relative extractable soil water content is low mainly during the pre monsoon period or the latter part of the growing season et declined because of the reductions in gs associated with soil water stress and high values of vpd 2 kpa this result indicated that vpd did not influence gs caused by water scarcity and stomata were partially open to guarantee the minimum gas exchange necessary for physiological and metabolic activities marques et al 2020 yue et al 2020 pearson s correlation was used to investigate the environmental pr ta and dsi and et and biophysical ndvi gs and et et eq constraints of seasonal variations in monthly et for the 6 years during the growing seasons april october fig 14 semiarid grassland and cropland with maize in the easm transition zone showed significant exponential relationships with pr and ta but increased more rapidly over cropland than grassland and pr was greater than 50 mm monthly 1 dsi played a key role in affecting monthly et fig 14c in contrast with the literature yue et al 2020 a transitional characteristic was observed in the response of et to dsi et significantly increased with increasing dsi under wet conditions and decreased with increasing dsi under dry conditions in this study et always decreased with increasing dsi and decreased more rapidly with increasing dsi over the cropland than the grassland sites with determination coefficient values of 0 59 and 0 62 p 0 05 respectively furthermore as the important biophysical parameters comprehensively reflecting the environmental conditions the time series ndvi gs and et et eq data strongly affected seasonal patterns in the semiarid grassland and cropland et fig 14d f the exponential function was the best fitting method with r 2 values of 0 74 0 79 and 0 83 p 0 05 among et and ndvi gs and et et eq respectively similarly the optimal function was fitted for the cropland but the determination coefficients were higher than those for the grassland site despite a significant correlation between monthly et et eq and ndvi during the growing seasons at both sites the regression functions of grassland and cropland differed fig 15 the exponential function was the best fitting method with r2 values of 0 76 and 0 85 p 0 05 respectively in the easm transition zone these results are consistent with those based on ndvi over semiarid grassland in the loess plateau of china yue et al 2019 low values of et et et eq and gs and high vpd and lower values of ndvi indicate significantly drier conditions and higher stomatal limitations for et in the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize in 2004 and 2007 baldocchi et al 2004 reported that this relationship and value of et et eq is also a function of ndvi swc and foliage photosynthetic capacity and can vary with plant function type the soil water content in this study was lower than that reported for other grassland and cropland ecosystems with swc ranging from 15 to 20 krishnan et al 2012 yang et al 2014 suggesting high resilience of these systems to dsi to determine how ndvi growing season length gls and effective precipitation frequency number of daily precipitation 2 5 mm influenced the interannual variations in et linear regression relationships between gsl and ndvi ndvi and gs gs and et et eq and effective precipitation frequency and et were investigated fig 16 at both sites the increase in gsl ndvi and effective precipitation frequency was positively correlated with et but the significance was higher in cropland ecosystems than in grassland ecosystems how the easm influenced the interannual variation in et the relationship between smd and et during the summer monsoon period et smd smd and monsoon precipitation p smd et smd and et in summer et sum and et sum and annual et were investigated fig 17 in the easm transition zone the increase in p smd et smd et sum and annual et was positively correlated with smd indicating that the ecosystem et was controlled by the precipitation smd in contrast with ryu et al 2008 who found that the length of growing seasons is the main factor that determines the interannual variability of annual et for grassland in california this study shows that smd is the primary factor controlling interannual et in semiarid grassland and cropland with maize in the easm transition zone the summer rainfall in this study accounted for 70 of the annual pr and there was a high correlation between et sum and annual cumulative et specifically the variations in et smd were strongly correlated with the distribution of precipitation in the peak of the growing season with smd and p smd figs 9 and 14a b furthermore in this region et smd accounted for approximately 55 of the annual total et r2 0 95 p 0 05 and et sum accounted for approximately 62 of the annual et r2 0 95 p 0 05 therefore in the northeastern part of the easm transition zone smd indirectly affects annual et via its effect on annual pr in this study ndvi during the growing seasons was strongly influenced by smd r2 0 69 for grassland and r2 0 72 for cropland p 0 05 and rainfall distribution and swc during the experimental period which is crucial to leaf coverage seasonality in the easm transition zone the marked seasonality of rainfall and swc in semiarid grassland and cropland affects phenology stomatal conductance seasonality and photosynthesis miao et al 2009 du et al 2019 this phenomenon concurs with mendes et al 2017 who reported that the phenological response of semiarid ecosystems or its vegetation dynamics is related to rainfall seasonality which modulates physiological and metabolic characteristics this result suggests that semiarid ecosystems have a high capacity for environmental changes mainly due to stomatal closure in the easm transition zone 4 conclusions the six year ec measurements of water vapor flux over semiarid grassland and cropland with maize ecosystems in northeast china showed similar seasonal patterns of atmospheric forcing and energy partitioning the climate of the study sites had a large range of annual pr 194 4 397 1 mm in 2003 2008 annual et varied from 209 to 373 mm and from 221 to 390 mm for the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize respectively monthly et et eq et and gs during the growing seasons were higher in cropland with maize than in semiarid grassland on a monthly scale both sites had similar and significant exponential relationships among et and pr ta et et eq gs and ndvi whereas a strong linearity was between et and dsi associated with the decrease in summer rainfall by 39 in 2004 34 in 2007 et declined by 33 34 in 2007 and 28 30 in 2007 for grassland and cropland sites respectively the main factor controlling the interannual variation in summer et at both sites was smd whereas annual et was largely determined by efficient precipitation frequency we conclude that et in the easm transition zone was water limited whereas water was relatively abundant in summer these results are useful for adjusting the agricultural planting structure and are suitable for planting autumn harvested crops in this region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9595,accurate quantification of semiarid energy partitioning and actual evapotranspiration et c is necessary to understand the variability in regional energy and the water cycle which is expected to intensify under climate change the seasonal and interannual variability in surface energy and et and its responses to environmental and biophysical factors of grassland and cropland with maize zea mays and ecosystems over the east asian summer monsoon transition zone of china were investigated using multiyear 2003 2008 eddy covariance measurements the study sites received 65 84 of the annual precipitation pr during the east asian summer monsoon easm june august with the lowest values in the weak easm years of 2004 and 2007 seasonal and interannual variations in the portioning of net radiation to turbulent fluxes were mainly controlled by pr via changes in soil water content swc and vegetation growth drastic changes in the bowen ratio vegetation growth and energy fluxes occurred after the onset of easm during the cool winter and dry spring and autumn the sensible heat flux was the largest component of the energy balance and the latent heat flux dominated during warm and wet periods of summer monthly et was 24 8 and 25 6 mm for the grassland and cropland respectively and they peaked at 89 0 mm and 113 9 mm respectively in july monthly et was positively correlated with monthly pr ta the soil water drought stress index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the surface conductance gs and the priestley taylor coefficient et et eq during the growing seasons april september annual et varied from 215 to 373 mm in grassland and from 227 to 390 mm in cropland with the lowest value during the severe drought year of 2007 interannual variations in et were primarily controlled by annual effective precipitation frequency and interannual variations in summer et were modulated by the summer monsoon duration period through changes in summer pr swc and vegetation growth keywords semiarid region effective precipitation frequency drought stress index bulk parameters summer monsoon period 1 introduction semiarid biomes cover a large portion of earth s terrestrial surface and the exchange of energy and water vapor between the land surface and the atmosphere in these regions is a driver of earth s climate from local to global scales krishnan et al 2012 the partitioning of net radiation to turbulent fluxes and soil heat flux is mainly dominated by factors such as climate land cover characteristics hydrological processes boundary layer development plant functional type and phenology and canopy succession stages wilson et al 2002 kutal et al 2012 eichelmann et al 2016 additionally water cycling is a primary component of ecosystems that links many biogeochemical and energy cycles wilson and baldocchi 2000 however the implications of the large scale production of grassland and cropland on local water and energy cycles are not well known in the east asian summer monsoon easm transition zone yue et al 2019 an effect of climate change is an increase in the frequency of droughts and dry spells across large parts of north china including many vital regions for grassland and agricultural production du and liu 2013 therefore investigating water vapor and energy exchange processes in different ecosystems is necessary information on seasonal and interannual variability in evapotranspiration et has been of particular importance because of its close link to ecosystem productivity and land surface atmosphere interactions wilson and baldocchi 2000 et is the second largest component of the global water cycle over land masses after precipitation pascolini campbell et al 2021 especially for terrestrial ecosystems et is a crucial variable involved in understanding interactions between precipitation and the atmosphere thomey et al 2011 kutal et al 2012 et also has significant impacts on regional climate extremes findell et al 2017 ren et al 2021 information on seasonal and interannual variations in et is particularly important because of its close link to ecosystem productivity water dynamics and regional climate via land surface interactions wang et al 2016 et is controlled by a combination of atmospheric evaporative demand the energy available at the surface and the water supply because of the complex interactions among soil air and plants allen et al 1998 advances in micrometeorological instrumentation that quantify et in different ecosystems such as grassland krishnan et al 2012 eichelmann et al 2016 cropland suyker and verma 2008 kimm et al 2020 and deserts ma et al 2015 via in situ observations have significantly promoted the understanding of interactions among soil vegetation and atmosphere as well as the effect of et in response to environmental changes within different ecosystems in semiarid regions ma et al 2015 adnan et al 2017 yue et al 2020 nearly 30 of earth s continental surface is semiarid yue et al 2019 and the regulation of hydrological processes by biological environmental and climatic factors in this region has long been a critical research topic scott et al 2006 li et al 2021 large scale changes in vegetation in water limited systems are an essential component of global change baldocchi et al 2004 li et al 2021 in addition to natural disturbances anthropogenic disturbances such as grazing and excessive cropping influence land surface processes which can affect surface albedo and radiation fluxes leading to local temperature changes and eventually vegetation responses pielke 2001 ren et al 2021 crop cultivation and grazing represent the two major land use practices in northeast china because of the rapidly increasing human population liu et al 2012 therefore investigating et in grassland and cropland ecosystems to improve the understanding of its link with other ecosystem processes wever et al 2002 and the water balance of terrestrial ecosystems yunusa et al 2004 miao et al 2009 would contribute to the literature studies have demonstrated that semiarid regions are usually limited by water huang et al 2015 yue et al 2020 the et of semiarid regions differs from that of humid and arid regions on seasonal and interannual scales for example the annual et in semiarid regions uses a large amount of rainfall on the land surface seddon et al 2016 brutsaert et al 2020 but actual et could be higher than pr due to the water storage in the soil and ground water contribution from shallow water table and dew events can also obviously affect surface water budgets zhang et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 in contrast with et reported in humid regions information on seasonal and interannual variability in et and its behavior in semiarid regions remains unclear particularly in northeast china furthermore annual pr in this region has an uneven spatiotemporal distribution and is strongly related to the easm zhang et al 2016a 2016b the summer monsoon dominates the pr variation and the seasonal drought in the easm transition zone zhang et al 2020 due to the interannual variation and interdecadal oscillation of the intensity the duration period and the northern edge of the easm the annual pr especially rainfall amount during the summer monsoon period fluctuates significantly zhang et al 2016a 2016b li et al 2021 therefore understanding how et exchange in grassland and cropland responds to environmental and biophysical factors is important however the controlling factors are interactively coupled with biosphere atmosphere system making it difficult to interpret the et as a result of the controlling factors bulk parameters including prestley taylor coefficient and surface conductance can be used to estimate the effects of these controls on et long term observations can help researchers obtain the magnitude and the seasonal interannual variations of these parameters thus it is possible to distinguish the impact of natural changes and human activities on the water cycle and improve the estimation of the land surface processes contribution used in hydrometeorological and climate models wilson and baldocchi 2000 in this study our main focus is on energy partitioning and et in the semiarid grassland of northeast china and cropland with rain fed maize in the easm transition zone between 2003 and 2008 the main objectives of this study were to 1 examine the seasonal and interannual variations in energy and water vapor fluxes 2 determine the effects of seasonal changes in environmental and canopy level biophysical factors on et and 3 understand the factors controlling the interannual variation in et in the easm transition zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description measurements analyzed in this study were performed between 2003 and 2008 at two flux towers in tongyu county 44 25 n 122 52 e northeastern china which is in the summer monsoon transition zone of china and has a continental climate fig 1 the area included two land types a grassland ecosystem and a maize cropland ecosystem the grassland is dominated by a chloris virgata community and the cropland ecosystem is a single maize cropping system the average air temperature for january and july were 15 7 c and 24 c respectively with the mean annual temperature 1961 2002 is 5 6 c the annual precipitation observed from tongyu weather station was 391 9 mm of which approximately 74 occurred during summer monsoon periods june august table 1 during the study period the six year annual average precipitation at the observation site was 296 mm which was approximately 24 lower than the long term average precipitation the soil is mainly composed of salty alkaline meadow soil and light chernozem the average field water capacity and wilting coefficient are 20 16 and 7 12 respectively the soil bulk densities are 1 39 1 42 and 1 55 g cm 3 for the depth of 10 40 and 80 cm respectively with an average value of 1 45 g cm 3 and the soil organic matter is approximately 6 84 g kg 1 the experimental site where the eddy covariance system was installed is located in the red triangle two types of ecosystems were selected for intercomparison namely a grassland ecosystem and a maize cropland ecosystem they were separated by 5 km the maximum canopy heights were 0 1 and 1 8 m for the grassland and cropland ecosystems respectively the semiarid grassland was mainly covered by chloris virgata and the annual weed communities in order to compare with the grassland the cropland was rainfed without extra irrigation both ecosystems extended more than 4 km2 and the terrain was flat liu et al 2008 the most frequent wind direction range are 180 210 southwest during the growing seasons and 280 310 west northwest during non growing seasons fig a the flux source areas around two sites under different conditions and stratification conditions were determined using the flux source area model schmid 1994 for 2003 2008 fig 2 for the area responsible for 90 of the surface effect under vegetation conditions fig 2a and b the maximum source location xm i e the upwind distance of the surface element with maximal effect on a given sensor is approximately 48 m and 39 m for the grassland and cropland respectively the distances from the near end a and far end e of the area to the sensor are approximately 23 m and 170 m for the grassland and 12 m and 162 m for the cropland respectively the maximum lateral half width d of the source area is approximately 35 m for the grassland and 32 m for the cropland respectively fig 2c and d show that in the areas responsible for 90 of the surface effect xm a e and d are approximately 45 22 160 and 21 m for the grassland and 41 20 120 and 19 m for the cropland respectively when the stratification

measurements the turbulent fluxes at the two sites were measured continuously using the eddy covariance ec technique ec instruments at each site were mounted at heights of 2 m for the grassland and 3 5 m for the cropland to measure water vapor and turbulent fluxes respectively the ec instruments consisted of a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific usa and an open path co2 h2o analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln usa which were taken at 10 hz via a computer controlled data logging system half hourly turbulent fluxes were calculated using the covariance of fluctuations in

a cr 23x data logger table 2 sixteen day composite modis land surface reflectance mod09a1 data for single pixels mean value composite with 250 m spatial resolution containing the geo location coordinates of a flux tower were downloaded from the data portal of the earth observation and modeling facility of the university of oklahoma http eomf ou edu visualization 2 3 flux data processing the quality control of the raw observational data was similar to that yue et al 2015 before data calculation the data of sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le were treated with spike detection and removal and the wind coordinates were rotated using the double rotation method wilczak et al 2001 in addition sonic temperature fluctuation was considered to correct the sensible heat flux and the webb pearman leuning correction was used to adjust the density change resulting from fluctuations in latent heat webb et al 1980 we screened and eliminated the ec flux data for anomalous or spurious values caused by precipitation and system failure any value that exceeded four standard deviations in a window of 10 values was deleted approximately 23 and 26 of ec flux data for grassland and cropland with maize from 2003 to 2008 respectively were deleted data gaps shorter than 2 h were filled using linear interpolation and gaps longer than 2 h were filled using the mean diurnal variation method falge et al 2001 all data were converted to 30 min averaged data for analysis raw data within 30 min that did not fulfill the criteria were eliminated in the analysis and replaced via the gap filling strategy liu et al 2012 beijing time gmt 8 was used throughout the analyses before filling the data gaps the energy balance closure was estimated for each year via the linear regression of the sum of all half hourly turbulent fluxes h le against available energy rn g where rn is the net radiation h is sensible heat flux le is latent heat flux and g is soil heat flux g gz δ g where gz is the measured ground heat flux at 5 cm depth and δ g is the ground storage above soil heat plates yue et al 2011 ec measurement energy closure was checked using the energy balance ratio ebr and ordinary

its controlling factors we calculated several bulk parameters such as surface conductance g s m s 1 aerodynamic conductance g a m s 1 the priestley taylor coefficient et et eq and the decoupling coefficient ω which are indicative of ecosystem function were calculated g s representing the efficiency of exchange between the top vegetation surface and atmosphere was calculated using the actual

represent the control of evaporation by atmospheric and physiological factors et eq is the equilibrium evaporation and is calculated using the following function 8 e t eq s s γ r n g the equilibrium rate is only dependent on the temperature and available energy rn g lower and higher values represent evaporation rates that are lower and higher than the equilibrium rate respectively wilson et al 2002 generally when α 1 the supply of soil water is sufficient such that et is controlled by the available energy rn g mcnaunhton and spriggs 1986 however the value is often below 1 in arid and semiarid ecosystems wilson and baldocchi 2000 tian et al 2016 indicating that et primarily depends on the supply of soil water the decoupling coefficient ω was calculated as follows jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 9 ω s γ s γ 1 r s r a in this case ω is a dimensionless factor that assumes values in the range of 0 1 depending on the size of the boundary layer and stomatal conductance when ω 0 the coupling is strong and the saturation deficit at the leaf surface is equal to that in the air outside the leaf boundary layer subsequently et is controlled by stomatal conductance through its response to vpd when ω 1 the conditions at the leaf surface are completely decoupled from the atmospheric boundary layer outside the leaf and the saturation deficit at the leaf surface tends toward a local equilibrium value which depends principally on the available energy receipt and the stomatal conductance evaporative fraction ef is a normalized value varying from 0 to1 suitable for temporal quantification of surface water deficit and balance roerink et al 2000 ef is the ratio of le to turbulent fluxes h le wang et al 2006 10 ef le le h to avoid numerical instability when the dominator

of long term field observations of vegetation development the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi modis mod13q1 with a temporal resolution of 16 days and spatial resolution of 250 m was applied to extract the phenology indices including the start of the growing season sos the end of the growing season eos and the length of the growing season gsl by using the dynamic threshold value method jansson and eklundh 2004 the seasonal variation in the curve is not obvious which affects land ecosystem monitoring the inversion of vegetation parameters and the accuracy of phonological information extraction therefore the fitting of time series ndvi data and the reconstruction of smooth time profiles are crucial tasks the asymmetric gaussian function fitting method was applied to smooth ndvi whose performance was proved superior to that of other fitting methods hird and mcdermid 2009 at our sites grass and crop growth extraction was based on the first order derivative of the fitting gaussian curve sos and eos were defined as the time point at 25 of the associated distance between the minimum and maximum values of the derivative for grassland and cropland respectively fig 3 illustrates the process of extracting vegetation phenological information from the ndvi the average sowing period jointing stage flowering period and maturing data of the maize in this region were

as follows yue et al 2020 11 dsi 1 rwc dsi is a dimensionless factor that ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the water demand of an ecosystem a dsi value close to 0 indicates no water stress and a dsi close to 1 indicates an ecosystem experiencing water stress rwc is the relative extractable soil water content 0 40 cm depth and was calculated to evaluate the state of soil water in a given soil layer rwc is defined as follows 12 rwc swc swc min swc max swc min where swc is the soil water content at the time of measurement m3 m 3 and swc max and swc min are the maximum and minimum respectively of volumetric soil water content during the 6 year observation period 2 4 5 calculation of the summer monsoon duration periods the interannual response of aridity to variations in the easm northernmost marginal region is significant and the easm northernmost marginal index enmi is sensitive and stable over northeast china zhang et al 2016a enmi combines air mass precipitation and wind horizontal resolution reanalysis data era5 0 25 0 25 from the european center for medium range weather forecasts must fulfill the following three conditions to define the enmi zhang et al 2016a yue et al 2020 1 pentad mean wind at 850 hpa should be southwest u 0 m s 1 v 0 m s 1 2 pentad mean pseudo equivalent potential temperature at 850 hpa should be greater than 335 k and 3 pentad mean precipitation should be greater than 4 mm d 1 the cumulative number of days that pentad mean precipitation is greater than 4 mm d 1 is defined as the summer monsoon duration period smd tang et al 2008 yue et al 2019 the effective precipitation was defined as the daily precipitation amount that exceeded 0 5 mm in winter and 4 0 mm in other seasons wang et al 2013 to verify the reliability of the era5 data fig 4 shows the relationship between the annual summer precipitation and the summer average temperature from the era5 datasets plotted against the observations from the tongyu weather station from 1979 to 2008 the slope and correlation coefficient of the linear fitting line were 0 97 and 0 94 p 0 05 respectively for the era5 temperature versus the observations and 0 79 and 0 81 p 0 05 respectively for the summer precipitation versus the observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental conditions the two sites experienced similar weather conditions cool winters and warm wet summers fig 5 the monthly ta reached the maximum value in the grassland and cropland in july 2007 24 8 and 28 4 c respectively the lowest monthly mean ta was recorded in january 2005 15 9 c in the semiarid grassland and 11 2 c in the cropland the monthly average vpd for the six year study period was 0 57 kpa for the semiarid grassland and 0 61 kpa for the cropland with maize the lowest monthly mean vpd was recorded in january 2005 0 07 kpa in the semiarid grassland and 0 08 kpa in the cropland with maize the maximum monthly average swc varied from 0 17 to 0 26 m 3 m 3 in the semiarid grassland and from 0 16 to 0 29 m 3 m 3 in cropland with maize precipitation distribution was the single peak type with more than 65 of the annual pr received during the summer period june august annual pr had a large interannual variation with a standard deviation of 85 mm the mean annual pr was 296 mm for the six year period below the long term value from 1961 to 2002 391 9 mm by contrast the extremely dry years 2004 2007 and the dry year 2006 were approximately 44 and 24 lower than the long term annual mean pr respectively the years 2003 and 2005 were normal and the total pr was approximately 11 lower than the long term precipitation the wettest year was 2008 approximately 12 greater than the long term pr the highest monthly pr was recorded in july 2008 139 mm 3 2 energy partitioning we evaluated the surface energy closure at the sites by using eqs 1 and 2 based on 30 the min average fluxes table 3 the theoretical closure was represented by a slope of 1 and an intercept of 0 slopes of the linear regression at the study site ranged from 0 73 to 0 89 and from 0 73 to 0 80 for the grassland and cropland with maize respectively and the intercepts varied from 23 99 to 46 82 w m 2 and from 7 58 to 54 88 w m 2 for grassland and cropland with maize respectively however there is not a well defined pattern for the intercept found in other studies given that this value doesn t vary between 23 and 29 wm 2 wilson et al 2002 campos et al 2019 showing higher values than previous studies wilson et al 2002 wever et al 2002 scott 2010 the possible explanation for the strong positive intercept values and the large variation between 2003 and 2008 found in the present study is due to the high rn portion converted into g in tongyu sites during all seasons above 25 on the contrary campos et al 2019 reported that there was an obviously negative inception values lower than 17 wm 2 due to the low rn portion converted into g below 3 in a preserved area of a brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest still according to table 2 during 2003 2008 the intercept values varied from 23 99 to 46 82 w m 2 and from 7 58 to 54 88 w m 2 over the grassland and the cropland sites respectively the larger variations found in this study can be explained due to the seasonal drought which provide greater heterogeneity of vegetation cover contribute to the worse performance of ec souza et al 2012 campos et al 2019 besides vegetation characteristics atmospheric and soil water conditions also play a decisive role in the variations of h le and g values between the wet and dry seasons the linear regression values at our site was within the range reported for many flux sites 0 53 0 99 with an average of 0 97 including grassland and cropland wever et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 annual values of the ebr were calculated as σ h le σ r n g for half hourly data which ranged from 0 86 to 1 04 for grassland and from 0 78 to 1 03 for cropland with maize and was within the range 0 39 1 69 of those measured at many other flux sites wilson et al 2002 scott 2010 seasonal variations in the diurnal cycles of the energy balance components are shown in fig 6 partitioning of net radiation rn into the components of sensible h latent le and ground heat flux g showed similar patterns during the 6 year period at the grassland and cropland sites on the diurnal time scale no major differences were observed between the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize and the energy balance components gradually increased after sunrise and typically peaked at midday however a small lag of approximately 1 5 h was between maximum rn and maximum g at the cropland site during the growing seasons because the vegetation was denser and higher at the cropland site and extended heat flux transfer time from the canopy to the ground eichelmann et al 2016 in the daily average results of the 6 year period h and le played nearly equal roles in dispersing available energy in june this pattern shifted for july and august when et from the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize increased and le was approximately twice the magnitude of h in september h increased and le decreased slightly such that two became comparable in magnitude again during the non growing seasons h was always greater than le similar results were reported by eichelmann et al 2016 for switchgrass plants in southern ontario canada nevertheless yue et al 2019 and yang et al 2014 found that even during the main active growing season in summer the values of h and le were almost equal over the semiarid ecosystems in the loess plateau of china they concluded that latent heat exchange was limited to their field because the semiarid regions in the loess plateau always suffered from droughts our results of increased partitioning of energy toward le in july and august indicate that le was not drastically limited by reduction swc except for lower le values recorded during the dry years of 2004 and 2007 because pr in our study sites was mainly concentrated during the summer monsoon periods fig 5c a transition to increasing h and decreased le at the eos has been observed in grassland and cropland wever et al 2002 eichelmann et al 2016 yue et al 2019 and was probably caused by the onset of plant senescence and the associated decrease in canopy conductance in 2004 and 2007 the decrease in le was no more pronounced than in the other years and was probably aggravated by dry conditions in summer energy fluxes followed similar seasonal patterns in semiarid grassland and cropland with maize fig 7 rn increased in january march and reached its highest values in july august h was typically greater in cropland with maize than in semiarid grassland consistent with the higher available energy at the cropland site it reached peak values in april june when swc and ndvi values were lowest figs 5c and 8 le values increased from nearly zero in winter to 165 w m 2 in summer and accounted for 35 and 38 of rn in summer in the semiarid grassland and cropland respectively the 16 day midday bowen ratio generally reached values of approximately 4 in september may of the following year and decreased to approximately 1 0 in the summer monsoon months under dry conditions the bowen ratio exceeded 5 with the highest values of above 6 during the dry periods of january february 2003 and october 2007 february 2008 annual g did not show great changes and varied from 25 to 46 w m 2 and 22 30 w m 2 for grassland and cropland with maize respectively 3 3 evapotranspiration and midday ef in grassland and cropland et varied considerably throughout the six year study the variability was similar between the two sites fig 9a b and corresponded closely with that of pr and associated changes in swc and vegetation ndvi figs 5c and 8b daily et in january april and october december of year 6 was 0 26 0 08 mm and 0 26 0 10 mm day 1 average standard error respectively the highest values of daily et generally occurred during the summer seasons particularly in july which was the wettest month with the highest ndvi the peak et values were 4 6 and 5 4 mm day 1 at the grassland and cropland sites respectively and were observed following several consecutive rainfall events e g day 188 in 2008 in grassland and cropland daily et decreased to approximately 1 8 mm day 1 within 1 week as the soil dried out unless there was another rainfall event these measured values compare well with non growing seasons daily values for semiarid grassland in the loess plateau yue et al 2019 but are smaller than the daily values for switchgrass in oklahoma and pennsylvania 0 5 mm day 1 eichelmann et al 2016 skinner and adler 2010 in the literature the growth peak periods values are within the 2 5 6 0 mm day 1 range for semiarid grassland and cropland yue et al 2019 jia et al 2016 yang et al 2014 except for lower values observed during a severe drought in july of 2004 1 47 and 1 55 mm day 1 for grassland and cropland respectively and a severe drought from mid june to july of 2007 2 07 and 1 73 mm day 1 for grassland and cropland respectively the average total et was similar between the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize sites both sites reached the highest annual et of 373 3 mm in the grassland and 390 0 mm in the cropland in 2008 and the average et during the six years is in the middle range of et reported for grassland 163 513 mm and cropland 194 1 725 2 mm in semiarid regions wever et al 2002 aires et al 2008 zha et al 2010 krishnan et al 2012 yue et al 2019 bai et al 2020 marques et al 2020 the annual et varied by 23 4 298 1 in the grassland and by 22 6 306 6 in the cropland in 2003 2008 et varied considerably by year because of large variations in pr fig 9 the severe drought year of 2004 215 mm at the grassland and 227 mm at the cropland sites lies in the lower end range of et reported for grassland 163 513 mm and cropland 194 1 725 2 mm in semiarid regions from january to mid june et consistently exceeded pr resulting in negative pr et by the end of june in 2003 and 2005 this finding indicates that the northeastern part of the easm transition zone is generally under water stress in the extremely dry 2004 2007 and dry 2006 years et was greater than pr year round fig 9d which is attributed to scarce rainfall and dew studies have shown that dew events occur more frequently than precipitation events in early spring and late autumn which can significantly affect surface water budgets over semiarid regions krishnan et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 reported that dew provides a feasible water source for semiarid ecosystems during droughts and can significantly affect diurnal soil moisture during evenings with above average nightly dew yields 0 2 l m 2 day 1 et more often exceeded pr at our sites especially in the winter to pre monsoon periods characterized by high potential et and little water loss via runoff during the study period midday ef varied considerably throughout the summer monsoon seasons at the grassland and cropland sites fig 9a b and the variability was similar between the two sites plateau ef values were approximately 0 85 and 0 9 respectively and were usually observed after the largest rainfall events each year fig 9c at both sites ef decreased to less than 0 35 within 1 week as the soil dried out unless another rainfall event occurred before the onset of the easm rainfall in july 2007 days 171 173 low values of ef 0 20 were observed the similarity between the et time series of cropland and grassland was measure using linear regression fig 10a the plot of et at the cropland versus et in the grassland showed little scatter r2 0 82 p 0 01 similar to et the time series of ef from cropland and grassland was similar fig 10b the slope of the regression 0 90 primarily indicated that et was greater in cropland than in grassland the regression between midday ef at the two sites had less scatter r2 0 83 p 0 01 than the equivalent regression for daily et 3 4 seasonal variation in bulk parameters the seasonal patterns of gs monthly average midday are shown in fig 11a with the lowest gs values found during non growing seasons with mean values of 1 96 and 2 13 mm s 1 in the grassland and cropland respectively the monthly average gs generally rapidly increased from june and peaked in july or august as the wetness of the environment increased and the opposite was observed from august to october the gs parameter was higher during the stable periods of the growing seasons when ndvi reached its maximum value therefore increased rainfall and soil moisture contributed to higher gs values with a mean value of 7 26 and 8 43 mm s 1 in the grassland and cropland respectively in 2003 2008 in 2004 and 2007 gs values were 25 and 20 lower than the six year mean value in the grassland and 28 and 37 lower than the six year mean value in the cropland seasonal increases and decreases in gs are related to leaf growth and wilting krishnan et al 2012 jia e al 2016 the reduction in gs values was associated with the leaf senescence mechanism as a response to soil water limitation avoiding the excessive loss of water by plants and reducing et mcnaughton and spring 1986 wever et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 during the weak summer monsoon years of 2004 and 2007 the peak growing season gs values were 25 and 20 and 29 and 37 respectively lower than the six year mean value for the grassland and cropland respectively indicating that the plants were occasionally under water stress however gs peaked at the beginning of the summer monsoon with the expansion of leaf cover figs 8 and 11 and marques et al 2020 reported similar results in caatinga in the brazilian semiarid region the results indicate that the increase in gs might have been affected by the morphophysiological states at the leaf scale the monthly average et et eq and ω had generally similar variations to gs whereas the monthly variation of ga presented a bimodal distribution the highest values of ω and et et eq typically occurred during the growth peak periods with higher ndvi when the canopy was wet and vegetation activity peaked figs 11 and 8b the growth peak periods indicate that ω and et et eq were generally lower in grassland than in cropland for the semiarid easm transition zone et et eq is expected to have a smaller value than the et et eq of saturated surfaces mcnaughton and spring 1986 on an annual timescale the average et et eq were 0 45 and 0 47 for the semiarid grassland and cropland respectively even in the most vigorous growing seasons the average et et eq were 0 73 and 0 73 respectively the lower value of determined et et eq compared with the theoretical value of 1 26 also suggests that seasonal growth control of transpiration must have been prevalent brümmer et al 2012 yue et al 2019 however peak vegetation growth of the grassland and cropland ecosystems occurred simultaneously during the rainy season figs 10c and 11d 3 5 controls on seasonal and interannual variations in et the relationship between mid daily et et eq and gs in each six year period in the grassland and cropland is shown in fig 12 et et eq decreased non linearly with the increase in gs and approximately followed results from theoretical studies on gs in 10 5 and 11 4 mm s 1 for the grassland and cropland in this study the significantly positive relationship between et et eq and gs is consistent with that of studies on grassland and cropland krishnan et al 2012 yue et al 2019 suggesting that et is significantly influenced by gs obviously the nonlinear relationship roughly followed results from theoretical studies on surface et except that et et eq became insensitive to gs values greater than 10 5 and 11 4 mm s 1 respectively for the grassland and cropland this result is similar to the gs values of less than 13 mm s 1 estimated for an alpine steppe over the tibetan plateau ma et al 2015 and the maize agroecosystems in a desert oasis region of northwest china approximately 10 mm s 1 zhang et al 2016b however the threshold values at our sites are greater than those of mediterranean grassland approximately 6 mm s 1 in north america krishnan et al 2012 these results indicate that et is strongly influenced by gs when the values are lower than the threshold values the equilibrium et et eq 1 was reached when gs 10 7 and 9 5 mm s 1 over grassland and cropland respectively which occurred in all six years but with less frequency in 2004 and 2007 which were the driest years these results indicate that high equilibrium et et eq is strongly influenced by water vapor advection in the direction of southwest northeast during summer monsoon periods et and gs were significantly correlated r2 0 9 at both sites p 0 001 and these results are also consistent with those of yue et al 2019 and jia et al 2016 this similarity is probably because high et values can be explained by low vpd which indicates an increase in the stomatal opening as a response to the water vapor transfer gradient fig 13 shows that gs decreased exponentially with an increase in vpd in the dry period vpd 2 0 kpa resulted in close to zero gs values this effect was most noticeable for vpd 2 0 kpa for periods of water stress indicating stomatal control of transpiration however the effects of vpd on gs were clearer for the semiarid grassland than for the semiarid cropland ecosystem r2 0 73 and 0 61 respectively p 0 001 when the relative extractable soil water content is low mainly during the pre monsoon period or the latter part of the growing season et declined because of the reductions in gs associated with soil water stress and high values of vpd 2 kpa this result indicated that vpd did not influence gs caused by water scarcity and stomata were partially open to guarantee the minimum gas exchange necessary for physiological and metabolic activities marques et al 2020 yue et al 2020 pearson s correlation was used to investigate the environmental pr ta and dsi and et and biophysical ndvi gs and et et eq constraints of seasonal variations in monthly et for the 6 years during the growing seasons april october fig 14 semiarid grassland and cropland with maize in the easm transition zone showed significant exponential relationships with pr and ta but increased more rapidly over cropland than grassland and pr was greater than 50 mm monthly 1 dsi played a key role in affecting monthly et fig 14c in contrast with the literature yue et al 2020 a transitional characteristic was observed in the response of et to dsi et significantly increased with increasing dsi under wet conditions and decreased with increasing dsi under dry conditions in this study et always decreased with increasing dsi and decreased more rapidly with increasing dsi over the cropland than the grassland sites with determination coefficient values of 0 59 and 0 62 p 0 05 respectively furthermore as the important biophysical parameters comprehensively reflecting the environmental conditions the time series ndvi gs and et et eq data strongly affected seasonal patterns in the semiarid grassland and cropland et fig 14d f the exponential function was the best fitting method with r 2 values of 0 74 0 79 and 0 83 p 0 05 among et and ndvi gs and et et eq respectively similarly the optimal function was fitted for the cropland but the determination coefficients were higher than those for the grassland site despite a significant correlation between monthly et et eq and ndvi during the growing seasons at both sites the regression functions of grassland and cropland differed fig 15 the exponential function was the best fitting method with r2 values of 0 76 and 0 85 p 0 05 respectively in the easm transition zone these results are consistent with those based on ndvi over semiarid grassland in the loess plateau of china yue et al 2019 low values of et et et eq and gs and high vpd and lower values of ndvi indicate significantly drier conditions and higher stomatal limitations for et in the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize in 2004 and 2007 baldocchi et al 2004 reported that this relationship and value of et et eq is also a function of ndvi swc and foliage photosynthetic capacity and can vary with plant function type the soil water content in this study was lower than that reported for other grassland and cropland ecosystems with swc ranging from 15 to 20 krishnan et al 2012 yang et al 2014 suggesting high resilience of these systems to dsi to determine how ndvi growing season length gls and effective precipitation frequency number of daily precipitation 2 5 mm influenced the interannual variations in et linear regression relationships between gsl and ndvi ndvi and gs gs and et et eq and effective precipitation frequency and et were investigated fig 16 at both sites the increase in gsl ndvi and effective precipitation frequency was positively correlated with et but the significance was higher in cropland ecosystems than in grassland ecosystems how the easm influenced the interannual variation in et the relationship between smd and et during the summer monsoon period et smd smd and monsoon precipitation p smd et smd and et in summer et sum and et sum and annual et were investigated fig 17 in the easm transition zone the increase in p smd et smd et sum and annual et was positively correlated with smd indicating that the ecosystem et was controlled by the precipitation smd in contrast with ryu et al 2008 who found that the length of growing seasons is the main factor that determines the interannual variability of annual et for grassland in california this study shows that smd is the primary factor controlling interannual et in semiarid grassland and cropland with maize in the easm transition zone the summer rainfall in this study accounted for 70 of the annual pr and there was a high correlation between et sum and annual cumulative et specifically the variations in et smd were strongly correlated with the distribution of precipitation in the peak of the growing season with smd and p smd figs 9 and 14a b furthermore in this region et smd accounted for approximately 55 of the annual total et r2 0 95 p 0 05 and et sum accounted for approximately 62 of the annual et r2 0 95 p 0 05 therefore in the northeastern part of the easm transition zone smd indirectly affects annual et via its effect on annual pr in this study ndvi during the growing seasons was strongly influenced by smd r2 0 69 for grassland and r2 0 72 for cropland p 0 05 and rainfall distribution and swc during the experimental period which is crucial to leaf coverage seasonality in the easm transition zone the marked seasonality of rainfall and swc in semiarid grassland and cropland affects phenology stomatal conductance seasonality and photosynthesis miao et al 2009 du et al 2019 this phenomenon concurs with mendes et al 2017 who reported that the phenological response of semiarid ecosystems or its vegetation dynamics is related to rainfall seasonality which modulates physiological and metabolic characteristics this result suggests that semiarid ecosystems have a high capacity for environmental changes mainly due to stomatal closure in the easm transition zone 4 conclusions the six year ec measurements of water vapor flux over semiarid grassland and cropland with maize ecosystems in northeast china showed similar seasonal patterns of atmospheric forcing and energy partitioning the climate of the study sites had a large range of annual pr 194 4 397 1 mm in 2003 2008 annual et varied from 209 to 373 mm and from 221 to 390 mm for the semiarid grassland and cropland with maize respectively monthly et et eq et and gs during the growing seasons were higher in cropland with maize than in semiarid grassland on a monthly scale both sites had similar and significant exponential relationships among et and pr ta et et eq gs and ndvi whereas a strong linearity was between et and dsi associated with the decrease in summer rainfall by 39 in 2004 34 in 2007 et declined by 33 34 in 2007 and 28 30 in 2007 for grassland and cropland sites respectively the main factor controlling the interannual variation in summer et at both sites was smd whereas annual et was largely determined by efficient precipitation frequency we conclude that et in the easm transition zone was water limited whereas water was relatively abundant in summer these results are useful for adjusting the

9596,inefficient use of irrigation in new zealand pastoral farms is widespread and the uptake of irrigation scheduling tools to improve efficiency is poor recent studies suggest that end user inclusive participatory approaches to developing tools and practices could improve the uptake contributing to improved economic and environmental outcomes using a co learning based participatory approach we researchers worked with a group of pastoral farmers water resources regulators and industry professionals to develop an operational irrigation scheduling support tool that would facilitate improved water use the key engagement principles used were taking time to understand the problem from multiple stakeholder perspectives applying equal value to all sources of knowledge providing an atmosphere that fosters learning among stakeholders co learning staying aware of the wider problem context and remaining flexible and adaptable the co learning approach revealed over lapping yet distinct perceptions of improved water use for farmers it meant pasture growth unimpeded by available soil water for regulators reduced irrigation drainage and consequent leaching of nutrients from rootzone and for researchers justified use of water based current crop demand and forecast rainfall supply the co learning guided operational tool combined near real time soil water monitoring demand and short term two to six days rainfall forecast supply to support on farm irrigation scheduling decisions the tool included biophysical data type and synthesis structural data format presentation and visualisation and technological instrumentation and data collection protocols features that incorporated the diverse perspectives to water use uptake of the tool by the pilot study farmers was high and their irrigation practices evolved because of the information it provided inclusion of multiple stakeholder perspectives throughout the tool development process revealed unexpected insights and resulted in improved outcomes for all stakeholders graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation participatory process drainage co learning scheduling 1 introduction poor to modest adoption of tools and practices by new zealand nz pastoral farmers to manage on farm natural resources such as water has commonly resulted in inefficient resource use and unrealised economic potential turner et al 2013 ministry for primary industries mpi 2011 van housen 2015 based on an investigation of water use in three pastoral farms in canterbury nz for an irrigation season 2014 15 van housen 2015 reported that 47 64 of irrigations were unnecessary and could have been avoided had appropriate irrigation scheduling practices been in place the nz ministry for primary industries mpi 2012 had estimated that if the bottom three quarters of least efficient pastoral farmers adopted the management practices currently used by the most efficient the country could have achieved an additional nz 3 billion revenue annually from increased exports without a need for new technology however hornbuckle et al 2009 lea cox 2012 and others indicated that the technological complexity of irrigation scheduling tools often inhibit their adoption by farmers more often end users perceive such technologies as a burdensome layer of management and thus ignore lea cox 2012 several studies in nz and elsewhere have associated the lack of user engagement in the process of developing tools and practices to their poor uptake e g nguyen et al 2007 bruges and smith 2009 reid and brazendale 2014 payne et al 2018 small et al 2021

realistic immediate take home outcomes that were affordable time money acceptable social license available timeliness practical use of existing infrastructure and convenient ease of implementation achieved the desired impact to develop such options mpi 2012 concluded that there needs to be increased direct interaction between technology developers and users with approaches such as transfer of technology there is an absence of direct interaction between developers and receptors rogers 2002 and others a lack of interaction could otherwise lead to mismatch in the understanding of the problem among stakeholders and end users hereafter in this paper the term stakeholder includes both stakeholders and end users resulting in tools and practices that are either irrelevant ill informed or both thus becoming a burden to the users nguyen et al 2007 lea cox 2012 developing tools and practices that are relevant usable and translate science into practice requires engagement methods that

srinivasan et al 2017 and verejissen et al 2017 studied the evolution and refinement of the case study objectives when the researchers opted for a participatory co learning approach instead of a transfer of technology model once a participatory approach was adopted srinivasan et al 2019 examined the case study activities and delineated the phases of the case study development from initiation to implementation fielke and srinivasan 2017 and srinivasan and elley 2018 examined the case study to understand the evolution of non tangible outcomes such as community resilience and trust among stakeholders respectively as instigated by the participatory process in this paper we address the eventual objective of the case study improved water use through improved information use here the improved water use is examined within the context of adoption of improved irrigation scheduling practices we examine the development of a tangible output an irrigation management tool that emerged from the co learning process we track the participatory process as it was informed and influenced by the stakeholders and the eventual shape and structure of the output the paper is targeted at researchers and resource managers who are considering employing a participatory approach in translating their science findings into usable tools and practices for end users 2 case study description the case study was initiated as a pilot project in 2013 14 under the endeavour fund managed by the nz ministry for business innovation and employment mbie to enhance the uptake of improved irrigation practices by pastoral farmers and to improve on farm water use the case study researchers sought to combine real time soil water monitoring with short term weather rainfall forecasting to inform irrigation scheduling soil water monitoring has long been used as a proxy for irrigation demand the question being is the soil dry enough to trigger an irrigation today the case study researchers explored the use of rainfall forecasts as a proxy for the next two to six days of irrigation supply the question was phrased as could the forecast rainfall be used to either delay a scheduled irrigation event or adjust the amount of irrigation applied today at the start of the case study the researchers described the improvement in water use by counting the number of irrigation events that were delayed altered or completely skipped based on current demand and forecast supply a total of 10 irrigated pastoral farms in the canterbury region nz was chosen for the case study the canterbury region is the home of approximately two thirds of irrigated lands in nz statsnz 2017 and irrigation allocation in this region accounts for approximately 80 of nationally consented irrigation water use booker and henderson 2019 each case study farm was instrumented with a rain gauge and soil moisture sensor under one irrigator the rain gauge measured both rainfall and irrigation and the soil moisture sensor measured soil water and soil temperature at 200 mm depth below soil surface at one location this depth of soil water measurement and the number of monitoring sites per irrigator are typical of pastoral farms in the region a schematic of the instrumentation is shown in fig 1a data were collected every 10 min and telemetered every hour the forecast data included two and six day weather predictions the two day weather forecast was updated every six hours and the six day forecast updated every day the weather forecasts included rainfall relative humidity air temperature and wind speed and direction the data format frequency synthesis display and sharing protocols and instrumentation evolved during the case study principally informed by the co learning process these are discussed in subsequent sections 3 case study participatory approach participatory approaches are commonly neither prescriptive nor pre defined bruges and smith 2009 instead of adhering to a singular regimented tech transfer pathway these approaches are focused on enabling active participation of stakeholders right from the early stages of the research kloppenburg 1991 massey et al 2006 jakku and thorburn 2010 botha et al 2017 described that participatory approach as organically evolving in response to stakeholder engagement in the case study described here a co learning based participatory approach that focused on fostering learning among stakeholders was employed the participatory process employed operating principles described in nederlof et al 2011 and coutts et al 2017 as a guide to engagement the key principles used were taking time to view and understand the problem from multiple stakeholder perspectives applying equal value to all sources of knowledge providing an atmosphere that fosters learning among stakeholders co learning by actively listening and understanding staying aware of wider problem context to balance between short term outcomes and long term vision and remaining flexible and adaptable as the co learning process requires the co learning process employed in the case study did not seek to confirm validate or establish a perspective preference knowledge source or value held by any one group e g researchers or farmers instead it sought ways to contextualise water use practices by encompassing stakeholder perspectives and evolving a relevant legitimate and adaptable set of practices and tools in the case study co learning between case study researchers and pilot farmers occurred through several one on one and group interactions at various stages these interactions engagement phases and evidence collected during each phase are described in detail in srinivasan et al 2019 initially 2014 15 the researchers sought farmers interest and consent in participating in the case study interactions then moved to setting up instruments on farms and training the farmers to access data and finally transitioning into end of the season workshops that included all case study stakeholders co learning between other stakeholders regulators government representatives industry professionals irrigation scheme managers and other non participant farmers in the study region researchers and pilot farmers occurred routinely at the end of the season workshops referred to as workshop s hereafter where the group discussed the irrigation practices and outcomes from the previous irrigation season and periodically during day to day operational interactions additionally the researchers used the workshop as an opportunity to gather feedback on the data provided to the pilot farmers more on this in subsequent sections and their ease of use in supporting irrigation decisions the workshop also focused on dissecting specific irrigation events to learn from them understanding the accuracy of weather forecasts provided incorporating weather forecast uncertainty into decision making discussing the usefulness and timeliness of data provided assessing the need for additional data collection and sharing to support irrigation decisions and considering other farm specific challenges to managing irrigation such as availability of water supply irrigation infrastructure limitations staff capacities and capabilities and others at the workshop the group discussed changes on farm operational as well as data collection syntheses and presentation procedures that could be implemented in the subsequent irrigation season to support more efficient irrigation practices for example for farmers this could be a change in irrigation frequency or amount for researchers this adaption could be considering options for additional data collection processing and sharing the majority of co learning happened at these workshops as all key stakeholders were present enriching the discussions by sharing their perspectives and understanding others co learning emerged from the participatory process and the evolution of the irrigation scheduling tool was captured in three distinct sequential phases each phase represented approximately two irrigation seasons this much time was needed for the operation of the instrumentation to stabilise in this case it is the time for the soil moisture sensors to settle in the soil and provide reliable data and for the stakeholders to become familiar with the newly available information and provide meaningful feedback phase one alignment with existing practices describes the early stages of the engagement process with stakeholders the co learning from this phase led to phase two deviation from existing practices where the understanding of irrigation water use broadened and the need for non conventional data collection protocols emerged phase three making the invisible visible represents the emergence of a matured product an irrigation scheduling tool that culminated from co learning process the tool though existed in one form or other across all three phases evolved and matured guided by the co learning process 4 phase 1 alignment with existing practices at the time of the case study initiation 2014 15 those pastoral farmers that monitored soil water to schedule irrigation monitored at a depth of 200 mm below surface for pasture generally a rootzone of 400 500 mm is assumed porteous et al 1994 and the 200 mm depth is assumed to represent the midpoint in accordance with the existing convention at the start of the case study soil moisture sensors were installed at 200 mm depth see fig 1a also unless there are distinct spatial differences in soil drainage properties or crop types farmers generally monitored soil water at one location under each irrigator and scheduled irrigations accordingly generally farmers are advised by irrigation consultants to schedule irrigation when soil water is at or close to stress point and not to irrigate when soil water is at near or above full point stress point is crop specific and is an empirical representation of a condition below which a crop would exhibit water stress and thus a decline in growth for pasture stress point is typically 50 of plant available water paw a soil physical property that can be readily obtained from published soil databases such as s map lilburne et al 2012 full point is soil specific it represents a condition when paw is at 100 and the available soil storage is zero any addition of water to a soil at or above full point results in drainage or overland flow brown 2007 kc et al 2018 and others had examined irrigation scheduling practices in canterbury pastoral farms and reported that farmers seldom wait until stress point to trigger an irrigation to avoid the risk of production loss from water stress during phase one of the case study the current irrigation demand soil water observations and forecast irrigation supply rainfall data were collated into a report and shared with the pilot farmers every day via email the daily report included last seven days of observed rainfall irrigation soil water and soil temperature both soil water and soil temperature were derived from the same soil moisture sensor buried at 200 mm depth last seven days of estimated evapotranspiration based on weather observations from the nearest weather station next two days of three hourly rainfall air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and direction and next six days of daily rainfall air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and direction a sample of the daily report is shown in fig 2 even though the two day forecast was updated every six hours emails were sent out only once a day the pilot farmers received only one forecast per day the last updated forecast to increase the co learning opportunities irrigation and soil water data from all case study farms were collated in the daily report and shared with all recipients this was to allow the pilot farmers see others irrigation practices and soil water conditions with the aim of instigating moments of reflection and learning which are discussed in detail in srinivasan and elley 2018 during this phase and over the entire case study the researchers neither advised the pilot farmers on making irrigation decisions nor interfered with the ones they made this was done deliberately as the wider goal of the case study was to co produce a tool that was easy to understand and use without the need for any expert input and guidance thus the researchers confined their role to collecting and presenting the data also the researchers did not have specific knowledge of on farm conditions such as a broken irrigator non availability of irrigation supply staff availability or stock movement so were not ideally placed to provide farm specific irrigation advice however at the workshops the stakeholders talked about reasons behind specific irrigation decisions and practices during the previous season and the learnings that occurred from observing peers see srinivasan and elley 2018 5 co learning from existing practices phase one 5 1 description of water use after the first two complete irrigation seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 as the stakeholders had become familiar with the aim of the case study and the co learning approach employed the operational definition of water use as a metric of improved irrigation practice began to evolve this is captured in table 1 along with a description of drivers perspectives and aims of specific stakeholder group as the researchers regularly interact with state of the art technologies such as high resolution weather forecasting models and soil moisture sensors and diverse climate soils and hydrology datasets they described improved water use as a way of scheduling irrigation using real time soil water monitoring in the rootzone and short term rainfall forecast in other words by combining data from multiple sources specific on farm observations and localised high resolution weather model forecasts and time scales current and future the researchers sought to extend the conventional irrigation scheduling question from is irrigation needed today based on current demand to is irrigation justified today based on current demand and forecast supply relevant local government representatives regional council regulators were also invited to the workshops they are the custodians and administrators of water resources in the region responsible for both quantity and quality water allocation and water use monitoring and are focused on responsible resource use regulators are increasingly concerned that drainage from irrigation and rainfall leach nutrients below the rootzone into groundwater thus it is important to control drainage to contain the possibility of leaching robson et al 2015 although rainfall drainage may not be able to be controlled regulators focused on minimising irrigation drainage this phase of the case study coincided with the emergence of the regional council s matrix of good management mgm initiative mgm represented the compilation of recommended irrigation practices to reduce nutrient leaching robson et al 2015 mgm 2015 thus the regulators defined improved water use as irrigation scheduling that minimises drainage they framed their question as would an irrigation today result in drainage and leaching as opposed to the conventional question is irrigation needed today based on current demand for farmers irrigation is one of the key inputs to agricultural production they were therefore focused on a scheduling approach that supported the productivity objective often farmers erred on the side of scheduling an irrigation event rather than skipping one as they perceive that the production repercussions were less damaging from irrigating than by skipping brown 2007 kc et al 2018 thus farmers definition of improved water use revolved around maintaining soil water conditions that did not impede production instead of asking is irrigation needed today based on demand they asked would not irrigating today compromise the production 5 2 evidence for good irrigation scheduling the existing soil moisture sensor configuration deployment at 200 mm depth helped farmers to trigger irrigation events before the soil dropped to stress point but did not provide evidence to the regulator on irrigation drainage at one of the workshops during phase one the researchers using a simple water balance model presented an estimate of seasonal drainage that would have occurred in the case study farms based on actual irrigation and rainfall data this estimation was done by summarising daily rainfall irrigation and evaporation data for each soil paw assuming any water in excess of paw would have been lost from the rootzone through drainage even though the modelled estimates were useful in evaluating how well the farms performed with drainage the timing after the irrigation season and time resolution seasonal as opposed to individual irrigation event scale of these drainage estimates did not help the farmers to learn about individual drainage events and alter their irrigation practices operationally nor could the seasonal drainage estimates categorically identified which irrigation events had resulted in drainage and what practices could have minimised those drainage events the need for timely evidence of drainage for operational irrigation scheduling was a co learning moment for researchers as it highlighted the absence of a dataset real time drainage sought by stakeholders 5 3 data presentation during phase one of the case study the meaningfulness of data collected and their syntheses and presentation became a frequent discussion point among the stakeholders a summary of these discussion points is captured below the soil moisture sensor at 200 mm depth did not provide conclusive evidence on drainage to the regulator and actionable intelligence for the pilot farmers to evaluate individual irrigation events each daily email update only contained the last seven days of data which meant that the pilot farmers had to go through their previous daily email updates to get a historical view of the season the presentation format of the weather forecast was perceived complex expert user focused see fig 2b which meant that the pilot farmers had to spend time in reading and understanding the data to make a decision and the presentation of historical last seven days soil water and forecast weather data specifically rainfall separately within the same update and in different formats compare fig 2a and b meant that the pilot farmers had to work to bridge the two data streams and surmise the likely impact of forecast rainfall on soil water conditions to make an irrigation scheduling decision 6 phase 2 deviation from existing practices srinivasan and elley 2018 recorded that the focus of case study towards the end of phase 1 shifted from when to start the irrigation to maintain productivity farmer focused to when to start the irrigation to maintain productivity and stop the irrigation to prevent drainage farmer and regulator focused this meant that the farmers needed near real time evidence of drainage or absence of it following each irrigation event with the existing soil moisture sensor at 200 mm depth it was possible to say when the full point was exceeded in the mid section of the rootzone but it was not possible to categorically conclude that the excess water drained below the rootzone 400 500 mm the possibility of the excess water being redistributed within the rootzone between 200 and 500 mm depth could not be discounted to gather evidence about drainage during 2017 18 irrigation season the researchers introduced a multi level soil moisture sensor profile sensor the profile sensor buried vertically measured soil water and soil temperature at every 100 mm interval at eight successive depths see fig 1b for the profile sensor set up the top 4 5 levels 0 400 500 mm of the profile sensor measured soil water conditions within the rootzone irrigation trigger zone and the bottom 3 4 levels 400 500 800 mm measured soil water conditions immediately below the rootzone drainage signal zone once the profile sensor was installed the case study farmers were presented with data from all eight depths these new data showed the transit of water within and between irrigation and drainage zones see an example in fig 3 the case study farmers were trained to manage their irrigation scheduling based on soil water conditions within the irrigation zone and assess the movement of water below the rootzone by following the changes increases in soil water in the drainage zone immediately following irrigation events the profile sensor did not quantify the amount of water drained below the rootzone but signalled the occurrence and timing of drainage this was enough for the farmers and regulators to understand the impact of individual irrigation event in near real time 6 1 enabling learning from accessing historical practices co learning from phase one helped to advance phase two in several aspects this included the adoption of a new multi depth soil water and soil temperature data collection scheme to address the evolving needs of farmers and regulators a data sharing platform website to allow 24 7 data access and access to historical data at ease during irrigation seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 following the installation of profile sensors to enable farmers view historical data the demand and forecast data were presented through a generic telemetry website built and operated by the host research agency niwa the daily email update was discontinued and all data sharing occurred via this website the option of allowing each pilot farmer to view others data was retained the website was not exclusively developed for the case study it collates and displays a wide range of environmental data collected by the host research agency farmers were trained in using the website to access the data on farm measurements were made available in near real time less than 60 min delay no changes were made to the forecast data presentation from phase one the demand and forecast data streams were still maintained separately as they arrive from two different sources demand data from on farm monitoring and forecast data from numerical weather models run every six hours by the host research agency niwa however as the website was active 24 7 the two day forecast was updated every six hours as new forecasts became available because of the number of soil water time series data to be displayed eight one from each depth the line plot visual became busier than before and reading the soil water trends at various depths became a challenge compare figs 2a and 3 while farmers were advised to read the soil water traces selectively say a trace each from the irrigation and drainage zones it became evident that there was a need to develop a more meaningful data display system to fully realise the potential of profile sensor data the complexity of displaying multiple soil water traces and the format mismatches in the presentation of current demand and forecast supply data made the tool less accessible for easy decision making these challenges provided the researchers with a new set of co learning moments phase three began with a search for a better data integration and presentation scheme 7 phase 3 making the invisible visible during irrigation seasons 2017 18 and thereafter following the introduction of profile sensor and provision of soil water and forecast data via a generic website the researchers turned their attention to combining current demand and forecast supply data into a seamless product an exclusive web portal irrimate https i2 niwa co nz was designed to display the data from 2018 to 19 season the web portal included the following display of current daily rainfall irrigation and potential evapotranspiration conditions and forecast rainfall and potential evapotranspiration conditions current and forecast soil water conditions updated weather forecast every six hours and current conditions every hour ability for users to scroll back to view all available historical data and zooming in and out of any specific periods of interest daily minimum and maximum soil temperature data at 100 mm depth daily modelled pasture production data and provision of a water balance by summarising daily rainfall irrigation and evapotranspiration data to estimate soil water excess or deficit the irrimate design allowed inclusion of other data such as measured on farm water use although that was not measured as a direct component of the case study one of the co learnings that occurred early during the case study was that farmers preferred to access all irrigation related data demand supply and use from one portal even if not from one source hence irrimate was designed to be adaptable and flexible to bring external data steams other than those collected in the case study following the installation of profile sensors the farmers saw an opportunity to access soil temperature data at 100 mm depth based on field observations and analysis of pasture growth and soil temperature data from various pasture growing regions of nz charlton et al 1986 concluded that soil temperature at 100 mm depth is a good indicator of pasture growth potential and thus nutrient and water use so generally farmers are advised to monitor soil temperature at 100 mm depth before starting or ending an irrigation season as soil temperature dips below optimal growing conditions during these shoulder seasons with the profile sensor the case study farmers saw an opportunity to objectively begin and end an irrigation season based on soil temperature measurements at 100 mm depth access to soil temperature was not possible before the installation of profile sensor this data stream was added to the irrimate portal on the farmers initiative similarly daily water use data which was not measured as a part of the case study was added to the irrimate portal based on the researchers initiative the core component of irrimate was the insight plot an integrated visual representation of soil water data both spatially and temporally see fig 4 it visually revealed the soil drying and wetting patterns soil water transfer within and between irrigation and drainage zones and changes in soil water based on historical and forecast weather conditions the insight plot enabled stakeholders to visualise the relationship between inputs rainfall irrigation and evapotranspiration and output soil water conditions in near real time as well as in a forecast mode this cause and effect relationship was previously invisible and the insight plot has made it visible the irrimate portal and insight plot were designed to show the timing and duration of drainage events the rainfall irrigation water use and evapotranspiration data were summarised as daily data and soil water and soil temperature data were summarised as hourly to 2 hourly data by zooming in users could identify the start and end of a drainage event daily resolution and link that back to the irrigation or rainfall event that had caused it in case of irrigation events that had resulted in drainage farmers were encouraged to explore options such as varying irrigation amounts and or frequency and trigger times for example if drainage was recorded after an irrigation event and if the irrigation infrastructure does not allow altering the amount of irrigation applied subsequent irrigation events could be started at a drier soil water condition if irrigation amount could be altered then the irrigation could be triggered at the same or similar soil water condition but less water could be applied the implementation of these options relies on the availability of irrigation supply on demand if irrigations are delayed to a drier condition and the capability of the irrigation infrastructure if irrigation amounts are to be varied the irrimate portal and insight plot served multiple purposes as described below 1 spatially within the soil profile 0 800 mm depth it reduced the complexity of reading multiple soil water traces from individual depths into a continuous and intuitive colour plot compare figs 3 and 4 for changes in soil water representation in phases two and three respectively this was achieved by standardising the soil water data at each depth using depth specific full point estimated from historical data 2 temporally it integrated current soil water and forecast supply data into one seamless product this was achieved by deriving forecast soil water data using current soil water and forecast rainfall and evapotranspiration data this eliminated the guesswork by the farmer in combining demand and supply data streams 3 historically farmers could retrace and see their irrigation practices over a period to understand the dynamic relationship between cause rainfall irrigation evapotranspiration and effect soil water changes and drainage and any observable changes in their irrigation behaviour 4 educationally the combined spatial and temporal plot provided farmers with a knowledge of wetting from rainfall and irrigation and drying from evapotranspiration patterns of their soils and their variability over the season the insight plot also highlighted the differences in wetting patterns and water redistribution within the soil profile resulting from rainfall and irrigation events as they differ in their intensities 5 for compliance purposes the occurrence and timing of drainage provided regulators the needed evidence of good irrigation practices regulators could temporally align drainage events to irrigation and rainfall events in a few cases the insight plot captured the rise of water table or lateral flow which was by picked up by increases in soil water without any addition of rainfall or irrigation 6 operationally the insight plot allowed farmers to evaluate the response of their paddock to irrigation scheduling practices this meant they could identify the optimal soil water conditions to start an irrigation event or optimal irrigation amount that could be applied at an existing soil water condition without causing a drainage the farmers could begin and end an irrigation season based on soil temperature measured at 100 mm depth 7 from a production perspective the insight plot further evolved to include modelled daily pasture production data based on available soil water sunshine hours and solar radiation as farmers control soil water through irrigation practices they could visualise variations in pasture production more details on the formulations used in developing various components of insight plot and methods used for standardising and forecasting soil water data are available in srinivasan et al in preparation 7 1 an example of self learning using the insight plot one of the aims of the case study was to develop a tool that is self explanatory and easy to use a requirement highlighted in many previous studies e g nguyen et al 2007 payne et al 2018 and others one of the pilot farms was moderately limited by irrigation infrastructure the travelling irrigator on that farm was on a rotation between paddocks and had a return period of eight to nine days within each paddock the irrigator speed could be varied to apply anywhere between 21 and 39 mm these limitations led to relatively large and infrequent irrigation applications which presented two risks from the regulator s perspective a large application of irrigation per event could potentially result in drainage if soils could not retain it from farmer s perspective the long gap between irrigation applications could result in soil drying below the stress point and impacting pasture growth based on the insight plot using a trial and error approach the pilot farmer learned to devise a routine that would ensure continued productivity while limiting drainage without having to invest in a new irrigation infrastructure the pilot farmer s self learning is captured in the insight plot shown in fig 5 to start with the pilot farmer was not sure how much irrigation to apply per event 21 or 39 mm or somewhere in between to balance between production and drainage outcomes but using a trial and error method and by following the insight plot after each irrigation event the pilot farmer was able to find an optimal irrigation amount that would fit an eight to nine day return period without causing any drainage between irrigation events the soil water within the top 200 mm dropped to stress point but there still was enough water within the root zone between 200 and 400 500 mm depth to support pasture growth the availability of additional water would not have been picked by the soil moisture sensor at one depth as done in phase one and would have convinced the pilot farmer that they were losing production however a complete knowledge of soil water conditions within the rootzone gave the pilot farmer the confidence that they were not losing out on potential production during this period the pilot farmer independently measured pasture growth to have additional independent evidence the initial few irrigation events resulted in drainage but over the six week period shown fig 5 the pilot farmer had settled on an optimal irrigation amount and frequency based on infrastructure limitation through this self learning exercise the pilot farmer was able to avoid investing in a new irrigation infrastructure that would allow them to apply less water more frequently according to fazey and schultz 2009 such experimentation by the farmer is a hallmark of adaptive management a means of actively seeking new ways of doing things to influence outcomes and learning about the system being managed 8 discussion 8 1 roles of context relevancy and legitimacy many studies have concluded that the uptake of tools and practices among farmers would increase if they farmers perceive the information provided is beneficial and relevant daberkow and mcbride 2003 adrian et al 2005 pierpaoli et al 2013 reid and brazendale 2014 payne et al 2018 in this study the stakeholders helped to describe the context improved water use and the legitimacy and relevancy of the irrigation scheduling tool developed within that context cash et al 2003 presented comprehensive definitions of relevancy and legitimacy relevancy is the usefulness of the information provided to the needs of the decision makers and legitimacy refers to the perception that the information respectful of stakeholders divergent values and beliefs cash et al 2003 pg 8086 here we describe legitimacy as the acceptability of irrimate as a tool to schedule irrigation by the farmer and the insight plot as an evidence of irrigation practice when the case study was launched the researchers hypothesised that adoption of soil water monitoring and weather forecasting for irrigation scheduling would improve water use however the co learning process revealed additional layers that refined the context of improved water use such an evolution of perspective is central to a co learning process which happens when researchers seek a wider perspective to the problem and start including values and knowledge from all sources coutts et al 2017 the establishment of context e g table 1 strengthened the relevancy of the tool as it encompassed multiple perspectives to improved water use when the first version of the tool was developed phase one it was designed to specifically fit the existing landscape soil moisture sensor 200 mm as well as presenting soil water data as a line trace fig 2a when the co learning process enabled the stakeholders to voice their expectation of data needs to improve water use see table 1 it became evident that the current then technology needed to be revisited to meet the expectations operationally both regulators and farmers needed irrigation event based near real time evidence to know the impact of irrigation practices which the then technology did not offer this provided an impetus to look for other options such as the profile sensor the introduction of profile sensor irrimate portal and insight plot challenged the conventional practice an outcome of participatory process reported in many other studies e g burges and smith 2009 mcentee 2016 a visual representation of cause and effect drainage followed by irrigation or rainfall provided a compelling evidence and learning opportunity for the pilot farmers to alter their practices the inclusion of modelled pasture production data linked to on farm soil water conditions helped farmers to understand the relationship between the two burges and smith 2009 concluded that such cause and effect evidence is an important component of a decision support tool the participatory process induced a similar change in the way researchers presented forecast data during the first two phases the co learning process enabled them to redesign the forecast data presentation compare figs 2 4 for an evolution of data presentation according to cox 1996 this represents an analytical phase of a tool development process where the professional models are deconstructed to suit the intended purpose the inclusion of regulators in the participatory process assisted with its context and legitimacy the regulators were able to gain a first hand account of data collected on farm and their limits and use in making irrigation decisions that are directly linked to resource use when they identified a gap in the data collected evidence for drainage and impending drainage controls through mgm process they provided a context for the researchers to introduce the profile sensor roth et al 2010 highlighted the importance of contextualising practices to allow end users to understand their impacts regulators presented the imminent context that the farmers would need to provide evidence of good management practices and this allowed the launch of the profile sensor technology the importance of such an alignment of technology and context has been reported by lindblom et al 2017 rose et al 2018 and others by acknowledging the value of data provided by the profile sensors the regulators legitimised their profile sensors application the profile sensor did not quantify the drainage but signalled its timing and occurrence which the regulators considered a sufficiently defensible evidence of irrigation practice through their interaction with the researchers and farmers during the engagement process the regulators understood the financial challenges and technical feasibility in quantifying drainage in every farm 8 2 experimentation and learning by doing in the case study co learning led to the development of irrimate portal and insight plot that enabled experimentation insight plot led to an environment that allowed learning by doing and doing by learning through experimentation the two key learning methods described in bos et al 2013 and others the example of self learning described earlier highlights the experimentation process such experimentation is a key enquiry step that leads to adapting new practices van der brugge and rotmans 2007 raven et al 2010 loorbach 2010 rotmans and loorbach 2010 bos et al 2013 and others even though the researchers consciously decided not to provide any irrigation decision advice the insight plot provided the opportunity for experimentation on farm as the researchers shared the data in near real time the pilot farmers were able to experiment and practice various options to arrive at a desired outcome s such experimentation included a cycle of plan do observe reflect this learning cycle has been reported by boyce et al 2016 and others experimentation using the insight plot triggered three levels of knowledge as described in kaiser and fuhrer 2003 garmendia and stagl 2010 bos et al 2013 and others firstly the plot provided an insight into the problem the pilot farmers got the first hand knowledge of the magnitude of irrigation impact on soil water conditions drainage and pasture production this knowledge was termed as declarative knowledge equipped with this declarative knowledge through experimentation the pilot farmers altered their irrigation practices to achieve multiple outcomes such as reduced drainage and unimpeded pasture growth this procedural knowledge enabled farmers to understand multiplicity of options available to achieve the same outcomes in the case study these options could have been anywhere from altering the irrigation frequency to the amount of irrigation applied according to kaiser and fuhrer 2003 garmendia and stagl 2010 and bos et al 2013 this procedural knowledge leads to an effectiveness knowledge where the pilot farmers were able to compare the effectiveness of various options investigated in the case of self learning example described earlier the pilot farmer was able to alter the amount of irrigation applied and to some extent frequency between 8 or 9 days to identify the most suitable option to achieve drainage mitigation and production maximisation outcomes 8 3 roles of researchers in a participatory process participatory process demands stakeholders specifically researchers to perform a variety of roles during a project fisher 2011 harvey et al 2012 and hammill et al 2013 have broadly classified these diverse roles under four general categories information intermediary knowledge intermediary knowledge broker and innovation broker at the start of the case study during the early engagement process phase one the researchers performed the role of an information intermediary by bringing together a range of data and information to help pilot farmers make an informed irrigation scheduling decision to improve water use as the case study progressed towards the end of phase one when the regulators required evidence for drainage the researchers processed the daily rainfall evapotranspiration and irrigation data to estimate seasonal drainage for the case study farms while the pilot farmers had access to these data over the entire time they lacked the skill and or time to process them to come up with such meaningful performance indicators as a knowledge intermediary the researchers synthesised these data into usable information seasonal drainage for the pilot farmers the researchers continued to play the role of knowledge intermediary as they developed irrimate portal that integrated multiple streams of data during phase three with the introduction of insight plot the researchers performed the role of a knowledge broker as a knowledge broker they worked on presenting current and forecast data in a format that could help pilot farmers make informed decisions the insight plot also led to the pilot farmers upskilling themselves in managing their irrigation within on farm infrastructural limits this is clearly illustrated by the self learning example presented earlier in the case of self learning the researchers role was limited to presenting the information in such a way that the pilot farmers could make their own decision such an evolution of the decision support tool from an analytical phase into usable information has been widely reported in the literature e g cox 1996 armstrong et al 2003 and cox et al 2004 the researchers acted as innovation brokers by including the regulator as one of the stakeholders the regulators alerted the group to the impending arrival of good management irrigation practices e g mgm and forewarned the pilot farmers and researchers to start exploring ways of gathering evidence to ground truth their practices the inclusion of regulator to the co learning group introduced the challenge of drainage management leading to the introduction of profile sensor which eventually led to the insight plot 9 conclusions a co learning based participatory approach was employed in developing an operational irrigation scheduling tool for nz pastoral farms the participatory approach included researchers farmers regulators and industry professionals including multiple perspectives throughout the tool development process revealed unexpected insights and resulted in improved outcomes for all stakeholders the co learning process resulted in three overlapping yet distinct descriptions of improved water use researchers provided a technology based definition irrigation scheduling using soil water monitoring and weather forecast regulators provided an environmental based definition irrigation scheduling that minimises drainage and nutrient leaching and the case study farmers provided an economic definition irrigation scheduling that supports pasture growth and productivity the co produced irrigation scheduling tool evolved to include all three perspectives to improved water use thereby enhancing the relevancy and legitimacy of the tool and potentially its uptake the co learning based irrigation tool development process led to a number of self learning opportunities researchers evolved their data collection profile soil moisture sensor and information presentation insight plot processes and the pilot farmers learned to use the insight plot to maximise the use of their irrigation infrastructure to balance mitigating drainage and maximising pasture growth while the initial phases of the co learning process enabled definition of case study context multiple

9596,inefficient use of irrigation in new zealand pastoral farms is widespread and the uptake of irrigation scheduling tools to improve efficiency is poor recent studies suggest that end user inclusive participatory approaches to developing tools and practices could improve the uptake contributing to improved economic and environmental outcomes using a co learning based participatory approach we researchers worked with a group of pastoral farmers water resources regulators and industry professionals to develop an operational irrigation scheduling support tool that would facilitate improved water use the key engagement principles used were taking time to understand the problem from multiple stakeholder perspectives applying equal value to all sources of knowledge providing an atmosphere that fosters learning among stakeholders co learning staying aware of the wider problem context and remaining flexible and adaptable the co learning approach revealed over lapping yet distinct perceptions of improved water use for farmers it meant pasture growth unimpeded by available soil water for regulators reduced irrigation drainage and consequent leaching of nutrients from rootzone and for researchers justified use of water based current crop demand and forecast rainfall supply the co learning guided operational tool combined near real time soil water monitoring demand and short term two to six days rainfall forecast supply to support on farm irrigation scheduling decisions the tool included biophysical data type and synthesis structural data format presentation and visualisation and technological instrumentation and data collection protocols features that incorporated the diverse perspectives to water use uptake of the tool by the pilot study farmers was high and their irrigation practices evolved because of the information it provided inclusion of multiple stakeholder perspectives throughout the tool development process revealed unexpected insights and resulted in improved outcomes for all stakeholders graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation participatory process drainage co learning scheduling 1 introduction poor to modest adoption of tools and practices by new zealand nz pastoral farmers to manage on farm natural resources such as water has commonly resulted in inefficient resource use and unrealised economic potential turner et al 2013 ministry for primary industries mpi 2011 van housen 2015 based on an investigation of water use in three pastoral farms in canterbury nz for an irrigation season 2014 15 van housen 2015 reported that 47 64 of irrigations were unnecessary and could have been avoided had appropriate irrigation scheduling practices been in place the nz ministry for primary industries mpi 2012 had estimated that if the bottom three quarters of least efficient pastoral farmers adopted the management practices currently used by the most efficient the country could have achieved an additional nz 3 billion revenue annually from increased exports without a need for new technology however hornbuckle et al 2009 lea cox 2012 and others indicated that the technological complexity of irrigation scheduling tools often inhibit their adoption by farmers more often end users perceive such technologies as a burdensome layer of management and thus ignore lea cox 2012 several studies in nz and elsewhere have associated the lack of user engagement in the process of developing tools and practices to their poor uptake e g nguyen et al 2007 bruges and smith 2009 reid and brazendale 2014 payne et al 2018 small et al 2021 and others payne et al 2018 investigated the impact of nz government funded on farm science and technology transfer projects over the last decade and concluded that those projects that generated realistic immediate take home outcomes that were affordable time money acceptable social license available timeliness practical use of existing infrastructure and convenient ease of implementation achieved the desired impact to develop such options mpi 2012 concluded that there needs to be increased direct interaction between technology developers and users with approaches such as transfer of technology there is an absence of direct interaction between developers and receptors rogers 2002 and others a lack of interaction could otherwise lead to mismatch in the understanding of the problem among stakeholders and end users hereafter in this paper the term stakeholder includes both stakeholders and end users resulting in tools and practices that are either irrelevant ill informed or both thus becoming a burden to the users nguyen et al 2007 lea cox 2012 developing tools and practices that are relevant usable and translate science into practice requires engagement methods that accommodate multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives and that utilise the skills and knowledge of those stakeholders in the design process forester 1999 klerkx and nettle 2013 payne et al 2018 participatory approaches that promote a closer and direct interaction between technology developers and users right from the genesis of an idea to its design development and implementation substantially enhance uptake e g röling 2009 turner et al 2013 vereijssen et al 2017 and others in this paper using a chronologically structured analysis of a case study we describe how a co learning based participatory process guided the cognitive and operational evolution of an on farm irrigation scheduling tool using the case study we track the starting conditions and the emergence of a context and relevance as enabled by the co learning process the case study employed in this paper has previously been used to investigate various aspects of participatory process srinivasan et al 2017 who published the original case study indicated that its primary objective was to improve irrigation water use by combining high resolution weather forecast and on farm irrigation demand monitoring srinivasan et al 2017 and verejissen et al 2017 studied the evolution and refinement of the case study objectives when the researchers opted for a participatory co learning approach instead of a transfer of technology model once a participatory approach was adopted srinivasan et al 2019 examined the case study activities and delineated the phases of the case study development from initiation to implementation fielke and srinivasan 2017 and srinivasan and elley 2018 examined the case study to understand the evolution of non tangible outcomes such as community resilience and trust among stakeholders respectively as instigated by the participatory process in this paper we address the eventual objective of the case study improved water use through improved information use here the improved water use is examined within the context of adoption of improved irrigation scheduling practices we examine the development of a tangible output an irrigation management tool that emerged from the co learning process we track the participatory process as it was informed and influenced by the stakeholders and the eventual shape and structure of the output the paper is targeted at researchers and resource managers who are considering employing a participatory approach in translating their science findings into usable tools and practices for end users 2 case study description the case study was initiated as a pilot project in 2013 14 under the endeavour fund managed by the nz ministry for business innovation and employment mbie to enhance the uptake of improved irrigation practices by pastoral farmers and to improve on farm water use the case study researchers sought to combine real time soil water monitoring with short term weather rainfall forecasting to inform irrigation scheduling soil water monitoring has long been used as a proxy for irrigation demand the question being is the soil dry enough to trigger an irrigation today the case study researchers explored the use of rainfall forecasts as a proxy for the next two to six days of irrigation supply the question was phrased as could the forecast rainfall be used to either delay a scheduled irrigation event or adjust the amount of irrigation applied today at the start of the case study the researchers described the improvement in water use by counting the number of irrigation events that were delayed altered or completely skipped based on current demand and forecast supply a total of 10 irrigated pastoral farms in the canterbury region nz was chosen for the case study the canterbury region is the home of approximately two thirds of irrigated lands in nz statsnz 2017 and irrigation allocation in this region accounts for approximately 80 of nationally consented irrigation water use booker and henderson 2019 each case study farm was instrumented with a rain gauge and soil moisture sensor under one irrigator the rain gauge measured both rainfall and irrigation and the soil moisture sensor measured soil water and soil temperature at 200 mm depth below soil surface at one location this depth of soil water measurement and the number of monitoring sites per irrigator are typical of pastoral farms in the region a schematic of the instrumentation is shown in fig 1a data were collected every 10 min and telemetered every hour the forecast data included two and six day weather predictions the two day weather forecast was updated every six hours and the six day forecast updated every day the weather forecasts included rainfall relative humidity air temperature and wind speed and direction the data format frequency synthesis display and sharing protocols and instrumentation evolved during the case study principally informed by the co learning process these are discussed in subsequent sections 3 case study participatory approach participatory approaches are commonly neither prescriptive nor pre defined bruges and smith 2009 instead of adhering to a singular regimented tech transfer pathway these approaches are focused on enabling active participation of stakeholders right from the early stages of the research kloppenburg 1991 massey et al 2006 jakku and thorburn 2010 botha et al 2017 described that participatory approach as organically evolving in response to stakeholder engagement in the case study described here a co learning based participatory approach that focused on fostering learning among stakeholders was employed the participatory process employed operating principles described in nederlof et al 2011 and coutts et al 2017 as a guide to engagement the key principles used were taking time to view and understand the problem from multiple stakeholder perspectives applying equal value to all sources of knowledge providing an atmosphere that fosters learning among stakeholders co learning by actively listening and understanding staying aware of wider problem context to balance between short term outcomes and long term vision and remaining flexible and adaptable as the co learning process requires the co learning process employed in the case study did not seek to confirm validate or establish a perspective preference knowledge source or value held by any one group e g researchers or farmers instead it sought ways to contextualise water use practices by encompassing stakeholder perspectives and evolving a relevant legitimate and adaptable set of practices and tools in the case study co learning between case study researchers and pilot farmers occurred through several one on one and group interactions at various stages these interactions engagement phases and evidence collected during each phase are described in detail in srinivasan et al 2019 initially 2014 15 the researchers sought farmers interest and consent in participating in the case study interactions then moved to setting up instruments on farms and training the farmers to access data and finally transitioning into end of the season workshops that included all case study stakeholders co learning between other stakeholders regulators government representatives industry professionals irrigation scheme managers and other non participant farmers in the study region researchers and pilot farmers occurred routinely at the end of the season workshops referred to as workshop s hereafter where the group discussed the irrigation practices and outcomes from the previous irrigation season and periodically during day to day operational interactions additionally the researchers used the workshop as an opportunity to gather feedback on the data provided to the pilot farmers more on this in subsequent sections and their ease of use in supporting irrigation decisions the workshop also focused on dissecting specific irrigation events to learn from them understanding the accuracy of weather forecasts provided incorporating weather forecast uncertainty into decision making discussing the usefulness and timeliness of data provided assessing the need for additional data collection and sharing to support irrigation decisions and considering other farm specific challenges to managing irrigation such as availability of water supply irrigation infrastructure limitations staff capacities and capabilities and others at the workshop the group discussed changes on farm operational as well as data collection syntheses and presentation procedures that could be implemented in the subsequent irrigation season to support more efficient irrigation practices for example for farmers this could be a change in irrigation frequency or amount for researchers this adaption could be considering options for additional data collection processing and sharing the majority of co learning happened at these workshops as all key stakeholders were present enriching the discussions by sharing their perspectives and understanding others co learning emerged from the participatory process and the evolution of the irrigation scheduling tool was captured in three distinct sequential phases each phase represented approximately two irrigation seasons this much time was needed for the operation of the instrumentation to stabilise in this case it is the time for the soil moisture sensors to settle in the soil and provide reliable data and for the stakeholders to become familiar with the newly available information and provide meaningful feedback phase one alignment with existing practices describes the early stages of the engagement process with stakeholders the co learning from this phase led to phase two deviation from existing practices where the understanding of irrigation water use broadened and the need for non conventional data collection protocols emerged phase three making the invisible visible represents the emergence of a matured product an irrigation scheduling tool that culminated from co learning process the tool though existed in one form or other across all three phases evolved and matured guided by the co learning process 4 phase 1 alignment with existing practices at the time of the case study initiation 2014 15 those pastoral farmers that monitored soil water to schedule irrigation monitored at a depth of 200 mm below surface for pasture generally a rootzone of 400 500 mm is assumed porteous et al 1994 and the 200 mm depth is assumed to represent the midpoint in accordance with the existing convention at the start of the case study soil moisture sensors were installed at 200 mm depth see fig 1a also unless there are distinct spatial differences in soil drainage properties or crop types farmers generally monitored soil water at one location under each irrigator and scheduled irrigations accordingly generally farmers are advised by irrigation consultants to schedule irrigation when soil water is at or close to stress point and not to irrigate when soil water is at near or above full point stress point is crop specific and is an empirical representation of a condition below which a crop would exhibit water stress and thus a decline in growth for pasture stress point is typically 50 of plant available water paw a soil physical property that can be readily obtained from published soil databases such as s map lilburne et al 2012 full point is soil specific it represents a condition when paw is at 100 and the available soil storage is zero any addition of water to a soil at or above full point results in drainage or overland flow brown 2007 kc et al 2018 and others had examined irrigation scheduling practices in canterbury pastoral farms and reported that farmers seldom wait until stress point to trigger an irrigation to avoid the risk of production loss from water stress during phase one of the case study the current irrigation demand soil water observations and forecast irrigation supply rainfall data were collated into a report and shared with the pilot farmers every day via email the daily report included last seven days of observed rainfall irrigation soil water and soil temperature both soil water and soil temperature were derived from the same soil moisture sensor buried at 200 mm depth last seven days of estimated evapotranspiration based on weather observations from the nearest weather station next two days of three hourly rainfall air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and direction and next six days of daily rainfall air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and direction a sample of the daily report is shown in fig 2 even though the two day forecast was updated every six hours emails were sent out only once a day the pilot farmers received only one forecast per day the last updated forecast to increase the co learning opportunities irrigation and soil water data from all case study farms were collated in the daily report and shared with all recipients this was to allow the pilot farmers see others irrigation practices and soil water conditions with the aim of instigating moments of reflection and learning which are discussed in detail in srinivasan and elley 2018 during this phase and over the entire case study the researchers neither advised the pilot farmers on making irrigation decisions nor interfered with the ones they made this was done deliberately as the wider goal of the case study was to co produce a tool that was easy to understand and use without the need for any expert input and guidance thus the researchers confined their role to collecting and presenting the data also the researchers did not have specific knowledge of on farm conditions such as a broken irrigator non availability of irrigation supply staff availability or stock movement so were not ideally placed to provide farm specific irrigation advice however at the workshops the stakeholders talked about reasons behind specific irrigation decisions and practices during the previous season and the learnings that occurred from observing peers see srinivasan and elley 2018 5 co learning from existing practices phase one 5 1 description of water use after the first two complete irrigation seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 as the stakeholders had become familiar with the aim of the case study and the co learning approach employed the operational definition of water use as a metric of improved irrigation practice began to evolve this is captured in table 1 along with a description of drivers perspectives and aims of specific stakeholder group as the researchers regularly interact with state of the art technologies such as high resolution weather forecasting models and soil moisture sensors and diverse climate soils and hydrology datasets they described improved water use as a way of scheduling irrigation using real time soil water monitoring in the rootzone and short term rainfall forecast in other words by combining data from multiple sources specific on farm observations and localised high resolution weather model forecasts and time scales current and future the researchers sought to extend the conventional irrigation scheduling question from is irrigation needed today based on current demand to is irrigation justified today based on current demand and forecast supply relevant local government representatives regional council regulators were also invited to the workshops they are the custodians and administrators of water resources in the region responsible for both quantity and quality water allocation and water use monitoring and are focused on responsible resource use regulators are increasingly concerned that drainage from irrigation and rainfall leach nutrients below the rootzone into groundwater thus it is important to control drainage to contain the possibility of leaching robson et al 2015 although rainfall drainage may not be able to be controlled regulators focused on minimising irrigation drainage this phase of the case study coincided with the emergence of the regional council s matrix of good management mgm initiative mgm represented the compilation of recommended irrigation practices to reduce nutrient leaching robson et al 2015 mgm 2015 thus the regulators defined improved water use as irrigation scheduling that minimises drainage they framed their question as would an irrigation today result in drainage and leaching as opposed to the conventional question is irrigation needed today based on current demand for farmers irrigation is one of the key inputs to agricultural production they were therefore focused on a scheduling approach that supported the productivity objective often farmers erred on the side of scheduling an irrigation event rather than skipping one as they perceive that the production repercussions were less damaging from irrigating than by skipping brown 2007 kc et al 2018 thus farmers definition of improved water use revolved around maintaining soil water conditions that did not impede production instead of asking is irrigation needed today based on demand they asked would not irrigating today compromise the production 5 2 evidence for good irrigation scheduling the existing soil moisture sensor configuration deployment at 200 mm depth helped farmers to trigger irrigation events before the soil dropped to stress point but did not provide evidence to the regulator on irrigation drainage at one of the workshops during phase one the researchers using a simple water balance model presented an estimate of seasonal drainage that would have occurred in the case study farms based on actual irrigation and rainfall data this estimation was done by summarising daily rainfall irrigation and evaporation data for each soil paw assuming any water in excess of paw would have been lost from the rootzone through drainage even though the modelled estimates were useful in evaluating how well the farms performed with drainage the timing after the irrigation season and time resolution seasonal as opposed to individual irrigation event scale of these drainage estimates did not help the farmers to learn about individual drainage events and alter their irrigation practices operationally nor could the seasonal drainage estimates categorically identified which irrigation events had resulted in drainage and what practices could have minimised those drainage events the need for timely evidence of drainage for operational irrigation scheduling was a co learning moment for researchers as it highlighted the absence of a dataset real time drainage sought by stakeholders 5 3 data presentation during phase one of the case study the meaningfulness of data collected and their syntheses and presentation became a frequent discussion point among the stakeholders a summary of these discussion points is captured below the soil moisture sensor at 200 mm depth did not provide conclusive evidence on drainage to the regulator and actionable intelligence for the pilot farmers to evaluate individual irrigation events each daily email update only contained the last seven days of data which meant that the pilot farmers had to go through their previous daily email updates to get a historical view of the season the presentation format of the weather forecast was perceived complex expert user focused see fig 2b which meant that the pilot farmers had to spend time in reading and understanding the data to make a decision and the presentation of historical last seven days soil water and forecast weather data specifically rainfall separately within the same update and in different formats compare fig 2a and b meant that the pilot farmers had to work to bridge the two data streams and surmise the likely impact of forecast rainfall on soil water conditions to make an irrigation scheduling decision 6 phase 2 deviation from existing practices srinivasan and elley 2018 recorded that the focus of case study towards the end of phase 1 shifted from when to start the irrigation to maintain productivity farmer focused to when to start the irrigation to maintain productivity and stop the irrigation to prevent drainage farmer and regulator focused this meant that the farmers needed near real time evidence of drainage or absence of it following each irrigation event with the existing soil moisture sensor at 200 mm depth it was possible to say when the full point was exceeded in the mid section of the rootzone but it was not possible to categorically conclude that the excess water drained below the rootzone 400 500 mm the possibility of the excess water being redistributed within the rootzone between 200 and 500 mm depth could not be discounted to gather evidence about drainage during 2017 18 irrigation season the researchers introduced a multi level soil moisture sensor profile sensor the profile sensor buried vertically measured soil water and soil temperature at every 100 mm interval at eight successive depths see fig 1b for the profile sensor set up the top 4 5 levels 0 400 500 mm of the profile sensor measured soil water conditions within the rootzone irrigation trigger zone and the bottom 3 4 levels 400 500 800 mm measured soil water conditions immediately below the rootzone drainage signal zone once the profile sensor was installed the case study farmers were presented with data from all eight depths these new data showed the transit of water within and between irrigation and drainage zones see an example in fig 3 the case study farmers were trained to manage their irrigation scheduling based on soil water conditions within the irrigation zone and assess the movement of water below the rootzone by following the changes increases in soil water in the drainage zone immediately following irrigation events the profile sensor did not quantify the amount of water drained below the rootzone but signalled the occurrence and timing of drainage this was enough for the farmers and regulators to understand the impact of individual irrigation event in near real time 6 1 enabling learning from accessing historical practices co learning from phase one helped to advance phase two in several aspects this included the adoption of a new multi depth soil water and soil temperature data collection scheme to address the evolving needs of farmers and regulators a data sharing platform website to allow 24 7 data access and access to historical data at ease during irrigation seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 following the installation of profile sensors to enable farmers view historical data the demand and forecast data were presented through a generic telemetry website built and operated by the host research agency niwa the daily email update was discontinued and all data sharing occurred via this website the option of allowing each pilot farmer to view others data was retained the website was not exclusively developed for the case study it collates and displays a wide range of environmental data collected by the host research agency farmers were trained in using the website to access the data on farm measurements were made available in near real time less than 60 min delay no changes were made to the forecast data presentation from phase one the demand and forecast data streams were still maintained separately as they arrive from two different sources demand data from on farm monitoring and forecast data from numerical weather models run every six hours by the host research agency niwa however as the website was active 24 7 the two day forecast was updated every six hours as new forecasts became available because of the number of soil water time series data to be displayed eight one from each depth the line plot visual became busier than before and reading the soil water trends at various depths became a challenge compare figs 2a and 3 while farmers were advised to read the soil water traces selectively say a trace each from the irrigation and drainage zones it became evident that there was a need to develop a more meaningful data display system to fully realise the potential of profile sensor data the complexity of displaying multiple soil water traces and the format mismatches in the presentation of current demand and forecast supply data made the tool less accessible for easy decision making these challenges provided the researchers with a new set of co learning moments phase three began with a search for a better data integration and presentation scheme 7 phase 3 making the invisible visible during irrigation seasons 2017 18 and thereafter following the introduction of profile sensor and provision of soil water and forecast data via a generic website the researchers turned their attention to combining current demand and forecast supply data into a seamless product an exclusive web portal irrimate https i2 niwa co nz was designed to display the data from 2018 to 19 season the web portal included the following display of current daily rainfall irrigation and potential evapotranspiration conditions and forecast rainfall and potential evapotranspiration conditions current and forecast soil water conditions updated weather forecast every six hours and current conditions every hour ability for users to scroll back to view all available historical data and zooming in and out of any specific periods of interest daily minimum and maximum soil temperature data at 100 mm depth daily modelled pasture production data and provision of a water balance by summarising daily rainfall irrigation and evapotranspiration data to estimate soil water excess or deficit the irrimate design allowed inclusion of other data such as measured on farm water use although that was not measured as a direct component of the case study one of the co learnings that occurred early during the case study was that farmers preferred to access all irrigation related data demand supply and use from one portal even if not from one source hence irrimate was designed to be adaptable and flexible to bring external data steams other than those collected in the case study following the installation of profile sensors the farmers saw an opportunity to access soil temperature data at 100 mm depth based on field observations and analysis of pasture growth and soil temperature data from various pasture growing regions of nz charlton et al 1986 concluded that soil temperature at 100 mm depth is a good indicator of pasture growth potential and thus nutrient and water use so generally farmers are advised to monitor soil temperature at 100 mm depth before starting or ending an irrigation season as soil temperature dips below optimal growing conditions during these shoulder seasons with the profile sensor the case study farmers saw an opportunity to objectively begin and end an irrigation season based on soil temperature measurements at 100 mm depth access to soil temperature was not possible before the installation of profile sensor this data stream was added to the irrimate portal on the farmers initiative similarly daily water use data which was not measured as a part of the case study was added to the irrimate portal based on the researchers initiative the core component of irrimate was the insight plot an integrated visual representation of soil water data both spatially and temporally see fig 4 it visually revealed the soil drying and wetting patterns soil water transfer within and between irrigation and drainage zones and changes in soil water based on historical and forecast weather conditions the insight plot enabled stakeholders to visualise the relationship between inputs rainfall irrigation and evapotranspiration and output soil water conditions in near real time as well as in a forecast mode this cause and effect relationship was previously invisible and the insight plot has made it visible the irrimate portal and insight plot were designed to show the timing and duration of drainage events the rainfall irrigation water use and evapotranspiration data were summarised as daily data and soil water and soil temperature data were summarised as hourly to 2 hourly data by zooming in users could identify the start and end of a drainage event daily resolution and link that back to the irrigation or rainfall event that had caused it in case of irrigation events that had resulted in drainage farmers were encouraged to explore options such as varying irrigation amounts and or frequency and trigger times for example if drainage was recorded after an irrigation event and if the irrigation infrastructure does not allow altering the amount of irrigation applied subsequent irrigation events could be started at a drier soil water condition if irrigation amount could be altered then the irrigation could be triggered at the same or similar soil water condition but less water could be applied the implementation of these options relies on the availability of irrigation supply on demand if irrigations are delayed to a drier condition and the capability of the irrigation infrastructure if irrigation amounts are to be varied the irrimate portal and insight plot served multiple purposes as described below 1 spatially within the soil profile 0 800 mm depth it reduced the complexity of reading multiple soil water traces from individual depths into a continuous and intuitive colour plot compare figs 3 and 4 for changes in soil water representation in phases two and three respectively this was achieved by standardising the soil water data at each depth using depth specific full point estimated from historical data 2 temporally it integrated current soil water and forecast supply data into one seamless product this was achieved by deriving forecast soil water data using current soil water and forecast rainfall and evapotranspiration data this eliminated the guesswork by the farmer in combining demand and supply data streams 3 historically farmers could retrace and see their irrigation practices over a period to understand the dynamic relationship between cause rainfall irrigation evapotranspiration and effect soil water changes and drainage and any observable changes in their irrigation behaviour 4 educationally the combined spatial and temporal plot provided farmers with a knowledge of wetting from rainfall and irrigation and drying from evapotranspiration patterns of their soils and their variability over the season the insight plot also highlighted the differences in wetting patterns and water redistribution within the soil profile resulting from rainfall and irrigation events as they differ in their intensities 5 for compliance purposes the occurrence and timing of drainage provided regulators the needed evidence of good irrigation practices regulators could temporally align drainage events to irrigation and rainfall events in a few cases the insight plot captured the rise of water table or lateral flow which was by picked up by increases in soil water without any addition of rainfall or irrigation 6 operationally the insight plot allowed farmers to evaluate the response of their paddock to irrigation scheduling practices this meant they could identify the optimal soil water conditions to start an irrigation event or optimal irrigation amount that could be applied at an existing soil water condition without causing a drainage the farmers could begin and end an irrigation season based on soil temperature measured at 100 mm depth 7 from a production perspective the insight plot further evolved to include modelled daily pasture production data based on available soil water sunshine hours and solar radiation as farmers control soil water through irrigation practices they could visualise variations in pasture production more details on the formulations used in developing various components of insight plot and methods used for standardising and forecasting soil water data are available in srinivasan et al in preparation 7 1 an example of self learning using the insight plot one of the aims of the case study was to develop a tool that is self explanatory and easy to use a requirement highlighted in many previous studies e g nguyen et al 2007 payne et al 2018 and others one of the pilot farms was moderately limited by irrigation infrastructure the travelling irrigator on that farm was on a rotation between paddocks and had a return period of eight to nine days within each paddock the irrigator speed could be varied to apply anywhere between 21 and 39 mm these limitations led to relatively large and infrequent irrigation applications which presented two risks from the regulator s perspective a large application of irrigation per event could potentially result in drainage if soils could not retain it from farmer s perspective the long gap between irrigation applications could result in soil drying below the stress point and impacting pasture growth based on the insight plot using a trial and error approach the pilot farmer learned to devise a routine that would ensure continued productivity while limiting drainage without having to invest in a new irrigation infrastructure the pilot farmer s self learning is captured in the insight plot shown in fig 5 to start with the pilot farmer was not sure how much irrigation to apply per event 21 or 39 mm or somewhere in between to balance between production and drainage outcomes but using a trial and error method and by following the insight plot after each irrigation event the pilot farmer was able to find an optimal irrigation amount that would fit an eight to nine day return period without causing any drainage between irrigation events the soil water within the top 200 mm dropped to stress point but there still was enough water within the root zone between 200 and 400 500 mm depth to support pasture growth the availability of additional water would not have been picked by the soil moisture sensor at one depth as done in phase one and would have convinced the pilot farmer that they were losing production however a complete knowledge of soil water conditions within the rootzone gave the pilot farmer the confidence that they were not losing out on potential production during this period the pilot farmer independently measured pasture growth to have additional independent evidence the initial few irrigation events resulted in drainage but over the six week period shown fig 5 the pilot farmer had settled on an optimal irrigation amount and frequency based on infrastructure limitation through this self learning exercise the pilot farmer was able to avoid investing in a new irrigation infrastructure that would allow them to apply less water more frequently according to fazey and schultz 2009 such experimentation by the farmer is a hallmark of adaptive management a means of actively seeking new ways of doing things to influence outcomes and learning about the system being managed 8 discussion 8 1 roles of context relevancy and legitimacy many studies have concluded that the uptake of tools and practices among farmers would increase if they farmers perceive the information provided is beneficial and relevant daberkow and mcbride 2003 adrian et al 2005 pierpaoli et al 2013 reid and brazendale 2014 payne et al 2018 in this study the stakeholders helped to describe the context improved water use and the legitimacy and relevancy of the irrigation scheduling tool developed within that context cash et al 2003 presented comprehensive definitions of relevancy and legitimacy relevancy is the usefulness of the information provided to the needs of the decision makers and legitimacy refers to the perception that the information respectful of stakeholders divergent values and beliefs cash et al 2003 pg 8086 here we describe legitimacy as the acceptability of irrimate as a tool to schedule irrigation by the farmer and the insight plot as an evidence of irrigation practice when the case study was launched the researchers hypothesised that adoption of soil water monitoring and weather forecasting for irrigation scheduling would improve water use however the co learning process revealed additional layers that refined the context of improved water use such an evolution of perspective is central to a co learning process which happens when researchers seek a wider perspective to the problem and start including values and knowledge from all sources coutts et al 2017 the establishment of context e g table 1 strengthened the relevancy of the tool as it encompassed multiple perspectives to improved water use when the first version of the tool was developed phase one it was designed to specifically fit the existing landscape soil moisture sensor 200 mm as well as presenting soil water data as a line trace fig 2a when the co learning process enabled the stakeholders to voice their expectation of data needs to improve water use see table 1 it became evident that the current then technology needed to be revisited to meet the expectations operationally both regulators and farmers needed irrigation event based near real time evidence to know the impact of irrigation practices which the then technology did not offer this provided an impetus to look for other options such as the profile sensor the introduction of profile sensor irrimate portal and insight plot challenged the conventional practice an outcome of participatory process reported in many other studies e g burges and smith 2009 mcentee 2016 a visual representation of cause and effect drainage followed by irrigation or rainfall provided a compelling evidence and learning opportunity for the pilot farmers to alter their practices the inclusion of modelled pasture production data linked to on farm soil water conditions helped farmers to understand the relationship between the two burges and smith 2009 concluded that such cause and effect evidence is an important component of a decision support tool the participatory process induced a similar change in the way researchers presented forecast data during the first two phases the co learning process enabled them to redesign the forecast data presentation compare figs 2 4 for an evolution of data presentation according to cox 1996 this represents an analytical phase of a tool development process where the professional models are deconstructed to suit the intended purpose the inclusion of regulators in the participatory process assisted with its context and legitimacy the regulators were able to gain a first hand account of data collected on farm and their limits and use in making irrigation decisions that are directly linked to resource use when they identified a gap in the data collected evidence for drainage and impending drainage controls through mgm process they provided a context for the researchers to introduce the profile sensor roth et al 2010 highlighted the importance of contextualising practices to allow end users to understand their impacts regulators presented the imminent context that the farmers would need to provide evidence of good management practices and this allowed the launch of the profile sensor technology the importance of such an alignment of technology and context has been reported by lindblom et al 2017 rose et al 2018 and others by acknowledging the value of data provided by the profile sensors the regulators legitimised their profile sensors application the profile sensor did not quantify the drainage but signalled its timing and occurrence which the regulators considered a sufficiently defensible evidence of irrigation practice through their interaction with the researchers and farmers during the engagement process the regulators understood the financial challenges and technical feasibility in quantifying drainage in every farm 8 2 experimentation and learning by doing in the case study co learning led to the development of irrimate portal and insight plot that enabled experimentation insight plot led to an environment that allowed learning by doing and doing by learning through experimentation the two key learning methods described in bos et al 2013 and others the example of self learning described earlier highlights the experimentation process such experimentation is a key enquiry step that leads to adapting new practices van der brugge and rotmans 2007 raven et al 2010 loorbach 2010 rotmans and loorbach 2010 bos et al 2013 and others even though the researchers consciously decided not to provide any irrigation decision advice the insight plot provided the opportunity for experimentation on farm as the researchers shared the data in near real time the pilot farmers were able to experiment and practice various options to arrive at a desired outcome s such experimentation included a cycle of plan do observe reflect this learning cycle has been reported by boyce et al 2016 and others experimentation using the insight plot triggered three levels of knowledge as described in kaiser and fuhrer 2003 garmendia and stagl 2010 bos et al 2013 and others firstly the plot provided an insight into the problem the pilot farmers got the first hand knowledge of the magnitude of irrigation impact on soil water conditions drainage and pasture production this knowledge was termed as declarative knowledge equipped with this declarative knowledge through experimentation the pilot farmers altered their irrigation practices to achieve multiple outcomes such as reduced drainage and unimpeded pasture growth this procedural knowledge enabled farmers to understand multiplicity of options available to achieve the same outcomes in the case study these options could have been anywhere from altering the irrigation frequency to the amount of irrigation applied according to kaiser and fuhrer 2003 garmendia and stagl 2010 and bos et al 2013 this procedural knowledge leads to an effectiveness knowledge where the pilot farmers were able to compare the effectiveness of various options investigated in the case of self learning example described earlier the pilot farmer was able to alter the amount of irrigation applied and to some extent frequency between 8 or 9 days to identify the most suitable option to achieve drainage mitigation and production maximisation outcomes 8 3 roles of researchers in a participatory process participatory process demands stakeholders specifically researchers to perform a variety of roles during a project fisher 2011 harvey et al 2012 and hammill et al 2013 have broadly classified these diverse roles under four general categories information intermediary knowledge intermediary knowledge broker and innovation broker at the start of the case study during the early engagement process phase one the researchers performed the role of an information intermediary by bringing together a range of data and information to help pilot farmers make an informed irrigation scheduling decision to improve water use as the case study progressed towards the end of phase one when the regulators required evidence for drainage the researchers processed the daily rainfall evapotranspiration and irrigation data to estimate seasonal drainage for the case study farms while the pilot farmers had access to these data over the entire time they lacked the skill and or time to process them to come up with such meaningful performance indicators as a knowledge intermediary the researchers synthesised these data into usable information seasonal drainage for the pilot farmers the researchers continued to play the role of knowledge intermediary as they developed irrimate portal that integrated multiple streams of data during phase three with the introduction of insight plot the researchers performed the role of a knowledge broker as a knowledge broker they worked on presenting current and forecast data in a format that could help pilot farmers make informed decisions the insight plot also led to the pilot farmers upskilling themselves in managing their irrigation within on farm infrastructural limits this is clearly illustrated by the self learning example presented earlier in the case of self learning the researchers role was limited to presenting the information in such a way that the pilot farmers could make their own decision such an evolution of the decision support tool from an analytical phase into usable information has been widely reported in the literature e g cox 1996 armstrong et al 2003 and cox et al 2004 the researchers acted as innovation brokers by including the regulator as one of the stakeholders the regulators alerted the group to the impending arrival of good management irrigation practices e g mgm and forewarned the pilot farmers and researchers to start exploring ways of gathering evidence to ground truth their practices the inclusion of regulator to the co learning group introduced the challenge of drainage management leading to the introduction of profile sensor which eventually led to the insight plot 9 conclusions a co learning based participatory approach was employed in developing an operational irrigation scheduling tool for nz pastoral farms the participatory approach included researchers farmers regulators and industry professionals including multiple perspectives throughout the tool development process revealed unexpected insights and resulted in improved outcomes for all stakeholders the co learning process resulted in three overlapping yet distinct descriptions of improved water use researchers provided a technology based definition irrigation scheduling using soil water monitoring and weather forecast regulators provided an environmental based definition irrigation scheduling that minimises drainage and nutrient leaching and the case study farmers provided an economic definition irrigation scheduling that supports pasture growth and productivity the co produced irrigation scheduling tool evolved to include all three perspectives to improved water use thereby enhancing the relevancy and legitimacy of the tool and potentially its uptake the co learning based irrigation tool development process led to a number of self learning opportunities researchers evolved their data collection profile soil moisture sensor and information presentation insight plot processes and the pilot farmers learned to use the insight plot to maximise the use of their irrigation infrastructure to balance mitigating drainage and maximising pasture growth while the initial phases of the co learning process enabled definition of case study context multiple

9597,the drip irrigation scheduled by different soil matric potential smp thresholds at different stages according to soil water and salt management purposes was usually adopted for revegetation in saline alkali land to reveal the desalinization mechanism of this multi stage drip irrigation scheduling a 3 year field trial adopting this method for revegetation was conducted in an arid saline area the trial consisted of 5 irrigation treatments marked s1 s5 with their smp that monitored directly under drip emitter at 0 2 m depth correspondingly controlled higher than 5 10 15 20 and 25kpa results showed the smp threshold of 5kpa during the unified irrigation stage induced a leaching fraction lf of 42 6 and a minimum recharge amount mra from groundwater of zero thus resulting the relative desalinization rate rdr of 91 8 in 0 120 cm soil layer when treatment applied the average electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extracts ece in 0 40 cm among three growing seasons in s1 s5 treatments linearly increased from 0 90 to 1 73ds m as smp threshold decreased from 5 to 25kpa resulting from the lf correspondingly decreasing from 18 4 to 2 5 and the mra increasing from 0 to 21 4 mm the inter annual salt dynamic indicated a salt equilibrium state was formed in 80 120 cm soil layer when the smp threshold was set higher than 10kpa and that was formed in 40 80 cm soil layer if the smp threshold was set between 20 and 15kpa this study found the smp threshold controlled the lf and mra and eventually determined the dynamics of soil salinity which explained the efficient desalinization mechanism under the multi stage drip irrigation scheduling a key smp threshold of 5kpa for rapid soil leaching stage and that of 20kpa for precise salt regulating stage were recommended for vegetation construction in the low lying saline area keywords saline soil drip irrigation scheduling revegetation leaching fraction 1 introduction the problem of soil salinization is ever increasing due to poor irrigation and drainage practices in some semi arid and arid zones with high evapotranspiration rates and high watertable munns 2002 2005 in these areas salinization occurs due to the upward movement and evaporation of saline groundwater when the groundwater depth is within 2 m white 2006 the yinchuan plain distributed along both sides of the yellow river is one of the most ancient irrigated areas in china and is deeply troubled by the soil salinization on the one hand the abundant flooding irrigation water maintains the agricultural prosperity for over 2000 years however on the other hand the watertable is raised and salinity is increased in some low lying edges of the plain due to the large amounts of drainage wang et al 1993 xiong et al 1996 reducing the soil salinity and lowering the watertable by proper practices are important issues in the similar low lying areas all over the world drip irrigation applies water precisely and uniformly at high frequencies reduces drainage through precise irrigation scheduling and maintains high soil water potential to facilitate water uptake by the plant roots being the most efficient irrigation method for reclaiming salt affected soils goldberg et al 1976 hanson et al 2009 kang 1998 wan et al 2007 the drip irrigation scheduled by tensiometer is worldwide adopted for the cultivation of crops and vegetables because it is precise in monitoring the soil matric potential smp that directly related to the water uptake by plant root and is also convenient for the field operation kang et al 2004 klein 2004 phene et al 1989 tensiometers buried at a depth of 20 cm exactly under drip emitters for the annual plant and depths of both 20 and 50 cm for the perennial plant are efficient for the water and salt management when applied to saline soil reclamation kang et al 2012 2004 wan et al 2012 using this drip irrigation scheduling method studies have found that soil environment improved a lot in 2 3 years in a semi humid area in northeast china liu et al 2011 conducted a 2 year field experiment for a perennial pasture cultivation under smp initiated drip irrigation in heavily soda saline alkali soil in which they found that the highest salt leaching efficiency occurred when smp higher than 10kpa after 2 years the drip irrigation combined with a gravel sand layer was effective to construct vegetation during the reclamation of coastal saline alkali soil and the smp higher than 5kpa was recommended for drip irrigation scheduling during first 3 years sun et al 2012 in recent years the multi stage drip irrigation for perennial vegetation construction in saline soil has been proved efficient for example chen et al 2015 came up with a three stage drip irrigation scheduling for rosa chinensis cultivation in the coastal saline soil based on the salt leaching process and plant response in which the smp thresholds of 5kpa 10kpa and 20kpa for the first the second and the third year respectively were recommended for triggering irrigation based on a 3 year field experiment dong et al 2021 also suggested the smp thresholds of 5kpa 10kpa and 20kpa for the first 3 years were very helpful for leaching and controlling soil salt and maintaining plant growth the results above indicated that the drip irrigation triggered by certain smp thresholds were efficient for saline soil reclamation but the leaching amounts which are very important for salt leaching and watertable controlling in low lying area were not well analyzed in present studies wang et al 2014 used the locate flux method to estimate the deep percolation at 120 cm depth in a field experiment that using the drip irrigation under plastic film for the cotton cultivation and they found the amounts of deep percolation decreased linearly from 18 to 3 mm when the controlled smp thresholds reduced from 5 to 25kpa within single growing season such small amounts of leaching water help with watertable controlling in the low lying areas but the leaching amounts and the amounts of groundwater recharge under drip irrigation remain unclear for perennial plants cultivation in low lying area with heavy salinity especially for those in semi arid or arid regions modeling method is used to help with a comprehensive understanding of water and salt dynamics under drip irrigation the steady state models were established several decades ago to set irrigation guidelines and are still widely used to assess the suitability of water for irrigation these guidelines were established to develop simple relationships between irrigation water salinity rootzone salinity and lf letey et al 2011 usually the average ece within rootzone and ec of irrigation water were functions of the lf for steady state models which was widely used for irrigation scheduling salinity controlling and yield estimation for its simplicity and convenience rhoades et al 1982 scs 1992 corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 the transient state hydrus model has also been widely used in field scale lila et al 2013 simunek et al 2008 skaggs et al 2004 however a better understanding on the root growth root distribution plant water uptake and soil texture is essential to predicting accuracy when modeling the salt dynamics using hydrus model roberts et al 2009 selim et al 2013 wallender et al 2007 moreover the salt dynamics are significantly affected by factors such as the groundwater dynamics plant leaf area index and irrigation regimes abliz et al 2016 lu et al 2015 scudiero et al 2014 monitoring these factors within a single growing season of the annual plant is accurate and feasible but it is difficult and costly for perennial plant over years thus this study carried a 3 year field experiment adopting the multi stage drip irrigation for vegetation construction in saline soil to mine the dynamic characteristics of soil salinity over the long period using the semi empirical and semi theoretical approach derived from steady state model and this study mainly focused on 1 analyzing the salt changes within growing season quantitatively 2 estimating the amounts of leaching and groundwater recharge and 3 revealing the desalinization mechanism under the improved drip irrigation scheduling 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the qingtongxia experimental station the same as dong et al 2020 from 2015 to 2017 the station 38º1 43 38º1 48 n 105º56 29 105º56 36 e is in wuzhong county the ningxia hui autonomous region china this area has temperate continental semi arid climate and the annual average temperature is 9 3 with the lowest and highest of 23 7 and 36 7 respectively the annual rainfall and the potential evaporation pe are around 260 mm and 2000 mm respectively the perennial average groundwater depth in this area is 1 2 m with ec of 20 ds m and ph of 8 5 before experiment the physical and chemical properties of the tested soil are showed in table 1 the 0 80 cm soil is sand and that in 80 120 cm is sandy loam the average phe and ece in 0 120 cm are 7 64 and 10 4ds m classified as heavily saline soil bao 2000 2 2 experimental design experimental treatments were described in detail in the author s former study dong et al 2020 five soil matric potential smp treatments marked with s1 s5 were set up with smp thresholds controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25kpa respectively exactly under drip emitters at both 0 2 m and 0 5 m each treatment consisted of 3 replications and there were 15 experimental plots in total which were in a random arrangement two tensiometers were buried exactly under drip emitters at 0 2 and 0 5 m in the second repeating plot in every treatment wrapped up by non saline loamy soil paste fig 1a to make sure the probes were in firm contact with the soil the irrigation of 5 treatments would be controlled by their matched smp thresholds once smp values of 0 2 or 0 5 m depths in a treatment reduced to smp threshold the treatment would be irrigated 10 mm water the amount of 10 mm water for single irrigation was more than 6 mm that adopted in semi humid areas by chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015a because extra water was needed for leaching salt and meeting more et in semi arid area 2 3 plot layout and the improved irrigation scheduling the saline soil was ridged by excavator at an interval of 4 m and the height of ridge was 0 8 m each plot had four 12 m long ridges and plants were planted on the top ridges the 2 year old poplar trees populus canadensis moench were planted in the transplanting hole at a space of 3 m five undershrub species were transplanted at a space of 1 5 m on two sides of one single ridge fig 1a the grass was sown in 5 rows on each ridge fig 1a all the plants were placed at a lateral separation of 0 1 m from drip tapes the experimental area was surrounded by 3 drainage ditches with depth of 1 5 m and width of 2 0 m and the planting details were described in the former study dong et al 2020 each treatment had an independent irrigation controller to irrigate 3 repeating plots there were 16 drip tapes on ridges and 4 drip tapes in furrows in each repeating plot with an area of 16 m 12 m drip tapes with emitter space of 0 3 m apart and discharge rate of 1 38 l h at 10 m water head were placed at an interval of 0 6 m on each top ridge fig 1 irrigation water was drawn from the yellow river with annually average ec of 0 86ds m ph of 7 95 and the irrigation water quality was introduced in a related study dong et al 2020 the improved irrigation scheduling was divided into 3 stages and the details were described in the author s former study dong et al 2020 the enhanced leaching stage stage i started immediately after plants were transplanted from 1 june 2015 to 6 june 2015 during which drip irrigation was conducted continuously for 5 days in all treatments based on previous study chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 wan et al 2012 the total irrigation water amount in stage i should be no less than 40 mm the conventional leaching stage stage ii started following stage i all treatments would receive 10 mm water if 2 out of 10 smp values fell below 5kpa stage ii lasted for at least 45 days from 7 june 2015 to 22 july 2015 to leach salt and ensure that all transplanted plants being established well the precise water and salt regulation stage stage iii was carried out as soon as stage ii was over after 23 july 2015 when the smp values of each treatment reduce to the matched smp threshold irrigation was conducted in that treatment in the first irrigation early may spring irrigation and last irrigation early november winter irrigation of one growing season the applied water for all treatments was the same and no less than 40 mm 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 smp the smp values monitored by tensiometers wst 2b waterstar beijing china at both 0 2 and 0 5 m depths in all treatments were recorded twice a day at 8 00 and 15 00 2 4 2 groundwater dynamics the depth and ec of groundwater were measured monthly through a pvc tube with holes drilled on the wall which was buried in the middle of the experimental area 2 4 3 soil sampling and ece soil samples were taken from each plot with an auger 4 cm diameter and 10 cm high according to the sampling sketch in fig 1b soil samples were collected when stage i and stage ii terminated and then collected at an interval of 1 2 months in stage iii of the first 2 years and at the beginning and the end of the third growing season all soil samples were air dried and sieved through 2 mm sieve three replicate soil samples mixed to one sample to make extract of saturated soil paste by standard method robbins and wiegand 1990 electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extracts ece was determined by a conductivity meter dds 11a yulong shanghai china the average ece of the whole profile was calculated as weighted average value that taking the distance and area as weight factors dong et al 2020 2 5 methods and models 2 5 1 leaching fraction estimation the leaching fraction lf is very important to salt leaching and controlling according to the section 15 irrigation in national engineering handbook scs 1992 the relationship between lf and the ratio of soil salinity within rootzones to salinity of irrigation water could be described by experience curves the empirical curve under high frequency irrigation condition such as drip irrigation could be expressed as the following equation rhoades et al 1982 1 lf 0 195 ec t ec i 2 95 where lf is the leaching fraction ect is the anticipated salt threshold within certain depth taking ece as the standard eci is the ec of irrigation water 2 5 2 groundwater recharge estimation the equation for the change in salt storage ss is the following asce 2011 2 δ s s d r c r d g c g d i c i s m s f d d c d s p s c where d water depths c salt concentration the subscripts r i g and d designate rain irrigation upward flow from groundwater and drainage respectively sm the salt dissolved from minerals in soil sf the salt added to soil as a fertilizer or amendment sp the salt precipitated and sc the salt removed in the harvested crop in this study the soil is sandy and the fertilizer for tree cultivation was negligible thus we assumed that there were no salt dissolve or precipitation no salt adding and removing in this study the eq 2 could be simplified to eq 3 3 δ s s d r c r d g c g d i c i d d c d the saturated soil pastes that determined the ece of soil samples were made in an approximate ratio of soil to water by weight as 5 3 in this study and the electrical conductivity ec of a solution is linearly correlated to its salt content when the ec is less than 20ds m asce 2011 white 2006 the salt content of rainfall is supposed to be zero thus the eq 3 can be replaced by eq 4 4 0 6d s ρ s δ ec e d g ρ g ec g d i ρ i ec i d d ρ d ec d where ds soil depth of the analyzing layer ρs soil bulk density ece changes of the average ece in the analyzing layer ec average ec supposing that the ρg ρi and ρd are equal to the density of pure water the total salt in applied water with leaching amount subtracted is stored in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the ec of leaching water was not less than that of the irrigation water then the minimum recharge amount mra from groundwater to 0 40 cm soil layer could be calculated by eq 5 5 mra 0 6d s ρ s δ ec e d i ec i d d ec d ec g 2 5 3 desalination simulation the gompertz equation was used to describe the processes of the developing things related to agriculture and chemistry anguelov et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 thus the gompertz equation was adopted to simulate the desalinization processes of different treatment 6 rdr a exp exp x x0 b where rdr is relative desalinization rate calculated as the decreased values divided by the initial value x is the total days of experiment a b and x0 are parameters 3 results 3 1 smp rainfall and irrigation daily smp changes of different treatments at 20 cm depth in the growing seasons from 2015 to 2017 are showed in fig 2 since all treatments received the same irrigation water at irrigation stage i and ii in 2015 smp values of all treatments were controlled between 5kpa and 10kpa and none obvious differences were found between treatments from 2015 6 15 to 2015 7 25 the smp dynamics at stage iii in three seasons had remarkable differences between treatments the smp in different treatments basically fluctuated around their corresponding thresholds and the fluctuation became more sharply as smp threshold becoming lower which is in accordance with the previous studies chen et al 2015 jiao and kang 2007 li et al 2015a obviously rainfalls increased smp values in all treatments black arrows and thus a couple of days would be taken to again reach the smp thresholds for the most of time without rainfalls smp values of all treatments were controlled around their thresholds very well and performed as they were anticipated the sum of applied water and rainfall sawr in table 2 showed that values of sawr in all treatments were the same 88 mm in the stage i and the same 386 mm in stage ii in 2015 values of sawr in s1 s5 gradually decreased from 417 to 123 mm in stage iii of 2015 and values in s1 s5 decreased from 732 to 257 mm in 2016 and from 971 to 426 mm in 2017 the sawr decreased as smp threshold decreased in all three growing seasons and the sawr in every treatment increased along with the increase of planting years and its ratio to that in s1 treatment also increased yearly as a result of tree growths year by year the prominent difference of winter irrigation between 2015 and 2016 could be attributed to the difference of soil moisture at the end of the two growing seasons 3 2 soil salinity and groundwater dynamics within growing seasons dynamics of ece in 0 40 cm soil layer ece 40 were shown in fig 3 the salt was leached sharply in all treatments in stage i and ii during which the average ece 40 reduced from 8 00 to 0 66 ds m within only 57 days the 474 mm applied water in these two stages table 2 played an important role in this efficient leaching when treatments conducted in stage iii in 2015 2017 the ece 40 value in s1 treatment kept stable and those in other treatments showed confirm increases along with time within single growing season the ece 40 increments table 3 basically increased as smp threshold decreased in 2015 and 2016 although increases of ece 40 were found in the third growing season stage iii in 2017 the increments were only 0 17 0 04 0 19 0 21 and 0 64 ds m for s1 s5 treatments which were less than the former two growing seasons the smp threshold that scheduled irrigation had prominent influence on salinity dynamics within growing season and the higher the smp threshold was set the less salt was built up by the way the sharp ece 40 drops in all treatments between the end of one growing season and the beginning of the next growing season would be attributed to the winter irrigation the groundwater dynamics fig 4 indicated that groundwater depth decreased from 1 6 m to 1 2 m after stage i and ii the elevation of the groundwater was caused by the 474 mm water for salt leaching in stage i and ii table 2 when treatments conducted in stage iii in 2015 the groundwater depth decreased gradually and remained around the initial 1 6 m in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the ec of groundwater before experiment was 20ds m and that increased to 35 9ds m in stage i and ii as a result of salt leaching then continuous decrease of groundwater salinity was found with the average ec values of 16 0 15 4 and 10 7ds m in the stage iii in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 the leaching fraction lf and groundwater recharge within growing seasons the lf that calculated by the eq 1 was shown in table 4 the lf in stage i and ii in 2015 was 42 6 and its corresponding leaching amount was 202 mm the lf showed differences among treatments during stage iii in 2015 lf values were 29 2 10 2 3 7 6 2 and 3 1 in s1 s5 treatments and their corresponding leaching amounts were 122 31 6 9 and 4 mm in this stage the situations of lf in both 2016 and 2017 were very similar to those in 2015 lf values and leaching amounts basically decreased as smp threshold decreased in both stage iii in 2016 and 2017 the average lf values in stage iii among three growing seasons were 18 4 8 0 4 8 3 8 and 2 5 with the correspondingly average leaching amounts of 114 39 19 10 and 6 mm in s1 s5 treatments the minimum recharge amounts mras from groundwater in table 5 calculated by eq 5 indicated that the mras from groundwater to 0 40 cm soil layer in stage i and ii in 2015 were zero in all treatments this might be attributed to the lf as high as 42 6 table 4 which caused a continuous and rapid decrease in soil salinity during this stage fig 3 the mras were 0 7 2 28 2 17 7 and 44 4 mm in treatments s1 s5 respectively in stage iii in 2015 which were in accordance with the increments of the ece during this stage table 3 during stage iii in 2016 the mras in s1 s3 were zero and those in s4 and s5 were 14 7 and 19 8 mm but those were zero in all treatments during stage iii in 2017 this indicated that the mras reduced with the reclaiming years and keeping the smp thresholds at 5 15 and 25kpa in stages iii of the first 3 years respectively could ensure that little saline groundwater recharging to the 0 40 soil layer 3 4 inter annual salt dynamics the rdr dynamics in different soil layers along time were showed in fig 5 during irrigation stage i and ii the salt was leached quickly with the rdr values of 90 80 and 70 for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm respectively by the end of stage ii the soil desalinization process became slow and sinusoidal shaking in stage iii the salt dynamics in 0 40 cm soil layer were strongly correlated to smp thresholds figs 5a and 6a as smp threshold decreased the rdr decreased and the average ece in stage iii in this soil layer increased linearly rdr values of all treatments fluctuated between years and the lower the smp thresholds the greater the amplitude fig 5a the temporal dynamic of rdr in 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5b was like those in 0 40 cm soil layer a linear relationship between ece and smp threshold was also found in this soil layer fig 6b the salt dynamics in this soil layer in treatments s3 and s4 exhibited a salt stable state while those in the other 3 treatments remained variable states the results suggested that keeping the smp thresholds at a range of 20 to 15kpa could formed a salt stable layer at 40 80 cm depths differences of temporal dynamics of salt in 80 120 cm soil layer fig 5c were found when compared with the former 2 soil layers the rdr at the beginning of growing seasons in this layer was less than that at the end of growing seasons revealing that the soil salt increased after non growing seasons in this soil layer a linear regression relationship between average ece and smp was also valid though the ece in s3 was abnormally high fig 6c the rdrs in treatment s1 and s2 kept stable along time in this layer suggesting a smp range of 10 to 5kpa could form a salt stable layer at 80 120 cm depths rdr values in ridge slope kept stable in all treatments in stage iii and the temporal dynamics of salt could be simulated by gompertz equation fig 5d however the ece decreased at first and then increased as smp decreased fig 6d which was different from that in 0 120 cm soil layers above rdr values in the whole soil profile of different treatments along time were simulated by eq 6 the salts in all treatments were leached quickly in stage i and stage ii and gradually became stable along time in irrigation stage iii except s3 treatment fig 7 the simulation results table 6 indicated that the stable rdr decreased as smp thresholds decreased with values of 81 84 75 06 67 77 and 64 69 for s1 s2 s4 and s5 the stable ece values for s1 s2 s4 and s5 were 1 89 2 60 3 36 and 3 82 ds m respectively classified as non saline soil based on classification criteria richards 1954 to be noted the rdr in treatment s3 didn t seem to be stable along time and had a tendency of salt accumulation in the whole soil profile along time which was in accordance with the salt dynamics in 80 120 cm fig 5c and fig 6c and ridge slope fig 5d and fig 6d soil layers 4 discussion 4 1 the efficiency of the improved drip irrigation scheduling for salt reclamation the leaching requirement lr is of vital importance to the soil salinity control in the irrigated areas in arid or semi arid region the lr was defined as the fraction of infiltrated water that must pass through the rootzone to keep average rootzone soil salinity from exceeding a level that would significantly reduce crop yield assuming steady state conditions with associated good management and uniformity of leaching usda 1954 the lr is calculated by the product of the applied water amount and the leaching fraction lf the lf is calculated by the ratio of the ec of the irrigation water to that of the drainage water or other empirical equations asce 2011 when developing an irrigation scheduling for salt control the accurate et must be known asce 2011 white 2006 usually the et is estimated by the fao 56 penman monteith method and its accuracy is influenced by the diversities of the climatic zones and ground conditions dhungel et al 2014 tadesse et al 2018 thus the lf calculation based on an estimated et would cause prominent difference between the actual lf and the designed lf asce 2011 the drip irrigation for the salt reclamation in this study is scheduled by the smp threshold and the et is no need to be estimated though the lf was not intentionally designed for the drip irrigation scheduled by the smp threshold in this study the lf did exist and reduced as the smp threshold decreased the multi stage drip irrigation scheduling showed high efficiency in the salt leaching in stages i and ii with the lf as high as 42 6 and salt control in stage iii thus compared with the traditional irrigation scheduling for salt control that calculates the lf and estimate the actual et this improved drip irrigation scheduling has advantages of simplicity convenience and accuracy and a certain leaching ratio is maintained if a proper smp threshold is determined in different irrigation stages the multi stage drip irrigation scheduling for salt reclamation has been widely used to saline soil reclamation among different climate regions in a semi arid coastal region li et al 2015b found that the irrigation scheduled by the smp thresholds at 5 and 15kpa in the first 2 years respectively could significantly decrease soil salinity and remain the 2 year survival rate higher than 80 when using the irrigation water with ec of 3 1ds m this prominent reclaiming effect might be attributed to the agronomy practice that setting a gravel sand layer at the upper boundary of the groundwater to reduce capillary action and the rich rainfall that higher than 500 mm yearly in the first year experiment of li et al 2015b the rainfall was as much as 883 mm because of which the irrigation frequencies were decreased and the total irrigation water amount was only 210 mm though the smp threshold was set at 5kpa table 7 in the second year the irrigation water amount was 45 mm more than the first year but the lf decreased from 18 26 to 3 12 when the smp threshold decreased from 5 to 15kpa the rainfall in the second year was 400 mm less than the first year which might be responsible for the lf difference between these 2 years the study of sun et al 2013 seemed supporting the positive effect of isolation layer on salt leaching table 7 they found that the ece within 0 40 cm was 1 5ds m and the lf was 39 16 when isolation layer was set while those were 4 4ds m and 1 64 when there was none isolation layer based on a 3 year experiment with a similar condition of li et al 2015b the study in this paper was in a semi arid region with annual rainfall around 110 mm and the soil was sandy which were quite different from the studies of li et al 2015b and sun et al 2013 the high ridge played a similar role of isolation layer to reduced capillary action and the increased irrigation amount could make up for the difference in rainfall between arid and humid regions thus lf around 13 and 3 could be maintained when smp threshold was set at 5 and 20kpa respectively in this study table 7 soil texture did not seem to have influences on lf when the appropriate agronomy practices were applied however the average ece in silt loam soil was basically larger than that in sandy soil table 7 the reason might be attributed to the differences of soil adsorption capacity for ions furthermore regardless of the differences of climate conditions and soil texture the total infiltrating water irrigation water rainfall was between 900 mm and 1100 mm when the smp threshold was set at 5 kpa and the lf greater than 2 could be maintained when the smp threshold was set at 20kpa this indicated that the drip irrigation scheduled by smp threshold was efficient in saline soil reclamation and it was little affected by the diversities of climate types and soil textures under the conditions that the key smp thresholds were determined and the proper agronomy practices such as isolation layer or ridging were adopted 4 2 the fate of salt under the improved drip irrigation in the long run generally field capacity fc corresponds to smp between 5 and 10kpa for well structured soils the smp at fc is set at 5kpa whereas for others it is set at 10kpa cavazza et al 1973 white 2006 in this study smps in treatment s1 5kpa and s2 10kpa were basic higher than the smp at fc 10kpa for most of the time thus the soil water in these two treatments would keep a trend of downward movement and a salt equilibrium state could be formed in 80 120 cm soil layer fig 5c for treatments s3 15kpa and s4 20kpa the smps would be less than the smp at fc 10kpa until irrigation was conducted the salt equilibrium state was formed in 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5b in these two treatments as for treatment s5 25kpa there was no salt equilibrium state formed in 0 120 cm soil layer this indicated that when the smp threshold was set larger than 20kpa salt could be controlled at an equilibrium state in 40 120 cm depth and the threshold larger the depth deeper this raised a question that what was the fate of the original soil salt the groundwater dynamics fig 4 suggested that the groundwater depth decreased and the ec increased drastically during the irrigation stage i and ii owing to the lf of 42 6 table 4 then during the stage iii the groundwater depth gradually increased and kept stable around 165 cm and the ec of groundwater kept a firmly decreasing trend with a decrease from the 35ds m at the beginning to the 12ds m at the end the groundwater dynamics explained that the soil salt was leached quickly to the groundwater during the leaching stage i and ii and then the salt was gradually transported to the out zone of the experimental area through lateral groundwater discharge in a comprehensive consideration of the soil salt dynamics and groundwater dynamics the key smp thresholds of 5kpa in stage ii and 20kpa in stage iii were essential to ensure salt leaching and external transfer which was in accordance with the result of dong et al 2020 to be noted the inter annual salt dynamics suggested that the average salt within 0 120 cm depth in s3 15kpa treatment tended to increase along time fig 7 which was different from the rest treatments with equilibrium state the salt increments in 80 120 cm soil layer fig 5c and soil layer in slope fig 5d mainly accounted for this phenomenon the similar result of salt distribution in s3 was also reported by the author s former study in another experiment dong et al 2021 they believed that the tree in the medium moisture conditions e g s3 treatment had deeper roots greater coverage and thus more water absorption by roots in deep soil than those in low moisture conditions e g s4 and s5 thus the salt in 80 120 cm soil layer and ridge slope was more easily affected by capillary action in s3 than s4 and s5 once the water was absorbed by deep root under this circumstance intentionally setting a relatively low smp threshold in irrigation stage iii following the salt leaching stage i and ii would be important to avoid salt building up again in deep soil layer in these low lying areas with saline groundwater using tensiometer scheduling drip irrigation induced high irrigation frequency which raised a very important question that how much applying water was needed to maintain the prosperity of plantation forests based on the first 3 year s data if the smp threshold was set at 5kpa for stage ii and 20kpa for stage iii the applying water amounts were correspondingly 921 430 and 541 mm for the first 3 years which almost met the et 525 mm of healthy development of a sparse woodland in an arid region yang and yang 1988 gou et al 2017 conducted a willow forest establishing experiment in a same area as this study finding that yearly applying 1800 mm water combined with ditches arranged at 9 m intervals in field was efficient to leach salt and ensure the establishment of the willow forest the yearly 1800 mm water would raise the water table in the long run on the one hand and increase water consumption pressure to the water shortage area on the other hand as compared the yearly applied water under multi stage drip irrigation in this study was less than one third of that of flood irrigation except in the first year which saved more than 1200 mm available water yearly when compared with flood irrigation 5 conclusion the improved drip irrigation scheduling consisted of the enhanced leaching stage i the conventional leaching stage ii and the precise water and salt regulating stage iii was proved to be efficient in salt leaching and controlling during the irrigation stage i and ii soil salt was rapidly leached to groundwater owing to the lf as high as 42 6 and the mra in all treatments were zero when the irrigation stage iii began the ece 40 basically increased as the smp thresholds decreased from 5kpa to 25kpa which was caused by the correspondingly decreasing lf and increasing mra the inter annual salt dynamics indicated that the average ece values in different soil layers were negatively linear correlated to the smp thresholds a salt equilibrium state was formed in the 80 120 cm soil layer when the smp threshold was set larger than 10kpa and a similar state was formed in the 40 80 cm soil layer when the smp threshold was set between 20 to 10kpa the mras in all treatments and ec of groundwater decreased with the reclaiming years indicating the whole experimental area was in a desalinization process as the multi stage irrigation scheduling continued this improved drip irrigation scheduling showed that the lf and mra were controlled by the smp thresholds and thus account for the excellent performance in short time salt leaching and long run salt controlling regardless of the differences of climate conditions and soil texture in different areas setting smp threshold of 5kpa in stage ii to rapidly leach all soil salt into groundwater and 20kpa in stage iii to gradually drainage the salt and keep salt balance was recommended for ecological restoration in areas similar to that in this study declaration of

9597,the drip irrigation scheduled by different soil matric potential smp thresholds at different stages according to soil water and salt management purposes was usually adopted for revegetation in saline alkali land to reveal the desalinization mechanism of this multi stage drip irrigation scheduling a 3 year field trial adopting this method for revegetation was conducted in an arid saline area the trial consisted of 5 irrigation treatments marked s1 s5 with their smp that monitored directly under drip emitter at 0 2 m depth correspondingly controlled higher than 5 10 15 20 and 25kpa results showed the smp threshold of 5kpa during the unified irrigation stage induced a leaching fraction lf of 42 6 and a minimum recharge amount mra from groundwater of zero thus resulting the relative desalinization rate rdr of 91 8 in 0 120 cm soil layer when treatment applied the average electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extracts ece in 0 40 cm among three growing seasons in s1 s5 treatments linearly increased from 0 90 to 1 73ds m as smp threshold decreased from 5 to 25kpa resulting from the lf correspondingly decreasing from 18 4 to 2 5 and the mra increasing from 0 to 21 4 mm the inter annual salt dynamic indicated a salt equilibrium state was formed in 80 120 cm soil layer when the smp threshold was set higher than 10kpa and that was formed in 40 80 cm soil layer if the smp threshold was set between 20 and 15kpa this study found the smp threshold controlled the lf and mra and eventually determined the dynamics of soil salinity which explained the efficient desalinization mechanism under the multi stage drip irrigation scheduling a key smp threshold of 5kpa for rapid soil leaching stage and that of 20kpa for precise salt regulating stage were recommended for vegetation construction in the low lying saline area keywords saline soil drip irrigation scheduling revegetation leaching fraction 1 introduction the problem of soil salinization is ever increasing due to poor irrigation and drainage practices in some semi arid and arid zones with high evapotranspiration rates and high watertable munns 2002 2005 in these areas salinization occurs due to the upward movement and evaporation of saline groundwater when the groundwater depth is within 2 m white 2006 the yinchuan plain distributed along both sides of the yellow river is one of the most ancient irrigated areas in china and is deeply troubled by the soil salinization on the one hand the abundant flooding irrigation water maintains the agricultural prosperity for over 2000 years however on the other hand the watertable is raised and salinity is increased in some low lying edges of the plain due to the large amounts of drainage wang et al 1993 xiong et al 1996 reducing the soil salinity and lowering the watertable by proper practices are important issues in the similar low lying areas all over the world drip irrigation applies water precisely and uniformly at high frequencies reduces drainage through precise irrigation scheduling and maintains high soil water potential to facilitate water uptake by the plant roots being the most efficient irrigation method for reclaiming salt affected soils goldberg et al 1976 hanson et al 2009 kang 1998 wan et al 2007 the drip irrigation scheduled by tensiometer is worldwide adopted for the cultivation of crops and vegetables because it is precise in monitoring the soil matric potential smp that directly related to the water uptake by plant root and is also convenient for the field operation kang et al 2004 klein 2004 phene et al 1989 tensiometers buried at a depth of 20 cm exactly under drip emitters for the annual plant and depths of both 20 and 50 cm for the perennial plant are efficient for the water and salt management when applied to saline soil reclamation kang et al 2012 2004 wan et al 2012 using this drip irrigation scheduling method studies have found that soil environment improved a lot in 2 3 years in a semi humid area in northeast china liu et al 2011 conducted a 2 year field experiment for a perennial pasture cultivation under smp initiated drip irrigation in heavily soda saline alkali soil in which they found that the highest salt leaching efficiency occurred when smp higher than 10kpa after 2 years the drip irrigation combined with a gravel sand layer was effective to construct vegetation during the reclamation of coastal saline alkali soil and the smp higher than 5kpa was recommended for drip irrigation scheduling during first 3 years sun et al 2012 in recent years the multi stage drip irrigation for perennial vegetation construction in saline soil has been proved efficient for example chen et al 2015 came up with a three stage drip irrigation scheduling for rosa chinensis cultivation in the coastal saline soil based on the salt leaching process and plant response in which the smp thresholds of 5kpa 10kpa and 20kpa for the first the second and the third year respectively were recommended for triggering irrigation based on a 3 year field experiment dong et al 2021 also suggested the smp thresholds of 5kpa 10kpa and 20kpa for the first 3 years were very helpful for leaching and controlling soil salt and maintaining plant growth the results above indicated that the drip irrigation triggered by certain smp thresholds were efficient for saline soil reclamation but the leaching amounts which are very important for salt leaching and watertable controlling in low lying area were not well analyzed in present studies wang et al 2014 used the locate flux method to estimate the deep percolation at 120 cm depth in a field experiment that using the drip irrigation under plastic film for the cotton cultivation and they found the amounts of deep percolation decreased linearly from 18 to 3 mm when the controlled smp thresholds reduced from 5 to 25kpa within single growing season such small amounts of leaching water help with watertable controlling in the low lying areas but the leaching amounts and the amounts of groundwater recharge under drip irrigation remain unclear for perennial plants cultivation in low lying area with heavy salinity especially for those in semi arid or arid regions modeling method is used to help with a comprehensive understanding of water and salt dynamics under drip irrigation the steady state models were established several decades ago to set irrigation guidelines and are still widely used to assess the suitability of water for irrigation these guidelines were established to develop simple relationships between irrigation water salinity rootzone salinity and lf letey et al 2011 usually the average ece within rootzone and ec of irrigation water were functions of the lf for steady state models which was widely used for irrigation scheduling salinity controlling and yield estimation for its simplicity and convenience rhoades et al 1982 scs 1992 corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 the transient state hydrus model has also been widely used in field scale lila et al 2013 simunek et al 2008 skaggs et al 2004 however a better understanding on the root growth root distribution plant water uptake and soil texture is essential to predicting accuracy when modeling the salt dynamics using hydrus model roberts et al 2009 selim et al 2013 wallender et al 2007 moreover the salt dynamics are significantly affected by factors such as the groundwater dynamics plant leaf area index and irrigation regimes abliz et al 2016 lu et al 2015 scudiero et al 2014 monitoring these factors within a single growing season of the annual plant is accurate and feasible but it is difficult and costly for perennial plant over years thus this study carried a 3 year field experiment adopting the multi stage drip irrigation for vegetation construction in saline soil to mine the dynamic characteristics of soil salinity over the long period using the semi empirical and semi theoretical approach derived from steady state model and this study mainly focused on 1 analyzing the salt changes within growing season quantitatively 2 estimating the amounts of leaching and groundwater recharge and 3 revealing the desalinization mechanism under the improved drip irrigation scheduling 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the qingtongxia experimental station the same as dong et al 2020 from 2015 to 2017 the station 38º1 43 38º1 48 n 105º56 29 105º56 36 e is in wuzhong county the ningxia hui autonomous region china this area has temperate continental semi arid climate and the annual average temperature is 9 3 with the lowest and highest of 23 7 and 36 7 respectively the annual rainfall and the potential evaporation pe are around 260 mm and 2000 mm respectively the perennial average groundwater depth in this area is 1 2 m with ec of 20 ds m and ph of 8 5 before experiment the physical and chemical properties of the tested soil are showed in table 1 the 0 80 cm soil is sand and that in 80 120 cm is sandy loam the average phe and ece in 0 120 cm are 7 64 and 10 4ds m classified as heavily saline soil bao 2000 2 2 experimental design experimental treatments were described in detail in the author s former study dong et al 2020 five soil matric potential smp treatments marked with s1 s5 were set up with smp thresholds controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25kpa respectively exactly under drip emitters at both 0 2 m and 0 5 m each treatment consisted of 3 replications and there were 15 experimental plots in total which were in a random arrangement two tensiometers were buried exactly under drip emitters at 0 2 and 0 5 m in the second repeating plot in every treatment wrapped up by non saline loamy soil paste fig 1a to make sure the probes were in firm contact with the soil the irrigation of 5 treatments would be controlled by their matched smp thresholds once smp values of 0 2 or 0 5 m depths in a treatment reduced to smp threshold the treatment would be irrigated 10 mm water the amount of 10 mm water for single irrigation was more than 6 mm that adopted in semi humid areas by chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015a because extra water was needed for leaching salt and meeting more et in semi arid area 2 3 plot layout and the improved irrigation scheduling the saline soil was ridged by excavator at an interval of 4 m and the height of ridge was 0 8 m each plot had four 12 m long ridges and plants were planted on the top ridges the 2 year old poplar trees populus canadensis moench were planted in the transplanting hole at a space of 3 m five undershrub species were transplanted at a space of 1 5 m on two sides of one single ridge fig 1a the grass was sown in 5 rows on each ridge fig 1a all the plants were placed at a lateral separation of 0 1 m from drip tapes the experimental area was surrounded by 3 drainage ditches with depth of 1 5 m and width of 2 0 m and the planting details were described in the former study dong et al 2020 each treatment had an independent irrigation controller to irrigate 3 repeating plots there were 16 drip tapes on ridges and 4 drip tapes in furrows in each repeating plot with an area of 16 m 12 m drip tapes with emitter space of 0 3 m apart and discharge rate of 1 38 l h at 10 m water head were placed at an interval of 0 6 m on each top ridge fig 1 irrigation water was drawn from the yellow river with annually average ec of 0 86ds m ph of 7 95 and the irrigation water quality was introduced in a related study dong et al 2020 the improved irrigation scheduling was divided into 3 stages and the details were described in the author s former study dong et al 2020 the enhanced leaching stage stage i started immediately after plants were transplanted from 1 june 2015 to 6 june 2015 during which drip irrigation was conducted continuously for 5 days in all treatments based on previous study chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 wan et al 2012 the total irrigation water amount in stage i should be no less than 40 mm the conventional leaching stage stage ii started following stage i all treatments would receive 10 mm water if 2 out of 10 smp values fell below 5kpa stage ii lasted for at least 45 days from 7 june 2015 to 22 july 2015 to leach salt and ensure that all transplanted plants being established well the precise water and salt regulation stage stage iii was carried out as soon as stage ii was over after 23 july 2015 when the smp values of each treatment reduce to the matched smp threshold irrigation was conducted in that treatment in the first irrigation early may spring irrigation and last irrigation early november winter irrigation of one growing season the applied water for all treatments was the same and no less than 40 mm 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 smp the smp values monitored by tensiometers wst 2b waterstar beijing china at both 0 2 and 0 5 m depths in all treatments were recorded twice a day at 8 00 and 15 00 2 4 2 groundwater dynamics the depth and ec of groundwater were measured monthly through a pvc tube with holes drilled on the wall which was buried in the middle of the experimental area 2 4 3 soil sampling and ece soil samples were taken from each plot with an auger 4 cm diameter and 10 cm high according to the sampling sketch in fig 1b soil samples were collected when stage i and stage ii terminated and then collected at an interval of 1 2 months in stage iii of the first 2 years and at the beginning and the end of the third growing season all soil samples were air dried and sieved through 2 mm sieve three replicate soil samples mixed to one sample to make extract of saturated soil paste by standard method robbins and wiegand 1990 electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extracts ece was determined by a conductivity meter dds 11a yulong shanghai china the average ece of the whole profile was calculated as weighted average value that taking the distance and area as weight factors dong et al 2020 2 5 methods and models 2 5 1 leaching fraction estimation the leaching fraction lf is very important to salt leaching and controlling according to the section 15 irrigation in national engineering handbook scs 1992 the relationship between lf and the ratio of soil salinity within rootzones to salinity of irrigation water could be described by experience curves the empirical curve under high frequency irrigation condition such as drip irrigation could be expressed as the following equation rhoades et al 1982 1 lf 0 195 ec t ec i 2 95 where lf is the leaching fraction ect is the anticipated salt threshold within certain depth taking ece as the standard eci is the ec of irrigation water 2 5 2 groundwater recharge estimation the equation for the change in salt storage ss is the following asce 2011 2 δ s s d r c r d g c g d i c i s m s f d d c d s p s c where d water depths c salt concentration the subscripts r i g and d designate rain irrigation upward flow from groundwater and drainage respectively sm the salt dissolved from minerals in soil sf the salt added to soil as a fertilizer or amendment sp the salt precipitated and sc the salt removed in the harvested crop in this study the soil is sandy and the fertilizer for tree cultivation was negligible thus we assumed that there were no salt dissolve or precipitation no salt adding and removing in this study the eq 2 could be simplified to eq 3 3 δ s s d r c r d g c g d i c i d d c d the saturated soil pastes that determined the ece of soil samples were made in an approximate ratio of soil to water by weight as 5 3 in this study and the electrical conductivity ec of a solution is linearly correlated to its salt content when the ec is less than 20ds m asce 2011 white 2006 the salt content of rainfall is supposed to be zero thus the eq 3 can be replaced by eq 4 4 0 6d s ρ s δ ec e d g ρ g ec g d i ρ i ec i d d ρ d ec d where ds soil depth of the analyzing layer ρs soil bulk density ece changes of the average ece in the analyzing layer ec average ec supposing that the ρg ρi and ρd are equal to the density of pure water the total salt in applied water with leaching amount subtracted is stored in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the ec of leaching water was not less than that of the irrigation water then the minimum recharge amount mra from groundwater to 0 40 cm soil layer could be calculated by eq 5 5 mra 0 6d s ρ s δ ec e d i ec i d d ec d ec g 2 5 3 desalination simulation the gompertz equation was used to describe the processes of the developing things related to agriculture and chemistry anguelov et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 thus the gompertz equation was adopted to simulate the desalinization processes of different treatment 6 rdr a exp exp x x0 b where rdr is relative desalinization rate calculated as the decreased values divided by the initial value x is the total days of experiment a b and x0 are parameters 3 results 3 1 smp rainfall and irrigation daily smp changes of different treatments at 20 cm depth in the growing seasons from 2015 to 2017 are showed in fig 2 since all treatments received the same irrigation water at irrigation stage i and ii in 2015 smp values of all treatments were controlled between 5kpa and 10kpa and none obvious differences were found between treatments from 2015 6 15 to 2015 7 25 the smp dynamics at stage iii in three seasons had remarkable differences between treatments the smp in different treatments basically fluctuated around their corresponding thresholds and the fluctuation became more sharply as smp threshold becoming lower which is in accordance with the previous studies chen et al 2015 jiao and kang 2007 li et al 2015a obviously rainfalls increased smp values in all treatments black arrows and thus a couple of days would be taken to again reach the smp thresholds for the most of time without rainfalls smp values of all treatments were controlled around their thresholds very well and performed as they were anticipated the sum of applied water and rainfall sawr in table 2 showed that values of sawr in all treatments were the same 88 mm in the stage i and the same 386 mm in stage ii in 2015 values of sawr in s1 s5 gradually decreased from 417 to 123 mm in stage iii of 2015 and values in s1 s5 decreased from 732 to 257 mm in 2016 and from 971 to 426 mm in 2017 the sawr decreased as smp threshold decreased in all three growing seasons and the sawr in every treatment increased along with the increase of planting years and its ratio to that in s1 treatment also increased yearly as a result of tree growths year by year the prominent difference of winter irrigation between 2015 and 2016 could be attributed to the difference of soil moisture at the end of the two growing seasons 3 2 soil salinity and groundwater dynamics within growing seasons dynamics of ece in 0 40 cm soil layer ece 40 were shown in fig 3 the salt was leached sharply in all treatments in stage i and ii during which the average ece 40 reduced from 8 00 to 0 66 ds m within only 57 days the 474 mm applied water in these two stages table 2 played an important role in this efficient leaching when treatments conducted in stage iii in 2015 2017 the ece 40 value in s1 treatment kept stable and those in other treatments showed confirm increases along with time within single growing season the ece 40 increments table 3 basically increased as smp threshold decreased in 2015 and 2016 although increases of ece 40 were found in the third growing season stage iii in 2017 the increments were only 0 17 0 04 0 19 0 21 and 0 64 ds m for s1 s5 treatments which were less than the former two growing seasons the smp threshold that scheduled irrigation had prominent influence on salinity dynamics within growing season and the higher the smp threshold was set the less salt was built up by the way the sharp ece 40 drops in all treatments between the end of one growing season and the beginning of the next growing season would be attributed to the winter irrigation the groundwater dynamics fig 4 indicated that groundwater depth decreased from 1 6 m to 1 2 m after stage i and ii the elevation of the groundwater was caused by the 474 mm water for salt leaching in stage i and ii table 2 when treatments conducted in stage iii in 2015 the groundwater depth decreased gradually and remained around the initial 1 6 m in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the ec of groundwater before experiment was 20ds m and that increased to 35 9ds m in stage i and ii as a result of salt leaching then continuous decrease of groundwater salinity was found with the average ec values of 16 0 15 4 and 10 7ds m in the stage iii in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 the leaching fraction lf and groundwater recharge within growing seasons the lf that calculated by the eq 1 was shown in table 4 the lf in stage i and ii in 2015 was 42 6 and its corresponding leaching amount was 202 mm the lf showed differences among treatments during stage iii in 2015 lf values were 29 2 10 2 3 7 6 2 and 3 1 in s1 s5 treatments and their corresponding leaching amounts were 122 31 6 9 and 4 mm in this stage the situations of lf in both 2016 and 2017 were very similar to those in 2015 lf values and leaching amounts basically decreased as smp threshold decreased in both stage iii in 2016 and 2017 the average lf values in stage iii among three growing seasons were 18 4 8 0 4 8 3 8 and 2 5 with the correspondingly average leaching amounts of 114 39 19 10 and 6 mm in s1 s5 treatments the minimum recharge amounts mras from groundwater in table 5 calculated by eq 5 indicated that the mras from groundwater to 0 40 cm soil layer in stage i and ii in 2015 were zero in all treatments this might be attributed to the lf as high as 42 6 table 4 which caused a continuous and rapid decrease in soil salinity during this stage fig 3 the mras were 0 7 2 28 2 17 7 and 44 4 mm in treatments s1 s5 respectively in stage iii in 2015 which were in accordance with the increments of the ece during this stage table 3 during stage iii in 2016 the mras in s1 s3 were zero and those in s4 and s5 were 14 7 and 19 8 mm but those were zero in all treatments during stage iii in 2017 this indicated that the mras reduced with the reclaiming years and keeping the smp thresholds at 5 15 and 25kpa in stages iii of the first 3 years respectively could ensure that little saline groundwater recharging to the 0 40 soil layer 3 4 inter annual salt dynamics the rdr dynamics in different soil layers along time were showed in fig 5 during irrigation stage i and ii the salt was leached quickly with the rdr values of 90 80 and 70 for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm respectively by the end of stage ii the soil desalinization process became slow and sinusoidal shaking in stage iii the salt dynamics in 0 40 cm soil layer were strongly correlated to smp thresholds figs 5a and 6a as smp threshold decreased the rdr decreased and the average ece in stage iii in this soil layer increased linearly rdr values of all treatments fluctuated between years and the lower the smp thresholds the greater the amplitude fig 5a the temporal dynamic of rdr in 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5b was like those in 0 40 cm soil layer a linear relationship between ece and smp threshold was also found in this soil layer fig 6b the salt dynamics in this soil layer in treatments s3 and s4 exhibited a salt stable state while those in the other 3 treatments remained variable states the results suggested that keeping the smp thresholds at a range of 20 to 15kpa could formed a salt stable layer at 40 80 cm depths differences of temporal dynamics of salt in 80 120 cm soil layer fig 5c were found when compared with the former 2 soil layers the rdr at the beginning of growing seasons in this layer was less than that at the end of growing seasons revealing that the soil salt increased after non growing seasons in this soil layer a linear regression relationship between average ece and smp was also valid though the ece in s3 was abnormally high fig 6c the rdrs in treatment s1 and s2 kept stable along time in this layer suggesting a smp range of 10 to 5kpa could form a salt stable layer at 80 120 cm depths rdr values in ridge slope kept stable in all treatments in stage iii and the temporal dynamics of salt could be simulated by gompertz equation fig 5d however the ece decreased at first and then increased as smp decreased fig 6d which was different from that in 0 120 cm soil layers above rdr values in the whole soil profile of different treatments along time were simulated by eq 6 the salts in all treatments were leached quickly in stage i and stage ii and gradually became stable along time in irrigation stage iii except s3 treatment fig 7 the simulation results table 6 indicated that the stable rdr decreased as smp thresholds decreased with values of 81 84 75 06 67 77 and 64 69 for s1 s2 s4 and s5 the stable ece values for s1 s2 s4 and s5 were 1 89 2 60 3 36 and 3 82 ds m respectively classified as non saline soil based on classification criteria richards 1954 to be noted the rdr in treatment s3 didn t seem to be stable along time and had a tendency of salt accumulation in the whole soil profile along time which was in accordance with the salt dynamics in 80 120 cm fig 5c and fig 6c and ridge slope fig 5d and fig 6d soil layers 4 discussion 4 1 the efficiency of the improved drip irrigation scheduling for salt reclamation the leaching requirement lr is of vital importance to the soil salinity control in the irrigated areas in arid or semi arid region the lr was defined as the fraction of infiltrated water that must pass through the rootzone to keep average rootzone soil salinity from exceeding a level that would significantly reduce crop yield assuming steady state conditions with associated good management and uniformity of leaching usda 1954 the lr is calculated by the product of the applied water amount and the leaching fraction lf the lf is calculated by the ratio of the ec of the irrigation water to that of the drainage water or other empirical equations asce 2011 when developing an irrigation scheduling for salt control the accurate et must be known asce 2011 white 2006 usually the et is estimated by the fao 56 penman monteith method and its accuracy is influenced by the diversities of the climatic zones and ground conditions dhungel et al 2014 tadesse et al 2018 thus the lf calculation based on an estimated et would cause prominent difference between the actual lf and the designed lf asce 2011 the drip irrigation for the salt reclamation in this study is scheduled by the smp threshold and the et is no need to be estimated though the lf was not intentionally designed for the drip irrigation scheduled by the smp threshold in this study the lf did exist and reduced as the smp threshold decreased the multi stage drip irrigation scheduling showed high efficiency in the salt leaching in stages i and ii with the lf as high as 42 6 and salt control in stage iii thus compared with the traditional irrigation scheduling for salt control that calculates the lf and estimate the actual et this improved drip irrigation scheduling has advantages of simplicity convenience and accuracy and a certain leaching ratio is maintained if a proper smp threshold is determined in different irrigation stages the multi stage drip irrigation scheduling for salt reclamation has been widely used to saline soil reclamation among different climate regions in a semi arid coastal region li et al 2015b found that the irrigation scheduled by the smp thresholds at 5 and 15kpa in the first 2 years respectively could significantly decrease soil salinity and remain the 2 year survival rate higher than 80 when using the irrigation water with ec of 3 1ds m this prominent reclaiming effect might be attributed to the agronomy practice that setting a gravel sand layer at the upper boundary of the groundwater to reduce capillary action and the rich rainfall that higher than 500 mm yearly in the first year experiment of li et al 2015b the rainfall was as much as 883 mm because of which the irrigation frequencies were decreased and the total irrigation water amount was only 210 mm though the smp threshold was set at 5kpa table 7 in the second year the irrigation water amount was 45 mm more than the first year but the lf decreased from 18 26 to 3 12 when the smp threshold decreased from 5 to 15kpa the rainfall in the second year was 400 mm less than the first year which might be responsible for the lf difference between these 2 years the study of sun et al 2013 seemed supporting the positive effect of isolation layer on salt leaching table 7 they found that the ece within 0 40 cm was 1 5ds m and the lf was 39 16 when isolation layer was set while those were 4 4ds m and 1 64 when there was none isolation layer based on a 3 year experiment with a similar condition of li et al 2015b the study in this paper was in a semi arid region with annual rainfall around 110 mm and the soil was sandy which were quite different from the studies of li et al 2015b and sun et al 2013 the high ridge played a similar role of isolation layer to reduced capillary action and the increased irrigation amount could make up for the difference in rainfall between arid and humid regions thus lf around 13 and 3 could be maintained when smp threshold was set at 5 and 20kpa respectively in this study table 7 soil texture did not seem to have influences on lf when the appropriate agronomy practices were applied however the average ece in silt loam soil was basically larger than that in sandy soil table 7 the reason might be attributed to the differences of soil adsorption capacity for ions furthermore regardless of the differences of climate conditions and soil texture the total infiltrating water irrigation water rainfall was between 900 mm and 1100 mm when the smp threshold was set at 5 kpa and the lf greater than 2 could be maintained when the smp threshold was set at 20kpa this indicated that the drip irrigation scheduled by smp threshold was efficient in saline soil reclamation and it was little affected by the diversities of climate types and soil textures under the conditions that the key smp thresholds were determined and the proper agronomy practices such as isolation layer or ridging were adopted 4 2 the fate of salt under the improved drip irrigation in the long run generally field capacity fc corresponds to smp between 5 and 10kpa for well structured soils the smp at fc is set at 5kpa whereas for others it is set at 10kpa cavazza et al 1973 white 2006 in this study smps in treatment s1 5kpa and s2 10kpa were basic higher than the smp at fc 10kpa for most of the time thus the soil water in these two treatments would keep a trend of downward movement and a salt equilibrium state could be formed in 80 120 cm soil layer fig 5c for treatments s3 15kpa and s4 20kpa the smps would be less than the smp at fc 10kpa until irrigation was conducted the salt equilibrium state was formed in 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5b in these two treatments as for treatment s5 25kpa there was no salt equilibrium state formed in 0 120 cm soil layer this indicated that when the smp threshold was set larger than 20kpa salt could be controlled at an equilibrium state in 40 120 cm depth and the threshold larger the depth deeper this raised a question that what was the fate of the original soil salt the groundwater dynamics fig 4 suggested that the groundwater depth decreased and the ec increased drastically during the irrigation stage i and ii owing to the lf of 42 6 table 4 then during the stage iii the groundwater depth gradually increased and kept stable around 165 cm and the ec of groundwater kept a firmly decreasing trend with a decrease from the 35ds m at the beginning to the 12ds m at the end the groundwater dynamics explained that the soil salt was leached quickly to the groundwater during the leaching stage i and ii and then the salt was gradually transported to the out zone of the experimental area through lateral groundwater discharge in a comprehensive consideration of the soil salt dynamics and groundwater dynamics the key smp thresholds of 5kpa in stage ii and 20kpa in stage iii were essential to ensure salt leaching and external transfer which was in accordance with the result of dong et al 2020 to be noted the inter annual salt dynamics suggested that the average salt within 0 120 cm depth in s3 15kpa treatment tended to increase along time fig 7 which was different from the rest treatments with equilibrium state the salt increments in 80 120 cm soil layer fig 5c and soil layer in slope fig 5d mainly accounted for this phenomenon the similar result of salt distribution in s3 was also reported by the author s former study in another experiment dong et al 2021 they believed that the tree in the medium moisture conditions e g s3 treatment had deeper roots greater coverage and thus more water absorption by roots in deep soil than those in low moisture conditions e g s4 and s5 thus the salt in 80 120 cm soil layer and ridge slope was more easily affected by capillary action in s3 than s4 and s5 once the water was absorbed by deep root under this circumstance intentionally setting a relatively low smp threshold in irrigation stage iii following the salt leaching stage i and ii would be important to avoid salt building up again in deep soil layer in these low lying areas with saline groundwater using tensiometer scheduling drip irrigation induced high irrigation frequency which raised a very important question that how much applying water was needed to maintain the prosperity of plantation forests based on the first 3 year s data if the smp threshold was set at 5kpa for stage ii and 20kpa for stage iii the applying water amounts were correspondingly 921 430 and 541 mm for the first 3 years which almost met the et 525 mm of healthy development of a sparse woodland in an arid region yang and yang 1988 gou et al 2017 conducted a willow forest establishing experiment in a same area as this study finding that yearly applying 1800 mm water combined with ditches arranged at 9 m intervals in field was efficient to leach salt and ensure the establishment of the willow forest the yearly 1800 mm water would raise the water table in the long run on the one hand and increase water consumption pressure to the water shortage area on the other hand as compared the yearly applied water under multi stage drip irrigation in this study was less than one third of that of flood irrigation except in the first year which saved more than 1200 mm available water yearly when compared with flood irrigation 5 conclusion the improved drip irrigation scheduling consisted of the enhanced leaching stage i the conventional leaching stage ii and the precise water and salt regulating stage iii was proved to be efficient in salt leaching and controlling during the irrigation stage i and ii soil salt was rapidly leached to groundwater owing to the lf as high as 42 6 and the mra in all treatments were zero when the irrigation stage iii began the ece 40 basically increased as the smp thresholds decreased from 5kpa to 25kpa which was caused by the correspondingly decreasing lf and increasing mra the inter annual salt dynamics indicated that the average ece values in different soil layers were negatively linear correlated to the smp thresholds a salt equilibrium state was formed in the 80 120 cm soil layer when the smp threshold was set larger than 10kpa and a similar state was formed in the 40 80 cm soil layer when the smp threshold was set between 20 to 10kpa the mras in all treatments and ec of groundwater decreased with the reclaiming years indicating the whole experimental area was in a desalinization process as the multi stage irrigation scheduling continued this improved drip irrigation scheduling showed that the lf and mra were controlled by the smp thresholds and thus account for the excellent performance in short time salt leaching and long run salt controlling regardless of the differences of climate conditions and soil texture in different areas setting smp threshold of 5kpa in stage ii to rapidly leach all soil salt into groundwater and 20kpa in stage iii to gradually drainage the salt and keep salt balance was recommended for ecological restoration in areas similar to that in this study declaration of

freshwater is an essential factor underlying food production because its supply directly determines the capacity of the agricultural sector to produce food for humans damerau et al 2019 currently however most world regions face water resource limitations rosa et al 2020 owing to the uneven spatial distribution of water resources across the globe water quality degradation induced by anthropogenic activities and rapid growth of water consumption due to agricultural domestic and industrial use dalin et al 2017 ma et al 2020 freshwater shortage has become a serious risk to global food security a tremendous challenge confronting humankind today is the fact that liquid freshwater covers less than 1 of the earth s surface and only 0 006 of all freshwater is usable by humans dudgeon 2019 since agricultural irrigation accounts for the largest part 70 of total global water withdrawal chen et al 2019 it is critical to apply water saving irrigation wsi technologies in order to minimize freshwater consumption during crop production among various wsi technologies alternate partial root zone irrigation apri has received considerable attention in the last two decades owing to its positive effect on either water use efficiency wue or crop productivity kang and zhang 2004 du et al 2008 pedrero et al 2014 adu et al 2018 khaleghi et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 apri is a highly efficient irrigation technique which requires that only half of the rooting zone is irrigated at each irrigation event while the remaining half is exposed to drying condition and that the wetted and dried sides are alternated in a frequency according to crop types growing stages and soil water conditions kang and zhang 2004 adu et al 2018 this technique holds great potential to decrease water use by plants enhance canopy vigor improve nitrogen use efficiency and increase fruit quality as compared to normal irrigation methods du et al 2008 liu et al 2020 jia et al 2021 these benefits have been sufficiently proven in addition to the application of wsi technology irrigation with saline water is also an efficient method that has been widely used to reduce freshwater use during crop production li et al 2019 khaleghi et al 2020 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 despite the global freshwater scarcity there are large amounts of saline water e g 13 0 billion m3 of saline groundwater and 85 4

maize alfalfa wheat cotton strawberry potato and tomato if appropriate management practices are followed li et al 2019 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 moreover an apparent benefit of saline water irrigation is its positive effects on the nutritional components in fruits li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 however since most agricultural crops are generally sensitive to salinity continuous saline

niu et al 2018 singh et al 2020 to maximize the effectiveness of grafting the grafting method adopted in this study is double root grafting drg in which grafted plants retain both rootstock root and scion root for more details see materials and methods little information is available regarding the probable consequences of saline water utilization under apri for economically important crops in addition few studies have been done to assess whether grafting can enhance irrigation water productivity under apri conditions due to the benefits of grafting on abiotic stress tolerance in plants we hypothesize that grafted plants will exhibit higher levels of salinity adaptability compared to self rooted plants under saline water irrigation grafting is also hypothesized to enhance the wue of irrigation water under apri conditions to test these hypotheses we focused on tomato solanum lycopersicum l an economically important crop having a worldwide distribution gao et al 2019 and makes a substantial nutritional contribution to the human diet in most freshwater scarce regions of the world zhu et al 2018 this crop is generally characterized by a long growing period and high levels of water consumption here we conducted an experimental trial under greenhouse conditions over two years to investigate the effects of drg on tomato production under apri with freshwater or saline water the efficiencies of various strategies were comprehensively evaluated by simultaneously measuring nutrient uptake plant growth crop yields fruit quality and root zone properties the main objectives of this study were i to examine whether drg can promote irrigation water efficiency in terms of crop yields and water productivity under apri with either freshwater or saline water and ii to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying drg induced enhancements of water productivity and fruit yields under saline water irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experiment design the

tomato plants were grown twice in two successive cropping years the proper lifespan of the plant is 135 days due to the restriction of climate conditions on plant growth the plants were grown only once in a cropping year for drg plants eggplant solanum melongena l torvum brenes et al 2020 and tomato solanum lycopersicum l xiangfei no 3 were used as rootstock and scion respectively the selected eggplant variety was more resistant to salinity than the tomato variety used here based on a preliminary test of plant salinity tolerance the tomato seedling was grafted with the eggplant seedling by using the tongue approach grafting method as described in lee et al 2010 notably both rootstock root and scion root were retained in drg plants in order to maximize the effectiveness of grafting under abiotic stress for plants subjected to apri twenty days after transplanting half of the root system was watered to 95 water holding capacity whc while the other half was allowed to dry until the water content reached 45 whc then the irrigation was shifted between the two root system compartments the characteristics of freshwater and saline water are presented in table s1 and those of the growth substrate are shown in table s2 methods used to measure these characteristics are provided in the section 2 5 both freshwater and saline water used in this study were artificially produced based on the actual characteristics of local water and the water characteristics were the same at every irrigation the local freshwater had an electrical conductivity ec of 0 42 ms cm 1 with respect to the local saline water its ec was 3 51 ms cm 1 table s1 and had exceeded the threshold salinity of tomato 2 50 ms cm 1 chinnusamy et al 2005 the saline water contained 0 052 g l 1 kcl 1 045 g l 1 k2so4 0

plant 1 day 1 depending on the plant growth stage and environmental conditions the irrigation frequency and amount for each treatment are listed in table s3 to meet nutrient requirement of plants each plot received the same fertilizers for the amounts of fertilizers see table s4 the experimental design was a completely randomized block design with three blocks and five treatments factors in the block for a total of fifteen plots per year each plot was 4 9 m 1 5 m when tomato seedlings had three true leaves they were pruned so that each plant had three branches of similar height and diameter sr and drg seedlings with three branches were transplanted on cultivation furrows 30 cm height 50 cm diameter 490 cm length by applying the single row planting pattern at a spacing of 27 cm within row and 150 cm between rows resulting in the planting density of 2 3 plants m 2 equal to 6 9 branches m 2 during the first twenty days after transplanting all seedlings were irrigated with freshwater in order to ensure their survival and normal growth 2 2 plant parameters after transplanting 35 day old seedlings ten plants were labelled randomly from each replicate plot to measure plant parameters in each cropping year the plant height and leaf area were measured every two weeks and then used to calculate the relative growth rate rgr according to the equation rgr lnq 2 lnq 1 t 2 t 1 where q 2 and

analysis as described in zhang et al 2020 to comprehensively evaluate the tomato fruit quality a fruit quality index fqi was calculated by integrating key fruit quality kfq indicators as described in

subjected to analysis of variance anova carried out by spss 19 0 spss inc chicago usa one way anova was applied to compare sr apri fw with sr ci fw in order to evaluate the impact of apri on plant parameters and substrate properties then the four treatments subjected to apri i e sr apri fw drg apri fw sr apri sw and drg apri sw were treated as a 2 facorial design to demonstrate the impact of drg under standard freshwater and salinity saline water conditions using two way anova with the factors grafting g salinity s and the interaction of g s once the anova showed a significant f value p 0 05 multiple comparisons were done among treatments using the tukey s test radar charts were employed to visualize parameters associated with plant nutrient uptake and fruit quality based on the normalization of all parameters using the corresponding values under sr ci fw or sr apri fw 3 results 3 1 plant growth rate and leaf photosynthetic indices the rgrs of plant height and leaf area are indicative of plant growth these two rgrs were significantly p 0 05 decreased by the application of apri sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 2a under apri conditions the plant height rgr was significantly affected by grafting g and salinity s in 2020 and by g and the g s interaction in 2021 while the leaf area rgr was affected by g and the g s interaction in 2020 and by g and s in 2021 all p 0 05 table 1 generally these two rgrs were positively affected by the application of drg in specific the drg apri fw treatment significantly p 0 05 increased plant height rgr in 2020 and leaf area rgr in 2021 as compared to sr apri fw while the drg apri sw treatment significantly p 0 05 increased plant rgr in all situations as compared to sr apri sw fig 2a b these results suggest that drg plants had a greater capacity than sr plants in the promotion of plant growth under apri conditions similar to the rgr all leaf photosynthetic indices were significantly p 0 05 reduced by the application of apri sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 2c and table s5 demonstrating the restriction of apri on leaf photosynthesis in sr plants under apri conditions most leaf photosynthetic indices were significantly influenced by g s except for e in 2020 and the g s interaction except for pn and ci in 2020 all p 0 05 table 1 particularly the leaf photosynthetic rate pn was enhanced by drg apri fw as compared to sr apri fw and by drg apri sw as compared to sr apri sw in both 2020 and 2021 fig 2c although pn was significantly p 0 05 decreased by saline water in drg plants under apri in 2021 drg apri sw vs drg apri fw it was still higher in drg plants than in sr plants under saline water condition drg apri sw vs sr apri sw these results infer that drg was capable of enhancing leaf photosynthesis under apri with either freshwater or saline water the intercellular co2 concentration ci stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate e were generally increased by drg apri fw as compared to sr apri fw table s5 moreover gs and e in 2020 and ci in 2021 were promoted by drg apri sw as compared to sr apri sw 3 2 plant cations cation ratios and nutrient uptake application of apri resulted in changed concentration of cations na k and ca2 in plants specifically the sr apri fw treatment significantly increased shoot na and root ca2 in 2020 and shoot na and root k in 2021 and decreased root na in 2021 fig 3a under apri conditions plant cations in both shoots and roots were significantly p 0 05 influenced by g except for shoot k and root k in 2020 s except for shoot ca2 in 2021 and their interaction except for shoot na in 2021 and root ca2 in 2020 and 2021 in most situations table 1 in general the na concentrations in both shoots and roots were increased by saline water irrigation under apri sr apri sw vs sr apri fw drg apri sw vs drg apri fw fig 3a interestingly however root na was apparently higher under the drg apri sw treatment than under the sr apri sw treatment a reverse trend was observed in terms of shoot na these results imply that plant type drg vs sr influenced the distribution of na concentrations among roots and shoots under saline water irrigation and that drg plants exhibited a strong capacity to stimulate na accumulation in roots rather than shoots in contrast to plant na the k concentration was decreased in roots but was increased in shoots by drg apri sw compared to sr apri sw fig 3a similarly the ca2 concentration in shoots was significantly higher in drg apri sw compared to sr apri sw in 2021 both k na and ca2 na ratios were generally decreased in shoots but increased in roots by apri application sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 3b the differences in plant na k and ca2 among treatments subjected to apri led to significant effects of g except for shoot ca2 na in 2021 and s on the k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues all p 0 001 table 1 in particular both k na and ca2 na ratios were generally reduced in either shoots or roots by saline water irrigation under apri conditions sr apri sw vs sr apri fw drg apri sw vs drg apri fw fig 3b however these negative effects of saline water could be reduced though not always by the application of drg plants in particular when compared to sr apri sw drg apri sw showed higher k na and ca2 na ratios in shoots in both 2020 and 2021 fig 3b suggesting that drg plants might be more efficient than sr plants in mitigating saline water induced na toxicity in plants under apri with saline water the shoot na root na ratio is indicative of na translocation from roots to shoots this ratio was always maintained lower in drg plants than sr plants fig 3b further demonstrating the remarkable ability of drg plants to suppress na translocation to shoots under saline water irrigation overall apri saline water irrigation and drg application had either positive or negative impacts on nutrient uptake in plans fig 3c consequently it was hard to find a general trend for nutrient uptake in plants especially in

biomass fruit yields and water productivity crop productivity related parameters i e plant biomass fruit yield and water productivity exhibited various responses to apri in general the root biomass and fruit yield were significantly decreased while the water productivity wp was increased by apri in both experimental years compare sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 4 under apri conditions crop productivity related parameters were significantly affected by g s and the g s interaction except for root biomass in 2021 and fruit yield and wp in 2020 all p 0 001 table 1 saline water irrigation decreased shoot biomass in sr plants in both 2020 and 2021 compare sr apri sw vs sr apri fw and that in drg plants in 2020 compare drg apri sw vs drg apri fw under apri conditions fig 4 however when compared to sr apri sw drg apri sw increased shoot biomass in both 2020 and 2021 implying that drg alleviated the adverse effects of saline water on shoot growth under apri conditions the fruit yield and water productivity wp were reduced by saline water irrigation in either sr plants compare sr apri sw vs sr apri fw or drg plants drg apri sw vs drg apri fw under apri conditions in spite of this both fruit yield and wp were significantly increased by drg apri fw as compared to sr apri fw and by drg apri sw as compared to sr apri sw in both experimental years suggesting that drg enhanced irrigation water efficiency under apri conditions 3 4 fruit quality parameters and overall fruit quality in contrast to fruit yield most fruit quality related parameters were promoted by apri application fig 5a resulting in significantly higher fqi a measure of overall fruit quality under sr apri fw as compared to sr ci fw fig 5b under apri conditions fruit quality related parameters were mainly influenced by g s and their interaction in 2020 p 0 05 table 1 specifically irrigation with saline water resulted in higher contents of total soluble sugar lactose d sorbitol glucose and sucrose in 2020 compare sr apri sw vs sr apri fw and compare drg apri sw vs drg apri fw fig 5a however drg application decreased lactose l rhamnose d sorbitol trehalose d fructose glucose and sucrose

compared to sr apri fw and by drg apri sw compared to sr apri sw in 2020 but not in 2021 fig 5b 3 5 root zone substrate properties most salinity related properties e g ec na na and sar measured at the root zone were significantly p 0 05 influenced by g except for ec in 2020 and na in 2021 and s table 1 moreover the ec was significantly affected by the g s interaction in both experimental years overall salinity related properties ec na and sar were increased by saline water irrigation in the root zone of either sr or drg plants under apri conditions in both 2020 and 2021 compare sr apri sw

other substrate properties i e na cations and anions under different treatments are presented in table s6 overall na ca2 so4 2 and cl generally showed ascending trends in the root zone under saline water irrigation 4 discussion water saving irrigation and irrigation with saline water are currently two inevitable agricultural practices in regions suffering from freshwater shortage damerau et al 2019 hussain et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 although apri has been widely demonstrated to be a highly efficient water saving irrigation technique kang and zhang 2004 du et al 2008 liu et al 2020 recently a global scale meta analysis showed that crop yields were remarkably lower under apri than under full irrigation cheng et al 2021 the reduction in the fruit yield under apri fig 4b could be explained by water deficit stress induced by apri ghafari et al 2020 clearly our present study revealed that the application of drg enhanced crop yields under apri conditions fig 4b the improvement of root system was probably the most direct consequence of drg application under apri fig 4a it has been well demonstrated that apri was more conducive to fruit trees compared with vegetables and crops because of the more developed root system of fruit trees du et al 2005 adu et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 this infers that it is possible to increase crop yields under apri through improving the root system of a crop therefore drg induced enhancements of root system contributed to plant adaptability to water deficit under apri conditions adu et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 actually the influence of the root system on crop yields could be attributed to nutrient uptake by roots and nutrient triggered shoot growth kumar and dey 2011 robinson et al 2018 clearly drg plants had either higher levels of nutrient uptake or more vigorous shoot growth than sr plants under apri conditions figs 2 and 3 thus for a given crop species or cultivar although it has a relatively stable response to water stress nemeskéri and helyes 2019 choudhary et al 2020 its adaptability to water deficit can be enhanced by the application of drg in addition to water deficit stress salinity stress also occurred in plants when saline water was used for irrigation figs 2 4 clearly irrigation with saline water led to na accumulation in the shoots of sr plants fig 3b since shoot na plays a determining role in salinity tolerance in plants niu et al 2017 elevated levels of na concentration in shoots have detrimental impacts on plant growth and cause a decrease in crop yields kumar and khare 2016 however shoot na accumulation was efficiently inhibited by the application of drg fig 3a this could be because i the salt tolerant rootstock of drg plants had a remarkable ability to limit the transport of na to above ground parts estan et al 2005 fig 3b and ii drg plants had a vigorous root system to transport water to the shoot system fernández garcía et al 2002 gao et al 2015 singh et al 2020 it was noted that drg plants generally exhibited higher shoot k na under apri with saline water fig 3b it is well established that shoot k na plays an important role in plant salt tolerance since k homeostasis is critical for a broad range of metabolic processes in cells singh et al 2020 taken as a whole these findings validated our first hypothesis that is that when irrigated with saline water drg application can alleviate salinity stress in plants under apri with saline water although the benefits of grafted plants in terms of salt stress mitigation were closely associated with cations nutrient uptake was a non negligible factor leading to the difference in salinity alleviating efficiency between grafted and non grafted plants fernández garcía et al 2002 yang et al 2013 our results clearly showed that the drg plants reduced the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on the uptake of most nutrients in shoots fig 3c since reduced nutrient mobilization is one of the major factors leading to poor plant growth under salinity stress li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 the drg induced enhancement in plant salt tolerance could be attributed partly to the high nutrient adsorbing capacity of the rootstock root of drg plants singh et al 2020 this could be partly supported by the results reported by yang et al 2013 who found that the application of grafting could enhance short term salt tolerance by improving ion metabolism affecting nutrient absorption in roots moreover the higher level of nutrient uptake in drg plants could also be confirmed by their vigorous root system having a remarkable capacity to transport water and nutrient to the shoot system fernández garcía et al 2002 as expected results from the present study confirmed our second hypothesis that grafting is capable of enhancing the wue of irrigation water under apri fig 4b although apri and saline water irrigation can induce water deficit stress and salinity in the root zone li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 the consequence of this was an apparent adverse effect on sr plant but not drg plants fig 4 this implies that the drg plants were more adaptive to apri than the sr plants this could be explained by the fact that the salt tolerant rootstock of grafted plants has a remarkable ability to adapt to abiotic stresses estan et al 2005 penella et al 2017 singh et al 2020 indeed drg plants had a vigorous root system to transport water to above ground parts fig 4a resulting in higher levels of abiotic stress tolerance than sr plants fernández garcía et al 2002 gao et al 2015 to comprehensively evaluate plant response to abiotic stresses our present study emphasized the importance of effects of root zone properties on fruit yield and quality it was noted that apri application reduced fruit yield but enhanced fqi an index used to reflect the overall quality of fruits figs 4 and 5b the enhanced overall fruit quality could be due to either reduced water content or increased nutritional components in fruits li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 in contrast drg application increased fruit yield but lowered fqi under apri conditions in 2020 presumably the trade off between crop yield and fruit quality was an apparent phenomenon for plants interestingly however this phenomenon did not occur for drg plants in 2021 fig 5b in other word drg application increased fruit yield without reducing fqi under apri conditions notably drg application increased not only tomato fruit yields but also water productivity under apri conditions thus drg application can be used to increase tomato yields without a remarkable decrease in fruit quality under apri conditions 5 conclusions apri increased water productivity and fruit quality but decreased plant growth and tomato fruit yields in sr plants under fresh water irrigation saline water irrigation reduced both water productivity and fruit yields in sr plants under apri conditions however the application of drg plants efficiently enhanced water productivity and fruit yields under apri with either freshwater or saline water overall drg was a suitable method for enhancing irrigation water efficiency and reducing the negative effects of saline water on tomato yields while simultaneously maintaining fruit quality table 2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9598,since most world regions face freshwater fw shortages water saving irrigation and irrigation with saline water sw are currently two inevitable agricultural practices for crop production however these two practices generally have adverse effects on crop yields in this study we investigated the effects of double root grafting drg on plant growth crop yields tomato quality and root zone properties under alternate partial root zone irrigation apri with fw or sw self rooting sr drg conventional irrigation ci apri fw and sw were considered in the experimental design to create treatments that included i sr ci fw ii sr apri fw iii drg apri fw iv sr apri sw and v drg apri sw the drg used here is a tongue approach grafting method in which grafted plants retain both rootstock eggplant root and scion tomato root in order to maximize the effectiveness of grafting under abiotic stress the tested salinity level was 3 51 ms cm 1 which had exceeded the threshold salinity of tomato 2 50 ms cm 1 in general apri application increased water productivity by 22 2 35 6 but decreased fruit yields by 9 1 18 8 in sr plants sr apri fw vs sr ci fw however under apri conditions drg plants showed higher rate of plant growth and less salinity damage as compared to sr plants application of drg significantly p 0 05 increased tomato fruit yields by 7 9 17 2 under standard conditions drg apri fw vs sr apri fw and by 14 2 27 4 under salinity conditions drg apri sw vs sr apri sw taken together double root grafting enhanced irrigation water efficiency and reduced the adverse effects of saline water on tomato yields under alternate partial root zone irrigation graphical abstract ga1 keywords freshwater shortage water saving irrigation low quality water grafted plants tomato yields 1 introduction freshwater is an essential factor underlying food production because its supply directly determines the capacity of the agricultural sector to produce food for humans damerau et al 2019 currently however most world regions face water resource limitations rosa et al 2020 owing to the uneven spatial distribution of water resources across the globe water quality degradation induced by anthropogenic activities and rapid growth of water consumption due to agricultural domestic and industrial use dalin et al 2017 ma et al 2020 freshwater shortage has become a serious risk to global food security a tremendous challenge confronting humankind today is the fact that liquid freshwater covers less than 1 of the earth s surface and only 0 006 of all freshwater is usable by humans dudgeon 2019 since agricultural irrigation accounts for the largest part 70 of total global water withdrawal chen et al 2019 it is critical to apply water saving irrigation wsi technologies in order to minimize freshwater consumption during crop production among various wsi technologies alternate partial root zone irrigation apri has received considerable attention in the last two decades owing to its positive effect on either water use efficiency wue or crop productivity kang and zhang 2004 du et al 2008 pedrero et al 2014 adu et al 2018 khaleghi et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 apri is a highly efficient irrigation technique which requires that only half of the rooting zone is irrigated at each irrigation event while the remaining half is exposed to drying condition and that the wetted and dried sides are alternated in a frequency according to crop types growing stages and soil water conditions kang and zhang 2004 adu et al 2018 this technique holds great potential to decrease water use by plants enhance canopy vigor improve nitrogen use efficiency and increase fruit quality as compared to normal irrigation methods du et al 2008 liu et al 2020 jia et al 2021 these benefits have been sufficiently proven in addition to the application of wsi technology irrigation with saline water is also an efficient method that has been widely used to reduce freshwater use during crop production li et al 2019 khaleghi et al 2020 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 despite the global freshwater scarcity there are large amounts of saline water e g 13 0 billion m3 of saline groundwater and 85 4 million m3 of saline lakes extensively distributed on the earth gleick and palaniappan 2010 gude 2017 theoretically saline water has the potential to provide available water for a number of crops e g maize alfalfa wheat cotton strawberry potato and tomato if appropriate management practices are followed li et al 2019 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 moreover an apparent benefit of saline water irrigation is its positive effects on the nutritional components in fruits li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 however since most agricultural crops are generally sensitive to salinity continuous saline water irrigation can easily lead to a decrease in crop yields majeed and muhammad 2019 at present approximately 30 crop species provide 90 of plant based human food most of which display severe yield losses average reduction 50 80 under conditions of moderate salinity ec 4 8 ds m 1 zörb et al 2019 therefore irrigation with saline water needs to be accompanied by other complementary measures introduced to enhance plant adaptability to salt stress pass among various pass enhancing strategies grafting is known as one of the most effective pathways regarding its positive effect on crop salt resistance penella et al 2017 singh et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that pass enhancement by grafting is closely associated with several physiological and molecular mechanisms e g limiting the transport of sodium and chloride from roots to shoots estan et al 2005 enhancing nutrient absorption in roots by regulating ion metabolism yang et al 2013 improving photosynthesis and antioxidant

niu et al 2018 singh et al 2020 to maximize the effectiveness of grafting the grafting method adopted in this study is double root grafting drg in which grafted plants retain both rootstock root and scion root for more details see materials and methods little information is available regarding the probable consequences of saline water utilization under apri for economically important crops in addition few studies have been done to assess whether grafting can enhance irrigation water productivity under apri conditions due to the benefits of grafting on abiotic stress tolerance in plants we hypothesize that grafted plants will exhibit higher levels of salinity adaptability compared to self rooted plants under saline water irrigation grafting is also hypothesized to enhance the wue of irrigation water under apri conditions to test these hypotheses we focused on tomato solanum lycopersicum l an economically important crop having a worldwide distribution gao et al 2019 and makes a substantial nutritional contribution to the human diet in most freshwater scarce regions of the world zhu et al 2018 this crop is generally characterized by a long growing period and high levels of water consumption here we conducted an experimental trial under greenhouse conditions over two years to investigate the effects of drg on tomato production under apri with freshwater or saline water the efficiencies of various strategies were comprehensively evaluated by simultaneously measuring nutrient uptake plant growth crop yields fruit quality and root zone properties the main objectives of this study were i to examine whether drg can promote irrigation water efficiency in terms of crop yields and water productivity under apri with either freshwater or saline water and ii to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying drg induced enhancements of water productivity and fruit yields under saline water irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experiment design the experimental site is located at the agricultural research center of ningxia university in yinchuan city latitude 38 51 n and longitude 106 14 e at an altitude of 1112 m above mean sea level ningxia china ningxia belongs to the high mountain regions of northwestern china hmrnc and is the main distribution area of saline groundwater in the hmrnc where most areas are characterized by serious freshwater shortage the climate in the study area is a semi arid temperate continental climate with the annual average precipitation of approximately 166 4 mm and the mean annual potential evaporation of about 1583 2 mm the annual average temperature of the study site was 9 5 c with the monthly mean temperature ranged from 7 7 in january the coldest month to 27 8 in july the warmest month over the course of a year in addition the yearly average solar radiation was 5 1 kw h m 2 day and the total yearly radiation period was approximately 3039 h year 1 the experiment was carried out in a multi tunnel glasshouse from february 2020 to october 2021 including two successive cropping years self rooting sr double root grafting drg conventional irrigation ci alternate partial root zone irrigation apri freshwater fw and saline water sw were considered in the experimental design to create treatments that included i sr ci fw ii sr apri fw iii drg apri fw iv sr apri sw and v drg apri sw fig 1 tomato plants were grown twice in two successive cropping years the proper lifespan of the plant is 135 days due to the restriction of climate conditions on plant growth the plants were grown only once in a cropping year for drg plants eggplant solanum melongena l torvum brenes et al 2020 and tomato solanum lycopersicum l xiangfei no 3 were used as rootstock and scion respectively the selected eggplant variety was more resistant to salinity than the tomato variety used here based on a preliminary test of plant salinity tolerance the tomato seedling was grafted with the eggplant seedling by using the tongue approach grafting method as described in lee et al 2010 notably both rootstock root and scion root were retained in drg plants in order to maximize the effectiveness of grafting under abiotic stress for plants subjected to apri twenty days after transplanting half of the root system was watered to 95 water holding capacity whc while the other half was allowed to dry until the water content reached 45 whc then the irrigation was shifted between the two root system compartments the characteristics of freshwater and saline water are presented in table s1 and those of the growth substrate are shown in table s2 methods used to measure these characteristics are provided in the section 2 5 both freshwater and saline water used in this study were artificially produced based on the actual characteristics of local water and the water characteristics were the same at every irrigation the local freshwater had an electrical conductivity ec of 0 42 ms cm 1 with respect to the local saline water its ec was 3 51 ms cm 1 table s1 and had exceeded the threshold salinity of tomato 2 50 ms cm 1 chinnusamy et al 2005 the saline water contained 0 052 g l 1 kcl 1 045 g l 1 k2so4 0

season irrigated water was applied by the drip system consisting of a water flow meter a screen filter pressure gauges valves and thin wall drip tapes the irrigation amount ranged from 0 25 to 0 86 l plant 1 day 1 depending on the plant growth stage and environmental conditions the irrigation frequency and amount for each treatment are listed in table s3 to meet nutrient requirement of plants each plot received the same fertilizers for the amounts of fertilizers see table s4 the experimental design was a completely randomized block design with three blocks and five treatments factors in the block for a total of fifteen plots per year each plot was 4 9 m 1 5 m when tomato seedlings had three true leaves they were pruned so that each plant had three branches of similar height and diameter sr and drg seedlings with three branches were transplanted on cultivation furrows 30 cm height 50 cm diameter 490 cm length by applying the single row planting pattern at a spacing of 27 cm within row and 150 cm between rows resulting in the planting density of 2 3 plants m 2 equal to 6 9 branches m 2 during the first twenty days after transplanting all seedlings were irrigated with freshwater in order to ensure their survival and normal growth 2 2 plant parameters after transplanting 35 day old seedlings ten plants were labelled randomly from each replicate plot to measure plant parameters in each cropping year the plant height and leaf area were measured every two weeks and then used to calculate the relative growth rate rgr according to the equation rgr lnq 2 lnq 1 t 2 t 1 where q 2 and q 1 present the plant height or leaf area at t 2 and t 1 respectively gent 2017 for the analysis of leaf photosynthesis a fully expanded illuminated and healthy leaf was selected from each plant to

states coupled to a transparent leaf chamber li et al 2019 the leaves selected to measure photosynthesis were the same lifetime and long term leaves once the final fruit harvest was completed plants were sampled separated into roots stems and leaves and then used to measure plant biomass nutrient content and ion concentration for the measurement of plant biomass plant samples were washed with deionized water and then oven dried to a constant weight at 85 these oven dried tissue samples were ground and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve in order to further analyze nutrient and ion concentration total n content was measured using the dumas method horneck and miller 1998 and total p k ca mg s cu fe mn zn and mo contents were determined after acidic digestion followed by analysis by the inductivity coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes jones et al 1991 the concentrations of soluble cations k na and ca2 were analyzed by the methods described in walker and bernal 2008 furthermore the ratios of k na and ca2 na in plant tissues were calculated to reflect plant salt tolerance ashraf 2004 the ratio of shoot na to root na was also calculated to reflect na translocation from roots to shoots porcel et al 2016 2 3 fruit yield and water productivity tomato fruits were picked and weighed to obtain fruit yield during the harvest period following conventional harvest practices in each cropping year irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated according to the equation iwp y e cabello et al 2009 where y and e are the tomato fruit yield kg ha 1 and the irrigation water amount m3 ha 1 respectively 2 4 fruit quality and overall fruit quality assessment for the determination of fruit quality forty fresh tomato fruits were randomly selected and sampled from each replicate plot when daily fruit production was high these fresh fruits were used to determine fruit quality parameters including total soluble solid by an atago n1 refractometer aoac 1984 total soluble sugar by the anthrone colorimetric method spiro 1966 vitamin c by the 2 6 dichloroindophenol titrimetric method aoac 1984 and organic acid by the potentiometric titration method rouphael

analysis as described in zhang et al 2020 to comprehensively evaluate the tomato fruit quality a fruit quality index fqi was calculated by integrating key fruit quality kfq indicators as described in yan et al 2021 briefly every observation of each kfq indicator was converted into a 0 1 scale to obtain the indicator score s and then used to calculate fqi according to the equation fqi σ i 1 n s i where y i is the indicator score for variable i the higher fqi was assumed as the better overall quality of tomato fruits 2 5 root zone substrate properties the growth substrates were sampled in the root zone after the final harvest in each cropping year a total of six cores 3 5 cm diameter 30 cm depth were randomly collected near crop roots in each replicate plot and then used to determine substrate properties the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined in water soluble extract by using a ph meter fe28 mettler toledo shanghai china and an ec meter fe30 mettler toledo shanghai china respectively as described in qu et al 2020 water soluble cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 cl hco3 and co3 2 were measured by the methods described in rowell 1994 sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated according to the equation sar c na c ca c mg 2 1 2 where c na c ca and c mg are the concentrations of na ca2 and mg2 in mmol kg 1 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova carried out by spss 19 0 spss inc chicago usa one way anova was applied to compare sr apri fw with sr ci fw in order to evaluate the impact of apri on plant parameters and substrate properties then the four treatments subjected to apri i e sr apri fw drg apri fw sr apri sw and drg apri sw were treated as a 2 facorial design to demonstrate the impact of drg under standard freshwater and salinity saline water conditions using two way anova with the factors grafting g salinity s and the interaction of g s once the anova showed a significant f value p 0 05 multiple comparisons were done among treatments using the tukey s test radar charts were employed to visualize parameters associated with plant nutrient uptake and fruit quality based on the normalization of all parameters using the corresponding values under sr ci fw or sr apri fw 3 results 3 1 plant growth rate and leaf photosynthetic indices the rgrs of plant height and leaf area are indicative of plant growth these two rgrs were significantly p 0 05 decreased by the application of apri sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 2a under apri conditions the plant height rgr was significantly affected by grafting g and salinity s in 2020 and by g and the g s interaction in 2021 while the leaf area rgr was affected by g and the g s interaction in 2020 and by g and s in 2021 all p 0 05 table 1 generally these two rgrs were positively affected by the application of drg in specific the drg apri fw treatment significantly p 0 05 increased plant height rgr in 2020 and leaf area rgr in 2021 as compared to sr apri fw while the drg apri sw treatment significantly p 0 05 increased plant rgr in all situations as compared to sr apri sw fig 2a b these results suggest that drg plants had a greater capacity than sr plants in the promotion of plant growth under apri conditions similar to the rgr all leaf photosynthetic indices were significantly p 0 05 reduced by the application of apri sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 2c and table s5 demonstrating the restriction of apri on leaf photosynthesis in sr plants under apri conditions most leaf photosynthetic indices were significantly influenced by g s except for e in 2020 and the g s interaction except for pn and ci in 2020 all p 0 05 table 1 particularly the leaf photosynthetic rate pn was enhanced by drg apri fw as compared to sr apri fw and by drg apri sw as compared to sr apri sw in both 2020 and 2021 fig 2c although pn was significantly p 0 05 decreased by saline water in drg plants under apri in 2021 drg apri sw vs drg apri fw it was still higher in drg plants than in sr plants under saline water condition drg apri sw vs sr apri sw these results infer that drg was capable of enhancing leaf photosynthesis under apri with either freshwater or saline water the intercellular co2 concentration ci stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate e were generally increased by drg apri fw as compared to sr apri fw table s5 moreover gs and e in 2020 and ci in 2021 were promoted by drg apri sw as compared to sr apri sw 3 2 plant cations cation ratios and nutrient uptake application of apri resulted in changed concentration of cations na k and ca2 in plants specifically the sr apri fw treatment significantly increased shoot na and root ca2 in 2020 and shoot na and root k in 2021 and decreased root na in 2021 fig 3a under apri conditions plant cations in both shoots and roots were significantly p 0 05 influenced by g except for shoot k and root k in 2020 s except for shoot ca2 in 2021 and their interaction except for shoot na in 2021 and root ca2 in 2020 and 2021 in most situations table 1 in general the na concentrations in both shoots and roots were increased by saline water irrigation under apri sr apri sw vs sr apri fw drg apri sw vs drg apri fw fig 3a interestingly however root na was apparently higher under the drg apri sw treatment than under the sr apri sw treatment a reverse trend was observed in terms of shoot na these results imply that plant type drg vs sr influenced the distribution of na concentrations among roots and shoots under saline water irrigation and that drg plants exhibited a strong capacity to stimulate na accumulation in roots rather than shoots in contrast to plant na the k concentration was decreased in roots but was increased in shoots by drg apri sw compared to sr apri sw fig 3a similarly the ca2 concentration in shoots was significantly higher in drg apri sw compared to sr apri sw in 2021 both k na and ca2 na ratios were generally decreased in shoots but increased in roots by apri application sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 3b the differences in plant na k and ca2 among treatments subjected to apri led to significant effects of g except for shoot ca2 na in 2021 and s on the k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues all p 0 001 table 1 in particular both k na and ca2 na ratios were generally reduced in either shoots or roots by saline water irrigation under apri conditions sr apri sw vs sr apri fw drg apri sw vs drg apri fw fig 3b however these negative effects of saline water could be reduced though not always by the application of drg plants in particular when compared to sr apri sw drg apri sw showed higher k na and ca2 na ratios in shoots in both 2020 and 2021 fig 3b suggesting that drg plants might be more efficient than sr plants in mitigating saline water induced na toxicity in plants under apri with saline water the shoot na root na ratio is indicative of na translocation from roots to shoots this ratio was always maintained lower in drg plants than sr plants fig 3b further demonstrating the remarkable ability of drg plants to suppress na translocation to shoots under saline water irrigation overall apri saline water irrigation and drg application had either positive or negative impacts on nutrient uptake in plans fig 3c consequently it was hard to find a general trend for nutrient uptake in plants especially in

biomass fruit yields and water productivity crop productivity related parameters i e plant biomass fruit yield and water productivity exhibited various responses to apri in general the root biomass and fruit yield were significantly decreased while the water productivity wp was increased by apri in both experimental years compare sr apri fw vs sr ci fw fig 4 under apri conditions crop productivity related parameters were significantly affected by g s and the g s interaction except for root biomass in 2021 and fruit yield and wp in 2020 all p 0 001 table 1 saline water irrigation decreased shoot biomass in sr plants in both 2020 and 2021 compare sr apri sw vs sr apri fw and that in drg plants in 2020 compare drg apri sw vs drg apri fw under apri conditions fig 4 however when compared to sr apri sw drg apri sw increased shoot biomass in both 2020 and 2021 implying that drg alleviated the adverse effects of saline water on shoot growth under apri conditions the fruit yield and water productivity wp were reduced by saline water irrigation in either sr plants compare sr apri sw vs sr apri fw or drg plants drg apri sw vs drg apri fw under apri conditions in spite of this both fruit yield and wp were significantly increased by drg apri fw as compared to sr apri fw and by drg apri sw as compared to sr apri sw in both experimental years suggesting that drg enhanced irrigation water efficiency under apri conditions 3 4 fruit quality parameters and overall fruit quality in contrast to fruit yield most fruit quality related parameters were promoted by apri application fig 5a resulting in significantly higher fqi a measure of overall fruit quality under sr apri fw as compared to sr ci fw fig 5b under apri conditions fruit quality related parameters were mainly influenced by g s and their interaction in 2020 p 0 05 table 1 specifically irrigation with saline water resulted in higher contents of total soluble sugar lactose d sorbitol glucose and sucrose in 2020 compare sr apri sw vs sr apri fw and compare drg apri sw vs drg apri fw fig 5a however drg application decreased lactose l rhamnose d sorbitol trehalose d fructose glucose and sucrose

root zone were significantly p 0 05 influenced by g except for ec in 2020 and na in 2021 and s table 1 moreover the ec was significantly affected by the g s interaction in both experimental years

other substrate properties i e na cations and anions under different treatments are presented in table s6 overall na ca2 so4 2 and cl generally showed ascending trends in the root zone under saline water irrigation 4 discussion water saving irrigation and irrigation with saline water are currently two inevitable agricultural practices in regions suffering from freshwater shortage damerau et al 2019 hussain et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 although apri has been widely demonstrated to be a highly efficient water saving irrigation technique kang and zhang 2004 du et al 2008 liu et al 2020 recently a global scale meta analysis showed that crop yields were remarkably lower under apri than under full irrigation cheng et al 2021 the reduction in the fruit yield under apri fig 4b could be explained by water deficit stress induced by apri ghafari et al 2020 clearly our present study revealed that the application of drg enhanced crop yields under apri conditions fig 4b the improvement of root system was probably the most direct consequence of drg application under apri fig 4a it has been well demonstrated that apri was more conducive to fruit trees compared with vegetables and crops because of the more developed root system of fruit trees du et al 2005 adu et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 this infers that it is possible to increase crop yields under apri through improving the root system of a crop therefore drg induced enhancements of root system contributed to plant adaptability to water deficit under apri conditions adu et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 actually the influence of the root system on crop yields could be attributed to nutrient uptake by roots and nutrient triggered shoot growth kumar and dey 2011 robinson et al 2018 clearly drg plants had either higher levels of nutrient uptake or more vigorous shoot growth than sr plants under apri conditions figs 2 and 3 thus for a given crop species or cultivar although it has a relatively stable response to water stress nemeskéri and helyes 2019 choudhary et al 2020 its adaptability to water deficit can be enhanced by the application of drg in addition to water deficit stress salinity stress also occurred in plants when saline water was used for irrigation figs 2 4 clearly irrigation with saline water led to na accumulation in the shoots of sr plants fig 3b since shoot na plays a determining role in salinity tolerance in plants niu et al 2017 elevated levels of na concentration in shoots have detrimental impacts on plant growth and cause a decrease in crop yields kumar and khare 2016 however shoot na accumulation was efficiently inhibited by the application of drg fig 3a this could be because i the salt tolerant rootstock of drg plants had a remarkable ability to limit the transport of na to above ground parts estan et al 2005 fig 3b and ii drg plants had a vigorous root system to transport water to the shoot system fernández garcía et al 2002 gao et al 2015 singh et al 2020 it was noted that drg plants generally exhibited higher shoot k na under apri with saline water fig 3b it is well established that shoot k na plays an important role in plant salt tolerance since k homeostasis is critical for a broad range of metabolic processes in cells singh et al 2020 taken as a whole these findings validated our first hypothesis that is that when irrigated with saline water drg application can alleviate salinity stress in plants under apri with saline water although the benefits of grafted plants in terms of salt stress mitigation were closely associated with cations nutrient uptake was a non negligible factor leading to the difference in salinity alleviating efficiency between grafted and non grafted plants fernández garcía et al 2002 yang et al 2013 our results clearly showed that the drg plants reduced the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on the uptake of most nutrients in shoots fig 3c since reduced nutrient mobilization is one of the major factors leading to poor plant growth under salinity stress li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 the drg induced enhancement in plant salt tolerance could be attributed partly to the high nutrient adsorbing capacity of the rootstock root of drg plants singh et al 2020 this could be partly supported by the results reported by yang et al 2013 who found that the application of grafting could enhance short term salt tolerance by improving ion metabolism affecting nutrient absorption in roots moreover the higher level of nutrient uptake in drg plants could also be confirmed by their vigorous root system having a remarkable capacity to transport water and nutrient to the shoot system fernández garcía et al 2002 as expected results from the present study confirmed our second hypothesis that grafting is capable of enhancing the wue of irrigation water under apri fig 4b although apri and saline water irrigation can induce water deficit stress and salinity in the root zone li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 the consequence of this was an apparent adverse effect on sr plant but not drg plants fig 4 this implies that the drg plants were more adaptive to apri than the sr plants this could be explained by the fact that the salt tolerant rootstock of grafted plants has a remarkable ability to adapt to abiotic stresses estan et al 2005 penella et al 2017 singh et al 2020 indeed drg plants had a vigorous root system to transport water to above ground parts fig 4a resulting in higher levels of abiotic stress tolerance than sr plants fernández garcía et al 2002 gao et al 2015 to comprehensively evaluate plant response to abiotic stresses our present study emphasized the importance of effects of root zone properties on fruit yield and quality it was noted that apri application reduced fruit yield but enhanced fqi an index used to reflect the overall quality of fruits figs 4 and 5b the enhanced overall fruit quality could be due to either reduced water content or increased nutritional components in fruits li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 in contrast drg application increased fruit yield but lowered fqi under apri conditions in 2020 presumably the trade off between crop yield and fruit quality was an apparent phenomenon for plants interestingly however this phenomenon did not occur for drg plants in 2021 fig 5b in other word drg application increased fruit yield without reducing fqi under apri conditions notably drg application increased not only tomato fruit yields but also water productivity under apri conditions thus drg application can be used to increase tomato yields without a remarkable decrease in fruit quality under apri conditions 5 conclusions apri increased water productivity and fruit quality but decreased plant growth and tomato fruit yields in sr plants under fresh water irrigation saline water irrigation reduced both water productivity and fruit yields in sr plants under apri conditions however the application of drg plants efficiently enhanced water productivity and fruit yields under apri with either freshwater or saline water overall drg was a suitable method for enhancing irrigation water efficiency and reducing the negative effects of saline water on tomato yields while simultaneously maintaining fruit quality table 2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9599,subsurface tile drainage while necessary for viable agricultural crop production in the humid poorly drained regions of the world has been linked to offsite nutrient transport culminating in harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in downstream waterbodies drainage water management dwm also known as controlled drainage has been promoted as a method to reduce nitrogen n and phosphorus p loss from field scale tile drainage however subsequent changes in surface runoff and associated water quality have not been explored four years of surface and subsurface discharge n and p loss from two sets of paired field sites in northwest ohio usa were evaluated using a before after control impact baci design to quantify the impact of dwm mean event surface runoff was greater significant at one site under dwm while tile drainage discharge was less at both sites but not significant there was no significant difference in surface nitrate n no3 n loss however significant reductions in tile no3 n loss under dwm were measured at both sites similar to discharge dissolved reactive p drp loss measured in surface runoff was greater under dwm significant at one site while no significant differences were noted in mean event tile drainage drp loss total p tp surface runoff losses were significantly greater under dwm at the site with significantly greater surface runoff while dwm reduced tile drainage tp loss at only one site these findings suggest that dwm reduced tile no3 n loss while also highlighting that any benefit from dwm with respect to tile drp or tp loss could be negated in part by increased surface losses furthermore these findings emphasize the need to understand the natural resource concern to which the practice is targeted and also call for additional research on dwm

that quantify the impacts of dwm on discharge and water quality in both subsurface tile and surface runoff pathways are limited the objective of this study was to determine the impact of dwm on field scale surface and subsurface discharge n and p losses from two sets of paired field sites in the usda ars edge of field eof network in ohio usa specifically the hypothesis was that surface discharge and surface nutrient losses would increase under dwm 2 methods and materials 2 1 eof site descriptions and management two paired field sites from the usda ars eof network williams et al 2016a were identified to assess the impact of dwm on hydrology nitrate n no3 n drp and tp loss fig 1 the two sites were located in the northwest quadrant of ohio and representative of agricultural crop production in the region each site was comprised of two paired fields with distinct surface and subsurface drainage site a is located in the maumee river watershed and consists of two side by side fields the contributing areas for the surface and tile are identical and equivalent to 15 9 ha for the control field and 15 6 ha for the treatment i e impact field the dominant soils are classified as a very poorly drained hoytville silty clay with mean mehlich 3 soil test p of 58 mg kg in the control field and 48 mg kg in the treatment i e impact field the general cropping rotation includes corn zea mays l and soybean glycine max l with fertilizer generally applied as starter with corn minimal tillage and cover crops were also used supplemental table 1 however the cover crops did not or were sparsely established after planting both fields are systematically tile drained with a lateral spacing of 15 m at a 0 9 m depth dwm is generally implemented in winter and summer and managed to a depth 0 4 m from the ground surface fig 1c table 2 site b is located in the sandusky river watershed and the fields are also side by side but separated by a grassed waterway the contributing areas for the control and treatment i e impact fields are also distinct but vary in size the surface runoff contributing area in the control field is 4 3 ha while the tile drainage contributing area is 5 5 ha for the treatment i e impact field the surface runoff contributing area is 15 4 ha while the tile drainage contributing area is 18 6 ha the dominant soils on both fields are classified as the very poorly drained pewamo silty clay and the somewhat poorly drained bennington silt loam soil test p was 33 mg kg in the control field and 40 mg kg in the treatment i e impact field the general cropping rotation was corn and soybeans with fertilizer applied using variable rate technology vrt and incorporation prior to the corn crop rotational tillage supplemental table 1 both fields were systematically tile drained with a lateral spacing of 10 6 m at a 0 9 m depth as with site a drainage water was managed in the winter and summer using dwm structures with boards positioned at 0 4 m from the ground surface during management periods fig 1c table 2 2 2 data collection and analysis hydrology and water quality data were measured at both sites for site a the period of record included in the present study began with the 2015 water year wy 15 october 1 2014 through september 30 2015 and continued through the end of wy 19 for site b the period of record for this study began with wy 16 and also continued through the end of wy 19 hydrology data consisted of precipitation and discharge precipitation was measured at each location using an isco 674 tipping bucket precipitation gauge teledyne isco lincoln ne and a standard precipitation gauge novalynx corporation grass valley ca precipitation was recorded on a 10 min interval using the tipping bucket gauge event volumes were compared to bulk precipitation collected with the standard gauge and corrected for bias shedekar et al 2016 when there was a discrepancy in volume between the gauges surface and subsurface discharge was primarily calculated by measuring stage within a control volume and applying the appropriate stage discharge relationship control volumes at three of the four surface sites were 0 61 m h flumes tracom inc alpharetta ga while a 0 76 m h flume was installed at the fourth site similarly tile drainage was measured at three locations 2 tiles as site a and 1 tile at site b by observing the stage behind a 0 3 m compound weir insert thel mar llc brevard nc and applying the stage discharge relationship a 0 38 m compound weir was used at the fourth tile outlet site b stage was measured at all locations on a 10 minute time interval using an isco 4230 bubbler meter in each tile drain an isco 2150 area velocity sensor was also installed to facilitate discharge measurement when the pipe was submerged an isco 6712 automated water quality sampler was positioned adjacent to each control volume to facilitate water sample collection surface water samples were collected using a flow proportional approach a 200 ml aliquot was collected for every 1 mm volumetric depth of discharge measured at the control volume ten aliquots were composited into a 2 l polypropylene bottle to form a sample with respect to tile drainage and prior to 2015 a time proportional approach was used whereby four 200 ml aliquots were collected every six hours and composited to form a daily sample starting in 2015 additional event samples were collected when a predetermined change in stage was recorded 200 ml aliquots were collected and composited every 15 min to form a one hour event sample once additional event samples collection was initiated in 2015 the single day composite sample was lengthened to a two day composite by collecting and combining eight 100 ml aliquots every six hours samples were collected from the field on a near weekly basis and transported to the usda ars soil drainage research unit columbus oh wet chemistry lab for analysis water samples were vacuum filtered 0 45 µm and refrigerated at 4 c until analysis generally within 28 d concentrations of no3 n plus nitrite n hereafter no3 n and drp were determined colorometrically using flow injection analysis on a lachat instruments loveland co quikchem 8500 fia automated ion analyzer concentrations of no3 n were determined by the copperized cadmium reduction method and drp was determined by the ascorbic acid reduction method murphy and riley 1962 concentrations of tp were determined on unfiltered samples following alkaline persulfate oxidation patton and kryskalla 2003 and subsequent analysis of drp a near continuous concentration data set was constructed through linear interpolation williams et al 2015c between midpoints for each sample the resulting concentrations corresponding to the 10 min discharge time stamp were multiplied to develop a 10 min no3 n drp and tp load data set events were determined based on precipitation amount and defined as at least 6 35 mm of rainfall separated by six hours thus more than one event could occur in a day and an event that did not produce discharge could also occur in the cases where discharge was generated surface runoff event duration was set equal to the point when discharge ceased with regard to tile drainage the duration was set equal to the lesser of the time period between 1 when stage was within 5 of stage at the initiation of the event 2 discharge ceased 3 a new event began or 4 7 days data were then summed over the event duration to form event based discharge no3 n drp and tp data sets 2 3 statistical analysis a before after control impact baci design was used to examine the effect of dwm at both site a and site b because dwm was implemented in all fields prior to this study the control at each site represents a field where dwm ceased i e free drainage or fd during the after period and the impact site represents a field where drainage water management continued i e dwm during the after period the before period was wy 15 through wy 17 at site a and wy 16 through wy 17 at site b the after period at both sites was wy 18 through wy 19 a generalized linear mixed model glmm was used to determine the effect of dwm on event discharge and nutrient loads in surface runoff and subsurface drainage only precipitation events that produced a discharge response in at least one field were used in the analysis thus a small constant 1 10 5 was added to all response variable observations in order to retain events with zero discharge that may have been impacted by the treatment in each model the period before after treatment control impact and their interaction baci effect were defined as fixed effects while event i e sampling time was treated as a random effect a log link function with a gamma distribution was used to fit the non normal data to the glmm everitt 2005 the primary statistic of interest was the interaction term i e the baci effect which represents the differential change between the control and impact sites compared before and after the alteration of dwm practices a parametric bootstrap method was used to test for statistical significance of the baci effect in the pbkrtest package halekoh and hojsgaard 2014 bootstrapping is a technique used to obtain confidence intervals for glmm parameters from which p values from likelihood ratio tests can be calculated p values less than 0 05 were considered statistically significant analyses were conducted using the glmer function in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 in r r core team 2020 the baci contrast defined as the difference in means at the control site µcafter µcbefore minus the difference in means at the impact site µiafter µibefore was also calculated to further aid in interpretation the ci divergence which is the absolute value of the difference in means between the impact and control sites before the treatment µibefore µcbefore subtracted from the difference in means between the impact and control after the treatment µiafter µcafter was also calculated and indicates how dissimilar the control and impact sites were after the treatment chevalier et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and events precipitation across periods at both sites generally followed normal 30 yr average trends for this region with greater precipitation from april to july i e spring and summer compared to september through march i e fall and winter fig 1 notably spring and summer precipitation amounts during the present study often exceeded 30 year normal trends fig 1 except at site b where greater spring and summer precipitation were only measured in the final year of the after period greater spring and summer precipitation is consistent with future climate predictions that indicate warmer and wetter conditions during these periods u s global change research program 2017 which will likely complicate efforts to complete production management practices i e fertilization planting etc without continued use of artificial drainage systems in this region guo et al 2020 the number and magnitude of precipitation events varied between sites and periods table 3 at site a mean event precipitation was similar in the before 22 4 1 7 mm and after 23 3 1 5 mm periods table 3 however mean event precipitation at site b increased slightly between the before 19 8 1 3 mm and after 24 6 1 7 mm periods table 3 total rainfall at site a was greater in the before 2129 4 mm compared to the after 1935 4 mm period while total rainfall at site b was less in the before 1737 8 mm compared to the after 2313 7 mm period table 3 as the frequency and intensity of rainfall events increase in the midwest us u s global change research program 2017 it follows that nutrient loss dynamics will also be impacted robertson et al 2013 jarvie et al 2013 indeed a recent study of tile drains in northcentral ohio found that precipitation characteristics strongly controlled n and p loss hanrahan et al 2021 3 2 discharge there was a significant baci period x treatment effect pbtest 14 54 p 0 003 for surface discharge at site a the estimated mean of event surface discharge in the control field decreased from 0 03 to 0 01 mm while the estimated mean of event surface discharge increased in the impact field from 0 04 to 0 12 mm fig 2 the baci contrast was 0 09 0 06 mm table 4 though the ci divergence was positive 0 09 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before period in contrast the baci period x treatment effect was not significant at site b pbtest 3 10 p 0 18 suggesting that differences in surface discharge between the two periods were comparable for the control and impact fields while not significant trends indicated that the estimated mean of event surface runoff increased more from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control field fig 3 the ci divergence was also positive 0 14 suggesting that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period surface runoff under dwm from sites a and b tended to increase relative to the free drainage fd however only the increase at site a was statistically significant the discharge precipitation ratio over the period of record for surface runoff at site a was greater 13 compared to site b 4 suggesting that the influence of dwm was stronger at the location more likely to experience greater surface runoff after precipitation tile drain spacing was also greater at site a 15 m compared with site b 10 6 m which impacts the partitioning of surface runoff and tile drainage pathways tan and zhang 2011 previous studies have also found greater surface runoff under dwm treatments drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 shedekar et al 2021 largely because elevated water tables and increased antecedent moisture in the soil profile reduce the amount of precipitation that soils can store thereby increasing the potential for runoff via surface pathways drury et al 2009 shedekar et al 2021 ross et al 2016 summarized data from 12 field studies where surface runoff was measured and found that dwm increased surface runoff by 33 28 mm compared to fd in contrast no surface runoff was recorded from either fd or dwm plots during a 4 year study in sweden wesstrom and messing 2007 the baci period treatment effect was not significant for subsurface tile discharge at site a pbtest 2 47 p 0 21 or site b pbtest 1 85 p 0 30 trends show that the estimated mean of event tile discharge decreased more from the before to the after period in the impact field at site a compared to the control field fig 2 in contrast at site b the estimated mean of event tile discharge increased less between the before and after periods in the impact field compared to the control fig 3 the ci divergence was positive at both site a 0 20 and site b 0 64 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after relative to the before period dwm is a structural conservation practice that manipulates the outlet elevation of a drainage system which decreases subsurface tile discharge therefore its impacts on drainage volume are well documented the non significant reductions with respect to tile drainage discharge in the present study differ from previous studies in ohio fausey 2005 williams et al 2015b gunn et al 2015 and various states in the midwestern us e g helmers et al 2012 however the present study focused on the influence of dwm on tile discharge associated with precipitation events which may have underestimated the overall impact of dwm by excluding tile discharge that was not event driven indeed on field plots with similar soil texture silty clay loam and crop rotation corn soybean to the present study fausey 2005 found that dwm decreased subsurface tile drainage by approximately 40 compared to fd reductions in tile discharge associated with dwm range from 17 to 80 skaggs et al 2010 and one study of paired field sites in the western lake erie basin specifically found that dwm reduced tile discharge by 40 100 gunn et al 2015 the magnitude and direction of change in surface runoff and tile discharge under dwm may also be affected by other water budget components such as evapotranspiration et and seepage for example a simulation study by youssef et al 2018 for 48 sites across the midwestern u s showed an increase in et 5 or 27 mm yr 1 and vertical seepage 23 or 9 mm yr 1 under dwm compared to fd with a greater hydraulic gradient resulting from a potentially elevated water table under dwm the losses to lateral and vertical seepage can increase especially when fields are adjacent to large drainage ditches or other agricultural fields with free drainage systems lavaire et al 2017 shedekar et al 2021 3 3 nitrate n the baci period x treatment effect was not significant for surface no3 n loss at site a pbtest 2 49 p 0 22 or site b pbtest 2 91 p 0 17 trends indicate that the estimated mean of event surface no3 n load at site a decreased more in the impact field from the before to the after period compared to the control field fig 2 in contrast at site b the estimated mean of event surface no3 n load increased more in the impact field from the before to the after period compared to the control field fig 3 regardless of the trends event surface no3 n loads were extremely low and changes between periods were generally small regardless of direction i e 0 01 kg ha the lack of statistical significance and minimal changes demonstrate that surface no3 n loads were not strongly influenced by dwm in the present study previous work has similarly found that dwm did not significantly impact surface no3 n loads drury et al 2009 wang et al 2020 in tile drained landscapes no3 n concentrations in surface runoff are negligible compared to those in subsurface tile discharge e g woodley et al 2018 thus n loss in surface runoff is of less concern the baci period x treatment effect for subsurface tile no3 n load was significant at site a pbtest 14 53 p 0 003 and site b pbtest 50 67 p 0 001 at site a the estimated mean of event tile no3 n load decreased from 0 08 to 0 05 kg ha in the control field and from 0 08 to 0 03 kg ha in the impact field fig 2 thus event tile no3 n load decreased more from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control the baci contrast was 0 03 0 01 kg ha and the ci divergence was positive 0 02 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before at site b the estimated mean of event tile no3 n load increased from 0 02 to 0 15 kg ha in the control field and from 0 03 to 0 06 kg ha in the impact field fig 3 thus event tile no3 n load increased less from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control the baci contrast for site b was 0 10 0 03 kg ha and the ci divergence was positive 0 08 indicating that the control and impact fields were also more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before these results demonstrate that dwm significantly reduced tile no3 n loss compared to fd numerous previous studies have also reported that dwm decreased no3 n loss in subsurface drainage relative to fd drury et al 1996 wesstrom and messing 2007 helmers et al 2012 williams et al 2015b saadat et al 2018 though we know of no other study that has specifically focused on event driven no3 n loss generally reductions in tile no3 n loss are proportional to changes in drainage volume fausey 2005 skaggs et al 2010 shedekar et al 2021 because of the strong relationship between no3 n loadings and discharge williams et al 2015b hanrahan et al 2021 however some dwm studies have also noted decreased no3 n concentrations in the soil profile fisher et al 1999 increased rates of denitrification cartensen et al 2019 kliewer and gilliam 1995 and greater plant n uptake sunohara et al 2014 lesser concentrations due to increased denitrification are likely to occur under dwm when elevated water table depths create anaerobic soil conditions williams et al 2015a it is also important to note that other site specific parameters such as decomposable soil organic matter or carbon and soil temperature may affect denitrification williams et al 2015a thus soils with greater soil organic carbon are likely to experience greater reduction in concentrations under dwm in contrast cold winter temperatures likely limit the amount of denitrification under dwm and result in similar no3 n concentrations as those under fd indeed in a plot scale study in indiana saadat et al 2018 reported that 88 of drain flow during dwm occurred when the average soil profile temperature was less than 10 c they observed similar concentrations between dwm and fd likely due to the lack of denitrification under dwm at sites where dwm does not significantly affect the drainage outflow these site specific factors may affect the no3 n loss 3 4 dissolved reactive p the baci treatment x period effect was significant for surface drp loss at site a pbtest 12 65 p 0 009 the estimated mean of event surface drp load decreased from 0 03 to 0 01 g ha in the control field but increased from 0 03 to 0 15 g ha in the impact field the baci contrast was 0 13 0 00 and the ci divergence was positive 0 13 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before period in contrast the baci treatment x period effect was not significant for surface drp loss at site b pbtest 1 79 p 0 32 though trends suggested a greater increase in the estimated mean of event surface drp load from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control field fig 3 the ci divergence was also positive indicating that the control and impact sites were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period findings at both site a and b were consistent with patterns in surface discharge and suggests that changes in surface drp loss were principally driven by greater surface runoff in the fields where dwm was maintained though the trend for both runoff and drp was only significant in one of the two sites in a study in southern ontario canada tan and zhang 2011 also found that drp loss in surface runoff was greater from a site with controlled drainage than fd cumulative drp loss over the 5 year study period was 177 g ha from controlled drainage but only 21 3 g ha from fd tan and zhang 2011 surface runoff p concentrations tend to be greater than those associated with subsurface discharge in tile drained landscapes pease et al 2018 thus increases in surface runoff could potentially offset some or all p reduction benefits in tile drainage attributed to dwm implementation the baci period treatment effect for subsurface drp loss was not significant at site a pbtest 0 94 p 0 47 or site b pbtest 5 39 p 0 08 at site a trends suggested that the estimated mean of event tile drp load decreased less in the impact field relative to the control field the ci divergence value was negative 0 06 and indicated that the two fields were trending more similar in the after compared to the before period in contrast trends at site b suggested that the estimated mean of event tile drp load decreased more in the impact field relative to the control field fig 3 the ci divergence value was positive 0 51 which supports the finding that the two fields were more dissimilar in the after period these results suggest that dwm did not strongly influence event driven tile drp loss in the sites examined here discharge is the primary mechanism for p movement williams et al 2016b and the lack of significant differences in tile drp loss between dwm and fd in the present study may be explained by trends in tile flow i e no differences saadat et al 2018 also found that subsurface drp loads did not differ between dwm and fd plots in indiana in contrast numerous studies have demonstrated that dwm decreased tile drp loads relative to fd feser et al 2010 nash et al 2015 williams et al 2015 again largely associated with reductions in tile discharge the anaerobic soil conditions under dwm can create a reducing environment and increase the solubility and mobility of p within the soil profile and thus to the tiles mcdowell et al 2012 in contrast wahba et al 2001 suggests that the reduced conditions created under dwm do not remain in the soil profile long enough to cause significant p losses furthermore the potential for p loss is lesser from soils deeper in the soil profile the zone of influence most affected by dwm compared to topsoil thus changes in drp concentrations under dwm would be expected to minimally affect field scale drp losses in fields with normal vertical soil test phosphorus distributions i e greater concentrations at the surface and lesser concentrations in the subsoil 3 5 total p the baci period treatment effect for surface tp loss was significant at site a pbtest 12 65 p 0 009 but not at site b pbtest 2 15 p 0 22 the estimated mean of surface tp load decreased from 0 12 to 0 04 g ha in the control field but increased from 0 18 to 0 47 g ha in the impact field the baci contrast was 0 36 0 03 and the ci divergence was positive 0 36 demonstrating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period in contrast trends at site b show that the estimated mean of surface tp load increased more in the control field than the impact field fig 3 results from site a demonstrate that dwm increased event surface tp loss relative to fd likely due to greater surface runoff tan and zhang 2011 found that tp loss in surface runoff was greater from a site with dwm than fd cumulative tp loss over the 5 year study period was 301 7 g ha from dwm and 275 1 g ha from fd tan and zhang 2011 in contrast wang et al 2020 found no significant increase in surface tp loss with dwm the baci period treatment effect for subsurface tp loss was significant at only site b pbtest 7 12 p 0 04 the estimated mean of event tile tp load increased from 2 38 to 5 33 g ha in the control field and from 1 90 to 2 56 g ha in the impact field demonstrating that tile tp loss increased less in the impact field relative to the control the baci contrast was 2 29 0 01 and the ci divergence was positive 2 29 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period while not significant trends at site a suggested that the estimated mean of event tile tp load increased slightly between the before and after period in the control field but decreased in the impact field the ci divergence was positive 0 82 supporting the conclusion that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period the significant findings at site b and trends at site a demonstrate that dwm reduced tile tp loss compared to fd which is consistent with previous studies wesstrom et al 2001 wesstrom and messing 2007 feser et al 2010 tan and zhang 2011 the contrast between tile drp and tp results in the present study may be explained by the influence of dwm on particulate p pp which was not measured here previous research has shown that dwm decreased subsurface tp loads by substantially reducing pp loads tan and zhang 2011 however others have reported no significant influence of dwm on subsurface tp loads saadat et al 2018 one potential explanation is that during the periods of dwm the lower hydraulic gradient between the field water table and outlet elevation likely causes water to move at slower velocities through drainage systems compared to that under fd during these times of slow velocity more sediment will settle in the drain tiles however soon after lowering the outlet elevation the velocities are increased and any accumulated sediment is flushed out frankenberger et al 2007 3 6 watershed scale implications the results of the immediate study suggest that widespread dwm adoption and management across a watershed has the potential to significantly reduce subsurface no3 n loads which comprise the majority of watershed n losses in tile drained landscapes randall and gross 2001 in watersheds that feed coastal systems less n would decrease the extent of algal blooms paerl et al 2008 however p is primarily linked with algal blooms in freshwater systems and the impact of dwm on drp and tp loads in this study was more variable than n in fact results here suggest that dwm has the potential to partially or in whole negate any reductions in subsurface tile drainage drp and tp losses when surface contributions are considered nevertheless a benefit of changes in n loss relative to p with dwm may decrease n p ratios that subsequently reduce the toxicity of algal blooms in downstream freshwaters since studies have suggested that n controls algal bloom toxicity while p controls the bloom extent newell et al 2019 thus dwm should continue to be promoted as a practice to address subsurface tile no3 n loss however more research is needed to evaluate the effects of dwm on surface and subsurface p dynamics at sites with varying characteristics e g soil types management etc as well as strategies for combining stacking dwm with other in field and edge of field practices that may help achieve p reduction goals furthermore as programs and practices are developed that focus on nutrient reduction in tile drained landscapes it is paramount that the tradeoffs between n and p as well as surface and subsurface pathways are explored and understood prior to implementation otherwise unintended consequences may

9599,subsurface tile drainage while necessary for viable agricultural crop production in the humid poorly drained regions of the world has been linked to offsite nutrient transport culminating in harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in downstream waterbodies drainage water management dwm also known as controlled drainage has been promoted as a method to reduce nitrogen n and phosphorus p loss from field scale tile drainage however subsequent changes in surface runoff and associated water quality have not been explored four years of surface and subsurface discharge n and p loss from two sets of paired field sites in northwest ohio usa were evaluated using a before after control impact baci design to quantify the impact of dwm mean event surface runoff was greater significant at one site under dwm while tile drainage discharge was less at both sites but not significant there was no significant difference in surface nitrate n no3 n loss however significant reductions in tile no3 n loss under dwm were measured at both sites similar to discharge dissolved reactive p drp loss measured in surface runoff was greater under dwm significant at one site while no significant differences were noted in mean event tile drainage drp loss total p tp surface runoff losses were significantly greater under dwm at the site with significantly greater surface runoff while dwm reduced tile drainage tp loss at only one site these findings suggest that dwm reduced tile no3 n loss while also highlighting that any benefit from dwm with respect to tile drp or tp loss could be negated in part by increased surface losses furthermore these findings emphasize the need to understand the natural resource concern to which the practice is targeted and also call for additional research on dwm

significantly impacted christianson et al 2016 furthermore predicted climate shifts for the midwest us suggest greater spring rainfall volumes with greater intensities u s global change research program 2017 emphasizing the need to maintain efficient subsurface tile drainage systems for sustainable crop production however tile drainage has been identified as a major pathway for nitrogen n and phosphorus p delivery to surface waters randall and gross 2008 king et al 2015a impaired surface waters are common in the midwest us and a majority of the pollutant loading originates from tile drained agricultural landscapes between 50 and 80 of watershed nitrate n no3 n loads and approximately 50 of watershed p loss are attributed to tile drainage in artificially drained landscapes of the

associated with tile drainage various practices that strive to maintain crop production goals while minimizing environmental footprints have been proposed and investigated christianson et al 2016 sharpley et al 2019 peterson et al 2019 drainage water management dwm also known as controlled drainage is based on the concept of periodically raising the outlet elevation of a subsurface drain tile resulting in decreased discharge volumes skaggs et al 2012 fausey 2005 and n and p loads ross et al 2016 initially used to address subsidence issues in drained organic soils dwm has more recently been applied to address nitrate n no3 n transport in tile drainage skaggs et al 2012 and has been recommended and promoted as a practice to reduce p loss ohio phosphorus task force 2013 strock et al 2010 the effectiveness of dwm to address n and p in tile drainage has been shown to vary across landscapes regions and continents table 1 annual reported reductions in discharge ranged from 7 in ohio to 95 in sweden while reductions in no3 n loadings ranged from 8 in ohio to 100 in italy table 1 in contrast studies examining the impacts of dwm on p loading have reported mixed results with changes in dissolved reactive p drp loadings ranging from a 69 increase to a 100 reduction and changes in total p tp loadings ranging from no effect to 95 reductions table 1 however comprehensive assessments that quantify the impacts of dwm on discharge and water quality in both subsurface tile and surface runoff pathways are limited the objective of this study was to determine the impact of dwm on field scale surface and subsurface discharge n and p losses from two sets of paired field sites in the usda ars edge of field eof network in ohio usa specifically the hypothesis was that surface discharge and surface nutrient losses would increase under dwm 2 methods and materials 2 1 eof site descriptions and management two paired field sites from the usda ars eof network williams et al 2016a were identified to assess the impact of dwm on hydrology nitrate n no3 n drp and tp loss fig 1 the two sites were located in the northwest quadrant of ohio and representative of agricultural crop production in the region each site was comprised of two paired fields with distinct surface and subsurface drainage site a is located in the maumee river watershed and consists of two side by side fields the contributing areas for the surface and tile are identical and equivalent to 15 9 ha for the control field and 15 6 ha for the treatment i e impact field the dominant soils are classified as a very poorly drained hoytville silty clay with mean mehlich 3 soil test p of 58 mg kg in the control field and 48 mg kg in the treatment i e impact field the general cropping rotation includes corn zea mays l and soybean glycine max l with fertilizer generally applied as starter with corn minimal tillage and cover crops were also used supplemental table 1 however the cover crops did not or were sparsely established after planting both fields are systematically tile drained with a lateral spacing of 15 m at a 0 9 m depth dwm is generally implemented in winter and summer and managed to a depth 0 4 m from the ground surface fig 1c table 2 site b is located in the sandusky river watershed and the fields are also side by side but separated by a grassed waterway the contributing areas for the control and treatment i e impact fields are also distinct but vary in size the surface runoff contributing area in the control field is 4 3 ha while the tile drainage contributing area is 5 5 ha for the treatment i e impact field the surface runoff contributing area is 15 4 ha while the tile drainage contributing area is 18 6 ha the dominant soils on both fields are classified as the very poorly drained pewamo silty clay and the somewhat poorly drained bennington silt loam soil test p was 33 mg kg in the control field and 40 mg kg in the treatment i e impact field the general cropping rotation was corn and soybeans with fertilizer applied using variable rate technology vrt and incorporation prior to the corn crop rotational tillage supplemental table 1 both fields were systematically tile drained with a lateral spacing of 10 6 m at a 0 9 m depth as with site a drainage water was managed in the winter and summer using dwm structures with boards positioned at 0 4 m from the ground surface during management periods fig 1c table 2 2 2 data collection and analysis hydrology and water quality data were measured at both sites for site a the period of record included in the present study began with the 2015 water year wy 15 october 1 2014 through september 30 2015 and continued through the end of wy 19 for site b the period of record for this study began with wy 16 and also continued through the end of wy 19 hydrology data consisted of precipitation and discharge precipitation was measured at each location using an isco 674 tipping bucket precipitation gauge teledyne isco lincoln ne and a standard precipitation gauge novalynx corporation grass valley ca precipitation was recorded on a 10 min interval using the tipping bucket gauge event volumes were compared to bulk precipitation collected with the standard gauge and corrected for bias shedekar et al 2016 when there was a discrepancy in volume between the gauges surface and subsurface discharge was primarily calculated by measuring stage within a control volume and applying the appropriate stage discharge relationship control volumes at three of the four surface sites were 0 61 m h flumes tracom inc alpharetta ga while a 0 76 m h flume was installed at the fourth site similarly tile drainage was measured at three locations 2 tiles as site a and 1 tile at site b by observing the stage behind a 0 3 m compound weir insert thel mar llc brevard nc and applying the stage discharge relationship a 0 38 m compound weir was used at the fourth tile outlet site b stage was measured at all locations on a 10 minute time interval using an isco 4230 bubbler meter in each tile drain an isco 2150 area velocity sensor was also installed to facilitate discharge measurement when the pipe was submerged an isco 6712 automated water quality sampler was positioned adjacent to each control volume to facilitate water sample collection surface water samples were collected using a flow proportional approach a 200 ml aliquot was collected for every 1 mm volumetric depth of discharge measured at the control volume ten aliquots were composited into a 2 l polypropylene bottle to form a sample with respect to tile drainage and prior to 2015 a time proportional approach was used whereby four 200 ml aliquots were collected every six hours and composited to form a daily sample starting in 2015 additional event samples were collected when a predetermined change in stage was recorded 200 ml aliquots were collected and composited every 15 min to form a one hour event sample once additional event samples collection was initiated in 2015 the single day composite sample was lengthened to a two day composite by collecting and combining eight 100 ml aliquots every six hours samples were collected from the field on a near weekly basis and transported to the usda ars soil drainage research unit columbus oh wet chemistry lab for analysis water samples were vacuum filtered 0 45 µm and refrigerated at 4 c until analysis generally within 28 d concentrations of no3 n plus nitrite n hereafter no3 n and drp were determined colorometrically using flow injection analysis on a lachat instruments loveland co quikchem 8500 fia automated ion analyzer concentrations of no3 n were determined by the copperized cadmium reduction method and drp was determined by the ascorbic acid reduction method murphy and riley 1962 concentrations of tp were determined on unfiltered samples following alkaline persulfate oxidation patton and kryskalla 2003 and subsequent analysis of drp a near continuous concentration data set was constructed through linear interpolation williams et al 2015c between midpoints for each sample the resulting concentrations corresponding to the 10 min discharge time stamp were multiplied to develop a 10 min no3 n drp and tp load data set events were determined based on precipitation amount and defined as at least 6 35 mm of rainfall separated by six hours thus more than one event could occur in a day and an event that did not produce discharge could also occur in the cases where discharge was generated surface runoff event duration was set equal to the point when discharge ceased with regard to tile drainage the duration was set equal to the lesser of the time period between 1 when stage was within 5 of stage at the initiation of the event 2 discharge ceased 3 a new event began or 4 7 days data were then summed over the event duration to form event based discharge no3 n drp and tp data sets 2 3 statistical analysis a before after control impact baci design was used to examine the effect of dwm at both site a and site b because dwm was implemented in all fields prior to this study the control at each site represents a field where dwm ceased i e free drainage or fd during the after period and the impact site represents a field where drainage water management continued i e dwm during the after period the before period was wy 15 through wy 17 at site a and wy 16 through wy 17 at site b the after period at both sites was wy 18 through wy 19 a generalized linear mixed model glmm was used to determine the effect of dwm on event discharge and nutrient loads in surface runoff and subsurface drainage only precipitation events that produced a discharge response in at least one field were used in the analysis thus a small constant 1 10 5 was added to all response variable observations in order to retain events with zero discharge that may have been impacted by the treatment in each model the period before after treatment control impact and their interaction baci effect were defined as fixed effects while event i e sampling time was treated as a random effect a log link function with a gamma distribution was used to fit the non normal data to the glmm everitt 2005 the primary statistic of interest was the interaction term i e the baci effect which represents the differential change between the control and impact sites compared before and after the alteration of dwm practices a parametric bootstrap method was used to test for statistical significance of the baci effect in the pbkrtest package halekoh and hojsgaard 2014 bootstrapping is a technique used to obtain confidence intervals for glmm parameters from which p values from likelihood ratio tests can be calculated p values less than 0 05 were considered statistically significant analyses were conducted using the glmer function in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 in r r core team 2020 the baci contrast defined as the difference in means at the control site µcafter µcbefore minus the difference in means at the impact site µiafter µibefore was also calculated to further aid in interpretation the ci divergence which is the absolute value of the difference in means between the impact and control sites before the treatment µibefore µcbefore subtracted from the difference in means between the impact and control after the treatment µiafter µcafter was also calculated and indicates how dissimilar the control and impact sites were after the treatment chevalier et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and events precipitation across periods at both sites generally followed normal 30 yr average trends for this region with greater precipitation from april to july i e spring and summer compared to september through march i e fall and winter fig 1 notably spring and summer precipitation amounts during the present study often exceeded 30 year normal trends fig 1 except at site b where greater spring and summer precipitation were only measured in the final year of the after period greater spring and summer precipitation is consistent with future climate predictions that indicate warmer and wetter conditions during these periods u s global change research program 2017 which will likely complicate efforts to complete production management practices i e fertilization planting etc without continued use of artificial drainage systems in this region guo et al 2020 the number and magnitude of precipitation events varied between sites and periods table 3 at site a mean event precipitation was similar in the before 22 4 1 7 mm and after 23 3 1 5 mm periods table 3 however mean event precipitation at site b increased slightly between the before 19 8 1 3 mm and after 24 6 1 7 mm periods table 3 total rainfall at site a was greater in the before 2129 4 mm compared to the after 1935 4 mm period while total rainfall at site b was less in the before 1737 8 mm compared to the after 2313 7 mm period table 3 as the frequency and intensity of rainfall events increase in the midwest us u s global change research program 2017 it follows that nutrient loss dynamics will also be impacted robertson et al 2013 jarvie et al 2013 indeed a recent study of tile drains in northcentral ohio found that precipitation characteristics strongly controlled n and p loss hanrahan et al 2021 3 2 discharge there was a significant baci period x treatment effect pbtest 14 54 p 0 003 for surface discharge at site a the estimated mean of event surface discharge in the control field decreased from 0 03 to 0 01 mm while the estimated mean of event surface discharge increased in the impact field from 0 04 to 0 12 mm fig 2 the baci contrast was 0 09 0 06 mm table 4 though the ci divergence was positive 0 09 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before period in contrast the baci period x treatment effect was not significant at site b pbtest 3 10 p 0 18 suggesting that differences in surface discharge between the two periods were comparable for the control and impact fields while not significant trends indicated that the estimated mean of event surface runoff increased more from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control field fig 3 the ci divergence was also positive 0 14 suggesting that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period surface runoff under dwm from sites a and b tended to increase relative to the free drainage fd however only the increase at site a was statistically significant the discharge precipitation ratio over the period of record for surface runoff at site a was greater 13 compared to site b 4 suggesting that the influence of dwm was stronger at the location more likely to experience greater surface runoff after precipitation tile drain spacing was also greater at site a 15 m compared with site b 10 6 m which impacts the partitioning of surface runoff and tile drainage pathways tan and zhang 2011 previous studies have also found greater surface runoff under dwm treatments drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 shedekar et al 2021 largely because elevated water tables and increased antecedent moisture in the soil profile reduce the amount of precipitation that soils can store thereby increasing the potential for runoff via surface pathways drury et al 2009 shedekar et al 2021 ross et al 2016 summarized data from 12 field studies where surface runoff was measured and found that dwm increased surface runoff by 33 28 mm compared to fd in contrast no surface runoff was recorded from either fd or dwm plots during a 4 year study in sweden wesstrom and messing 2007 the baci period treatment effect was not significant for subsurface tile discharge at site a pbtest 2 47 p 0 21 or site b pbtest 1 85 p 0 30 trends show that the estimated mean of event tile discharge decreased more from the before to the after period in the impact field at site a compared to the control field fig 2 in contrast at site b the estimated mean of event tile discharge increased less between the before and after periods in the impact field compared to the control fig 3 the ci divergence was positive at both site a 0 20 and site b 0 64 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after relative to the before period dwm is a structural conservation practice that manipulates the outlet elevation of a drainage system which decreases subsurface tile discharge therefore its impacts on drainage volume are well documented the non significant reductions with respect to tile drainage discharge in the present study differ from previous studies in ohio fausey 2005 williams et al 2015b gunn et al 2015 and various states in the midwestern us e g helmers et al 2012 however the present study focused on the influence of dwm on tile discharge associated with precipitation events which may have underestimated the overall impact of dwm by excluding tile discharge that was not event driven indeed on field plots with similar soil texture silty clay loam and crop rotation corn soybean to the present study fausey 2005 found that dwm decreased subsurface tile drainage by approximately 40 compared to fd reductions in tile discharge associated with dwm range from 17 to 80 skaggs et al 2010 and one study of paired field sites in the western lake erie basin specifically found that dwm reduced tile discharge by 40 100 gunn et al 2015 the magnitude and direction of change in surface runoff and tile discharge under dwm may also be affected by other water budget components such as evapotranspiration et and seepage for example a simulation study by youssef et al 2018 for 48 sites across the midwestern u s showed an increase in et 5 or 27 mm yr 1 and vertical seepage 23 or 9 mm yr 1 under dwm compared to fd with a greater hydraulic gradient resulting from a potentially elevated water table under dwm the losses to lateral and vertical seepage can increase especially when fields are adjacent to large drainage ditches or other agricultural fields with free drainage systems lavaire et al 2017 shedekar et al 2021 3 3 nitrate n the baci period x treatment effect was not significant for surface no3 n loss at site a pbtest 2 49 p 0 22 or site b pbtest 2 91 p 0 17 trends indicate that the estimated mean of event surface no3 n load at site a decreased more in the impact field from the before to the after period compared to the control field fig 2 in contrast at site b the estimated mean of event surface no3 n load increased more in the impact field from the before to the after period compared to the control field fig 3 regardless of the trends event surface no3 n loads were extremely low and changes between periods were generally small regardless of direction i e 0 01 kg ha the lack of statistical significance and minimal changes demonstrate that surface no3 n loads were not strongly influenced by dwm in the present study previous work has similarly found that dwm did not significantly impact surface no3 n loads drury et al 2009 wang et al 2020 in tile drained landscapes no3 n concentrations in surface runoff are negligible compared to those in subsurface tile discharge e g woodley et al 2018 thus n loss in surface runoff is of less concern the baci period x treatment effect for subsurface tile no3 n load was significant at site a pbtest 14 53 p 0 003 and site b pbtest 50 67 p 0 001 at site a the estimated mean of event tile no3 n load decreased from 0 08 to 0 05 kg ha in the control field and from 0 08 to 0 03 kg ha in the impact field fig 2 thus event tile no3 n load decreased more from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control the baci contrast was 0 03 0 01 kg ha and the ci divergence was positive 0 02 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before at site b the estimated mean of event tile no3 n load increased from 0 02 to 0 15 kg ha in the control field and from 0 03 to 0 06 kg ha in the impact field fig 3 thus event tile no3 n load increased less from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control the baci contrast for site b was 0 10 0 03 kg ha and the ci divergence was positive 0 08 indicating that the control and impact fields were also more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before these results demonstrate that dwm significantly reduced tile no3 n loss compared to fd numerous previous studies have also reported that dwm decreased no3 n loss in subsurface drainage relative to fd drury et al 1996 wesstrom and messing 2007 helmers et al 2012 williams et al 2015b saadat et al 2018 though we know of no other study that has specifically focused on event driven no3 n loss generally reductions in tile no3 n loss are proportional to changes in drainage volume fausey 2005 skaggs et al 2010 shedekar et al 2021 because of the strong relationship between no3 n loadings and discharge williams et al 2015b hanrahan et al 2021 however some dwm studies have also noted decreased no3 n concentrations in the soil profile fisher et al 1999 increased rates of denitrification cartensen et al 2019 kliewer and gilliam 1995 and greater plant n uptake sunohara et al 2014 lesser concentrations due to increased denitrification are likely to occur under dwm when elevated water table depths create anaerobic soil conditions williams et al 2015a it is also important to note that other site specific parameters such as decomposable soil organic matter or carbon and soil temperature may affect denitrification williams et al 2015a thus soils with greater soil organic carbon are likely to experience greater reduction in concentrations under dwm in contrast cold winter temperatures likely limit the amount of denitrification under dwm and result in similar no3 n concentrations as those under fd indeed in a plot scale study in indiana saadat et al 2018 reported that 88 of drain flow during dwm occurred when the average soil profile temperature was less than 10 c they observed similar concentrations between dwm and fd likely due to the lack of denitrification under dwm at sites where dwm does not significantly affect the drainage outflow these site specific factors may affect the no3 n loss 3 4 dissolved reactive p the baci treatment x period effect was significant for surface drp loss at site a pbtest 12 65 p 0 009 the estimated mean of event surface drp load decreased from 0 03 to 0 01 g ha in the control field but increased from 0 03 to 0 15 g ha in the impact field the baci contrast was 0 13 0 00 and the ci divergence was positive 0 13 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after period compared to the before period in contrast the baci treatment x period effect was not significant for surface drp loss at site b pbtest 1 79 p 0 32 though trends suggested a greater increase in the estimated mean of event surface drp load from the before to the after period in the impact field relative to the control field fig 3 the ci divergence was also positive indicating that the control and impact sites were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period findings at both site a and b were consistent with patterns in surface discharge and suggests that changes in surface drp loss were principally driven by greater surface runoff in the fields where dwm was maintained though the trend for both runoff and drp was only significant in one of the two sites in a study in southern ontario canada tan and zhang 2011 also found that drp loss in surface runoff was greater from a site with controlled drainage than fd cumulative drp loss over the 5 year study period was 177 g ha from controlled drainage but only 21 3 g ha from fd tan and zhang 2011 surface runoff p concentrations tend to be greater than those associated with subsurface discharge in tile drained landscapes pease et al 2018 thus increases in surface runoff could potentially offset some or all p reduction benefits in tile drainage attributed to dwm implementation the baci period treatment effect for subsurface drp loss was not significant at site a pbtest 0 94 p 0 47 or site b pbtest 5 39 p 0 08 at site a trends suggested that the estimated mean of event tile drp load decreased less in the impact field relative to the control field the ci divergence value was negative 0 06 and indicated that the two fields were trending more similar in the after compared to the before period in contrast trends at site b suggested that the estimated mean of event tile drp load decreased more in the impact field relative to the control field fig 3 the ci divergence value was positive 0 51 which supports the finding that the two fields were more dissimilar in the after period these results suggest that dwm did not strongly influence event driven tile drp loss in the sites examined here discharge is the primary mechanism for p movement williams et al 2016b and the lack of significant differences in tile drp loss between dwm and fd in the present study may be explained by trends in tile flow i e no differences saadat et al 2018 also found that subsurface drp loads did not differ between dwm and fd plots in indiana in contrast numerous studies have demonstrated that dwm decreased tile drp loads relative to fd feser et al 2010 nash et al 2015 williams et al 2015 again largely associated with reductions in tile discharge the anaerobic soil conditions under dwm can create a reducing environment and increase the solubility and mobility of p within the soil profile and thus to the tiles mcdowell et al 2012 in contrast wahba et al 2001 suggests that the reduced conditions created under dwm do not remain in the soil profile long enough to cause significant p losses furthermore the potential for p loss is lesser from soils deeper in the soil profile the zone of influence most affected by dwm compared to topsoil thus changes in drp concentrations under dwm would be expected to minimally affect field scale drp losses in fields with normal vertical soil test phosphorus distributions i e greater concentrations at the surface and lesser concentrations in the subsoil 3 5 total p the baci period treatment effect for surface tp loss was significant at site a pbtest 12 65 p 0 009 but not at site b pbtest 2 15 p 0 22 the estimated mean of surface tp load decreased from 0 12 to 0 04 g ha in the control field but increased from 0 18 to 0 47 g ha in the impact field the baci contrast was 0 36 0 03 and the ci divergence was positive 0 36 demonstrating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period in contrast trends at site b show that the estimated mean of surface tp load increased more in the control field than the impact field fig 3 results from site a demonstrate that dwm increased event surface tp loss relative to fd likely due to greater surface runoff tan and zhang 2011 found that tp loss in surface runoff was greater from a site with dwm than fd cumulative tp loss over the 5 year study period was 301 7 g ha from dwm and 275 1 g ha from fd tan and zhang 2011 in contrast wang et al 2020 found no significant increase in surface tp loss with dwm the baci period treatment effect for subsurface tp loss was significant at only site b pbtest 7 12 p 0 04 the estimated mean of event tile tp load increased from 2 38 to 5 33 g ha in the control field and from 1 90 to 2 56 g ha in the impact field demonstrating that tile tp loss increased less in the impact field relative to the control the baci contrast was 2 29 0 01 and the ci divergence was positive 2 29 indicating that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period while not significant trends at site a suggested that the estimated mean of event tile tp load increased slightly between the before and after period in the control field but decreased in the impact field the ci divergence was positive 0 82 supporting the conclusion that the control and impact fields were more dissimilar in the after compared to the before period the significant findings at site b and trends at site a demonstrate that dwm reduced tile tp loss compared to fd which is consistent with previous studies wesstrom et al 2001 wesstrom and messing 2007 feser et al 2010 tan and zhang 2011 the contrast between tile drp and tp results in the present study may be explained by the influence of dwm on particulate p pp which was not measured here previous research has shown that dwm decreased subsurface tp loads by substantially reducing pp loads tan and zhang 2011 however others have reported no significant influence of dwm on subsurface tp loads saadat et al 2018 one potential explanation is that during the periods of dwm the lower hydraulic gradient between the field water table and outlet elevation likely causes water to move at slower velocities through drainage systems compared to that under fd during these times of slow velocity more sediment will settle in the drain tiles however soon after lowering the outlet elevation the velocities are increased and any accumulated sediment is flushed out frankenberger et al 2007 3 6 watershed scale implications the results of the immediate study suggest that widespread dwm adoption and management across a watershed has the potential to significantly reduce subsurface no3 n loads which comprise the majority of watershed n losses in tile drained landscapes randall and gross 2001 in watersheds that feed coastal systems less n would decrease the extent of algal blooms paerl et al 2008 however p is primarily linked with algal blooms in freshwater systems and the impact of dwm on drp and tp loads in this study was more variable than n in fact results here suggest that dwm has the potential to partially or in whole negate any reductions in subsurface tile drainage drp and tp losses when surface contributions are considered nevertheless a benefit of changes in n loss relative to p with dwm may decrease n p ratios that subsequently reduce the toxicity of algal blooms in downstream freshwaters since studies have suggested that n controls algal bloom toxicity while p controls the bloom extent newell et al 2019 thus dwm should continue to be promoted as a practice to address subsurface tile no3 n loss however more research is needed to evaluate the effects of dwm on surface and subsurface p dynamics at sites with varying characteristics e g soil types management etc as well as strategies for combining stacking dwm with other in field and edge of field practices that may help achieve p reduction goals furthermore as programs and practices are developed that focus on nutrient reduction in tile drained landscapes it is paramount that the tradeoffs between n and p as well as surface and subsurface pathways are explored and understood prior to implementation otherwise unintended consequences may
