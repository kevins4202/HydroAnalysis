6585,predicting the bulk cross sectional average flow velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation is an important topic in river engineering researchers have proposed numerous theoretical and empirical formulae but the accuracy and physical basis of their solutions still need improvement this study separates the flow into vegetation layer and surface layer following conventional two layer approach and estimates the average velocities in these two layers separately in the vegetation layer force balance equation provides the basement of the estimation and in the surface layer we use genetic programming gp a data driven method a darcy weisbach coefficient like parameter is proposed for the surface layer which is related to other parameters through the gp algorithm the maximum dissimilarity algorithm a data clustering algorithm is used to separate the existing data sets in the training validation and testing groups to feed gp algorithm finally by weighted combination a new velocity formula with high accuracy and physical basis is proposed for submerged vegetated flow keywords open channel flow submerged vegetation cross sectional mean velocity two layer approach genetic programming 1 introduction an open channel flow with submerged vegetation is a common flow condition in natural rivers and artificial channels especially during flood seasons the interplay between a flow and vegetation results in a specific and complicated flow structure it has also aroused the interest of hydraulic and hydrology researchers accordingly several researchers huai et al 2009 nikora et al 2013 tang et al 2014 have conducted detailed experiments and established models to describe the vertical distribution of velocity in an open channel flow with submerged vegetation nikora et al 2013 stated that flows can be divided into five sub layers bed boundary uniform mixing logarithmic and wake layers fig 1 the bed boundary layer is usually thin the velocity in this layer rapidly increases with the distance from the riverbed in the uniform layer the drag force balances with the sliding force causing a relatively uniform distribution of velocity the mixing layer is the most complicated layer and can be described by a hyperbolic tangent profile raupach et al 1996 nepf 2012b nikora et al 2013 in the logarithmic layer the velocity follows the logarithmic profile in the wake layer this profile should be revised with a wake term however this kind of velocity distribution is complex in river engineering the flood discharge capacity can be evaluated only with bulk cross sectional average velocity ub as such people sometimes only care about ub rather than the detailed velocity distribution nonetheless even only for ub predicting is still difficult because the submerged vegetation in an open channel flow exerts forces and remarkably changes the hydrodynamics of the flow su li 2010 okamoto nezu 2010 okamoto et al 2012 li li 2015 etminan et al 2017 numerous models have been established to estimate the average velocity in open channel flows with submerged vegetation examples of these models are the single layer cheng 2015 tinoco et al 2015 gualtieri et al 2018 and two layer approaches stone shen 2002 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 yang choi 2010 cheng 2011 li et al 2015b a review is provided by pasquino gualtieri 2017 the single layer model proposed by cheng 2015 is derived from the conventional darcy weisbach formula with a revision in the hydraulic radius which considered the obstruction from vegetation a relationship between the darcy weisbach coefficient and other parameters such as the energy slope submergence and vegetation density was established by analyzing the existing data bank tinoco et al 2015 applied genetic programming gp and used the froude number as the target dimensionless parameter in formula searching among the alternative predictors obtained by gp a chezy like equation was selected by the authors as the final formula gualtieri et al 2018 compared the performance of different conventional resistance equations when used in vegetated flow with high submergence and argued that the keulegan equation performs best these single layer models are simple but ignore the different physical mechanisms of vegetation induced drag force and bed roughness induced resistance the conventional flow resistance equations used cheng 2015 tinoco et al 2015 gualtieri et al 2018 were originally established in flumes without vegetation in which the friction resistance arises from the bed roughness however in vegetated flow the drag force is often the dominant source of resistance making the bed resistance negligible huthoff et al 2007 moreover there is a huge difference between the physical processes of vegetation induced drag force and bed roughness induced resistance thus directly applying these conventional flow resistance equations and searching for corresponding scales such as roughness height and friction factors may need more consideration most of the two layer models separate the flow with submerged vegetation into the vegetation layer also called as the resistance layer and the surface layer by using the top of the vegetation as the boundary fig 1 stone and shen 2002 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 yang and choi 2010 cheng 2011 the average velocities of each layer uv and us were estimated individually and the bulk average velocity ub was derived by weighted combination the mean velocity in the vegetation layer was calculated based on the force balance between vegetation reduced drag force and the sliding force stone shen 2002 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 yang choi 2010 cheng 2011 whereas the average velocity in the surface layer can be estimated with the logarithmic velocity distribution assumption baptist et al 2007 yang choi 2010 based on similarity considerations huthoff et al 2007 or an equation similar to the darcy weisbach equation cheng 2011 in this study uv and us are separately estimated uv is estimated by analysing the momentum equations force balance and us s predictor is based on gp if good predictors for uv and us could be obtained then ub could be estimated by weighted combination method different from the single layer gp based model proposed by tinoco et al 2015 the model presented in this study separates the flow into the vegetation and surface layers then the drag force is disassociated with bed roughness previous studies azamathulla ahmad 2012 tinoco et al 2015 have shown that the gp algorithm provides accurate predictors without additional assumptions the performance of this model in terms of average velocity in submerged vegetated flow will be evaluated in this study 2 methods and material 2 1 geometric scales and two layer approach the vegetation geography can be described via individual vegetation scales and their density nepf 2012a vegetation is categorised in accordance with shape a circular cylinder and a strip like cylinder nepf 2012a for rigid vegetation circular cylinder arrays have been mostly used to simulate the vegetation for experiments and theoretical analysis shimizu et al 1991 dunn et al 1996 meijer and van velzen 1999 stone shen 2002 poggi et al 2004 murphy et al 2007 liu et al 2008 yan 2008 yang 2008 cheng 2011 wang et al 2015 in this case the vegetation elements have a characteristic diameter d and the average spacing between elements is δ s then the frontal area per canopy volume a can be described as 1 a d δ s 2 d n where n 1 δ s 2 is the number of stems per unit bed area nepf 2012a the vegetation density can also be described using the solid volume fraction occupied by the canopy elements λ which can be calculated as 2 λ π 4 a d 1 4 n π d 2 when the vegetation is submerged the relative depth of submergence h hv greatly influences the flow structure where h is the flow depth and hv is the height of the vegetation with the top of the vegetation as the boundary the flow could be divided into two layers vegetation layer with a depth of hv and surface layer with a depth of hs fig 1 2 2 genetic programming obtaining empirical relationships from a large data bank is a useful engineering approach especially when the physical mechanism is still undiscovered or extremely complicated tinoco et al 2015 gp is a useful tool that helps us explore and evaluate all the possible relationships based on the data bank tinoco et al 2015 this tool executes the recognition task to derive physically sound predictors koza 2010 which are effective when the physical mechanism has not been elucidated tinoco et al 2015 in this study a well documented gp based software package called eureqa schmidt lipson 2013 is applied to determine predictors for the average velocity in the surface layer us in open channel flow with submerged rigid vegetation eureqa is a user friendly gp software package developed by schmidt and lipson 2009 and has been proven to be valid in different research topics of river engineering and hydrology research goldstein coco 2014 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2016 huai et al 2018 different from the work of tinoco et al 2015 which applied gp in the same topic as this paper say average velocity in open channel flow with submerged vegetation this study is based on the two layer approach in the study of tinoco et al 2015 the vegetation was seen as the roughness of the riverbed which means the vegetation induced resistance was not analyzed as drag force but shear stress however in this study with the two layer approach the vegetation induced resistance will be analyzed as what it should be the drag force 2 3 force balance some theories for submerged flow have been developed based on force balance baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 a brief expression about force balance analysis is exhibited in the present study different from the open channel flow without vegetation the flow in the vegetation layer in submerged vegetated flow is slowed down not only by the bed resistance but also by the drag force from the vegetation and the flow in the surface layer is much faster than that in the vegetation layer because of the absence of drag force an interface shear τ k between these two layers located at the top of the vegetation layer was proposed by huthoff et al 2007 to build the force balance equation in the vegetation layer 3 ρ g h v s 1 λ τ k 0 h v 1 2 ρ c dl a u 2 d z 1 8 ρ f b u v 2 where the leftmost term is the gravity term ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and s is the energy slope the first term on the right is the drag force caused by the vegetation c dl is local drag coefficient u v is average velocity in the vegetation layer and u is local velocity the second term on the right is the bed resistance where f b is the darcy weisbach coefficient of the river bed for the surface layer the balance between the slide force and the interface shear is as follows 4 ρ g h s s τ k inserting eq 4 into eq 3 yields the following 5 ρ g h v s 1 λ ρ g h s s 0 h v 1 2 ρ c dl a u 2 d z 1 8 ρ f b u v 2 the local drag coefficient changes with the location z several studies have tried to realise the vertical distribution of cdl e g dunn et al 1996 nepf vivoni 2000 ghisalberti 2004 tang et al 2014 although they all have used rigid cylinders in their experiments controversial results have been reported by dunn et al 1996 nepf vivoni 2000 and ghisalberti 2004 hence further research is still needed on this topic an alternative method is the use of the bulk drag coefficient cdb to estimate the dag force this method is much simpler and has been widely used in previous studies e g huthoff et al 2007 cheng 2012 6 0 h v 1 2 ρ c dl a u 2 d z 1 2 ρ h v c db a u v 2 the bed resistance is often much smaller than the drag force and can be ignored huthoff et al 2007 on this basis the average velocity of the vegetation flow can be calculated as follows 7 u v 2 g s 1 λ h s h v c db a thus the next step should focus on how to calculate cdb constants such as c d 1 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 li et al 2015b or c d 1 13 yang and choi 2010 have been used to estimate this coefficient in some previous studies recently several studies tanino nepf 2008 cheng and nguyen 2011 cheng 2012 tinoco cowen 2013 etminan et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2018 have conducted detailed experimental theoretical and numerical research on the bulk drag coefficient for rigid emergent vegetation showing that cdb is dependent on the cylinder reynolds number re d u v d v 1 and vegetation array characteristics sonnenwald et al 2018 a similar format was shared by some of these studies tanino nepf 2008 tinoco cowen 2013 sonnenwald et al 2018 8 c db 2 α 0 re d α 1 where α 0 and α 1 are the coefficients of viscous and inertial drag effects respectively tanino nepf 2008 and tinoco cowen 2013 noted that cdb becomes independent of re d when re d is large enough for instance re d 1000 thus their formulae go as tanino nepf 2008 9 c d t n 2 0 46 3 8 λ tinoco cowen 2013 10 c d t c 2 0 58 6 49 λ sonnenwald et al 2018 proposed an empirical formula that is not dimensionally consistent 11 c d sonnenwald 2 6475 d 32 re d 17 d 3 2 λ 0 5 cheng and nguyen 2011 redefined and applied hydraulic radius to evaluate the resistance induced by emergent vegetation which also provided a formula to estimate cdb 12 c d cheng 130 r v 0 85 0 8 1 exp r v 400 where r v r v gs υ 2 1 3 υ is the kinematic viscosity of fluid and r v π 1 λ d 4 λ the formulas obtained from the emergent vegetation flow have also been tested for submerged vegetation showing acceptable consistency king et al 2012 cheng 2015 to choose a suitable formula for cdb for this study data sets from tang et al 2014 are collected to compare the performance of the aforementioned formulas eq 11 is not dimensionally consistent and hence is excluded from the comparison tang et al 2014 provided the detailed measurements of the vertical distribution of velocity in this manner the values of uv can be obtained from these measurements trapezoidal rule is applied here 13 u vm 1 h v 0 h v u d z 1 2 1 n u i u i 1 δ h i h v where u vm is the measured mean velocity in the vegetation layer u i is the measured local velocity and δ h i is the depth gap between two contiguous measuring points by transforming eq 7 the following can be obtained 14 c dbm 2 g s 1 λ h s h v a u vm 2 where c dbm represents the measured values for cdb table 1 shows the parameters and calculation results for the data sets from tang et al 2014 eq 12 which was proposed by cheng nguyen 2011 has the smallest mean relative error mre accordingly the equation was applied to calculate cdb in this study 15 mre 1 n 1 n p i b i b i where n is the total number of the data sets p i and b i are the predicted and observed values respectively the magnitude of fluctuations in velocity field is often used to estimate the shear stress according to the reynolds average navier stokes equation pope 2000 huthoff et al 2007 16 τ k τ xz ρ v x v z where vx and vz are the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the streamwise and vertical directions respectively the vx value could be scaled with us while the vertical vz is determined with particular eddies which could be described by a characteristic length scale r and a velocity scale ur gioia and bombardelli 2002 huthoff et al 2007 thus 17 τ k ρ u s u r if length scale r is much larger than the kolmogórov length i e r η η is the kolmogórov length then the rate of dissipation of turbulent energy per unit mass can be described as gioia and bombardelli 2002 huthoff et al 2007 konings et al 2012 18 ε u r 3 r according to kolmogórov s theory of turbulence ε is equal to the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass which is possessed by the largest eddies u s 2 the turnover time of the largest eddies l 1 u s for those with horizontal vorticity vector and l 2 u s for those with vertical vorticity vector is often used to characterise this energy production rate thus 19 u r 3 r ε u s 2 l 1 u s u s 2 l 2 u s l 1 l 2 l 1 l 2 u s 3 u s 3 r where r l 1 l 2 l 1 l 2 represents the systematic scale thus 20 u r u s r r 1 3 the combination of eqs 4 17 and 20 yields the following 21 g h s s r r 1 3 u s 2 eq 21 has a similar format as the darcy weisbach formula in the open channel flow without vegetation this formula can be written as li et al 2015a li huai 2016 22 ghs 1 8 f u 2 where f is the darcy weisbach coefficient and 23 f k s r c 1 3 where k s is the absolute roughness height of the river bed and r c is the hydraulic radius thus we propose an f like non dimensional coefficient fs to equate the two sides of eq 21 24 g h s s 1 8 f s u s 2 where 25 f s r r 1 3 cheng 2012 also proposed a darcy weisbach formula and a corresponding friction coefficient for the surface layer however he failed to give a derivation of this formula but directly applied the conventional darcy weisbach formula into the surface layer a completed derivation process of a darcy weisbach like formula is provided from eq 4 to eq 25 the best method to solve eq 25 may be finding an estimation method for r l1 and l2 nonetheless conducting this method at this stage is difficult because the condition of eddies in the submerged vegetated flow is complex especially in the mixing layer an alternative method is finding the relationship between f s and other dimensionless parameters with a data driven method which is the core part of this study 2 4 data to find a predictor of fs in eq 25 and next obtain a formula to predict the average velocity in the surface layer us then finally predict the bulk average velocity ub we analyze experimental data collected by li et al 2015 b from previous works shimizu et al 1991 dunn et al 1996 meijer and van velzen 1999 stone shen 2002 poggi et al 2004 murphy et al 2007 liu et al 2008 yan 2008 yang 2008 cheng 2011 lópez garcía 2001 baptist 2005 a total of 315 data sets see appendix a which used rigid cylinders with submergence h h v of 1 09 7 5 to simulate the submerged vegetation have been collected the reynolds numbers red u b d v 1 and reh u b h v 1 have the range of 61 9873 and 4138 2974200 respectively eq 7 is applied to calculate the average velocity in vegetated layer while eq 12 is applied here to calculate the drag coefficient we name these results as uvp 26 u vp 2 g s 1 λ h s h v c d cheng a we use uvp values and the measured total discharge to calculate the average velocity in the surface layer we name it as usm 27 u sm q m u vp 1 λ h v b b h s where qm is the measured discharge and b is the channel width it should be noticed that values of usm are not the real measured average velocity in surface layers in those experiments in most of the previous experiments no effort was applied to measure us or uv the only available measured data is the total discharge qm thus we use eq 26 and 27 to obtain usm and take it as measured us this method has been widely used in previous studies for example cheng 2011 and li et al 2015b however among the 315 data sets we have collected problems happen in 27 data sets in these 27 data sets we find that u vp u sm which is unreasonable section 2 3 huthoff et al 2007 huai et al 2009 nikora et al 2013 two possible reasons for this problem are 1 measurement errors in the slope meijer 1998 huthoff et al 2007 2 errors in cd when applying eq 12 i e cd cheng is actually smaller than the real cd in these data sets without an identified source of this error we only use the remaining 288 data sets in the following analysis with the 288 data sets a best fit relationship between fs and other parameters is determined with gp to avoid some dimensional coefficients we only consider non dimensional variables as feed for the gp algorithm tinoco et al 2015 several non dimensional variables are possibly related to fs cheng 2011 tinoco et al 2015 cheng 2015 including λ energy slope s h h v reynolds numbers red and reh and a h v other non dimensional parameters could be calculated with these variables such as ad 4 λ π and ah a h v h h v regarding to reynolds numbers the flow is in a fully rough turbulent area thus fs is unlikely to be influenced by the reynolds numbers meanwhile the reynolds numbers are proportional to the target parameter the average velocity thus the reynolds numbers may cause self related problems taking all these into consideration we assume that f s g s λ h h v a h v eq 24 and values of usm are used to calculate measured fs we name it as fsm 28 f sm 8 g h s s u sm 2 the next step is to use these values of fsm and other parameters to feed gp algorithm and find a predictor for fs the data bank should be grouped into the following 1 the training group that provides the formulae 2 the validation group that selects the optimal formula and 3 the testing group that judges the selected result koza 1992 the training group and validation group are used to feed the gp algorithm and the test group is used for final test however no unique and optimal approach can perform this task tinoco et al 2015 before data division the dimensionless variables require further normalization to eliminate the remarkable difference in the parameters accordingly we employ x n x i x min x max x min to normalize the given dimensionless data where x i represents the non dimensional data bank x max is the maximum dimensionless data x min is the minimum dimensionless data and x n represents the normalized data bank the division criterion used in this study is the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda camus et al 2011 the sum of squares of dissimilarity is a type of geometric distance tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and every dimensionless parameter has a non ignorable contribution because of preliminary normalization mda chooses the centroid farthest from the previous one moreover we choose the data point with the largest fsm as the first centroid mda ensures that the selected data used to obtain the predictor can best represent the data bank we select 115 40 datasets from the mda selected data as the training group another 115 40 as the validation group and the remaining datasets as the testing group then all the data sets are dis normalized to feed the gp algorithm the detailed process of the algorithm can also be found in the work of tinoco et al 2015 the data f sm s λ h h v a h v of the training and validation groups are used to feed eureqa no outliers of fsm were found in these 230 data points 2 5 formula searching eureqa provides several kinds of fitness functions to evaluate possible relationships mean absolute error mae is chosen as the error metric wang et al 2016 huai et al 2018 29 mae 1 n i 1 n p i b i the mathematical operators chosen include the constant input variable addition subtraction multiplication division exponential power and square root each mathematical operator has its own complexity value set by eureqa which could be reset by the users default values are used in this study the final complexity also called size of a formula is the sum of the complexities of all its foundational mathematical operators schmidt lipson 2013 wang et al 2016 huai et al 2018 the output of this gp routine is a suite of solutions with different complexities where a large complexity indicates a small error extremely complex formulae with high complexity generally lack physical meanings and are less practical oversimplified ones cannot extract the intrinsic relation among variables and their accuracy is relatively low thus the researcher must select a balanced result which is neither extremely complex nor oversimplified 3 results after 18 h of evaluating 7 2 10 12 formulae in 2 10 7 generations a series of solutions is obtained by eureqa and shown in table 2 a total of 14 solutions are found with a minimum complexity of 1 and maximum complexity of 33 the mae and mean squared error mse of these solutions could also be found in table 2 30 mse 1 n i 1 n p i b i 2 the non continuous relationship between the complexity and mae is shown in fig 2 thus a stair like figure frontier called pareto front is drawn in fig 2 where every solution has a point for its complexity and mae with a broken line between itself and the next solution goldstein et al 2013 wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 at the beginning when the complexity increases mae rapidly decreases however after the complexity reaches to 5 a large increase of the complexity only results in a small improvement on accuracy thus the formula with a complexity of 5 is chosen as the final solution 31 f sp 0 102 3 73 λ which means 32 r r 0 102 3 73 λ 3 eq 32 can estimate the relationship of the complex eddy scales its accuracy is successfully tested in sections 4 1 and 4 2 although the accurate scales of the dominant eddies are unknown eqs 31 and 32 provide a practical method to estimate their scale relationship according to gioia bombardelli 2002 in open channel flows without vegetation r is often taken as the absolute roughness height of the bed ks and r is taken as the hydraulic radius rc in the present study in an open channel flow with submerged vegetation eq 32 implies that the vegetation in the vegetation layer provides roughness shear stress to the surface layer the relative height r r of this kind of roughness is dependent on the vegetation density then with eq 24 33 u s 8 g h s s 0 102 3 73 λ ub could be calculated by weighted combination 34 u

measured and predicted values aghababaei et al 2017 which is also calculated the percentage of dr between 0 3 and 0 3 is often used to evaluate the performance of models zeng huai 2014 aghababaei et al 2017 huai et al 2018 which could also be found in table 3 among the three data groups no significant discrepancy in the performance of eq 31 could be found which shows its rationality 36 d r i log

the bulk average velocity according to table 4 and fig 3 for the selected data bank 288 data sets our new predictors perform better in terms of the mean relative error than other predictors generally equations that use the two layer model have lower relative error rates than those that use the single layer model maybe because of their detailed physical mechanism additionally our new predictors show higher accuracy than other two layer models which indicates the good ability of the gp algorithm to find an estimating formula from the existing data bank 4 3 limitations of the present model data sets from previous studies which have used rigid cylinders to simulate aquatic vegetation were used to build the present model thus the present model has a good accuracy but still has some limitations if used in natural rivers with vegetation for example if the vegetation is flexible then complex fluid dynamics will arise from the flexibility and the vegetation height will change with the flow rate although cheng 2011 successfully tested the applicability of the formula from rigid vegetation in the case of flexible vegetation research is still needed if the present model wants to be applied in the vegetated flow with flexible vegetation another important concern is that the cross section and vegetation geometries may also be non uniform and irregular in natural rivers therefore applying the results from the laboratory into a natural river becomes challenging on this basis average scales e g generalised cross section shape and average vegetation height and density may be used to provide a simple but useful solution 5 summary previous studies have applied various formulae for bulk average flow velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation that are deduced with different theoretical considerations in this study we employ gp a data driven method in the conventional two layer approach to craft the mathematical correlations between the f like coefficient fs and the relevant dimensionless variables fs is then applied to calculate the average velocity of the surface layer and finally the bulk average velocity of the entire cross section this new model has a relatively strong physical basement and its accuracy has lower relative deviations than previously presented ones therefore the gp obtained equation provides a new possibility to facilitate the future theoretical investigation of the mean velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation acknowledgments this work is financially supported by the natural science foundation of china nos

6585,predicting the bulk cross sectional average flow velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation is an important topic in river engineering researchers have proposed numerous theoretical and empirical formulae but the accuracy and physical basis of their solutions still need improvement this study separates the flow into vegetation layer and surface layer following conventional two layer approach and estimates the average velocities in these two layers separately in the vegetation layer force balance equation provides the basement of the estimation and in the surface layer we use genetic programming gp a data driven method a darcy weisbach coefficient like parameter is proposed for the surface layer which is related to other parameters through the gp algorithm the maximum dissimilarity algorithm a data clustering algorithm is used to separate the existing data sets in the training validation and testing groups to feed gp algorithm finally by weighted combination a new velocity formula with high accuracy and physical basis is proposed for submerged vegetated flow keywords open channel flow submerged vegetation cross sectional mean velocity two layer approach genetic programming 1 introduction an open channel flow with submerged vegetation is a common flow condition in natural rivers and artificial channels especially during flood seasons the interplay between a flow and vegetation results in a specific and complicated flow structure it has also aroused the interest of hydraulic and hydrology researchers accordingly several researchers huai et al 2009 nikora et al 2013 tang et al 2014 have conducted detailed experiments and established models to describe the vertical distribution of velocity in an open channel flow with submerged vegetation nikora et al 2013 stated that flows can be divided into five sub layers bed boundary uniform mixing logarithmic and wake layers fig 1 the bed boundary layer is usually thin the velocity in this layer rapidly increases with the distance from the riverbed in the uniform layer the drag force balances with the sliding force causing a relatively uniform distribution of velocity the mixing layer is the most complicated layer and can be described by a hyperbolic tangent profile raupach et al 1996 nepf 2012b nikora et al 2013 in the logarithmic layer the velocity follows the logarithmic profile in the wake layer this profile should be revised with a wake term however this kind of velocity distribution is complex in river engineering the flood discharge capacity can be evaluated only with bulk cross sectional average velocity ub as such people sometimes only care about ub rather than the detailed velocity distribution nonetheless even only for ub predicting is still difficult because the submerged vegetation in an open channel flow exerts forces and remarkably changes the hydrodynamics of the flow su li 2010 okamoto nezu 2010 okamoto et al 2012 li li 2015 etminan et al 2017 numerous models have been established to estimate the average velocity in open channel flows with submerged vegetation examples of these models are the single layer cheng 2015 tinoco et al 2015 gualtieri et al 2018 and two layer approaches stone shen 2002 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 yang choi 2010 cheng 2011 li et al 2015b a review is provided by pasquino gualtieri 2017 the single layer model proposed by cheng 2015 is derived from the conventional darcy weisbach formula with a revision in the hydraulic radius which considered the obstruction from vegetation a relationship between the darcy weisbach coefficient and other parameters such as the energy slope submergence and vegetation density was established by analyzing the existing data bank tinoco et al 2015 applied genetic programming gp and used the froude number as the target dimensionless parameter in formula searching among the alternative predictors obtained by gp a chezy like equation was selected by the authors as the final formula gualtieri et al 2018 compared the performance of different conventional resistance equations when used in vegetated flow with high submergence and argued that the keulegan equation performs best these single layer models are simple but ignore the different physical mechanisms of vegetation induced drag force and bed roughness induced resistance the conventional flow resistance equations used cheng 2015 tinoco et al 2015 gualtieri et al 2018 were originally established in flumes without vegetation in which the friction resistance arises from the bed roughness however in vegetated flow the drag force is often the dominant source of resistance making the bed resistance negligible huthoff et al 2007 moreover there is a huge difference between the physical processes of vegetation induced drag force and bed roughness induced resistance thus directly applying these conventional flow resistance equations and searching for corresponding scales such as roughness height and friction factors may need more consideration most of the two layer models separate the flow with submerged vegetation into the vegetation layer also called as the resistance layer and the surface layer by using the top of the vegetation as the boundary fig 1 stone and shen 2002 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 yang and choi 2010 cheng 2011 the average velocities of each layer uv and us were estimated individually and the bulk average velocity ub was derived by weighted combination the mean velocity in the vegetation layer was calculated based on the force balance between vegetation reduced drag force and the sliding force stone shen 2002 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 yang choi 2010 cheng 2011 whereas the average velocity in the surface layer can be estimated with the logarithmic velocity distribution assumption baptist et al 2007 yang choi 2010 based on similarity considerations huthoff et al 2007 or an equation similar to the darcy weisbach equation cheng 2011 in this study uv and us are separately estimated uv is estimated by analysing the momentum equations force balance and us s predictor is based on gp if good predictors for uv and us could be obtained then ub could be estimated by weighted combination method different from the single layer gp based model proposed by tinoco et al 2015 the model presented in this study separates the flow into the vegetation and surface layers then the drag force is disassociated with bed roughness previous studies azamathulla ahmad 2012 tinoco et al 2015 have shown that the gp algorithm provides accurate predictors without additional assumptions the performance of this model in terms of average velocity in submerged vegetated flow will be evaluated in this study 2 methods and material 2 1 geometric scales and two layer approach the vegetation geography can be described via individual vegetation scales and their density nepf 2012a vegetation is categorised in accordance with shape a circular cylinder and a strip like cylinder nepf 2012a for rigid vegetation circular cylinder arrays have been mostly used to simulate the vegetation for experiments and theoretical analysis shimizu et al 1991 dunn et al 1996 meijer and van velzen 1999 stone shen 2002 poggi et al 2004 murphy et al 2007 liu et al 2008 yan 2008 yang 2008 cheng 2011 wang et al 2015 in this case the vegetation elements have a characteristic diameter d and the average spacing between elements is δ s then the frontal area per canopy volume a can be described as 1 a d δ s 2 d n where n 1 δ s 2 is the number of stems per unit bed area nepf 2012a the vegetation density can also be described using the solid volume fraction occupied by the canopy elements λ which can be calculated as 2 λ π 4 a d 1 4 n π d 2 when the vegetation is submerged the relative depth of submergence h hv greatly influences the flow structure where h is the flow depth and hv is the height of the vegetation with the top of the vegetation as the boundary the flow could be divided into two layers vegetation layer with a depth of hv and surface layer with a depth of hs fig 1 2 2 genetic programming obtaining empirical relationships from a large data bank is a useful engineering approach especially when the physical mechanism is still undiscovered or extremely complicated tinoco et al 2015 gp is a useful tool that helps us explore and evaluate all the possible relationships based on the data bank tinoco et al 2015 this tool executes the recognition task to derive physically sound predictors koza 2010 which are effective when the physical mechanism has not been elucidated tinoco et al 2015 in this study a well documented gp based software package called eureqa schmidt lipson 2013 is applied to determine predictors for the average velocity in the surface layer us in open channel flow with submerged rigid vegetation eureqa is a user friendly gp software package developed by schmidt and lipson 2009 and has been proven to be valid in different research topics of river engineering and hydrology research goldstein coco 2014 tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2016 huai et al 2018 different from the work of tinoco et al 2015 which applied gp in the same topic as this paper say average velocity in open channel flow with submerged vegetation this study is based on the two layer approach in the study of tinoco et al 2015 the vegetation was seen as the roughness of the riverbed which means the vegetation induced resistance was not analyzed as drag force but shear stress however in this study with the two layer approach the vegetation induced resistance will be analyzed as what it should be the drag force 2 3 force balance some theories for submerged flow have been developed based on force balance baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 a brief expression about force balance analysis is exhibited in the present study different from the open channel flow without vegetation the flow in the vegetation layer in submerged vegetated flow is slowed down not only by the bed resistance but also by the drag force from the vegetation and the flow in the surface layer is much faster than that in the vegetation layer because of the absence of drag force an interface shear τ k between these two layers located at the top of the vegetation layer was proposed by huthoff et al 2007 to build the force balance equation in the vegetation layer 3 ρ g h v s 1 λ τ k 0 h v 1 2 ρ c dl a u 2 d z 1 8 ρ f b u v 2 where the leftmost term is the gravity term ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and s is the energy slope the first term on the right is the drag force caused by the vegetation c dl is local drag coefficient u v is average velocity in the vegetation layer and u is local velocity the second term on the right is the bed resistance where f b is the darcy weisbach coefficient of the river bed for the surface layer the balance between the slide force and the interface shear is as follows 4 ρ g h s s τ k inserting eq 4 into eq 3 yields the following 5 ρ g h v s 1 λ ρ g h s s 0 h v 1 2 ρ c dl a u 2 d z 1 8 ρ f b u v 2 the local drag coefficient changes with the location z several studies have tried to realise the vertical distribution of cdl e g dunn et al 1996 nepf vivoni 2000 ghisalberti 2004 tang et al 2014 although they all have used rigid cylinders in their experiments controversial results have been reported by dunn et al 1996 nepf vivoni 2000 and ghisalberti 2004 hence further research is still needed on this topic an alternative method is the use of the bulk drag coefficient cdb to estimate the dag force this method is much simpler and has been widely used in previous studies e g huthoff et al 2007 cheng 2012 6 0 h v 1 2 ρ c dl a u 2 d z 1 2 ρ h v c db a u v 2 the bed resistance is often much smaller than the drag force and can be ignored huthoff et al 2007 on this basis the average velocity of the vegetation flow can be calculated as follows 7 u v 2 g s 1 λ h s h v c db a thus the next step should focus on how to calculate cdb constants such as c d 1 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 li et al 2015b or c d 1 13 yang and choi 2010 have been used to estimate this coefficient in some previous studies recently several studies tanino nepf 2008 cheng and nguyen 2011 cheng 2012 tinoco cowen 2013 etminan et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2018 have conducted detailed experimental theoretical and numerical research on the bulk drag coefficient for rigid emergent vegetation showing that cdb is dependent on the cylinder reynolds number re d u v d v 1 and vegetation array characteristics sonnenwald et al 2018 a similar format was shared by some of these studies tanino nepf 2008 tinoco cowen 2013 sonnenwald et al 2018 8 c db 2 α 0 re d α 1 where α 0 and α 1 are the coefficients of viscous and inertial drag effects respectively tanino nepf 2008 and tinoco cowen 2013 noted that cdb becomes independent of re d when re d is large enough for instance re d 1000 thus their formulae go as tanino nepf 2008 9 c d t n 2 0 46 3 8 λ tinoco cowen 2013 10 c d t c 2 0 58 6 49 λ sonnenwald et al 2018 proposed an empirical formula that is not dimensionally consistent 11 c d sonnenwald 2 6475 d 32 re d 17 d 3 2 λ 0 5 cheng and nguyen 2011 redefined and applied hydraulic radius to evaluate the resistance induced by emergent vegetation which also provided a formula to estimate cdb 12 c d cheng 130 r v 0 85 0 8 1 exp r v 400 where r v r v gs υ 2 1 3 υ is the kinematic viscosity of fluid and r v π 1 λ d 4 λ the formulas obtained from the emergent vegetation flow have also been tested for submerged vegetation showing acceptable consistency king et al 2012 cheng 2015 to choose a suitable formula for cdb for this study data sets from tang et al 2014 are collected to compare the performance of the aforementioned formulas eq 11 is not dimensionally consistent and hence is excluded from the comparison tang et al 2014 provided the detailed measurements of the vertical distribution of velocity in this manner the values of uv can be obtained from these measurements trapezoidal rule is applied here 13 u vm 1 h v 0 h v u d z 1 2 1 n u i u i 1 δ h i h v where u vm is the measured mean velocity in the vegetation layer u i is the measured local velocity and δ h i is the depth gap between two contiguous measuring points by transforming eq 7 the following can be obtained 14 c dbm 2 g s 1 λ h s h v a u vm 2 where c dbm represents the measured values for cdb table 1 shows the parameters and calculation results for the data sets from tang et al 2014 eq 12 which was proposed by cheng nguyen 2011 has the smallest mean relative error mre accordingly the equation was applied to calculate cdb in this study 15 mre 1 n 1 n p i b i b i where n is the total number of the data sets p i and b i are the predicted and observed values respectively the magnitude of fluctuations in velocity field is often used to estimate the shear stress according to the reynolds average navier stokes equation pope 2000 huthoff et al 2007 16 τ k τ xz ρ v x v z where vx and vz are the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the streamwise and vertical directions respectively the vx value could be scaled with us while the vertical vz is determined with particular eddies which could be described by a characteristic length scale r and a velocity scale ur gioia and bombardelli 2002 huthoff et al 2007 thus 17 τ k ρ u s u r if length scale r is much larger than the kolmogórov length i e r η η is the kolmogórov length then the rate of dissipation of turbulent energy per unit mass can be described as gioia and bombardelli 2002 huthoff et al 2007 konings et al 2012 18 ε u r 3 r according to kolmogórov s theory of turbulence ε is equal to the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass which is possessed by the largest eddies u s 2 the turnover time of the largest eddies l 1 u s for those with horizontal vorticity vector and l 2 u s for those with vertical vorticity vector is often used to characterise this energy production rate thus 19 u r 3 r ε u s 2 l 1 u s u s 2 l 2 u s l 1 l 2 l 1 l 2 u s 3 u s 3 r where r l 1 l 2 l 1 l 2 represents the systematic scale thus 20 u r u s r r 1 3 the combination of eqs 4 17 and 20 yields the following 21 g h s s r r 1 3 u s 2 eq 21 has a similar format as the darcy weisbach formula in the open channel flow without vegetation this formula can be written as li et al 2015a li huai 2016 22 ghs 1 8 f u 2 where f is the darcy weisbach coefficient and 23 f k s r c 1 3 where k s is the absolute roughness height of the river bed and r c is the hydraulic radius thus we propose an f like non dimensional coefficient fs to equate the two sides of eq 21 24 g h s s 1 8 f s u s 2 where 25 f s r r 1 3 cheng 2012 also proposed a darcy weisbach formula and a corresponding friction coefficient for the surface layer however he failed to give a derivation of this formula but directly applied the conventional darcy weisbach formula into the surface layer a completed derivation process of a darcy weisbach like formula is provided from eq 4 to eq 25 the best method to solve eq 25 may be finding an estimation method for r l1 and l2 nonetheless conducting this method at this stage is difficult because the condition of eddies in the submerged vegetated flow is complex especially in the mixing layer an alternative method is finding the relationship between f s and other dimensionless parameters with a data driven method which is the core part of this study 2 4 data to find a predictor of fs in eq 25 and next obtain a formula to predict the average velocity in the surface layer us then finally predict the bulk average velocity ub we analyze experimental data collected by li et al 2015 b from previous works shimizu et al 1991 dunn et al 1996 meijer and van velzen 1999 stone shen 2002 poggi et al 2004 murphy et al 2007 liu et al 2008 yan 2008 yang 2008 cheng 2011 lópez garcía 2001 baptist 2005 a total of 315 data sets see appendix a which used rigid cylinders with submergence h h v of 1 09 7 5 to simulate the submerged vegetation have been collected the reynolds numbers red u b d v 1 and reh u b h v 1 have the range of 61 9873 and 4138 2974200 respectively eq 7 is applied to calculate the average velocity in vegetated layer while eq 12 is applied here to calculate the drag coefficient we name these results as uvp 26 u vp 2 g s 1 λ h s h v c d cheng a we use uvp values and the measured total discharge to calculate the average velocity in the surface layer we name it as usm 27 u sm q m u vp 1 λ h v b b h s where qm is the measured discharge and b is the channel width it should be noticed that values of usm are not the real measured average velocity in surface layers in those experiments in most of the previous experiments no effort was applied to measure us or uv the only available measured data is the total discharge qm thus we use eq 26 and 27 to obtain usm and take it as measured us this method has been widely used in previous studies for example cheng 2011 and li et al 2015b however among the 315 data sets we have collected problems happen in 27 data sets in these 27 data sets we find that u vp u sm which is unreasonable section 2 3 huthoff et al 2007 huai et al 2009 nikora et al 2013 two possible reasons for this problem are 1 measurement errors in the slope meijer 1998 huthoff et al 2007 2 errors in cd when applying eq 12 i e cd cheng is actually smaller than the real cd in these data sets without an identified source of this error we only use the remaining 288 data sets in the following analysis with the 288 data sets a best fit relationship between fs and other parameters is determined with gp to avoid some dimensional coefficients we only consider non dimensional variables as feed for the gp algorithm tinoco et al 2015 several non dimensional variables are possibly related to fs cheng 2011 tinoco et al 2015 cheng 2015 including λ energy slope s h h v reynolds numbers red and reh and a h v other non dimensional parameters could be calculated with these variables such as ad 4 λ π and ah a h v h h v regarding to reynolds numbers the flow is in a fully rough turbulent area thus fs is unlikely to be influenced by the reynolds numbers meanwhile the reynolds numbers are proportional to the target parameter the average velocity thus the reynolds numbers may cause self related problems taking all these into consideration we assume that f s g s λ h h v a h v eq 24 and values of usm are used to calculate measured fs we name it as fsm 28 f sm 8 g h s s u sm 2 the next step is to use these values of fsm and other parameters to feed gp algorithm and find a predictor for fs the data bank should be grouped into the following 1 the training group that provides the formulae 2 the validation group that selects the optimal formula and 3 the testing group that judges the selected result koza 1992 the training group and validation group are used to feed the gp algorithm and the test group is used for final test however no unique and optimal approach can perform this task tinoco et al 2015 before data division the dimensionless variables require further normalization to eliminate the remarkable difference in the parameters accordingly we employ x n x i x min x max x min to normalize the given dimensionless data where x i represents the non dimensional data bank x max is the maximum dimensionless data x min is the minimum dimensionless data and x n represents the normalized data bank the division criterion used in this study is the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda camus et al 2011 the sum of squares of dissimilarity is a type of geometric distance tinoco et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and every dimensionless parameter has a non ignorable contribution because of preliminary normalization mda chooses the centroid farthest from the previous one moreover we choose the data point with the largest fsm as the first centroid mda ensures that the selected data used to obtain the predictor can best represent the data bank we select 115 40 datasets from the mda selected data as the training group another 115 40 as the validation group and the remaining datasets as the testing group then all the data sets are dis normalized to feed the gp algorithm the detailed process of the algorithm can also be found in the work of tinoco et al 2015 the data f sm s λ h h v a h v of the training and validation groups are used to feed eureqa no outliers of fsm were found in these 230 data points 2 5 formula searching eureqa provides several kinds of fitness functions to evaluate possible relationships mean absolute error mae is chosen as the error metric wang et al 2016 huai et al 2018 29 mae 1 n i 1 n p i b i the mathematical operators chosen include the constant input variable addition subtraction multiplication division exponential power and square root each mathematical operator has its own complexity value set by eureqa which could be reset by the users default values are used in this study the final complexity also called size of a formula is the sum of the complexities of all its foundational mathematical operators schmidt lipson 2013 wang et al 2016 huai et al 2018 the output of this gp routine is a suite of solutions with different complexities where a large complexity indicates a small error extremely complex formulae with high complexity generally lack physical meanings and are less practical oversimplified ones cannot extract the intrinsic relation among variables and their accuracy is relatively low thus the researcher must select a balanced result which is neither extremely complex nor oversimplified 3 results after 18 h of evaluating 7 2 10 12 formulae in 2 10 7 generations a series of solutions is obtained by eureqa and shown in table 2 a total of 14 solutions are found with a minimum complexity of 1 and maximum complexity of 33 the mae and mean squared error mse of these solutions could also be found in table 2 30 mse 1 n i 1 n p i b i 2 the non continuous relationship between the complexity and mae is shown in fig 2 thus a stair like figure frontier called pareto front is drawn in fig 2 where every solution has a point for its complexity and mae with a broken line between itself and the next solution goldstein et al 2013 wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 at the beginning when the complexity increases mae rapidly decreases however after the complexity reaches to 5 a large increase of the complexity only results in a small improvement on accuracy thus the formula with a complexity of 5 is chosen as the final solution 31 f sp 0 102 3 73 λ which means 32 r r 0 102 3 73 λ 3 eq 32 can estimate the relationship of the complex eddy scales its accuracy is successfully tested in sections 4 1 and 4 2 although the accurate scales of the dominant eddies are unknown eqs 31 and 32 provide a practical method to estimate their scale relationship according to gioia bombardelli 2002 in open channel flows without vegetation r is often taken as the absolute roughness height of the bed ks and r is taken as the hydraulic radius rc in the present study in an open channel flow with submerged vegetation eq 32 implies that the vegetation in the vegetation layer provides roughness shear stress to the surface layer the relative height r r of this kind of roughness is dependent on the vegetation density then with eq 24 33 u s 8 g h s s 0 102 3 73 λ ub could be calculated by weighted combination 34 u

stability to test the performance of eq 31 for the training validation and test groups mae and mse are calculated and shown in table 3 the discrepancy ratio dr shows the discrepancy between the measured and predicted values aghababaei et al 2017 which is also calculated the percentage of dr between 0 3 and 0 3 is often used to evaluate the performance of models zeng huai 2014 aghababaei et al 2017 huai et al 2018 which could also be found in table 3 among the three data groups no significant discrepancy in the performance of eq 31 could be found which shows its rationality 36 d r i log

the bulk average velocity according to table 4 and fig 3 for the selected data bank 288 data sets our new predictors perform better in terms of the mean relative error than other predictors generally equations that use the two layer model have lower relative error rates than those that use the single layer model maybe because of their detailed physical mechanism additionally our new predictors show higher accuracy than other two layer models which indicates the good ability of the gp algorithm to find an estimating formula from the existing data bank 4 3 limitations of the present model data sets from previous studies which have used rigid cylinders to simulate aquatic vegetation were used to build the present model thus the present model has a good accuracy but still has some limitations if used in natural rivers with vegetation for example if the vegetation is flexible then complex fluid dynamics will arise from the flexibility and the vegetation height will change with the flow rate although cheng 2011 successfully tested the applicability of the formula from rigid vegetation in the case of flexible vegetation research is still needed if the present model wants to be applied in the vegetated flow with flexible vegetation another important concern is that the cross section and vegetation geometries may also be non uniform and irregular in natural rivers therefore applying the results from the laboratory into a natural river becomes challenging on this basis average scales e g generalised cross section shape and average vegetation height and density may be used to provide a simple but useful solution 5 summary previous studies have applied various formulae for bulk average flow velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation that are deduced with different theoretical considerations in this study we employ gp a data driven method in the conventional two layer approach to craft the mathematical correlations between the f like coefficient fs and the relevant dimensionless variables fs is then applied to calculate the average velocity of the surface layer and finally the bulk average velocity of the entire cross section this new model has a relatively strong physical basement and its accuracy has lower relative deviations than previously presented ones therefore the gp obtained equation provides a new possibility to facilitate the future theoretical investigation of the mean velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation acknowledgments this work is financially supported by the natural science foundation of china nos

6586,groundwater is an important resource for drinking water supply and is subject to natural variation as well as climate change effects it has been shown that long term natural variations of groundwater levels can often be attributed to climatic oscillations long term groundwater level records are rare but of special importance for the detection of longer decadal to multi decadal periodicities which are vital for predictions of future development of groundwater levels and the distinction between natural variation and climate change effects we have examined periodicities of nine groundwater level time series with records of more than 100 years as well as possible impacts of climatic teleconnections nao amo and enso with wavelet analysis the monitoring wells are located in germany netherlands uk and denmark and cover different depths to groundwater different aquifer types and hydraulic conditions our results show that all evaluated monitoring wells exhibit significant relations to long term climatic periodicities of nao amo and enso among the wells in phreatic porous aquifers there is a signal damping which can be related to the thickness of the unsaturated zone further the damping is higher in the lower permeable aquifers and there is less damping in the karstic aquifers compared to the porous aquifers in spite of a much thicker unsaturated zone keywords long term groundwater level time series wavelet analysis climate change climatic teleconnections 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of freshwater worldwide and more than two billion people depend on groundwater for drinking water supplies mackay et al 2015 morris et al 2003 the understanding of groundwater level fluctuations including periodicities and trends is therefore of critical importance for water resource management issues as it helps to predict future variability of groundwater resources periodic control on groundwater levels from oscillatory climatic systems thereby offers a potentially valuable source of longer term forecasting capability rust et al 2018 long term systematic measurements of groundwater levels provide essential data needed to evaluate changes in the resource over time taylor and alley 2001 this is especially the case for differentiating between natural long term periodic variations of groundwater levels caused by climatic influences teleconnections which have been described by many authors in recent years e g hanson et al 2004 fleming and quilty 2006 anderson and emanuel 2008 luque espinar et al 2008 holman et

exploitation since climatic oscillations which influence precipitation distribution in space and time show multi annual to multi decadal periodicities enfield et al 2001 brönnimann et al 2007 dieppois et al 2013 these periodicities can also be found in hydrologic processes and time series like streamflow ionita 2009 niedzielski 2011 massei and fournier 2012 markovic and koch 2014 drought frequency and severity barros et al 2017 as well as spring discharges charlier et al 2015 cox et al 2009 huo et al 2016 and groundwater level responses moreover long term periodicities are of a higher importance regarding groundwater level fluctuations since high frequency oscillations are often filtered or damped during the propagation of precipitation signals through the unsaturated zone corona et al 2018 velasco et al 2017 however multi annual to multi decadal periodicities have traditionally not been considered in many studies may it be because statistical assessments of groundwater records often assume variance and autocorrelation are stationary at extra annual scales rust et al 2018 or records of groundwater are mostly too short to study long term periodicities while there have been quite a few studies of climatic teleconnections on long 80 100 years precipitation and streamflow records e g dieppois et al 2013 kumar and duffy 2009 fendeková et al 2014 for a progress report see mcgregor 2017 such long term measurements of groundwater data are rare holman et al 2011 studied periodicity in a 110 year long groundwater level time series of a monitoring well in the uk but most studies focus on groundwater time series with maximum lengths of 50 years which limits the study of decadal and multi decadal periodicities moreover the relatively short lengths may cause problems with respect to quantifying trends e g related to climate change in the data jackson et al 2015 chen and grasby 2009 e g state that given the predominance of 45 60 year climate cycles observed in instrumental records trend analyses of time series records less than 60 years should be done with caution since natural long term fluctuations in groundwater levels could be misinterpreted as trends caused by climate change or anthropogenic effects the study of long groundwater level records is thus of special importance for the detection of longer decadal to multi decadal periodicities these are vital for predictions of future groundwater level development regarding their importance for drinking water supply agricultural irrigation and sensitive ecosystems as well as the risk and impact assessment of groundwater extremes such as land subsidence or groundwater flooding a recent review of climatic teleconnection signal control on groundwater variability in europe is given by rust et al 2018 as well as a conceptual model based on current research they also identified several research gaps among these are improved quantification of spatial groundwater sensitivity to periodic control and better identification of the hydrogeological controls on signal lagging and damping in this study we examine periodicities of nine groundwater level time series with records of more than 100 years from 1915 to 2016 as well as possible impacts of precipitation and climatic teleconnections on groundwater with wavelet analysis the monitoring wells are located in germany netherlands uk and denmark and cover different depths to groundwater 2 5 to about 30 m different aquifer types porous and fractured karstic and phreatic and confined conditions the considered climatic systems are the north atlantic oscillation nao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the el niño southern oscillation enso several studies found correlations between nao and precipitation in europe e g markovic and koch 2005 massei et al 2007 and via recharge also on groundwater levels luque espinar et al 2008 in a synthesis rust et al 2018 state that while in northern europe a positive correlation between winter nao index and precipitation dominates southern and mediterranean europe reveal a strong negative correlation between winter nao and precipitation in the intermediate zone the correlation is low overall between positive and negative correlation and diminishes eastward or with distance from the coastline rust et al 2018 while some authors doubt an influence of non nao like climatic indices on europe chaudhuri et al 2011 alexander et al 2002 brönnimann et al 2007 found relations between enso and late winter climate in europe and mariotti et al 2002 could show spatially coherent correlation patterns of interannual variability of rainfall and enso for central europe during winter and spring and for western europe during autumn and spring moron and ward 1998 concluded from reviews and own studies that enso could explain about 15 20 percent of climate variance in europe already in 1994 fraedrich 1994 reviewed statistical as well as physical research about a possible long distance teleconnection link between enso and europe and concluded that some analyses support an enso europe connection though the conjectures are highly speculative in the last decade there is an emerging consensus for a robust link between european climate and enso events ineson and scaife 2009 which can be explained with stratospheric variability bell et al 2009 domeisen et al 2015 herceg bulić et al 2017 ineson and scaife 2009 stated that the response of european surface climate to the el niño signal is large enough to be useful for seasonal forecasting tabari and willems 2018 recently analysed the extreme precipitation events in europe and could show that the winter north atlantic oscillation nao and to a lesser extent winter enso signal have a controlling influence not only concurrently on european extreme precipitation anomaly in winter but in a delayed way on the extremes in the following seasons several authors could furthermore show a significant influence of amo on european climate especially for the summer months e g sutton and hodson 2005 knight et al 2006 pohlmann et al 2006 dieppois et al 2013 found relations between precipitation and temperature in england and france and amo pohlmann et al 2006 could show that special amo states lead to the fact that precipitation is enhanced in northern and decreased in southern europe and conclude that some useful decadal predictability may exist wyatt et al 2011 state a significant impact of amo on the climate in europe with a low frequency quasi cyclic climate signal of 50 80 years sutton and hodson 2005 speak of a 65 80 years cycle the latter might explain why amo has not been included in studies of groundwater level fluctuations in europe to date since these are mostly based on shorter records a problem that knight et al 2006 also state for the climate impacts of amo based on these findings and assuming that the influence of these climate indices on precipitation and temperature especially regarding long term periodicities is propagated to groundwater levels via recharge we included the nao amo and enso indices in our study as far as we know this is the first study of aquifer responses to long term climatic periodicities including amo and enso in europe 2 data and methods 2 1 groundwater level and climate data the groundwater level data comprise time series of nine wells with monthly records of 102 years from 1915 to 2016 and were selected based on the length and completeness of the water level records as well as available data regarding aquifer depth and drilling profile the monitoring wells are located in germany netherlands uk and denmark fig 1 and cover different depths to groundwater 2 5 to about 30 m different aquifer types porous and fractured karstic and phreatic and confined conditions though a confining layer could be limiting responses to climatic oscillations depending on the thickness and hydraulic conductivity two wells with presumptive confining layers have been included in the analyses one of them dalton home attributed as having a thin drift cover has been analysed before by holman et al 2011 and was therefore added for comparison furthermore the variability in the groundwater level of confined to semi confined wells can nevertheless be subject to climate oscillations at land surface either as a result of the recharge processes at the unconfined distance recharge areas of the aquifer or by damped recharge through semi permeable layers the land uses in the wells surroundings range from light urban fabric over non irrigated arable land to forest details are given in table 1 the analysed wells are widely free from anthropogenic influences that might complicate the interpretation of climatic teleconnections with the exception of copenhagen and fuhrberg where pumping activities of water plants in a distance of about 2 km each started from the 1960 on data were obtained either from online services or by request from concerned authorities data pre processing included computing monthly means in the case of higher resolutions the linear interpolation of occasional smaller data gaps up to four months and a standardisation to a zero mean and unit variance climate data precipitation and temperature were mainly obtained from the u s noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration national environmental satellite data and information service the gsom global summary of the month dataset consist of 55 climatological variables computed from summary of the day observations of the global historical climatology network daily dataset precipitation data for the uk climate stations were taken from the uk met office for germany climate data partly originates from the climate data center cdc of germany s national meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst for each groundwater monitoring well the nearest climate station with the same temporal extent precipitation data available from 1915 to 2016 was chosen fig 1 and table 1 in some cases though the resulting distance from the climate station to the groundwater well is quite far up to about 100 km in the case of chilgrove house oxford which probably constitutes some source of error in the case of chilgrove house where a nearer climate station was available southampton in a distance of about 40 km to the well but not with the same temporal extent a correlation analysis with was carried out the correlation for monthly precipitation values of the oxford and southampton climate stations resulted in 0 81 pearson r p 0 for the time of 1915 2000 taking the relatively high correlation into account we included the analysis of the precipitation time series of oxford despite the great distance 2 2 climatic indices 2 2 1 north atlantic oscillation nao the north atlantic oscillation nao is one of the major modes of variability of the northern hemispheres atmosphere hurrell 1995 it describes the sea level pressure anomalies between the azores high and the icelandic low and exhibits a principle and secondary periodicity of 8 9 years and of 3 5 years respectively hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and deser 2009 monthly nao data extended back to 1823 by jones et al 1997 based on early instrumental data were obtained from the climatic research unit university of east anglia jones et al 1997 2 2 2 atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the amo is a sea surface temperature sst anomaly observed in the north atlantic with highest intensity in the high latitudes and a low frequency quasi cyclic behaviour of 50 80 years wyatt et al 2011 amo unsmoothed monthly data were taken from the u s noaa earth system research laboratory enfield et al 2001 2 2 3 el niño southern oscillation enso the enso is a globally dominating mode of interannual climate variability and affects weather and climate worldwide brönnimann et al 2007 a number of indices are available we employ monthly data of the nino3 4 index sst averages over the area 170 120 w and 5 s 5 n from the u s noaa earth system research laboratory rayner et al 2003 the often used multivariate enso index mei could not be used since its records only start in 1950 the nino 3 4 index was chosen since this area was identified as being the most enso representative bamston et al 1997 trenberth 1997 2 3 climatic control of groundwater levels the influence of climate on groundwater levels is given by groundwater recharge signals related to precipitation p and evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration is thereby mainly controlled by temperature t the propagation of the recharge signal through the unsaturated zone is quite complex though in their review rust et al 2018 give a good overview of current research main findings are that the unsaturated zone dampens precipitation signals and the damping capacity becomes greater with increased depth and lower hydraulic conductivity that shorter periodic recharge signals are more sensitive to damping signals get lagged on their way through the unsaturated zone driven by the same characteristics as for damping and the unsaturated zone does not stretch periodic signals but preserves their periodicity bloomfield and marchant 2013 dickinson et al 2014 gurdak et al 2007 holman et al 2011 kuss and gurdak 2014 van loon 2015 in a recent study corona et al 2018 evaluated the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters based on hydrus 1d simulations they found that mean infiltration flux period of time varying infiltration and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth based on these findings we applied univariate wavelet analyses to study periodicities in all analysed time series and cross wavelet analyses between groundwater level time series precipitation and climatic indices time series to study common periodicities and coherence temperature time series were also assessed but did not show meaningful results concerning long term periodicities additionally the average power of the wavelet analyses was evaluated against hydrogeological parameters like depths to water hydraulic conditions and aquifer type 2 4 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis is a powerful method that provides an effective approach for non stationary time series like hydrologic atmospheric and other geophysical time series and has been widely applied in different fields a review on the applications of wavelet transform in hydrology time series analysis for example has been given by sang 2013 wavelet transforms expand time series into time frequency space and can therefore find localized intermittent periodicities grinsted et al 2004 there are two classes of wavelet transforms the continuous wavelet transform cwt and the discrete wavelet transform dwt the dwt is particularly useful for decomposing signals into different frequencies and e g applied in noise reduction and data compression whereas cwt is a common tool for the analysis of localized intermittent periodicities in a time series when two cwts are analysed together a cross wavelet transform xwt is constructed which exposes the common power continuous wavelet cross correlation and relative phase continuous wavelet coherence wtc in time frequency space grinsted et al 2004 continuous wavelet cross correlation provides a time scale distribution of the correlation between two signals whereas continuous wavelet coherence provides a qualitative estimator of the temporal evolution of the degree of linearity of the relationship between two signals on a given scale labat 2005 maraun and kurths 2004 recommend the use of continuous wavelet coherence wtc for the testing of causal relations between two time series since continuous wavelet cross correlation can show misleading results if one of the time series exhibits strong peaks in wavelet power whereas wavelet coherence overcomes this problem by normalizing the single wavelet power the wtc which ranges from zero to one and measures the correlation and phase shift between two time series as a function of frequency can be interpreted as a correlation coefficient between the two time series detailed theory of wavelet analysis has been extensively elucidated in many works therefore we refer the reader to relevant literature like e g foufoula georgiou and kumar 1994 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 torrence and compo 1998 or grinsted et al 2004 for further details in this study we used cwt and xwt with a morlet wavelet which is a good choice since it provides a good balance between time and frequency localization torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 monte carlo methods with a total of 1 000 realizations were used to assess the statistical significance p 0 05 against red noise backgrounds first order autoregressive ar1 as proposed by torrence and compo 1998 and grinsted et al 2004 and previously used by several authors e g holman et al 2011 massei et al 2007 the wavelet analyses was done with the original monthly data as applied in similar studies by holman et al 2011 huo et al 2016 or luque espinar et al 2008 as well as with deseasonalized data as suggested by e g kuss and gurdak 2014 the inclusion of the seasonal cycle allows additional insight especially regarding the propagation of the recharge signal through the unsaturated zone lagging and damping of different frequencies while removing the seasonal cycle prior to the analyses was additionally done to check whether longer periodic fluctuations are being superimposed by a strong seasonal behaviour in the following only the results of the original data are referred to there were only minor differences in the results after removing the seasonal cycle especially regarding significance in the univariate wavelet analyses i e some of the longer periods became significant on average that have not been significant before while the main results especially regarding the maxima of the average cross wavelet coherences remained overall unchanged for completeness the results of the wavelet analyses with the deseasonalized data are given in the electronic supplementary all computations were done in r r core team 2017 using the waveletcomp package roesch and schmidbauer 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 univariate wavelet analyses of groundwater wells precipitation and climate indices the univariate wavelet analyses give an overview of significant periodicities of the single time series the power spectra of the groundwater wells are shown in fig 2 the local maxima of the power spectra are given in table 2 all wells but one show a typical yearly cycle for six out of nine wells the 12 months period is the global power maximum the well without a 12 months periodicity is eglfing which is an unconfined well with a rather high depth to groundwater of 13 44 m table 1 the maxima of the power spectrum are at about 5 7 and 11 years with 11 3 years being the global maximum which shows a comparably low absolute average power of 3 957 this helps to support the findings that with increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone signals are damped and shorter periodic recharge signals are more sensitive to damping though other factors controlling damping like the mean annual infiltration flux soil texture or layering in the vadose zone could not be evaluated due to lacking data nevertheless this result fits well to the findings of corona et al 2018 who computed a damping depth of about 10 20 m for annual periods in a temperate climate in the copenhagen and tilburg wells the one year cycle is present but not the global maximum copenhagen is a confined well with a thick confining silt layer of 12 6 m the maxima of the power spectrum are at 1 and 84 4 years with the latter being second lowest of all global maximum by showing an average power of 2 838 the confining layer with its high thickness and rather low hydraulic conductivity might be an explanation of the overall damping of the signals as well as the lack of the shorter periodicities beside the annual signal assuming that the conductivity of the semi confining layer is still high enough to conduct recharge signals another explanation could be damping of the recharge processes at the distant recharge areas of the aquifer the power spectrum of the copenhagen well also exhibits a change in behaviour from about 1970 on where the significant periodicities especially the one year cycle seem to get vaguer which may be due to an anthropogenic influence pumping the tilburg well also shows rather low average power values compared to the other unconfined wells in porous aquifers though a one year periodicity is present its power is less than at 57 7 years being the global maximum this might be a result of the comparably fine material in contrast to the other unconfined wells in porous aquifers which makes the shorter periodicities more prone to damping the other unconfined wells in porous aquifers have their global maxima of average power at one year with values between 3 659 and 5 414 they also support the findings that signals are damped with increasing depth to groundwater since the average power of the one year periodicity correlates well with decreasing depth to groundwater pearson r 0 97 p 0 026 three of them also show significant local maxima at longer periodicities namely at about 23 and 84 years though with lower average powers two wells show a very special behaviour chilgrove house and dalton home though they have rather thick unsaturated zones of on average 28 and 17 m they show a decent one year periodicity with comparatively high average powers 10 086 and 7 730 as global maxima which is about twice as much as for the other wells this can be explained from the aquifer type which is fractured to karstic due to low specific yields the groundwater table reacts fast and damping is not as distinct as in porous aquifers among these two wells dalton home which is described as having a thin drift cover shows more damping which is also consistent with the earlier findings the chilgrove house well is the only one to show a periodicity of 6 months concerning precipitation all time series also show a one year cycle as the global maximum significant maxima of the power spectra in table 2 power spectra are provided as esm the average power values for the global maxima differ from 1 631 to 7 540 with a general trend to higher values with increasing continental climate most stations also show longer periodicities but with overall low average powers 1 0 for the nao climate index we found significant periodicities of half a year about 13 and 33 years with the global maximum at 6 months table 2 the principle periodicity of 8 9 years and a secondary periodicity of 3 5 years described in earlier works hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and deser 2009 are not classified as significant in the average power but are at least partly visible in some time periods of the power spectrum fig 3 amo shows three significant maxima of average power at 1 0 57 7 and 84 4 years with the global maximum at 57 7 years a maximum at about 9 years which is also mentioned in barros et al 2017 can be seen in the power spectrum but is not classified as significant the longer periodicities described by others e g barros et al 2017 wyatt et al 2011 for amo of 50 80 years can thereby be confirmed fig 3 enso shows the highest average powers of all three climate indices with the global maximum at one year and secondary maximum with relatively high power at 2 5 years becoming clearer from about the 1960s on confirming the often described 2 7 years cycle as nao enso also shows a maximum at 6 months though the average power is not very high fig 3 3 2 cross wavelet analyses 3 2 1 precipitation climate indices the cross wavelet analyses of the precipitation time series of three of the considered climate stations and the nao index show significant cross wavelet coherence at about one year though with relatively low average coherence values of 0 5 whereas six lack a common annual cycle table 3 some of the stations also show significant coherences at periodicities of about 13 14 years karlsruhe halle as well as of 30 40 years hannover halle de bilt table 3 especially from the 1960s on though due to the long period the average coherence is in some cases not classified as significant fig 4 where significant the 13 14 years cycles show relatively high average coherences of 0 7 some stations also reveal a coherent periodicity of about 4 5 years for some periods which is most distinct for sheffield steinhagen and copenhagen where it is significant on average over the whole time period the stations of steinhagen and hannover are quite similar which is not surprising as they are only about 100 km away from each other the de bilt and hannover stations are the only ones without a significant average coherence with nao though the power spectra show significant coherences for parts of the time period at about 14 16 years until 1930 about 32 years between 1960 and 1980 and around 64 years from 2000 on for de bilt as well as about 32 years between 1980 and 2000 for hannover regarding phase the 13 14 years cycle is similar for the stations of karlsruhe and halle with a phase difference of about a third to half a cycle duration though the influence of nao on european climate especially in winter precipitation is widely recognized it is overall rather complex wanner et al 2001 while the influence is high in northern europe with a positive correlation between nao and winter precipitation and in southern and mediterranean europe with a strong negative correlation it is low in the intermediate zone where most of our assessed stations are situated and diminishes eastward or with distance from the coastline rust et al 2018 furthermore whilst the main atmospheric driver of winter precipitation variability is well established that of summer precipitation remains unquantified due to the complexity of summer precipitation and diverse influencing factors involved tabari and willems 2018 next to the contemporaneous relation between extreme precipitation and atmospheric circulation patterns tabari and willems 2018 found that the long memory of atmospheric anomalies also creates a delayed influence especially on extreme precipitation the latter could possibly be an explanation of the phase difference of the found 13 14 year cycle though in our results the shift is slightly longer 5 6 years than found by tabari and willems 2018 regarding low frequency variability some studies suggest a nonstationary relationship of the nao across europe that is linked to interdecadal shifts in the location of the positions of the nao pressure centers vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 moore et al 2013 such displacement of the pressure nao centers points to possible existence of different nao patterns which could explain the lack of systematically strong correlations in the course of the twentieth century vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 and has been particularly identified in the period of 1930 1950 and after the 1980s moore et al 2013 though the overall coherence between precipitation and amo is less distinct than for nao some stations also reveal coherences at longer cycles at least for parts of the regarded time period but again in most cases these are not classified as significant on average table 3 with the exception of the 25 1 years and 68 6 years cycles for karlsruhe average coherence of 0 848 and 0 983 significant coherences in parts of the time period at about 8 16 years can be found for most stations and at about 25 years for oxford between 1960 and 1980 and munich 1940 1960 most of the stations also suggest coherences at about 50 80 years but only for karlsruhe this is significant due to the long period which is mostly covered by the cone of influence for enso there is a clear coherence maximum at the one year cycle for all stations seven out of nine stations show another local maximum for 6 months five stations show maxima at longer periods of about 2 7 years copenhagen de bilt 17 19 years hannover and steinhagen 30 years copenhagen and 56 years karlsruhe on average for hannover steinhagen copenhagen and karlsruhe the maxima at 17 19 30 and 56 years respectively are the global maximum with average coherences of about 0 8 overall the coherences of a certain cycle only seem to be stable over shorter time periods of about 10 20 years this is consistent with earlier findings of lópez parages and rodríguez fonseca 2012 who have found a nonstationary strong and significant impact of enso on european rainfall in late winter just for those decades throughout the twentieth century in coincidence with negative phases of amo overall precipitation and all three considered climate indices show significant coherences beyond the one year cycle at least for some of the regarded climate stations and parts of the time period which supports earlier findings of an influence of nao amo and enso on european climate 3 2 2 groundwater precipitation cross wavelet analyses of groundwater wells and precipitation of the respective climate station expectedly show significant coherence on a wide range of the power spectra with high average coherences of about 0 5 up to 0 9 fig 5 and table 3 indicating that the groundwater level of the wells are influenced by the precipitation differences between confined and unconfined wells or different depths to groundwater regarding coherences of cycle lengths are not clearly obvious all wells reveal coherences with precipitation for periods between six months and several years three of them also for quite long cycles of 30 years fuhrberg hannover copenhagen and 54 years chilgrove house oxford but without a clear pattern in terms of phase the wells reveal clear differences for the one year cycles most are out of phase with different phase shifts between about a quarter of a cycle up to more than half a cycle which could be three to more than six months but also phase shifts of longer than one year are possible for most of the wells the phase shifts of the one year cycle are varying over time this can be explained by the fact that the propagation of the precipitation signal in the unsaturated zone described by the richards equation is dependent on the prevailing moisture or water content which is in turn dependent on the previous precipitation regime this effect diminishes for longer periods and phase shifts are less likely to occur concerning the 2 8 year cycles three of the unconfined wells in the porous aquifers fuhrberg kork otterwisch as well as the unconfined karstic chilgrove house well show mostly in phase coherences indicating a probably direct reaction of the groundwater table to precipitation the other unconfined wells in the porous aquifers show phase differences depending on the cycle length for eglfing this can be explained by lagging in consequence of the high depth to groundwater for tilburg and friedrichsdorf we can only speculate that the lagging might be a result of a lower hydraulic conductivity since no detailed information of the aquifers hydraulic conductivities are recorded the confined semi confined wells copenhagen dalton home also show longer phase shifts presumably as a result of retardation of the precipitation by the semi confining layers a damping of the signal for the semi confined wells or higher depths to groundwater cannot directly be seen from the coherence analyses 3 2 3 groundwater climate indices most of the groundwater wells show at least some time periods with significant coherence to all three climate indices fig 6 unlike for precipitation the average coherences are higher for amo than for nao and highest for enso for nao the coherence seems rather low on average especially compared to precipitation table 3 only the four more northern wells of chilgrove house fuhrberg copenhagen and tilburg show coherences at longer cycles of about 4 and 13 15 years respectively this at least partly confirms earlier findings that there is a stronger influence of nao on the climate in northern europe while in the intermediate zone the correlation is overall low and diminishes eastward or with distance from the coastline rust et al 2018 regarding amo four wells chilgrove house dalton home otterwisch and tilburg show significant coherence at longer cycles of about 15 23 25 and 52 years some of the wells especially eglfing and tilburg also suggest coherences at longer periods of about 60 80 years though these are not classified as significant on average due to the long period enso shows the most distinct coherence of all climate indices to groundwater with common cycles of one year for all wells 2 5 years copenhagen otterwisch tilburg 15 18 years fuhrberg friedrichsdorf 31 years chilgrove house and kork up to 56 years tilburg for eglfing the overall coherence of groundwater and climate indices is rather low which can again be explained by the thick unsaturated zone that leads to damping an exception is the coherence to longer periods of amo at about 16 32 years from 1979 to 2000 and 64 years over the whole evaluated time span though due to the long cycles these are not classified as significant on average nevertheless this is in accordance to the theory that longer periods are less prone to damping 3 2 4 comparison of cross wavelet coherence of precipitation climate indices and groundwater climate indices for most of the groundwater wells and precipitation series the wtc power spectra with nao amo and enso look somewhat similar this might be expected when assuming that the precipitation signal is propagated to groundwater at a second look interesting differences can be recognized for some wells like chilgrove house the coherences with the climate indices are more distinct for groundwater than for precipitation this could be explained with the fact that the propagation of the precipitation to groundwater through the unsaturated zones acts like a noise filter this can be seen for all cycle lengths e g the one year cycle of enso average coherence to groundwater 0 779 vs average coherence to precipitation 0 441 or the 14 4 year cycle of nao average coherence to groundwater 0 767 vs average coherence to precipitation 0 565 and 14 9 year cycle of amo average coherence to groundwater 0 782 vs average coherence to precipitation 0 641 which are visible but not as distinct and both not classified as significant on average for precipitation to a minor degree this can also be observed for other wells for eglfing with its high depth to groundwater the comparison shows that small periodicities e g the one year cycle visible in the wtc spectrum of precipitation and enso are filtered out whereas the longer periodicities especially for amo are retained the same can be seen for the tilburg well probably caused by a comparably low hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone and though not as distinct for copenhagen and dalton home for fuhrberg and otterwisch the situation is not that clear while the coherences for amo and enso seem to be higher to groundwater for nao it is higher for precipitation at least for cycles of more than one year 4 conclusions we conducted wavelet analyses of nine groundwater level time series in europe with records of more than 100 years from 1915 to 2016 and analysed possible impacts of precipitation and climatic teleconnections on long term fluctuations of groundwater levels the major findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows univariate wavelet analyses of long term groundwater level time series show periodicities beyond the 1 year cycle namely at about 2 7 years 20 30 and 60 80 years at least for some periods in the evaluated time span especially longer periods of 11 23 57 7 and 84 4 years are classified as significant the two latter for several of the considered wells though these are on the edge of significance due to the relatively short length of the recorded time span compared to the cycle duration our analyses provide additional support of previous findings that with increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone signals are damped and shorter periodic recharge signals are more sensitive to damping moreover our results suggest that with lower permeability especially the shorter signals get damped whereas fractured to karstic aquifers with a lower specific yield are less prone to signal damping in spite of high depths to groundwater cross wavelet analyses of groundwater and precipitation show strong correlations over a wide range of periodicities supporting the expected causal relation that climatic signals are propagated to groundwater levels via recharge here the same findings for damping and lagging apply for the recharge signals our cross wavelet analyses of precipitation at nine climate stations and the nao amo and enso climate indices show significant correlations and coherences over the regarded periods as previously suggested by some authors indicating their influence on european climate the periodic signals of nao amo and enso propagate to groundwater via recharge which could be shown by cross wavelet analyses all evaluated monitoring wells show significant relations in cross wavelet power as well as cross wavelet coherence to long term climatic periodicities of nao amo or enso the average coherences are higher for amo than for nao and highest for enso probably caused by the fact that the majority of the considered wells is located in the intermediate zone where the correlation of nao and precipitation or groundwater respectively can be expected to be rather low major periodicities are 4 years and 13 14 years for nao about 15 23 25 52 and 60 80 years for amo and 2 5 15 18 31 and 56 years for enso some of the longer periodicities especially for amo are on the edge of significance due to the relatively short length of the recorded time span compared to the cycle duration the shown periodic control on groundwater levels in europe from the climate indices nao and especially amo and enso offers a valuable source of longer term forecasting capability and should also be included or at least considered in analyses of anthropogenic trends and climate change effects especially when regarding only shorter recorded groundwater time series which constitute the majority of available data moreover our study shows the importance and value of long term records of groundwater levels this should be kept in mind especially given the fact that during our search for long term groundwater data we found that in the last two decades quite a few wells with previously long records were given up probably as a result of cost savings acknowledgements groundwater level data of the chilgrove house and dalton home wells were kindly provided by the british geological survey groundwater level data of the remaining wells were taken from publicly available web services of the public authorities of baden wurttemberg bavaria lower saxony north rhine westphalia saxony denmark and the netherlands we would also like to thank the three reviewers for their constructive comments declaration of interest none declared 
6586,groundwater is an important resource for drinking water supply and is subject to natural variation as well as climate change effects it has been shown that long term natural variations of groundwater levels can often be attributed to climatic oscillations long term groundwater level records are rare but of special importance for the detection of longer decadal to multi decadal periodicities which are vital for predictions of future development of groundwater levels and the distinction between natural variation and climate change effects we have examined periodicities of nine groundwater level time series with records of more than 100 years as well as possible impacts of climatic teleconnections nao amo and enso with wavelet analysis the monitoring wells are located in germany netherlands uk and denmark and cover different depths to groundwater different aquifer types and hydraulic conditions our results show that all evaluated monitoring wells exhibit significant relations to long term climatic periodicities of nao amo and enso among the wells in phreatic porous aquifers there is a signal damping which can be related to the thickness of the unsaturated zone further the damping is higher in the lower permeable aquifers and there is less damping in the karstic aquifers compared to the porous aquifers in spite of a much thicker unsaturated zone keywords long term groundwater level time series wavelet analysis climate change climatic teleconnections 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of freshwater worldwide and more than two billion people depend on groundwater for drinking water supplies mackay et al 2015 morris et al 2003 the understanding of groundwater level fluctuations including periodicities and trends is therefore of critical importance for water resource management issues as it helps to predict future variability of groundwater resources periodic control on groundwater levels from oscillatory climatic systems thereby offers a potentially valuable source of longer term forecasting capability rust et al 2018 long term systematic measurements of groundwater levels provide essential data needed to evaluate changes in the resource over time taylor and alley 2001 this is especially the case for differentiating between natural long term periodic variations of groundwater levels caused by climatic influences teleconnections which have been described by many authors in recent years e g hanson et al 2004 fleming and quilty 2006 anderson and emanuel 2008 luque espinar et al 2008 holman et al 2011 tremblay et al 2011 perez valdivia et al 2012 kuss and gurdak 2014 dong et al 2015 velasco et al 2017 climate change effects smerdon 2017 and anthropogenic trends e g caused by over exploitation since climatic oscillations which influence precipitation distribution in space and time show multi annual to multi decadal periodicities enfield et al 2001 brönnimann et al 2007 dieppois et al 2013 these periodicities can also be found in hydrologic processes and time series like streamflow ionita 2009 niedzielski 2011 massei and fournier 2012 markovic and koch 2014 drought frequency and severity barros et al 2017 as well as spring discharges charlier et al 2015 cox et al 2009 huo et al 2016 and groundwater level responses moreover long term periodicities are of a higher importance regarding groundwater level fluctuations since high frequency oscillations are often filtered or damped during the propagation of precipitation signals through the unsaturated zone corona et al 2018 velasco et al 2017 however multi annual to multi decadal periodicities have traditionally not been considered in many studies may it be because statistical assessments of groundwater records often assume variance and autocorrelation are stationary at extra annual scales rust et al 2018 or records of groundwater are mostly too short to study long term periodicities while there have been quite a few studies of climatic teleconnections on long 80 100 years precipitation and streamflow records e g dieppois et al 2013 kumar and duffy 2009 fendeková et al 2014 for a progress report see mcgregor 2017 such long term measurements of groundwater data are rare holman et al 2011 studied periodicity in a 110 year long groundwater level time series of a monitoring well in the uk but most studies focus on groundwater time series with maximum lengths of 50 years which limits the study of decadal and multi decadal periodicities moreover the relatively short lengths may cause problems with respect to quantifying trends e g related to climate change in the data jackson et al 2015 chen and grasby 2009 e g state that given the predominance of 45 60 year climate cycles observed in instrumental records trend analyses of time series records less than 60 years should be done with caution since natural long term fluctuations in groundwater levels could be misinterpreted as trends caused by climate change or anthropogenic effects the study of long groundwater level records is thus of special importance for the detection of longer decadal to multi decadal periodicities these are vital for predictions of future groundwater level development regarding their importance for drinking water supply agricultural irrigation and sensitive ecosystems as well as the risk and impact assessment of groundwater extremes such as land subsidence or groundwater flooding a recent review of climatic teleconnection signal control on groundwater variability in europe is given by rust et al 2018 as well as a conceptual model based on current research they also identified several research gaps among these are improved quantification of spatial groundwater sensitivity to periodic control and better identification of the hydrogeological controls on signal lagging and damping in this study we examine periodicities of nine groundwater level time series with records of more than 100 years from 1915 to 2016 as well as possible impacts of precipitation and climatic teleconnections on groundwater with wavelet analysis the monitoring wells are located in germany netherlands uk and denmark and cover different depths to groundwater 2 5 to about 30 m different aquifer types porous and fractured karstic and phreatic and confined conditions the considered climatic systems are the north atlantic oscillation nao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the el niño southern oscillation enso several studies found correlations between nao and precipitation in europe e g markovic and koch 2005 massei et al 2007 and via recharge also on groundwater levels luque espinar et al 2008 in a synthesis rust et al 2018 state that while in northern europe a positive correlation between winter nao index and precipitation dominates southern and mediterranean europe reveal a strong negative correlation between winter nao and precipitation in the intermediate zone the correlation is low overall between positive and negative correlation and diminishes eastward or with distance from the coastline rust et al 2018 while some authors doubt an influence of non nao like climatic indices on europe chaudhuri et al 2011 alexander et al 2002 brönnimann et al 2007 found relations between enso and late winter climate in europe and mariotti et al 2002 could show spatially coherent correlation patterns of interannual variability of rainfall and enso for central europe during winter and spring and for western europe during autumn and spring moron and ward 1998 concluded from reviews and own studies that enso could explain about 15 20 percent of climate variance in europe already in 1994 fraedrich 1994 reviewed statistical as well as physical research about a possible long distance teleconnection link between enso and europe and concluded that some analyses support an enso europe connection though the conjectures are highly speculative in the last decade there is an emerging consensus for a robust link between european climate and enso events ineson and scaife 2009 which can be explained with stratospheric variability bell et al 2009 domeisen et al 2015 herceg bulić et al 2017 ineson and scaife 2009 stated that the response of european surface climate to the el niño signal is large enough to be useful for seasonal forecasting tabari and willems 2018 recently analysed the extreme precipitation events in europe and could show that the winter north atlantic oscillation nao and to a lesser extent winter enso signal have a controlling influence not only concurrently on european extreme precipitation anomaly in winter but in a delayed way on the extremes in the following seasons several authors could furthermore show a significant influence of amo on european climate especially for the summer months e g sutton and hodson 2005 knight et al 2006 pohlmann et al 2006 dieppois et al 2013 found relations between precipitation and temperature in england and france and amo pohlmann et al 2006 could show that special amo states lead to the fact that precipitation is enhanced in northern and decreased in southern europe and conclude that some useful decadal predictability may exist wyatt et al 2011 state a significant impact of amo on the climate in europe with a low frequency quasi cyclic climate signal of 50 80 years sutton and hodson 2005 speak of a 65 80 years cycle the latter might explain why amo has not been included in studies of groundwater level fluctuations in europe to date since these are mostly based on shorter records a problem that knight et al 2006 also state for the climate impacts of amo based on these findings and assuming that the influence of these climate indices on precipitation and temperature especially regarding long term periodicities is propagated to groundwater levels via recharge we included the nao amo and enso indices in our study as far as we know this is the first study of aquifer responses to long term climatic periodicities including amo and enso in europe 2 data and methods 2 1 groundwater level and climate data the groundwater level data comprise time series of nine wells with monthly records of 102 years from 1915 to 2016 and were selected based on the length and completeness of the water level records as well as available data regarding aquifer depth and drilling profile the monitoring wells are located in germany netherlands uk and denmark fig 1 and cover different depths to groundwater 2 5 to about 30 m different aquifer types porous and fractured karstic and phreatic and confined conditions though a confining layer could be limiting responses to climatic oscillations depending on the thickness and hydraulic conductivity two wells with presumptive confining layers have been included in the analyses one of them dalton home attributed as having a thin drift cover has been analysed before by holman et al 2011 and was therefore added for comparison furthermore the variability in the groundwater level of confined to semi confined wells can nevertheless be subject to climate oscillations at land surface either as a result of the recharge processes at the unconfined distance recharge areas of the aquifer or by damped recharge through semi permeable layers the land uses in the wells surroundings range from light urban fabric over non irrigated arable land to forest details are given in table 1 the analysed wells are widely free from anthropogenic influences that might complicate the interpretation of climatic teleconnections with the exception of copenhagen and fuhrberg where pumping activities of water plants in a distance of about 2 km each started from the 1960 on data were obtained either from online services or by request from concerned authorities data pre processing included computing monthly means in the case of higher resolutions the linear interpolation of occasional smaller data gaps up to four months and a standardisation to a zero mean and unit variance climate data precipitation and temperature were mainly obtained from the u s noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration national environmental satellite data and information service the gsom global summary of the month dataset consist of 55 climatological variables computed from summary of the day observations of the global historical climatology network daily dataset precipitation data for the uk climate stations were taken from the uk met office for germany climate data partly originates from the climate data center cdc of germany s national meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst for each groundwater monitoring well the nearest climate station with the same temporal extent precipitation data available from 1915 to 2016 was chosen fig 1 and table 1 in some cases though the resulting distance from the climate station to the groundwater well is quite far up to about 100 km in the case of chilgrove house oxford which probably constitutes some source of error in the case of chilgrove house where a nearer climate station was available southampton in a distance of about 40 km to the well but not with the same temporal extent a correlation analysis with was carried out the correlation for monthly precipitation values of the oxford and southampton climate stations resulted in 0 81 pearson r p 0 for the time of 1915 2000 taking the relatively high correlation into account we included the analysis of the precipitation time series of oxford despite the great distance 2 2 climatic indices 2 2 1 north atlantic oscillation nao the north atlantic oscillation nao is one of the major modes of variability of the northern hemispheres atmosphere hurrell 1995 it describes the sea level pressure anomalies between the azores high and the icelandic low and exhibits a principle and secondary periodicity of 8 9 years and of 3 5 years respectively hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and deser 2009 monthly nao data extended back to 1823 by jones et al 1997 based on early instrumental data were obtained from the climatic research unit university of east anglia jones et al 1997 2 2 2 atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the amo is a sea surface temperature sst anomaly observed in the north atlantic with highest intensity in the high latitudes and a low frequency quasi cyclic behaviour of 50 80 years wyatt et al 2011 amo unsmoothed monthly data were taken from the u s noaa earth system research laboratory enfield et al 2001 2 2 3 el niño southern oscillation enso the enso is a globally dominating mode of interannual climate variability and affects weather and climate worldwide brönnimann et al 2007 a number of indices are available we employ monthly data of the nino3 4 index sst averages over the area 170 120 w and 5 s 5 n from the u s noaa earth system research laboratory rayner et al 2003 the often used multivariate enso index mei could not be used since its records only start in 1950 the nino 3 4 index was chosen since this area was identified as being the most enso representative bamston et al 1997 trenberth 1997 2 3 climatic control of groundwater levels the influence of climate on groundwater levels is given by groundwater recharge signals related to precipitation p and evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration is thereby mainly controlled by temperature t the propagation of the recharge signal through the unsaturated zone is quite complex though in their review rust et al 2018 give a good overview of current research main findings are that the unsaturated zone dampens precipitation signals and the damping capacity becomes greater with increased depth and lower hydraulic conductivity that shorter periodic recharge signals are more sensitive to damping signals get lagged on their way through the unsaturated zone driven by the same characteristics as for damping and the unsaturated zone does not stretch periodic signals but preserves their periodicity bloomfield and marchant 2013 dickinson et al 2014 gurdak et al 2007 holman et al 2011 kuss and gurdak 2014 van loon 2015 in a recent study corona et al 2018 evaluated the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters based on hydrus 1d simulations they found that mean infiltration flux period of time varying infiltration and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth based on these findings we applied univariate wavelet analyses to study periodicities in all analysed time series and cross wavelet analyses between groundwater level time series precipitation and climatic indices time series to study common periodicities and coherence temperature time series were also assessed but did not show meaningful results concerning long term periodicities additionally the average power of the wavelet analyses was evaluated against hydrogeological parameters like depths to water hydraulic conditions and aquifer type 2 4 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis is a powerful method that provides an effective approach for non stationary time series like hydrologic atmospheric and other geophysical time series and has been widely applied in different fields a review on the applications of wavelet transform in hydrology time series analysis for example has been given by sang 2013 wavelet transforms expand time series into time frequency space and can therefore find localized intermittent periodicities grinsted et al 2004 there are two classes of wavelet transforms the continuous wavelet transform cwt and the discrete wavelet transform dwt the dwt is particularly useful for decomposing signals into different frequencies and e g applied in noise reduction and data compression whereas cwt is a common tool for the analysis of localized intermittent periodicities in a time series when two cwts are analysed together a cross wavelet transform xwt is constructed which exposes the common power continuous wavelet cross correlation and relative phase continuous wavelet coherence wtc in time frequency space grinsted et al 2004 continuous wavelet cross correlation provides a time scale distribution of the correlation between two signals whereas continuous wavelet coherence provides a qualitative estimator of the temporal evolution of the degree of linearity of the relationship between two signals on a given scale labat 2005 maraun and kurths 2004 recommend the use of continuous wavelet coherence wtc for the testing of causal relations between two time series since continuous wavelet cross correlation can show misleading results if one of the time series exhibits strong peaks in wavelet power whereas wavelet coherence overcomes this problem by normalizing the single wavelet power the wtc which ranges from zero to one and measures the correlation and phase shift between two time series as a function of frequency can be interpreted as a correlation coefficient between the two time series detailed theory of wavelet analysis has been extensively elucidated in many works therefore we refer the reader to relevant literature like e g foufoula georgiou and kumar 1994 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 torrence and compo 1998 or grinsted et al 2004 for further details in this study we used cwt and xwt with a morlet wavelet which is a good choice since it provides a good balance between time and frequency localization torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 monte carlo methods with a total of 1 000 realizations were used to assess the statistical significance p 0 05 against red noise backgrounds first order autoregressive ar1 as proposed by torrence and compo 1998 and grinsted et al 2004 and previously used by several authors e g holman et al 2011 massei et al 2007 the wavelet analyses was done with the original monthly data as applied in similar studies by holman et al 2011 huo et al 2016 or luque espinar et al 2008 as well as with deseasonalized data as suggested by e g kuss and gurdak 2014 the inclusion of the seasonal cycle allows additional insight especially regarding the propagation of the recharge signal through the unsaturated zone lagging and damping of different frequencies while removing the seasonal cycle prior to the analyses was additionally done to check whether longer periodic fluctuations are being superimposed by a strong seasonal behaviour in the following only the results of the original data are referred to there were only minor differences in the results after removing the seasonal cycle especially regarding significance in the univariate wavelet analyses i e some of the longer periods became significant on average that have not been significant before while the main results especially regarding the maxima of the average cross wavelet coherences remained overall unchanged for completeness the results of the wavelet analyses with the deseasonalized data are given in the electronic supplementary all computations were done in r r core team 2017 using the waveletcomp package roesch and schmidbauer 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 univariate wavelet analyses of groundwater wells precipitation and climate indices the univariate wavelet analyses give an overview of significant periodicities of the single time series the power spectra of the groundwater wells are shown in fig 2 the local maxima of the power spectra are given in table 2 all wells but one show a typical yearly cycle for six out of nine wells the 12 months period is the global power maximum the well without a 12 months periodicity is eglfing which is an unconfined well with a rather high depth to groundwater of 13 44 m table 1 the maxima of the power spectrum are at about 5 7 and 11 years with 11 3 years being the global maximum which shows a comparably low absolute average power of 3 957 this helps to support the findings that with increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone signals are damped and shorter periodic recharge signals are more sensitive to damping though other factors controlling damping like the mean annual infiltration flux soil texture or layering in the vadose zone could not be evaluated due to lacking data nevertheless this result fits well to the findings of corona et al 2018 who computed a damping depth of about 10 20 m for annual periods in a temperate climate in the copenhagen and tilburg wells the one year cycle is present but not the global maximum copenhagen is a confined well with a thick confining silt layer of 12 6 m the maxima of the power spectrum are at 1 and 84 4 years with the latter being second lowest of all global maximum by showing an average power of 2 838 the confining layer with its high thickness and rather low hydraulic conductivity might be an explanation of the overall damping of the signals as well as the lack of the shorter periodicities beside the annual signal assuming that the conductivity of the semi confining layer is still high enough to conduct recharge signals another explanation could be damping of the recharge processes at the distant recharge areas of the aquifer the power spectrum of the copenhagen well also exhibits a change in behaviour from about 1970 on where the significant periodicities especially the one year cycle seem to get vaguer which may be due to an anthropogenic influence pumping the tilburg well also shows rather low average power values compared to the other unconfined wells in porous aquifers though a one year periodicity is present its power is less than at 57 7 years being the global maximum this might be a result of the comparably fine material in contrast to the other unconfined wells in porous aquifers which makes the shorter periodicities more prone to damping the other unconfined wells in porous aquifers have their global maxima of average power at one year with values between 3 659 and 5 414 they also support the findings that signals are damped with increasing depth to groundwater since the average power of the one year periodicity correlates well with decreasing depth to groundwater pearson r 0 97 p 0 026 three of them also show significant local maxima at longer periodicities namely at about 23 and 84 years though with lower average powers two wells show a very special behaviour chilgrove house and dalton home though they have rather thick unsaturated zones of on average 28 and 17 m they show a decent one year periodicity with comparatively high average powers 10 086 and 7 730 as global maxima which is about twice as much as for the other wells this can be explained from the aquifer type which is fractured to karstic due to low specific yields the groundwater table reacts fast and damping is not as distinct as in porous aquifers among these two wells dalton home which is described as having a thin drift cover shows more damping which is also consistent with the earlier findings the chilgrove house well is the only one to show a periodicity of 6 months concerning precipitation all time series also show a one year cycle as the global maximum significant maxima of the power spectra in table 2 power spectra are provided as esm the average power values for the global maxima differ from 1 631 to 7 540 with a general trend to higher values with increasing continental climate most stations also show longer periodicities but with overall low average powers 1 0 for the nao climate index we found significant periodicities of half a year about 13 and 33 years with the global maximum at 6 months table 2 the principle periodicity of 8 9 years and a secondary periodicity of 3 5 years described in earlier works hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and deser 2009 are not classified as significant in the average power but are at least partly visible in some time periods of the power spectrum fig 3 amo shows three significant maxima of average power at 1 0 57 7 and 84 4 years with the global maximum at 57 7 years a maximum at about 9 years which is also mentioned in barros et al 2017 can be seen in the power spectrum but is not classified as significant the longer periodicities described by others e g barros et al 2017 wyatt et al 2011 for amo of 50 80 years can thereby be confirmed fig 3 enso shows the highest average powers of all three climate indices with the global maximum at one year and secondary maximum with relatively high power at 2 5 years becoming clearer from about the 1960s on confirming the often described 2 7 years cycle as nao enso also shows a maximum at 6 months though the average power is not very high fig 3 3 2 cross wavelet analyses 3 2 1 precipitation climate indices the cross wavelet analyses of the precipitation time series of three of the considered climate stations and the nao index show significant cross wavelet coherence at about one year though with relatively low average coherence values of 0 5 whereas six lack a common annual cycle table 3 some of the stations also show significant coherences at periodicities of about 13 14 years karlsruhe halle as well as of 30 40 years hannover halle de bilt table 3 especially from the 1960s on though due to the long period the average coherence is in some cases not classified as significant fig 4 where significant the 13 14 years cycles show relatively high average coherences of 0 7 some stations also reveal a coherent periodicity of about 4 5 years for some periods which is most distinct for sheffield steinhagen and copenhagen where it is significant on average over the whole time period the stations of steinhagen and hannover are quite similar which is not surprising as they are only about 100 km away from each other the de bilt and hannover stations are the only ones without a significant average coherence with nao though the power spectra show significant coherences for parts of the time period at about 14 16 years until 1930 about 32 years between 1960 and 1980 and around 64 years from 2000 on for de bilt as well as about 32 years between 1980 and 2000 for hannover regarding phase the 13 14 years cycle is similar for the stations of karlsruhe and halle with a phase difference of about a third to half a cycle duration though the influence of nao on european climate especially in winter precipitation is widely recognized it is overall rather complex wanner et al 2001 while the influence is high in northern europe with a positive correlation between nao and winter precipitation and in southern and mediterranean europe with a strong negative correlation it is low in the intermediate zone where most of our assessed stations are situated and diminishes eastward or with distance from the coastline rust et al 2018 furthermore whilst the main atmospheric driver of winter precipitation variability is well established that of summer precipitation remains unquantified due to the complexity of summer precipitation and diverse influencing factors involved tabari and willems 2018 next to the contemporaneous relation between extreme precipitation and atmospheric circulation patterns tabari and willems 2018 found that the long memory of atmospheric anomalies also creates a delayed influence especially on extreme precipitation the latter could possibly be an explanation of the phase difference of the found 13 14 year cycle though in our results the shift is slightly longer 5 6 years than found by tabari and willems 2018 regarding low frequency variability some studies suggest a nonstationary relationship of the nao across europe that is linked to interdecadal shifts in the location of the positions of the nao pressure centers vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 moore et al 2013 such displacement of the pressure nao centers points to possible existence of different nao patterns which could explain the lack of systematically strong correlations in the course of the twentieth century vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 and has been particularly identified in the period of 1930 1950 and after the 1980s moore et al 2013 though the overall coherence between precipitation and amo is less distinct than for nao some stations also reveal coherences at longer cycles at least for parts of the regarded time period but again in most cases these are not classified as significant on average table 3 with the exception of the 25 1 years and 68 6 years cycles for karlsruhe average coherence of 0 848 and 0 983 significant coherences in parts of the time period at about 8 16 years can be found for most stations and at about 25 years for oxford between 1960 and 1980 and munich 1940 1960 most of the stations also suggest coherences at about 50 80 years but only for karlsruhe this is significant due to the long period which is mostly covered by the cone of influence for enso there is a clear coherence maximum at the one year cycle for all stations seven out of nine stations show another local maximum for 6 months five stations show maxima at longer periods of about 2 7 years copenhagen de bilt 17 19 years hannover and steinhagen 30 years copenhagen and 56 years karlsruhe on average for hannover steinhagen copenhagen and karlsruhe the maxima at 17 19 30 and 56 years respectively are the global maximum with average coherences of about 0 8 overall the coherences of a certain cycle only seem to be stable over shorter time periods of about 10 20 years this is consistent with earlier findings of lópez parages and rodríguez fonseca 2012 who have found a nonstationary strong and significant impact of enso on european rainfall in late winter just for those decades throughout the twentieth century in coincidence with negative phases of amo overall precipitation and all three considered climate indices show significant coherences beyond the one year cycle at least for some of the regarded climate stations and parts of the time period which supports earlier findings of an influence of nao amo and enso on european climate 3 2 2 groundwater precipitation cross wavelet analyses of groundwater wells and precipitation of the respective climate station expectedly show significant coherence on a wide range of the power spectra with high average coherences of about 0 5 up to 0 9 fig 5 and table 3 indicating that the groundwater level of the wells are influenced by the precipitation differences between confined and unconfined wells or different depths to groundwater regarding coherences of cycle lengths are not clearly obvious all wells reveal coherences with precipitation for periods between six months and several years three of them also for quite long cycles of 30 years fuhrberg hannover copenhagen and 54 years chilgrove house oxford but without a clear pattern in terms of phase the wells reveal clear differences for the one year cycles most are out of phase with different phase shifts between about a quarter of a cycle up to more than half a cycle which could be three to more than six months but also phase shifts of longer than one year are possible for most of the wells the phase shifts of the one year cycle are varying over time this can be explained by the fact that the propagation of the precipitation signal in the unsaturated zone described by the richards equation is dependent on the prevailing moisture or water content which is in turn dependent on the previous precipitation regime this effect diminishes for longer periods and phase shifts are less likely to occur concerning the 2 8 year cycles three of the unconfined wells in the porous aquifers fuhrberg kork otterwisch as well as the unconfined karstic chilgrove house well show mostly in phase coherences indicating a probably direct reaction of the groundwater table to precipitation the other unconfined wells in the porous aquifers show phase differences depending on the cycle length for eglfing this can be explained by lagging in consequence of the high depth to groundwater for tilburg and friedrichsdorf we can only speculate that the lagging might be a result of a lower hydraulic conductivity since no detailed information of the aquifers hydraulic conductivities are recorded the confined semi confined wells copenhagen dalton home also show longer phase shifts presumably as a result of retardation of the precipitation by the semi confining layers a damping of the signal for the semi confined wells or higher depths to groundwater cannot directly be seen from the coherence analyses 3 2 3 groundwater climate indices most of the groundwater wells show at least some time periods with significant coherence to all three climate indices fig 6 unlike for precipitation the average coherences are higher for amo than for nao and highest for enso for nao the coherence seems rather low on average especially compared to precipitation table 3 only the four more northern wells of chilgrove house fuhrberg copenhagen and tilburg show coherences at longer cycles of about 4 and 13 15 years respectively this at least partly confirms earlier findings that there is a stronger influence of nao on the climate in northern europe while in the intermediate zone the correlation is overall low and diminishes eastward or with distance from the coastline rust et al 2018 regarding amo four wells chilgrove house dalton home otterwisch and tilburg show significant coherence at longer cycles of about 15 23 25 and 52 years some of the wells especially eglfing and tilburg also suggest coherences at longer periods of about 60 80 years though these are not classified as significant on average due to the long period enso shows the most distinct coherence of all climate indices to groundwater with common cycles of one year for all wells 2 5 years copenhagen otterwisch tilburg 15 18 years fuhrberg friedrichsdorf 31 years chilgrove house and kork up to 56 years tilburg for eglfing the overall coherence of groundwater and climate indices is rather low which can again be explained by the thick unsaturated zone that leads to damping an exception is the coherence to longer periods of amo at about 16 32 years from 1979 to 2000 and 64 years over the whole evaluated time span though due to the long cycles these are not classified as significant on average nevertheless this is in accordance to the theory that longer periods are less prone to damping 3 2 4 comparison of cross wavelet coherence of precipitation climate indices and groundwater climate indices for most of the groundwater wells and precipitation series the wtc power spectra with nao amo and enso look somewhat similar this might be expected when assuming that the precipitation signal is propagated to groundwater at a second look interesting differences can be recognized for some wells like chilgrove house the coherences with the climate indices are more distinct for groundwater than for precipitation this could be explained with the fact that the propagation of the precipitation to groundwater through the unsaturated zones acts like a noise filter this can be seen for all cycle lengths e g the one year cycle of enso average coherence to groundwater 0 779 vs average coherence to precipitation 0 441 or the 14 4 year cycle of nao average coherence to groundwater 0 767 vs average coherence to precipitation 0 565 and 14 9 year cycle of amo average coherence to groundwater 0 782 vs average coherence to precipitation 0 641 which are visible but not as distinct and both not classified as significant on average for precipitation to a minor degree this can also be observed for other wells for eglfing with its high depth to groundwater the comparison shows that small periodicities e g the one year cycle visible in the wtc spectrum of precipitation and enso are filtered out whereas the longer periodicities especially for amo are retained the same can be seen for the tilburg well probably caused by a comparably low hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone and though not as distinct for copenhagen and dalton home for fuhrberg and otterwisch the situation is not that clear while the coherences for amo and enso seem to be higher to groundwater for nao it is higher for precipitation at least for cycles of more than one year 4 conclusions we conducted wavelet analyses of nine groundwater level time series in europe with records of more than 100 years from 1915 to 2016 and analysed possible impacts of precipitation and climatic teleconnections on long term fluctuations of groundwater levels the major findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows univariate wavelet analyses of long term groundwater level time series show periodicities beyond the 1 year cycle namely at about 2 7 years 20 30 and 60 80 years at least for some periods in the evaluated time span especially longer periods of 11 23 57 7 and 84 4 years are classified as significant the two latter for several of the considered wells though these are on the edge of significance due to the relatively short length of the recorded time span compared to the cycle duration our analyses provide additional support of previous findings that with increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone signals are damped and shorter periodic recharge signals are more sensitive to damping moreover our results suggest that with lower permeability especially the shorter signals get damped whereas fractured to karstic aquifers with a lower specific yield are less prone to signal damping in spite of high depths to groundwater cross wavelet analyses of groundwater and precipitation show strong correlations over a wide range of periodicities supporting the expected causal relation that climatic signals are propagated to groundwater levels via recharge here the same findings for damping and lagging apply for the recharge signals our cross wavelet analyses of precipitation at nine climate stations and the nao amo and enso climate indices show significant correlations and coherences over the regarded periods as previously suggested by some authors indicating their influence on european climate the periodic signals of nao amo and enso propagate to groundwater via recharge which could be shown by cross wavelet analyses all evaluated monitoring wells show significant relations in cross wavelet power as well as cross wavelet coherence to long term climatic periodicities of nao amo or enso the average coherences are higher for amo than for nao and highest for enso probably caused by the fact that the majority of the considered wells is located in the intermediate zone where the correlation of nao and precipitation or groundwater respectively can be expected to be rather low major periodicities are 4 years and 13 14 years for nao about 15 23 25 52 and 60 80 years for amo and 2 5 15 18 31 and 56 years for enso some of the longer periodicities especially for amo are on the edge of significance due to the relatively short length of the recorded time span compared to the cycle duration the shown periodic control on groundwater levels in europe from the climate indices nao and especially amo and enso offers a valuable source of longer term forecasting capability and should also be included or at least considered in analyses of anthropogenic trends and climate change effects especially when regarding only shorter recorded groundwater time series which constitute the majority of available data moreover our study shows the importance and value of long term records of groundwater levels this should be kept in mind especially given the fact that during our search for long term groundwater data we found that in the last two decades quite a few wells with previously long records were given up probably as a result of cost savings acknowledgements groundwater level data of the chilgrove house and dalton home wells were kindly provided by the british geological survey groundwater level data of the remaining wells were taken from publicly available web services of the public authorities of baden wurttemberg bavaria lower saxony north rhine westphalia saxony denmark and the netherlands we would also like to

of this event which was likely due to the strong impact of enso in antecedent periods keywords compound event dry and hot prediction enso 1 introduction compound events have received much attention in recent years due to their amplified impacts on the agricultural production ecosystem energy security and human health seneviratne et al 2012 zscheischler et al 2018 likewise compound drought and hot events such as the 2003 and 2010 summer heatwaves in europe accompanied by drought are among the most disastrous compound events miralles et al 2014 flach et al 2018 for example such events during summer 2010 in russia caused a loss of 25 annual crop production barriopedro et al 2011 in order to reduce associated potential impacts it is important that early warnings of likely occurrence are issued in advance and to that end the accurate prediction is needed a compound event involves multiple contributing variables so its characterization requires the joint behavior of these variables for example a dry hot event is generally characterized by precipitation deficit and positive temperature anomaly or heat wave its joint behavior can be modeled using a bivariate distribution of drought and heat or precipitation and temperature cong and brady 2012 aghakouchak et al 2014 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 employed a copula based joint distribution to characterize the occurrence of compound dry hot events at the global scale and showed that such events tended to occur when there was a negative dependence between precipitation and temperature during the summer season recent progress along this line includes the development of indicators for characterizing compound extremes events for example for the compound event characterized by low rainfall low soil moisture and high temperature hao et al 2018a employed their joint probability as an indicator to characterize the severity of compound events by taking into account multiple contributing variables different mechanisms that cause the occurrence of compound events have been explored such as the common external factor e g circulation anomaly or the feedback seneviratne et al 2012 kopp et al 2017 the atmosphere ocean circulation anomaly has been shown to affect the dry and hot conditions or precipitation and temperature anomalies at regional and global scales mcphaden et al 2006 mishra and singh 2011 arblaster and alexander 2012 yang and delsole 2012 sun et al 2015 dittus et al 2018 liu et al 2018 which mostly focused on individual occurrence of dry or hot conditions recently hao et al 2018b investigated the relationship between enso and compound dry hot events at the global scale and showed the important role of enso in their occurrence in several regions including northern south america africa southeast asia and australia these results on the impact of enso on dry and hot conditions imply that enso is an important source of predictability of the compound event due to the lower ability to adapt to and recover from disasters partly resulting from the poverty and political instability southern africa is among the most vulnerable regions to weather and climate variabilities or extremes williams et al 2008 ipcc 2014 in recent decade southern africa has suffered from serious drought and hot events which have affected the water supplies food security and even human health ceccherini et al 2017 understanding and predicting drought and hot extremes in this region is thus of particular importance the climate in southern africa is sensitive to the sea surface temperature sst anomalies a variety of studies have evaluated the relationship between rainfall in southern african and sst anomalies with focus on three ocean basins including remote effects from the pacific and local and remote effects from the indian ocean and south atlantic ocean williams et al 2008 previous studies have shown that enso plays an important role in the climate variability in the study region lyon 2009 meque and abiodun 2015 lakhraj govender and grab 2018 pomposi et al 2018 during austral summer below average precipitation is generally associated with positive phase of enso or el niño and above average precipitation with negative phase of enso or la niña meque and abiodun 2015 hoell and cheng 2018 manatsa et al 2017 moreover the high temperature has also been shown to be associated with enso and tends to co occur with rainfall deficit in southern africa lyon 2009 overall studies have shown that el niño related to anomalous high pressure generally suppressed rainfall and increased the surface temperature through moisture reduction ratnam et al 2014 hoell and cheng 2018 manatsa et al 2018 leading to the occurrence of dry and hot conditions though substantial progresses have been made in characterizing both dry and hot events and understanding their causing mechanisms in southern africa the prediction of the severity of compound dry hot events which is in pressing need due to adverse impacts is still lacking the objective of this study therefore is to propose a statistical approach to predict the severity of compound dry hot events characterized by a compound event indicator the meta gaussian model was employed to derive the conditional distribution for the prediction of the indicator the model was then applied for predicting the severity of compound dry hot events in southern africa 2 method 2 1 multivariate distribution for a random vector x 1 x 2 xn the joint probability distribution can be expressed as 1 p x 1 x n p x 1 x 1 x n x n the joint distribution characterizes the joint behavior of multiple variables e g precipitation and temperature precipitation and streamflow and can be used as an indicator to characterize an extreme event e g drought beersma and buishand 2004 kao and govindaraju 2010 hao et al 2018a however a multivariate distribution in high dimensions that is capable of modeling flexible dependence is still a challenge several alternatives to address this challenge include the development of the vine copula aas et al 2009 liu et al 2015 which is based on the decomposition of dependence into several pair copulas or the meta gaussian model kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 montanari and brath 2004 herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 which is based on the assumption of multivariate normal distribution with underlying variables transformed by the normal quantile transformation nqt krzysztofowicz 1997 the advantage of the meta gaussian model or mg model is that it is capable of modeling the full range of dependence and the form of the conditional distribution is explicit which is convenient for prediction purposes hao et al 2016 in the following we will employ the joint distribution and conditional distribution of the meta gaussian model see appendix to derive the indicator and construct the conditional distribution for the prediction of compound dry hot events 2 2 indicator based on the joint distribution for the univariate case marginal probability distributions have been commonly used to derive standardized indicators such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized temperature index sti zscheischler et al 2014 the procedure for deriving standardized indicators is essentially the nqt from which a normal random variate e g spi and sti can be obtained in this study we are particular interested in the compound dry hot event for the bivariate case represented by x 1 and x 2 if the drought and hot condition is characterized by the two standardized indicators spi x 1 and sti x 2 the joint probability of the compound dry hot event can be expressed as 2 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 p x 1 x 1 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 the joint distribution p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 can be constructed using equation a1 in which a bivariate normal distribution is assumed the marginal distribution p x 1 x 1 is essentially a normal distribution then the joint probability in equation 2 can be estimated accordingly and used as the indicator of the compound dry hot event hao et al 2018a hao et al 2019 the joint probability p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 may not be uniformly distributed which differs from the marginal probability in the univariate case the percentile approach has been employed to facilitate the comparison of indices at different regions for example mo and lettenmaier 2014 developed an objective drought classification method for the drought monitoring by remapping the drought index to a uniform distribution using the empirical cumulative distribution of the percentile following the same approach we standardize the joint probability based on the nqt for the ease of understanding and implementation of the indicator to characterize compound dry hot events specifically a parametric or nonparametric distribution f is fitted to the joint probability and then the standardization based on the standard normal distribution ф is performed the resulting standardized compound event indicator scei for the compound dry hot event can then be expressed as 3 scei φ 1 f p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 where ф 1 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution it is noted that the scei is essentially a normal random variate similar to the commonly used drought indicators e g spi or sti a low value of scei indicates a low probability p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 in equation 2 implying a more severe condition of compound dry hot events to avoid the assumption about the parametric distribution the distribution f can be estimated based the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 2 3 prediction based on the conditional distribution the conditional distribution has been commonly employed for statistical predictions in hydrology yan et al 2012 khedun et al 2014 liu et al 2016 specifically the conditional distribution of the random variable xn conditioned on a suite of predictors x 1 xn 1 can be expressed as 4 p x n x 1 x n 1 the scei derived from eq 3 can be used to measure the severity of a compound dry hot event thus the severity of a compound event can be predicted by predicting scei through constructing the conditional distribution of scei with respect to several predictors if the predictors are transformed by nqt then the conditional distribution of scei in eq 4 is essentially a normal distribution by assuming a multivariate normal distribution of the predictor and predictand see appendix wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 for example in the trivariate case the conditional distribution of scei i e x 3 given values of two random variables x 1 and x 2 which are obtained based on the nqt can be expressed as hao et al 2016 5 x 3 x 1 x 2 n μ σ 2 where μ and σ are the conditional mean and standard variation of the normal distribution n usually the conditional mean μ can be used as the predicted value of scei since the full distribution of the predictand scei is available from eq 5 the model also provides a probabilistic prediction for example the probability of the predicted scei lower than a specific threshold t0 can be computed as n t 0 μ σ2 hao et al 2016 3 data and results 3 1 data the study area is southern africa defined as 15 s 35 s and 10 e 40 e which has been struck by both drought and heat events in recent decades since compound dry hot events are of particularly interest we focused on the austral summer december january and february djf during which southern africa receives most of the annual precipitation williams et al 2008 lyon 2009 monthly precipitation and temperature data from the climatic research unit cru ts v 3 25 of the university of east anglia http www cru uea ac uk data harris et al 2014 were used to define compound dry hot events for the period 1951 2016 the niño 3 4 sea surface temperature sst averaged sst from 5s to 5 n and 170 120 w was obtained from global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 rayner et al 2003 the spi mckee et al 1993 and sti zscheischler et al 2014 were used to represent drought and hot conditions which were computed based on the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 to facilitate the statistical prediction the nqt is applied to niño 3 4 sst index resulting in a standard normal random variable denoted as snino34 3 2 performance measure the mean absolute error mae was used as a measure to assess the prediction performance of the proposed model which is defined as follows 6 mae 1 n i 1 n s i o i where si and oi are predicted and observed values of scei for a specific period i n is the number of prediction periods or instances in addition the proposed model also enables a probabilistic prediction the brier score bs which is essentially the mean squared error of probability predictions is employed to measure the performance of the probabilistic prediction and is defined as wilks 2011 7 bs 1 n i 1 n f i p o i 2 where fi is the predicted probability from the model poi is the observed probability 0 if it does not occur and 1 if it occurs the bs takes the value in the range 0 bs 1 with bs 0 indicating perfect prediction wilks 2011 a reference prediction is generally needed for the evaluation of the prediction performance in this case the brier skill score bss is used to evaluate the probabilistic prediction skill which is defined as wilks 2011 8 bss 1 bs b s ref where bs ref is the bs computed from the reference prediction the bss ranges from to 1 bss 0 represents no skill and bss 1 represents the perfect skill compared to the reference prediction for the deterministic prediction the reference prediction is defined as the persistence forecast for example for the 3 month lead prediction of december scei the observed value of september scei is used as the reference prediction for the probabilistic prediction the random forecast is used as the reference prediction wilks 2011 for example the random forecast probability of scei lower than 0 5 corresponding to the 30th percentile is 0 3 3 3 compound dry hot events in historical records we first illustrate the property of scei in capturing compound dry hot events based on monthly precipitation and temperature data in december during 1951 2016 monthly precipitation and temperature data were first averaged over the study area from which scei was computed from eq 3 as shown in fig 1 the spi and sti values of december for 1951 2016 in southern africa are also shown in fig 1 for comparisons severe drought events are shown from the spi for 1972 1982 1992 1994 1997 2003 2015 in southern africa which is generally consistent with previous studies masih et al 2014 in addition positive temperature anomalies are shown for several periods such as 1972 1997 2004 and 2015 lyon 2009 ceccherini et al 2017 for example the spi and sti values for december 2015 were 1 76 and 2 39 respectively indicating the concurrence of dry and hot conditions the scei value was generally low and negative when the spi showed the drought condition and the sti indicated the hot condition implying the compound dry hot event for example the scei value for december 2015 was 2 39 indicating the severe condition of a compound dry hot event to further illustrate the property of scei the spatial pattern of dry and hot conditions based on scei for december 1972 1982 2003 and 2015 in southern africa are shown in fig 2 the scei value was low in regions with both dry and hot conditions for example during 2003 the drought and hot condition was shown mostly in eastern regions based on spi and sti respectively the compound dry hot condition from scei mainly resided in the eastern region which generally captured both dry and hot conditions overall these results showed that the scei provided a useful measure of compound dry hot events and can hence be employed for the prediction of compound events 3 4 predictor selection for prediction purposes suitable predictors are needed to construct the prediction model though several factors have been shown to affect the precipitation and temperature in southern africa it has been recognized that enso was the major driver of the precipitation variability in this regions pomposi et al 2018 which has been shown to be the basis for the seasonal prediction during the austral summer in this region yuan et al 2014 pomposi et al 2018 thus the snino34 is selected as one predictor to further show the suitability of using enso as a predictor in predicting compound dry hot conditions based on scei we showed the lag 1 and lag 3 correlation coefficient significant at 0 05 significance level between scei and snino34 for december january and february for the period 1951 2016 in fig 3 significant correlation coefficients were found in a large region of the study area for example for december significant correlations were observed in most of the study area except for the northwestern and southwestern region the overall negative correlation coefficients between enso and scei implied that a higher value of nino34 or el niño during djf tended to lead to more severe conditions of the compound dry hot condition or low values of scei in southern africa these results suggest it is reasonable to incorporate enso as a predictor to predict scei in addition the persistence of scei e g november scei for one month lead prediction of december scei was also used as a predictor which provided the initial condition of the compound dry hot event thus two predictors including the antecedent scei representing the initial condition and enso representing the external forcing were used for the prediction of the severity of compound events the conditional distribution in eq 5 can then be employed for predicting compound dry hot conditions with the predictand scei and predictors of antecedent scei and snino34 3 5 prediction skill the leave one out cross validation loocv wilks 2011 was used to assess the prediction skill of scei of djf for the period 1951 2016 specifically for n observations and predictors the fitting of the mg model was repeated for n times with a sample size n 1 for each time during which one observation and its corresponding predictor were left out the omitted observation was then predicted based on the mg model with parameter estimated from the remaining n 1 data for example for predicting scei of december 2011 the observations for the period 1951 2010 and 2012 2016 were used to construct the conditional distribution of the mg model this procedure was repeated n times to predict the scei of each december during 1951 2016 and the mae and bss values were then estimated the difference of mae for the prediction from the proposed approach and persistence maeproposed maepersistence is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that for 1 month and 3 month predictions mae was consistently lower than that of the persistence model for most regions moreover for the 3 month prediction the mae difference was larger and negative than that of the 1 month prediction this implies that for the long lead time prediction the external forcing i e enso plays a more important role in the prediction than does the persistence the bss for the 1 and 3 month lead probabilistic prediction of scei 0 5 for december january and february is shown in fig 5 the bss was higher than 0 for 1 and 3 month lead predictions for most regions indicating the proposed model consistently performed better than the reference prediction the bss of 3 month lead prediction for december scei was similar to that of 1 month lead prediction without significant decrease this is likely due to the strong enso impact partly shown from the significant correlation between nino34 and scei for december fig 3 overall these results showed the skillful prediction of the compound dry hot condition represented by scei based on enso 4 case study during summer 2015 2016 southern africa was struck by a compound dry hot event yuan et al 2018 we use this compound event during december 2015 as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed model for the prediction observations from 1951 to 2014 were used to estimate distribution parameters of the conditional distribution in eq 5 which was then used to predict the severity of compound events for the target period i e december 2015 the 1 and 3 month lead prediction of scei is shown in fig 6 a b the 1 month lead prediction of scei resembled the observation shown in fig 2 relatively well in most of the study area except for regions such as southwest moreover the 3 month lead prediction also showed a good performance the 1 and 3 month lead prediction of the probability of scei lower than 0 5 is shown in fig 6 c d for the 1 and 3 month lead prediction regions with a higher probability of scei 0 5 generally resembled the regions with scei 0 5 in observations fig 2 these results imply that the compound dry hot event during december 2015 in southern africa can be predicted relatively well up to 3 month lead time the main reason of the good performance of the 3 month lead prediction was likely due to the strong enso in the previous period which was used as a predictor in the proposed model overall these results highlight the usefulness of the proposed model in predicting compound dry hot events based on enso 5 conclusion in this study a statistical approach based on the meta gaussian model is proposed for the prediction of the severity of compound dry hot events in southern africa based on enso a standardized indicator to characterize compound dry hot conditions was first derived based on which the conditional distribution was constructed for prediction purposes the assessment of the prediction skill showed that the proposed model outperformed the persistence for both 1 and 3 month lead predictions the prediction of severe conditions of the compound dry hot event during december 2015 was used as a case study it was found that the proposed model performed well in predicting this event for 1 and 3 month lead time which was likely due to the important role played by enso the prediction approach proposed in this study relies on the high correlation between the compound precipitation temperature indicator i e scei and preceding enso which results from the strong influence of enso on both precipitation and temperature in southern africa the concept of using the indicator integrating multiple variables and enso for the climate prediction to aid early warning of natural hazards e g drought in southern africa has been explored in previous studies meque and abiodun 2015 showed that enso was better linked to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a multiscalar drought indicator based on precipitation and temperature vicente serrano et al 2010 than to the spi based on precipitation alone manatsa et al 2017 also demonstrated the strong influence of enso on spei with large temporal lag and used this property for the drought prediction in southern africa resulting in good prediction performance results from this study confirmed the strong influence of enso on both drought and hot event or precipitation and temperature and demonstrated the applicability of using enso for predicting compound dry hot events in this region we mainly focused on the monthly time scale to define dry and hot conditions however certain hot extremes such as heat wave is commonly characterized based on data of the daily time scale perkins 2015 in addition we used the enso as the predictor representing the external forcing while there are other processes that may contribute to the occurrence of dry and hot events or extremes in southern africa such as the indian ocean dipole iod hoell and cheng 2018 hoell et al 2017 moreover the relationship between enso and precipitation temperature which is employed in this study to construct the predicting model may be subject to variations under greenhouse warming kim et al 2014 lakhraj govender and grab 2018 manatsa et al 2018 this may lead to uncertainties in the prediction result and calls for improved understanding of how enso and it impacts on dry hot condition will change under global warming advanced models that takes into account the nonstationarity in time series of compound events should also be explored for improved prediction meng et al 2019 these limitations will be further investigated in our future studies the proposed approach is expected to be useful for the early warning and informed decision making in southern africa to reduce adverse impact of compound dry hot events a global compound events monitoring and prediction system gcemaps based on precipitation and temperature is under development and this approach will be used as the prediction component of this system declaration of interests none declared acknowledgments we thank the editors and reviewers for

pressing need due to adverse impacts is still lacking the objective of this study therefore is to propose a statistical approach to predict the severity of compound dry hot events characterized by a compound event indicator the meta gaussian model was employed to derive the conditional distribution for the prediction of the indicator the model was then applied for predicting the severity of compound dry hot events in southern africa 2 method 2 1 multivariate distribution for a random vector x 1 x 2 xn the joint probability distribution can be expressed as 1 p x 1 x n p x 1 x 1 x n x n the joint distribution characterizes the joint behavior of multiple variables e g precipitation and temperature precipitation and streamflow and can be used as an indicator to characterize an extreme event e g drought beersma and buishand 2004 kao and govindaraju 2010 hao et al 2018a however a multivariate distribution in high dimensions that is capable of modeling flexible dependence is still a challenge several alternatives to address this challenge include the development of the vine copula aas et al 2009 liu et al 2015 which is based on the decomposition of dependence into several pair copulas or the meta gaussian model kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 montanari and brath 2004 herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 which is based on the assumption of multivariate normal distribution with underlying variables transformed by the normal quantile transformation nqt krzysztofowicz 1997 the advantage of the meta gaussian model or mg model is that it is capable of modeling the full range of dependence and the form of the conditional distribution is explicit which is convenient for prediction purposes hao et al 2016 in the following we will employ the joint distribution and conditional distribution of the meta gaussian model see appendix to derive the indicator and construct the conditional distribution for the prediction of compound dry hot events 2 2 indicator based on the joint distribution for the univariate case marginal probability distributions have been commonly used to derive standardized indicators such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized temperature index sti zscheischler et al 2014 the procedure for deriving standardized indicators is essentially the nqt from which a normal random variate e g spi and sti can be obtained in this study we are particular interested in the compound dry hot event for the bivariate case represented by x 1 and x 2 if the drought and hot condition is characterized by the two standardized indicators spi x 1 and sti x 2 the joint probability of the compound dry hot event can be expressed as 2 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 p x 1 x 1 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 the joint distribution p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 can be constructed using equation a1 in which a bivariate normal distribution is assumed the marginal distribution p x 1 x 1 is essentially a normal distribution then the joint probability in equation 2 can be estimated accordingly and used as the indicator of the compound dry hot event hao et al 2018a hao et al 2019 the joint probability p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 may not be uniformly distributed which differs from the marginal probability in the univariate case the percentile approach has been employed to facilitate the comparison of indices at different regions for example mo and lettenmaier 2014 developed an objective drought classification method for the drought monitoring by remapping the drought index to a uniform distribution using the empirical cumulative distribution of the percentile following the same approach we standardize the joint probability based on the nqt for the ease of understanding and implementation of the indicator to characterize compound dry hot events specifically a parametric or nonparametric distribution f is fitted to the joint probability and then the standardization based on the standard normal distribution ф is performed the resulting standardized compound event indicator scei for the compound dry hot event can then be expressed as 3 scei φ 1 f p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 where ф 1 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution it is noted that the scei is essentially a normal random variate similar to the commonly used drought indicators e g spi or sti a low value of scei indicates a low probability p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 in equation 2 implying a more severe condition of compound dry hot events to avoid the assumption about the parametric distribution the distribution f can be estimated based the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 2 3 prediction based on the conditional distribution the conditional distribution has been commonly employed for statistical predictions in hydrology yan et al 2012 khedun et al 2014 liu et al 2016 specifically the conditional distribution of the random variable xn conditioned on a suite of predictors x 1 xn 1 can be expressed as 4 p x n x 1 x n 1 the scei derived from eq 3 can be used to measure the severity of a compound dry hot event thus the severity of a compound event can be predicted by predicting scei through constructing the conditional distribution of scei with respect to several predictors if the predictors are transformed by nqt then the conditional distribution of scei in eq 4 is essentially a normal distribution by assuming a multivariate normal distribution of the predictor and predictand see appendix wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 for example in the trivariate case the conditional distribution of scei i e x 3 given values of two random variables x 1 and x 2 which are obtained based on the nqt can be expressed as hao et al 2016 5 x 3 x 1 x 2 n μ σ 2 where μ and σ are the conditional mean and standard variation of the normal distribution n usually the conditional mean μ can be used as the predicted value of scei since the full distribution of the predictand scei is available from eq 5 the model also provides a probabilistic prediction for example the probability of the predicted scei lower than a specific threshold t0 can be computed as n t 0 μ σ2 hao et al 2016 3 data and results 3 1 data the study area is southern africa defined as 15 s 35 s and 10 e 40 e which has been struck by both drought and heat events in recent decades since compound dry hot events are of particularly interest we focused on the austral summer december january and february djf during which southern africa receives most of the annual precipitation williams et al 2008 lyon 2009 monthly precipitation and temperature data from the climatic research unit cru ts v 3 25 of the university of east anglia http www cru uea ac uk data harris et al 2014 were used to define compound dry hot events for the period 1951 2016 the niño 3 4 sea surface temperature sst averaged sst from 5s to 5 n and 170 120 w was obtained from global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 rayner et al 2003 the spi mckee et al 1993 and sti zscheischler et al 2014 were used to represent drought and hot conditions which were computed based on the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 to facilitate the statistical prediction the nqt is applied to niño 3 4 sst index resulting in a standard normal random variable denoted as snino34 3 2 performance measure the mean absolute error mae was used as a measure to assess the prediction performance of the proposed model which is defined as follows 6 mae 1 n i 1 n s i o i where si and oi are predicted and observed values of scei for a specific period i n is the number of prediction periods or instances in addition the proposed model also enables a probabilistic prediction the brier score bs which is essentially the mean squared error of probability predictions is employed to measure the performance of the probabilistic prediction and is defined as wilks 2011 7 bs 1 n i 1 n f i p o i 2 where fi is the predicted probability from the model poi is the observed probability 0 if it does not occur and 1 if it occurs the bs takes the value in the range 0 bs 1 with bs 0 indicating perfect prediction wilks 2011 a reference prediction is generally needed for the evaluation of the prediction performance in this case the brier skill score bss is used to evaluate the probabilistic prediction skill which is defined as wilks 2011 8 bss 1 bs b s ref where bs ref is the bs computed from the reference prediction the bss ranges from to 1 bss 0 represents no skill and bss 1 represents the perfect skill compared to the reference prediction for the deterministic prediction the reference prediction is defined as the persistence forecast for example for the 3 month lead prediction of december scei the observed value of september scei is used as the reference prediction for the probabilistic prediction the random forecast is used as the reference prediction wilks 2011 for example the random forecast probability of scei lower than 0 5 corresponding to the 30th percentile is 0 3 3 3 compound dry hot events in historical records we first illustrate the property of scei in capturing compound dry hot events based on monthly precipitation and temperature data in december during 1951 2016 monthly precipitation and temperature data were first averaged over the study area from which scei was computed from eq 3 as shown in fig 1 the spi and sti values of december for 1951 2016 in southern africa are also shown in fig 1 for comparisons severe drought events are shown from the spi for 1972 1982 1992 1994 1997 2003 2015 in southern africa which is generally consistent with previous studies masih et al 2014 in addition positive temperature anomalies are shown for several periods such as 1972 1997 2004 and 2015 lyon 2009 ceccherini et al 2017 for example the spi and sti values for december 2015 were 1 76 and 2 39 respectively indicating the concurrence of dry and hot conditions the scei value was generally low and negative when the spi showed the drought condition and the sti indicated the hot condition implying the compound dry hot event for example the scei value for december 2015 was 2 39 indicating the severe condition of a compound dry hot event to further illustrate the property of scei the spatial pattern of dry and hot conditions based on scei for december 1972 1982 2003 and 2015 in southern africa are shown in fig 2 the scei value was low in regions with both dry and hot conditions for example during 2003 the drought and hot condition was shown mostly in eastern regions based on spi and sti respectively the compound dry hot condition from scei mainly resided in the eastern region which generally captured both dry and hot conditions overall these results showed that the scei provided a useful measure of compound dry hot events and can hence be employed for the prediction of compound events 3 4 predictor selection for prediction purposes suitable predictors are needed to construct the prediction model though several factors have been shown to affect the precipitation and temperature in southern africa it has been recognized that enso was the major driver of the precipitation variability in this regions pomposi et al 2018 which has been shown to be the basis for the seasonal prediction during the austral summer in this region yuan et al 2014 pomposi et al 2018 thus the snino34 is selected as one predictor to further show the suitability of using enso as a predictor in predicting compound dry hot conditions based on scei we showed the lag 1 and lag 3 correlation coefficient significant at 0 05 significance level between scei and snino34 for december january and february for the period 1951 2016 in fig 3 significant correlation coefficients were found in a large region of the study area for example for december significant correlations were observed in most of the study area except for the northwestern and southwestern region the overall negative correlation coefficients between enso and scei implied that a higher value of nino34 or el niño during djf tended to lead to more severe conditions of the compound dry hot condition or low values of scei in southern africa these results suggest it is reasonable to incorporate enso as a predictor to predict scei in addition the persistence of scei e g november scei for one month lead prediction of december scei was also used as a predictor which provided the initial condition of the compound dry hot event thus two predictors including the antecedent scei representing the initial condition and enso representing the external forcing were used for the prediction of the severity of compound events the conditional distribution in eq 5 can then be employed for predicting compound dry hot conditions with the predictand scei and predictors of antecedent scei and snino34 3 5 prediction skill the leave one out cross validation loocv wilks 2011 was used to assess the prediction skill of scei of djf for the period 1951 2016 specifically for n observations and predictors the fitting of the mg model was repeated for n times with a sample size n 1 for each time during which one observation and its corresponding predictor were left out the omitted observation was then predicted based on the mg model with parameter estimated from the remaining n 1 data for example for predicting scei of december 2011 the observations for the period 1951 2010 and 2012 2016 were used to construct the conditional distribution of the mg model this procedure was repeated n times to predict the scei of each december during 1951 2016 and the mae and bss values were then estimated the difference of mae for the prediction from the proposed approach and persistence maeproposed maepersistence is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that for 1 month and 3 month predictions mae was consistently lower than that of the persistence model for most regions moreover for the 3 month prediction the mae difference was larger and negative than that of the 1 month prediction this implies that for the long lead time prediction the external forcing i e enso plays a more important role in the prediction than does the persistence the bss for the 1 and 3 month lead probabilistic prediction of scei 0 5 for december january and february is shown in fig 5 the bss was higher than 0 for 1 and 3 month lead predictions for most regions indicating the proposed model consistently performed better than the reference prediction the bss of 3 month lead prediction for december scei was similar to that of 1 month lead prediction without significant decrease this is likely due to the strong enso impact partly shown from the significant correlation between nino34 and scei for december fig 3 overall these results showed the skillful prediction of the compound dry hot condition represented by scei based on enso 4 case study during summer 2015 2016 southern africa was struck by a compound dry hot event yuan et al 2018 we use this compound event during december 2015 as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed model for the prediction observations from 1951 to 2014 were used to estimate distribution parameters of the conditional distribution in eq 5 which was then used to predict the severity of compound events for the target period i e december 2015 the 1 and 3 month lead prediction of scei is shown in fig 6 a b the 1 month lead prediction of scei resembled the observation shown in fig 2 relatively well in most of the study area except for regions such as southwest moreover the 3 month lead prediction also showed a good performance the 1 and 3 month lead prediction of the probability of scei lower than 0 5 is shown in fig 6 c d for the 1 and 3 month lead prediction regions with a higher probability of scei 0 5 generally resembled the regions with scei 0 5 in observations fig 2 these results imply that the compound dry hot event during december 2015 in southern africa can be predicted relatively well up to 3 month lead time the main reason of the good performance of the 3 month lead prediction was likely due to the strong enso in the previous period which was used as a predictor in the proposed model overall these results highlight the usefulness of the proposed model in predicting compound dry hot events based on enso 5 conclusion in this study a statistical approach based on the meta gaussian model is proposed for the prediction of the severity of compound dry hot events in southern africa based on enso a standardized indicator to characterize compound dry hot conditions was first derived based on which the conditional distribution was constructed for prediction purposes the assessment of the prediction skill showed that the proposed model outperformed the persistence for both 1 and 3 month lead predictions the prediction of severe conditions of the compound dry hot event during december 2015 was used as a case study it was found that the proposed model performed well in predicting this event for 1 and 3 month lead time which was likely due to the important role played by enso the prediction approach proposed in this study relies on the high correlation between the compound precipitation temperature indicator i e scei and preceding enso which results from the strong influence of enso on both precipitation and temperature in southern africa the concept of using the indicator integrating multiple variables and enso for the climate prediction to aid early warning of natural hazards e g drought in southern africa has been explored in previous studies meque and abiodun 2015 showed that enso was better linked to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a multiscalar drought indicator based on precipitation and temperature vicente serrano et al 2010 than to the spi based on precipitation alone manatsa et al 2017 also demonstrated the strong influence of enso on spei with large temporal lag and used this property for the drought prediction in southern africa resulting in good prediction performance results from this study confirmed the strong influence of enso on both drought and hot event or precipitation and temperature and demonstrated the applicability of using enso for predicting compound dry hot events in this region we mainly focused on the monthly time scale to define dry and hot conditions however certain hot extremes such as heat wave is commonly characterized based on data of the daily time scale perkins 2015 in addition we used the enso as the predictor representing the external forcing while there are other processes that may contribute to the occurrence of dry and hot events or extremes in southern africa such as the indian ocean dipole iod hoell and cheng 2018 hoell et al 2017 moreover the relationship between enso and precipitation temperature which is employed in this study to construct the predicting model may be subject to variations under greenhouse warming kim et al 2014 lakhraj govender and grab 2018 manatsa et al 2018 this may lead to uncertainties in the prediction result and calls for improved understanding of how enso and it impacts on dry hot condition will change under global warming advanced models that takes into account the nonstationarity in time series of compound events should also be explored for improved prediction meng et al 2019 these limitations will be further investigated in our future studies the proposed approach is expected to be useful for the early warning and informed decision making in southern africa to reduce adverse impact of compound dry hot events a global compound events monitoring and prediction system gcemaps based on precipitation and temperature is under development and this approach will be used as the prediction component of this system declaration of interests none declared acknowledgments we thank the editors and reviewers for

bioreactors reflectometry is a widely used method for estimating volumetric water content θ in permeable media but material specific calibration functions should be developed this study aimed at developing relationships between the bulk dielectric permittivity ε b and θ in woodchips considering their particle size distribution psd temperature t and the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air ε sa the ε b of fine medium and coarse psds were measured with cs616 l water content reflectometers up to θ of 0 83 cm3 cm3 and at t c of 10 24 37 55 and 70 calibration equations were developed using a multivariate power law function fitted to the data with a hierarchical bayesian inference procedure the best fit r 2 0 96 rmse 0 04 cm3 cm3 was obtained for the fine psd ε sa 1

carlo 1 introduction monitoring water content within ground woody biomass woodchips is important for practitioners in the agricultural energy forestry and waste management industries afzal et al 2009 fenton et al 2014 kannepalli et al 2016 for instance open stockpiles of woodchips present potential environmental hazards through their ability to self ignite li et al 2006 and generate harmful leachate during precipitation and irrigation events hedmark and scholz 2008 tao et al 2005 there is also an economic incentive to maintain the quality of the stockpiled woodchip materials by keeping the piles sufficiently dry lenz et al 2015 lin and pan 2015 additionally woodchips are popularly used as filling medium in denitrifying bioreactors addy et al 2016 jitka et al 2017 their ability to maintain high hydraulic conductivity van driel et al 2006 which is a function of their water content subroy et al 2014 is key to their efficiency and long term operation time domain reflectometry tdr is a widely used method for measuring spatiotemporal variations in water content due to its accuracy practicality and ability to be automated jones et al 2002 this technique computes the apparent bulk dielectric permittivity ε b which is defined as the squared ratio of the propagation velocity of an electromagnetic em pulse in vacuum relative to the medium in which the waveguide is embedded jones et al 2002 the dielectric permittivity of oven dry wood material ε s with density between 0 1 and 1 5 g cm3 varies from 1 3 to 4 5 when measured at a frequency of 100 mhz which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that of pure deionized water ε w 80 this contrast is used to detect water content by measuring the bulk medium s dielectric permittivity topp et al 1980 torgovnikov 1993 water content reflectometers such as the cs616 l model manufactured by campbell scientific inc have been promoted as a cost effective alternative to tdr instruments as they are durable for long term usage in the field and do not require a separate waveform analysis to compute ε b instead reflectometers are internally programmed to record the number of em pulse reflections per second which is proportional to ε b and through calibration to the volumetric water content θ kelleners et al 2005 however because water content reflectometers operate at a lower frequency 175 mhz than traditional tdr instruments 500 1000 mhz they are more sensitive to surrounding environmental conditions such as temperature kapiliratne and lu 2017 as well as characteristics of the material itself such as porosity composition and specific surface area roth et al 1990 malicki et al 1996 or and wraith 1990 skierucha et al 2012 as a consequence material specific relationships between ε b and θ that consider the effect of temperature should be developed when using the cs616 l probe quinones et al 2003 logsdon 2009 bulk dielectric permittivity is commonly related to water content using the third order polynomial relationship proposed by topp et al 1980 or the linearized equation proposed by ledieu et al 1986 these and other empirical relationships table 1 have been calibrated to measure stem

configuration of the constituents is difficult to know a priori and it is typically obtained by fitting the model to data e g paz et al 2010 the scope of this study was to calibrate a mathematical relationship between ε b and θ as measured by a cs616 l water content reflectometer in mixtures of woodchip particles of various sizes and temperatures between 10 and 70 c this corresponds roughly to the range of temperatures measured in controlled experimental woodchip stockpiles kannepalli 2014 and also covers standard temperature conditions within agricultural denitrifying beds 10 c addy et al 2016 the objectives were to 1 determine if particle size and or temperature were significant factors for modeling the θ v s ε b relationship in woodchip mixtures and 2 calibrate θ v s ε b functions taking into account any significant factors a hierarchical bayesian inference framework was used such that the uncertainty of the calibration function and measurements are accounted for during the parameter inference process 2 materials and methods the θ v s ε b relationship was measured in woodchip samples with three different particle size distributions at five different temperatures 10 c 24

polypropylene containers that were 32 5 cm long 15 cm wide and had a height of 10 cm each container had five apertures on the side that were distributed uniformly from the base to the top of the container male luer fittings 0 16 cm in i d were attached to each aperture which served as both water delivery and drainage ports fig 2 filter paper was applied over the ports on the inside surface of the container to prevent them from clogging during drainage and to facilitate a uniform dispersion of water during saturation a cs616 l water content reflectometer and a 109 l thermistor both campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were inserted horizontally into the container at a height of 4 cm through openings made in the plastic fig 2 air dried woodchip material was packed incrementally around the waveguides to a dry bulk density of 0 245 0 049 g cm3 which is similar to that measured in experimental woodchip stockpiles kannepalli 2014 a run consisted of a saturation experiment followed by a drainage drying experiment for each of the three woodchip samples each run was performed at the five temperatures starting with the lowest temperature of 10 c runs conducted at temperatures between 10 c and 40 c were carried out in a growth chamber gc15 environmental growth chambers chagrin falls oh while those performed at 55 c and 70 c were done in an oven model 800 memmert gmbh co kg schwabach de before each run started at a particular temperature the containers of packed material along with the reservoir of deionized water used to saturate the samples were equilibrated at that desired temperature overnight containers were covered with lids during saturation experiments to reduce evaporative losses however the lids did not seal air tight at the beginning of the saturation experiment all three samples one per container were simultaneously wetted from the reservoir through a syringe pump equipped with six 3 ml capacity syringes soil measurement systems tucson az usa that delivered water at an average rate of 19 4 ml min with an average standard deviation of 1 4 ml min water from two syringes was directed into a single tube connected to a five way manifold each line of the manifold was connected to one of the five ports along the side of the containers through a one way valve that prevented backflow each container was placed on a balance xs 32001l mettler toledo columbus oh usa with precision of 0 1 g to measure the amount of water being delivered into the samples fig 2 readings from the balances were collected every minute using the lab x software mettler toledo while data from the probes were collected simultaneously using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc a saturation experiment ended when the box was filled and the output from the cs616 l sensor had stabilized at this time the syringe pump was turned off the lids were removed the manifold was disconnected and the water in the samples was allowed to drain by gravity and simultaneously evaporate the decreasing weights of the open containers as well as the corresponding cs616 l and 109 l probe readings were recorded every minute for the first 2 h and every 15 or 30 min after that after gravity driven drainage had ceased the samples were allowed to dry by evaporation at near constant temperature for the next 2 3 days before starting a new run with the same material at the next higher temperature at 55 c and 70 c the calibration set up had to be modified because the balances and the syringe pump could not be placed inside the drying oven the weight of water added to the container was determined by weighing the container before and after saturation and dividing the added weight of water equally across the saturation time during free drainage at 55 c and 70 c water draining from the samples was routed through tubing attached to the ports which emptied into separate containers placed on the balances outside of the drying oven free drainage ended once water ceased to flow out by gravity at this time the lids were removed and water from the packed material was allowed to evaporate the packed containers were then periodically weighed over the next 5 6 days after a run had been recorded at each temperature and for each sample the containers were re packed with a new subsample of the same material and the entire procedure was repeated in order to obtain duplicate data sets 2 2 determination of the water content the effective volume sensed by the cs616 l water content reflectometer was smaller and had a different shape than the container thus the size and shape of this volume had to be estimated to properly account for the fraction of the total water actually within the sensor s range at any given time perpendicular to the direction of the waveguides the sensed area was assumed to have the shape of an ellipse ferré et al 2002 germann 2017 following baker and lascano 1989 the three dimensional shape of the effective volume was a half ellipsoid cut on its vertical axis at the point of insertion of the waveguides into the sensor head fig 3 the effective volume considered had a constant length of 30 cm the length of the probes and a constant width of 15 cm the width of the container the height dimension of the volume changed each run and was computed from the range of the water level when the sensors initially responded to changes in water content to when they ceased to respond the response of the sensor during saturating and free drainage experiments followed a symmetrical sigmoidal relationship data not shown similar to the one reported in germann 2017 this implies that the shape of the response was the same at the early and late stages of saturation drainage and that the effective sensing volume did not change over time as a result of the ellipsoidal shape of the effective volume equal filling draining rates resulted in larger changes in the readings made by the cs616 l as the level of water approached the waveguides fig 3 this is because changes in water content closer to the waveguide occurred within a larger portion of the effective volume whereas the opposite is true with changes in water content further from the waveguide the ratio of the effective volume filled over the total volume of the container that was filled was used to correct for the amount of water inside the effective volume this correction method was used for saturating experiments and the free drainage portion of the draining experiments for the evaporative drying part of the draining experiments changes in water content were assumed to be uniform throughout the container because the relationship between the sensor s output and mass of the drying woodchips was linear data not shown a similar assumption is used to interpret evaporation from soils schindler et al 2010 and leads to a linear decrease of water from the bottom of the container to the evaporating surface since sensors were placed in the middle of that vertical span measurements are representative of the woodchips average water content during evaporation 2 3 apparent bulk dielectric permittivity the output of the cs616 l water content reflectometer is period p t which is inversely related to the number of pulse reflections recorded per second f r t 1 and can be used to compute the travel time t t by the following relationship campbell and anderson 1998 2 t 2 f r p s f where s f is a scaling factor equal to 1024 for the cs616 reflectometer model logsdon 2009 in turn travel time t and ε b are related as follows kelleners et al 2005 3 ε b t 2 t d c 4 l a where t d is the delay time between the step pulse voltages emitted by the reflectometer and is approximately equal to 5 4 10 9 s c is the speed of light 3 0 108 m s and l a is the apparent length of the waveguide which is not equal to its physical length 30 cm but is instead taken to be 26 cm logsdon 2009 the rationale for converting p to ε b was to allow for comparisons with other tdr studies and their reported calibration relationships with θ 2 4 inference bayesian inference methods were applied to address uncertainty arising from experimental procedures hypothesis testing and the selection of a calibration function bayesian methods assign probabilistic distributions to the parameters being inferred and then update them based on observational data gelman et al 2015 in this work the parameters were conditioned with measurements of ε b and θ in a normal likelihood function such that the maximum a posteriori estimates for the parameters could similarly be attained with a least squares regression the mean of the normal likelihood function was set equal to θ predicted by a given calibration function the standard deviation of the normal likelihood function which is related to the root mean square error rmse of the calibration function was inferred along with the unknown parameters of the calibration function a hierarchical bayesian inference model was used to obtain posterior probability distributions for all of the inferred parameters of a calibration function that translated the experimental data from ε b to θ for either a specific particle size distribution or temperature group level and for all data overall level simultaneously gelman et al 2015 the parameter values were assumed to be unknown at all levels in the hierarchical model therefore weakly informative prior distributions were assigned to give more weight on the data during the inference procedure group level parameters subjected to inference were pooled under common normal prior distributions each defined by an unknown common mean and unknown common variance hyperparameters in bayesian terminology gelman et al 2015 the hyperparameters which defined the calibration function at the overall level were also unknown and were assigned their own prior distributions hyperpriors the common mean was assigned a flat normal hyperprior distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of 10 000 the common variance was assigned a flat uniform hyperprior distribution between 0 0001 and 10 000 the rmse was inferred independently for all groups in the hierarchical model and in each case it was assigned a flat gamma distribution with both shape parameters equal to 0 00001 gelman et al 2015 the r package rjags was used to identify the posterior distribution for all of the unknown parameters plummer 2016 four mcmc chains were each programmed to run for a burn in period of 10 000 generations until all four chains converged for each parameter convergence was diagnosed with the gelman and rubin 1992 scale reduction statistic r as calculated by the coda package plummer et al 2006 chains were considered converged when r stabilized below 1 05 after which it was assumed that any subsequent mcmc sample was to be accepted as a member of the posterior distribution in total 40 000 independent samples from the posterior distribution were drawn 10 000 from each of the four chains for each parameter and used for hypothesis testing and uncertainty analyses the posterior distribution of the inferred parameters were summarized by their 95 credible interval cr i which is a continuous range of values that has a 95 probability of containing the true parameter value in it the 95 cr i for the group level parameters were compared by contrast subtracting one from the other in order to determine significant differences between temperature and particle size groups separately if the 95 cr i for a given contrast was overlapping contained zero then the effects between the two groups could be considered insignificant gelman and hill 2016 multiple comparisons between particle size and temperature groups are acceptable within bayesian hierarchical models because all of the parameters are obtained simultaneously from common prior distributions partial pooling gelman et al 2012 the 95 cr i s for the inferred parameters of the calibration functions were used to identify a 95 cr i for θ given a measurement of ε b the 95 prediction interval p i was also identified for θ which is an interval that takes into account the uncertainty of the measurements by considering the 40 000 posterior samples of the rmse the p i for θ is wider than the cr i for θ although it should be noted that both intervals are centered around the same conditional mean value of θ 2 5 calibration two separate nonlinear regressions were set up using the hierarchical bayesian formalism to individually assess the effects of particle size and temperature on the θ v s ε b relationship the equation used in this hierarchical regression was 4 θ j α j ε b j ε sa j β j where α j and β j are empirical fitting parameters of the jth group where j 3 for particle size fine medium and coarse or j 5 for temperature 10 c 24 c 37 c 55 c and 70 c the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air ε sa was measured for each particle size when the material was air dried before the start of the 10 c run these values were subtracted from ε b to force the regressions through the physically determined origin i e when θ 0 cm3 cm3 then ε b ε sa this assumes ε sa is invariant to changes in temperature because the increase in ε s with increasing temperature is minor enough that the effect can be neglected torgovnikov 1993 once the effects of particle size and temperature had been analyzed using the contrast method described in section 2 4 a power law function of the form 5 θ j α j ε b j ε sa j β 1 j t β 2 j was calibrated for each particle size group using a hierarchical multiple nonlinear regression with two continuous covariates ε b and temperature t c a set of α β 1 and β 2 parameters were inferred for each particle size group group level and for all data overall level as well as the rmse for each group 15 total parameters equation 5 was simplified by pooling the data and assuming ε sa 1 making it independent of particle size 6 θ α ε b 1 β 1 t β 2 after applying this modification the posterior parameter estimates were obtained in a simpler non hierarchical bayesian model which had four unknown parameters α β 1 and β 2 and the rmse 2 6 validation three measurements of θ and ε b were made at target water contents of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 cm3 cm3 for each particle size at room temperature by thoroughly mixing known masses of water and woodchips and packing the mix around the waveguide of the cs616 l sensor in addition field measurements were acquired from an experimental woodchip pile comprised of finely ground woodchip materials dg 1554 µm that was instrumented with multiple cs616 l water content reflectometers and 109 l temperature probes placed at different locations within the pile kannepalli 2014 at the end of a six month field experiment three samples of woodchips were taken in close proximity to each of 13 probes in all cases the volumetric water content was determined by the gravimetric method and the bulk density of the material because the three measurements at a given location within the pile were always in close agreement with one another the average between them was used in the validation the root mean square deviation rmsd square root of the sum of the squared residuals divided by the number of samples and the percent relative difference bias average residual divided by the average measured value of θ were used as metrics to assess deviations between predictions and the validation data 3 results and discussion experiments conducted at the five temperatures yielded a wide range of θ v s ε b measurements that were not adequately fit by the temperature independent functions found throughout the literature fig 4 table 1 the majority of these functions were developed with tdr measurements taken in whole wood which usually has a greater density and holds less water than ground wood materials the linearized function calibrated by gray and spies 1995 for use in decaying logs of wood with similar porosity to woodchips 0 7 cm3 cm3 kannepalli 2014 closely followed the trend of the experimental data collected in this study fig 4 the power law roth et al 1990 and maxwell garnett sihvola and kong 1988 mixing models as used by paz et al 2010 were the only functions that were calibrated specifically for use in comminuted wood materials their predictions fall within the range of measured values but are restricted to the θ interval used in their development 0 08 0 3 cm3 cm3 the experimental design in this study allowed measurements to be made over almost the entire range of possible water contents for a woodchip mixture this would have been difficult to achieve had the highly porous woodchip samples been mixed and measured separately with the gravimetric method this is particularly true for measurements taken close to saturation as water within the large inter particle pores would be preferentially distributed towards the bottom of the container since the gravimetric method assumes a homogenous water content this would then lead to an under or overestimation of ε b depending on the position of the waveguide relative to the saturated region in the container the drawback of the experimental design however was that the sensor s effective volume needed to be calculated for each individual experiment in order to accurately compute θ and relate it to measurements of ε b the vertical axis of the effective volume decreased with particle size table 2 probably because coarse woodchip mixtures had a sharp wetting drying front that could only be sensed when in close proximity to the waveguides fig 3 on the contrary capillary forces in fine particle mixtures created a diffuse wetting drying front ultimately causing the sensor to react sooner and more gradually than in the coarse mixture fig 3 the effective volume was also determined to be smaller in saturation experiments when the woodchips started at a drier condition than during draining experiments table 2 likely because of greater sensitivity of the sensor when water instead of air is the continuous phase baker and lascano 1989 ferré et al 1996 which was the case during draining experiments 3 1 particle size and temperature effects the 95 cr i for the parameter contrasts of eq 4 provide an indication of the similarity between the posterior distributions of the two groups compared if the cr i of a contrast contains 0 it is likely that the true value for that parameter is the same for both groups in contrast if the cr i does not contain 0 then it is fair to conclude that the two groups are significantly different from one another how the two groups differ can be gauged by the sign positive or negative and magnitude distance from zero of the 95 cr i for that contrast gelman and hill 2016 since none of the 95 cr i for the contrasts between the inferred parameters of eq 4 contained 0 temperature and particle size were both deemed significant for modeling the θ v s ε b relationship for woodchip materials fig 5 accordingly particle size was considered a categorical covariate while temperature was included as a continuous covariate in the calibration function eq 5 contrasts of the 95 cr i for the parameters of eq 4 show that the θ v s ε b relationship was most similar between the medium and coarse woodchip mixtures as they were closest to zero while the opposite is true for contrasts between the fine and coarse mixtures fig 5a malicki et al 1996 used bulk density to account for differences in the θ v s ε b relationship in porous materials with different particle sizes in this study the bulk density values of the woodchip mixtures were virtually the same subroy et al 2014 thus a more probable explanation for these observed differences is how the woodchip particles and their pore network are spatially arranged in relation to the orientation of the em field ansoult et al 1985 roth et al 1990 jones and or 2002 for fine woodchip mixtures the pore network contains smaller pores that are likely to lead to a more continuous water phase that transmits the em pulse with less interference from components with low dielectric permittivity such as solid wood or air when this is the case the θ v s ε b relationship tends to be linear in contrast coarse woodchip mixtures have a more disconnected water phase caused by interferences with large woodchip particles or air voids resulting in a nonlinear θ v s ε b relationship another reason for the observed differences between particle size groups is that insufficient contact between the waveguides and coarse woodchips affected the reproducibility of the measurements this is evidenced by the increase in the mean rmse from eq 4 computed from the 40 000 samples in the posterior distribution for the fine 0 04 cm3 cm3 medium 0 06 cm3 cm3 and coarse 0 07 cm3 cm3 woodchip mixtures data not shown notice that the mean rmse values for the medium and coarse woodchips are most similar to each other and so are their 95 cr i s for their inferred parameters fig 5a with regard to temperature the θ v s ε b relationship was most similar at temperatures between 10 c and 37 c and at temperatures 55 c and 70 c fig 5b this also coincides with the rmse of the five temperature groups from eq 4 which increased greatly above 37 c fig 6 the mean rmse from eq 4 at and below 37 c was 0 04 cm3 cm3 while above 37 c it was 0 08 cm3 cm3 data not shown overall the measurements made at temperatures 24 c and 37 c were the most alike in terms of their 95 cr i for the contrasted parameter values potentially indicating that temperature may not need to be included as a covariate if measurements of ε b are taken between 24 c and 37 c fig 5b however it is common for the temperature to exceed 37 c within woodchip stockpiles especially towards the insulated center of large piles where metabolic processes are constantly producing heat li et al 2006 temperature conditions within agricultural denitrifying beds are typically less than 24 c addy et al 2016 the specific surface area of a material varies with particle size and controls how much water can be adsorbed which in turn affects the θ v s ε b relationship at varying temperature conditions or and wraith 1990 jones and or 2002 adsorbed water molecules that are bound by intermolecular forces to hydroxyl groups in the cell wall of the woodchip materials are rotationally hindered which results in a lower dielectric signature ε bw 5 than free liquid water molecules torgovnikov 1993 jones and or 2002 as a consequence at low water contents and low temperature bound water will reduce measurements of ε b through what is known as the thermodielectric effect or and wraith 1990 jones and or 2002 conversely as temperature increases bound water desorbs and values of ε b tend to increase without change in θ this phenomenon was most apparent at low water contents in the fine woodchip particles fig 6a which have a larger specific surface area than coarse particles bekhta and haziroglu 2002 at high water contents the thermodielectric effect has less influence because all possible sorption sites are occupied but increases in temperature may noticeably decrease the value of ε w e g values of ε w at 10 c and 70 c are about 84 and 66 respectively or and wraith 1990 this effect is slightly apparent in the medium and coarse woodchip mixtures fig 6b and c although the high variability in the measurements and reduced accuracy of the reflectometer at high temperature water content campbell scientific inc 2016 kapiliratne and lu 2017 makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions 3 2 calibration the ε sa of the particular woodchip mixture was subtracted from ε b in eq 5 so that the prediction of θ was not influenced by temperature when θ 0 cm3 cm3 table 3 torgovnikov 1993 reports that solid wood with a similar bulk density to the woodchip materials used in the experiments 0 2 g cm3 had ε s values between 1 14 and 1 18 measured at a tdr frequency of 100 1000 mhz in this study values of ε sa include the influence of air and can be used to infer the amount of contact between the woodchips and the waveguides values of ε sa close to 1 would indicate a prevalence of air voids i e poor contact between the sensor and the solid wood material whereas ε sa values close to ε s would indicate near perfect contact equation 5 with optimized parameter values for fine medium and coarse woodchip particle sizes fitted the data reasonably well but rmse increased with particle size table 3 consequently the 95 cr i and p i for the predictions of θ were narrower for the fine in comparison to the medium and coarse woodchip calibration relationships fig 7 this increase may have been caused by poorer contact between the sensor and the woodchips in the coarser mixtures than in fine this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that one of the fine woodchip replicates had a ε sa value closest to the dielectric permittivity of solid wood ε s whereas one of the coarse material replicates had the lowest value of ε sa table 3 the variability in the measurements also increased with temperature fig 6 according to the user manual the cs616 l reflectometers have an operational temperature range from 0 to 70 c although measurements made at 40 c can have as much as 2 and 6 error when the volumetric water content is 12 and 30 respectively measurement error above 40 c has not been quantified but is expected to be much larger especially as the woodchips become more saturated personal communication with campbell scientific inc which is apparent from the scatter of the data points displayed in the 55⁰ and 70 c subplots incorporated in fig 7 the goodness of fit statistics for eq 6 were only slightly lower than those for eq 5 for the medium and coarse woodchip mixtures table 3 application of eq 6 is best suited when the particle size distribution for a woodchip mixture is uncharacterized and or ε sa is unknown assuming ε sa 1 in eq 6 is somewhat arbitrary however since measurements of ε b should never be less than the dielectric permittivity of air this value was chosen so that the predicted value for θ could not be negative 3 3 validation the d g 1554 µm and bulk density 0 296 g cm3 of the woodchip mixture used to construct the field pile was determined at the beginning of the experiment and was comparable to the d g of the fine woodchip mixture used in the calibration fig 7 kannepalli 2014 using the mean parameter values for the fine particle size calibration equation table 3 the rmsd of the field measured water content was 0 13 cm3 cm3 and the bias was 19 however the validation measurements were taken at the end of the 6 month experimental period after there was sufficient time for the finer sized woodchip particles to migrate downward towards the bottom of the pile and after the woodchips had undergone decomposition and compaction when the mean parameter values for eq 6 i e all in table 3 were used to predict θ the rmsd was reduced to 0 11 cm3 cm3 and the bias was lowered to 10 the field validation points that were not contained within the 95 p i were located at the bottom edge of the pile two data points in the 37 c and one in the 55 c subplots of fig 7 where compaction is purported to be highest and where the finest particles tend to accumulate and directly in the center the one data point in the 70 c subplot of fig 7 where temperature is highest it should be noted that the field validation data points were not made exactly at the temperature of the graph they are displayed in which also could explain some of the variation outside of the temperature specific p i displayed in fig 7 the laboratory validation measurements were only made at room temperature but were completed for all particle sizes these measurements had a rmsd of 0 08 cm3 cm3 and a 4 bias using the mean parameter values for eq 5 and a rmsd of 0 06 cm3 cm3 and a 7 bias using the mean parameter values for eq 6 table 3 the laboratory validation measurement made at a target water content of about 0 6 cm3 cm3 in the coarse woodchip mixture had a residual error nearly two times as large as all others from its calibration equation fig 7 this is likely a result of the water being preferentially distributed towards the bottom of the container closer to where the waveguides were positioned resulting in an overestimation of θ 4 conclusions measurements of θ v s ε b in woodchip mixtures taken with a low frequency cs616 l water content reflectometer were highly influenced by temperature and to a lesser extent by particle size distribution incomplete contact between the probes and material that occurs in mixtures containing large woodchip particles reduces the accuracy of the calibration and poses a potential problem to practitioners future measurements of the θ v s ε b relationship taken in woodchip mixtures with particle size distributions different than the mixtures used here can be inserted in the same hierarchical bayesian framework by incorporating the information contained in the posterior distribution for the parameters provided in this paper table 3 as prior information for future inferences the calibration functions provided in this study are best suited for taking measurements in partially saturated woodchips at low 10 c to moderate 37 c temperature conditions like those found in agricultural denitrifying beds addy et al 2016 and towards the periphery of outdoor stockpiles kannepalli

6588,information on the amount of water held by woodchips in the field is needed to assess environmental risks when they are kept in stockpiles or for inferring their efficiency as denitrifying bioreactors reflectometry is a widely used method for estimating volumetric water content θ in permeable media but material specific calibration functions should be developed this study aimed at developing relationships between the bulk dielectric permittivity ε b and θ in woodchips considering their particle size distribution psd temperature t and the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air ε sa the ε b of fine medium and coarse psds were measured with cs616 l water content reflectometers up to θ of 0 83 cm3 cm3 and at t c of 10 24 37 55 and 70 calibration equations were developed using a multivariate power law function fitted to the data with a hierarchical bayesian inference procedure the best fit r 2 0 96 rmse 0 04 cm3 cm3 was obtained for the fine psd ε sa 1 09 while medium ε sa 1 09 and coarse ε sa 1 03 psds were more influenced by t and the presence of large air voids r 2 0 92 rmse 0 06 cm3 cm3 a modified calibration equation independent of psd ε sa 1 reduced only slightly the goodness of fit r 2 0 90 rmse 0 07 cm3 cm3 the equations developed in this study are well suited for field applications as they cover a wider range of θ than previously published functions and they are applicable within the range of t found in field applications keywords water content sensor multiple nonlinear regression jags uncertainty analysis markov chain monte carlo 1 introduction monitoring water content within ground woody biomass woodchips is important for practitioners in the agricultural energy forestry and waste management industries afzal et al 2009 fenton et al 2014 kannepalli et al 2016 for instance open stockpiles of woodchips present potential environmental hazards through their ability to self ignite li et al 2006 and generate harmful leachate during precipitation and irrigation events hedmark and scholz 2008 tao et al 2005 there is also an economic incentive to maintain the quality of the stockpiled woodchip materials by keeping the piles sufficiently dry lenz et al 2015 lin and pan 2015 additionally woodchips are popularly used as filling medium in denitrifying bioreactors addy et al 2016 jitka et al 2017 their ability to maintain high hydraulic conductivity van driel et al 2006 which is a function of their water content subroy et al 2014 is key to their efficiency and long term operation time domain reflectometry tdr is a widely used method for measuring spatiotemporal variations in water content due to its accuracy practicality and ability to be automated jones et al 2002 this technique computes the apparent bulk dielectric permittivity ε b which is defined as the squared ratio of the propagation velocity of an electromagnetic em pulse in vacuum relative to the medium in which the waveguide is embedded jones et al 2002 the dielectric permittivity of oven dry wood material ε s with density between 0 1 and 1 5 g cm3 varies from 1 3 to 4 5 when measured at a frequency of 100 mhz which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that of pure deionized water ε w 80 this contrast is used to detect water content by measuring the bulk medium s dielectric permittivity topp et al 1980 torgovnikov 1993 water content reflectometers such as the cs616 l model manufactured by campbell scientific inc have been promoted as a cost effective alternative to tdr instruments as they are durable for long term usage in the field and do not require a separate waveform analysis to compute ε b instead reflectometers are internally programmed to record the number of em pulse reflections per second which is proportional to ε b and through calibration to the volumetric water content θ kelleners et al 2005 however because water content reflectometers operate at a lower frequency 175 mhz than traditional tdr instruments 500 1000 mhz they are more sensitive to surrounding environmental conditions such as temperature kapiliratne and lu 2017 as well as characteristics of the material itself such as porosity composition and specific surface area roth et al 1990 malicki et al 1996 or and wraith 1990 skierucha et al 2012 as a consequence material specific relationships between ε b and θ that consider the effect of temperature should be developed when using the cs616 l probe quinones et al 2003 logsdon 2009 bulk dielectric permittivity is commonly related to water content using the third order polynomial relationship proposed by topp et al 1980 or the linearized equation proposed by ledieu et al 1986 these and other empirical relationships table 1 have been calibrated to measure stem water contents in whole wood materials like tree trunks logs and timber constantz and murphy 1990 gray and spies 1995 wullschleger et al 1996 malicki and kotlinski 1998 nadler et al 2003 hernández santana and martínez fernández 2008 schimleck et al 2011 dahlen et al 2015 similar relationships in ground woody materials like woodchips tree tops and saw dust are less documented paz 2006 paz et al 2010 mendel et al 2016 paz et al 2010 proposed using mixing models to predict water content in ground woody materials table 1 mixing models are physically sounder than empirical equations but require data on the volumetric portions geometric configurations and dielectric properties for each of the constituents comprising the bulk mixture sihvola and kong 1988 roth et al 1990 the geometric configuration of the constituents is difficult to know a priori and it is typically obtained by fitting the model to data e g paz et al 2010 the scope of this study was to calibrate a mathematical relationship between ε b and θ as measured by a cs616 l water content reflectometer in mixtures of woodchip particles of various sizes and temperatures between 10 and 70 c this corresponds roughly to the range of temperatures measured in controlled experimental woodchip stockpiles kannepalli 2014 and also covers standard temperature conditions within agricultural denitrifying beds 10 c addy et al 2016 the objectives were to 1 determine if particle size and or temperature were significant factors for modeling the θ v s ε b relationship in woodchip mixtures and 2 calibrate θ v s ε b functions taking into account any significant factors a hierarchical bayesian inference framework was used such that the uncertainty of the calibration function and measurements are accounted for during the parameter inference process 2 materials and methods the θ v s ε b relationship was measured in woodchip samples with three different particle size distributions at five different temperatures 10 c 24 c 37 c 55 c and 70 c the samples used in the experiments were selected from a subset of woodchip mixture samples previously characterized by subroy et al 2014 air dried samples were represented by their geometric mean diameter dg calculated as 1 d g i 0 n d gi fi where d gi is the geometric mean between the ith and i 1 th sieve openings f i is the mass fraction that is retained on the ith sieve and n is the number of sieves a set of 10 us standard sieves with openings mm of 25 40 19 05 9 53 5 66 2 83 1 41 0 59 0 30 0 15 and 0 06 were used the lower i 0 and upper bound i 1 th 11 to calculate d gi for the smallest and largest sieve diameters were assumed to be 10 3 and 50 8 mm respectively samples selected for calibration had dg std dev values of 2255 260 µm 4402 1852 µm and 8130 1354 µm fig 1 and are representative of woodchip mixtures with a predominance of fine medium and coarse sized woodchip particles respectively 2 1 experiment woodchip samples were packed into rectangular polypropylene containers that were 32 5 cm long 15 cm wide and had a height of 10 cm each container had five apertures on the side that were distributed uniformly from the base to the top of the container male luer fittings 0 16 cm in i d were attached to each aperture which served as both water delivery and drainage ports fig 2 filter paper was applied over the ports on the inside surface of the container to prevent them from clogging during drainage and to facilitate a uniform dispersion of water during saturation a cs616 l water content reflectometer and a 109 l thermistor both campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were inserted horizontally into the container at a height of 4 cm through openings made in the plastic fig 2 air dried woodchip material was packed incrementally around the waveguides to a dry bulk density of 0 245 0 049 g cm3 which is similar to that measured in experimental woodchip stockpiles kannepalli 2014 a run consisted of a saturation experiment followed by a drainage drying experiment for each of the three woodchip samples each run was performed at the five temperatures starting with the lowest temperature of 10 c runs conducted at temperatures between 10 c and 40 c were carried out in a growth chamber gc15 environmental growth chambers chagrin falls oh while those performed at 55 c and 70 c were done in an oven model 800 memmert gmbh co kg schwabach de before each run started at a particular temperature the containers of packed material along with the reservoir of deionized water used to saturate the samples were equilibrated at that desired temperature overnight containers were covered with lids during saturation experiments to reduce evaporative losses however the lids did not seal air tight at the beginning of the saturation experiment all three samples one per container were simultaneously wetted from the reservoir through a syringe pump equipped with six 3 ml capacity syringes soil measurement systems tucson az usa that delivered water at an average rate of 19 4 ml min with an average standard deviation of 1 4 ml min water from two syringes was directed into a single tube connected to a five way manifold each line of the manifold was connected to one of the five ports along the side of the containers through a one way valve that prevented backflow each container was placed on a balance xs 32001l mettler toledo columbus oh usa with precision of 0 1 g to measure the amount of water being delivered into the samples fig 2 readings from the balances were collected every minute using the lab x software mettler toledo while data from the probes were collected simultaneously using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc a saturation experiment ended when the box was filled and the output from the cs616 l sensor had stabilized at this time the syringe pump was turned off the lids were removed the manifold was disconnected and the water in the samples was allowed to drain by gravity and simultaneously evaporate the decreasing weights of the open containers as well as the corresponding cs616 l and 109 l probe readings were recorded every minute for the first 2 h and every 15 or 30 min after that after gravity driven drainage had ceased the samples were allowed to dry by evaporation at near constant temperature for the next 2 3 days before starting a new run with the same material at the next higher temperature at 55 c and 70 c the calibration set up had to be modified because the balances and the syringe pump could not be placed inside the drying oven the weight of water added to the container was determined by weighing the container before and after saturation and dividing the added weight of water equally across the saturation time during free drainage at 55 c and 70 c water draining from the samples was routed through tubing attached to the ports which emptied into separate containers placed on the balances outside of the drying oven free drainage ended once water ceased to flow out by gravity at this time the lids were removed and water from the packed material was allowed to evaporate the packed containers were then periodically weighed over the next 5 6 days after a run had been recorded at each temperature and for each sample the containers were re packed with a new subsample of the same material and the entire procedure was repeated in order to obtain duplicate data sets 2 2 determination of the water content the effective volume sensed by the cs616 l water content reflectometer was smaller and had a different shape than the container thus the size and shape of this volume had to be estimated to properly account for the fraction of the total water actually within the sensor s range at any given time perpendicular to the direction of the waveguides the sensed area was assumed to have the shape of an ellipse ferré et al 2002 germann 2017 following baker and lascano 1989 the three dimensional shape of the effective volume was a half ellipsoid cut on its vertical axis at the point of insertion of the waveguides into the sensor head fig 3 the effective volume considered had a constant length of 30 cm the length of the probes and a constant width of 15 cm the width of the container the height dimension of the volume changed each run and was computed from the range of the water level when the sensors initially responded to changes in water content to when they ceased to respond the response of the sensor during saturating and free drainage experiments followed a symmetrical sigmoidal relationship data not shown similar to the one reported in germann 2017 this implies that the shape of the response was the same at the early and late stages of saturation drainage and that the effective sensing volume did not change over time as a result of the ellipsoidal shape of the effective volume equal filling draining rates resulted in larger changes in the readings made by the cs616 l as the level of water approached the waveguides fig 3 this is because changes in water content closer to the waveguide occurred within a larger portion of the effective volume whereas the opposite is true with changes in water content further from the waveguide the ratio of the effective volume filled over the total volume of the container that was filled was used to correct for the amount of water inside the effective volume this correction method was used for saturating experiments and the free drainage portion of the draining experiments for the evaporative drying part of the draining experiments changes in water content were assumed to be uniform throughout the container because the relationship between the sensor s output and mass of the drying woodchips was linear data not shown a similar assumption is used to interpret evaporation from soils schindler et al 2010 and leads to a linear decrease of water from the bottom of the container to the evaporating surface since sensors were placed in the middle of that vertical span measurements are representative of the woodchips average water content during evaporation 2 3 apparent bulk dielectric permittivity the output of the cs616 l water content reflectometer is period p t which is inversely related to the number of pulse reflections recorded per second f r t 1 and can be used to compute the travel time t t by the following relationship campbell and anderson 1998 2 t 2 f r p s f where s f is a scaling factor equal to 1024 for the cs616 reflectometer model logsdon 2009 in turn travel time t and ε b are related as follows kelleners et al 2005 3 ε b t 2 t d c 4 l a where t d is the delay time between the step pulse voltages emitted by the reflectometer and is approximately equal to 5 4 10 9 s c is the speed of light 3 0 108 m s and l a is the apparent length of the waveguide which is not equal to its physical length 30 cm but is instead taken to be 26 cm logsdon 2009 the rationale for converting p to ε b was to allow for comparisons with other tdr studies and their reported calibration relationships with θ 2 4 inference bayesian inference methods were applied to address uncertainty arising from experimental procedures hypothesis testing and the selection of a calibration function bayesian methods assign probabilistic distributions to the parameters being inferred and then update them based on observational data gelman et al 2015 in this work the parameters were conditioned with measurements of ε b and θ in a normal likelihood function such that the maximum a posteriori estimates for the parameters could similarly be attained with a least squares regression the mean of the normal likelihood function was set equal to θ predicted by a given calibration function the standard deviation of the normal likelihood function which is related to the root mean square error rmse of the calibration function was inferred along with the unknown parameters of the calibration function a hierarchical bayesian inference model was used to obtain posterior probability distributions for all of the inferred parameters of a calibration function that translated the experimental data from ε b to θ for either a specific particle size distribution or temperature group level and for all data overall level simultaneously gelman et al 2015 the parameter values were assumed to be unknown at all levels in the hierarchical model therefore weakly informative prior distributions were assigned to give more weight on the data during the inference procedure group level parameters subjected to inference were pooled under common normal prior distributions each defined by an unknown common mean and unknown common variance hyperparameters in bayesian terminology gelman et al 2015 the hyperparameters which defined the calibration function at the overall level were also unknown and were assigned their own prior distributions hyperpriors the common mean was assigned a flat normal hyperprior distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of 10 000 the common variance was assigned a flat uniform hyperprior distribution between 0 0001 and 10 000 the rmse was inferred independently for all groups in the hierarchical model and in each case it was assigned a flat gamma distribution with both shape parameters equal to 0 00001 gelman et al 2015 the r package rjags was used to identify the posterior distribution for all of the unknown parameters plummer 2016 four mcmc chains were each programmed to run for a burn in period of 10 000 generations until all four chains converged for each parameter convergence was diagnosed with the gelman and rubin 1992 scale reduction statistic r as calculated by the coda package plummer et al 2006 chains were considered converged when r stabilized below 1 05 after which it was assumed that any subsequent mcmc sample was to be accepted as a member of the posterior distribution in total 40 000 independent samples from the posterior distribution were drawn 10 000 from each of the four chains for each parameter and used for hypothesis testing and uncertainty analyses the posterior distribution of the inferred parameters were summarized by their 95 credible interval cr i which is a continuous range of values that has a 95 probability of containing the true parameter value in it the 95 cr i for the group level parameters were compared by contrast subtracting one from the other in order to determine significant differences between temperature and particle size groups separately if the 95 cr i for a given contrast was overlapping contained zero then the effects between the two groups could be considered insignificant gelman and hill 2016 multiple comparisons between particle size and temperature groups are acceptable within bayesian hierarchical models because all of the parameters are obtained simultaneously from common prior distributions partial pooling gelman et al 2012 the 95 cr i s for the inferred parameters of the calibration functions were used to identify a 95 cr i for θ given a measurement of ε b the 95 prediction interval p i was also identified for θ which is an interval that takes into account the uncertainty of the measurements by considering the 40 000 posterior samples of the rmse the p i for θ is wider than the cr i for θ although it should be noted that both intervals are centered around the same conditional mean value of θ 2 5 calibration two separate nonlinear regressions were set up using the hierarchical bayesian formalism to individually assess the effects of particle size and temperature on the θ v s ε b relationship the equation used in this hierarchical regression was 4 θ j α j ε b j ε sa j β j where α j and β j are empirical fitting parameters of the jth group where j 3 for particle size fine medium and coarse or j 5 for temperature 10 c 24 c 37 c 55 c and 70 c the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air ε sa was measured for each particle size when the material was air dried before the start of the 10 c run these values were subtracted from ε b to force the regressions through the physically determined origin i e when θ 0 cm3 cm3 then ε b ε sa this assumes ε sa is invariant to changes in temperature because the increase in ε s with increasing temperature is minor enough that the effect can be neglected torgovnikov 1993 once the effects of particle size and temperature had been analyzed using the contrast method described in section 2 4 a power law function of the form 5 θ j α j ε b j ε sa j β 1 j t β 2 j was calibrated for each particle size group using a hierarchical multiple nonlinear regression with two continuous covariates ε b and temperature t c a set of α β 1 and β 2 parameters were inferred for each particle size group group level and for all data overall level as well as the rmse for each group 15 total parameters equation 5 was simplified by pooling the data and assuming ε sa 1 making it independent of particle size 6 θ α ε b 1 β 1 t β 2 after applying this modification the posterior parameter estimates were obtained in a simpler non hierarchical bayesian model which had four unknown parameters α β 1 and β 2 and the rmse 2 6 validation three measurements of θ and ε b were made at target water contents of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 cm3 cm3 for each particle size at room temperature by thoroughly mixing known masses of water and woodchips and packing the mix around the waveguide of the cs616 l sensor in addition field measurements were acquired from an experimental woodchip pile comprised of finely ground woodchip materials dg 1554 µm that was instrumented with multiple cs616 l water content reflectometers and 109 l temperature probes placed at different locations within the pile kannepalli 2014 at the end of a six month field experiment three samples of woodchips were taken in close proximity to each of 13 probes in all cases the volumetric water content was determined by the gravimetric method and the bulk density of the material because the three measurements at a given location within the pile were always in close agreement with one another the average between them was used in the validation the root mean square deviation rmsd square root of the sum of the squared residuals divided by the number of samples and the percent relative difference bias average residual divided by the average measured value of θ were used as metrics to assess deviations between predictions and the validation data 3 results and discussion experiments conducted at the five temperatures yielded a wide range of θ v s ε b measurements that were not adequately fit by the temperature independent functions found throughout the literature fig 4 table 1 the majority of these functions were developed with tdr measurements taken in whole wood which usually has a greater density and holds less water than ground wood materials the linearized function calibrated by gray and spies 1995 for use in decaying logs of wood with similar porosity to woodchips 0 7 cm3 cm3 kannepalli 2014 closely followed the trend of the experimental data collected in this study fig 4 the power law roth et al 1990 and maxwell garnett sihvola and kong 1988 mixing models as used by paz et al 2010 were the only functions that were calibrated specifically for use in comminuted wood materials their predictions fall within the range of measured values but are restricted to the θ interval used in their development 0 08 0 3 cm3 cm3 the experimental design in this study allowed measurements to be made over almost the entire range of possible water contents for a woodchip mixture this would have been difficult to achieve had the highly porous woodchip samples been mixed and measured separately with the gravimetric method this is particularly true for measurements taken close to saturation as water within the large inter particle pores would be preferentially distributed towards the bottom of the container since the gravimetric method assumes a homogenous water content this would then lead to an under or overestimation of ε b depending on the position of the waveguide relative to the saturated region in the container the drawback of the experimental design however was that the sensor s effective volume needed to be calculated for each individual experiment in order to accurately compute θ and relate it to measurements of ε b the vertical axis of the effective volume decreased with particle size table 2 probably because coarse woodchip mixtures had a sharp wetting drying front that could only be sensed when in close proximity to the waveguides fig 3 on the contrary capillary forces in fine particle mixtures created a diffuse wetting drying front ultimately causing the sensor to react sooner and more gradually than in the coarse mixture fig 3 the effective volume was also determined to be smaller in saturation experiments when the woodchips started at a drier condition than during draining experiments table 2 likely because of greater sensitivity of the sensor when water instead of air is the continuous phase baker and lascano 1989 ferré et al 1996 which was the case during draining experiments 3 1 particle size and temperature effects the 95 cr i for the parameter contrasts of eq 4 provide an indication of the similarity between the posterior distributions of the two groups compared if the cr i of a contrast contains 0 it is likely that the true value for that parameter is the same for both groups in contrast if the cr i does not contain 0 then it is fair to conclude that the two groups are significantly different from one another how the two groups differ can be gauged by the sign positive or negative and magnitude distance from zero of the 95 cr i for that contrast gelman and hill 2016 since none of the 95 cr i for the contrasts between the inferred parameters of eq 4 contained 0 temperature and particle size were both deemed significant for modeling the θ v s ε b relationship for woodchip materials fig 5 accordingly particle size was considered a categorical covariate while temperature was included as a continuous covariate in the calibration function eq 5 contrasts of the 95 cr i for the parameters of eq 4 show that the θ v s ε b relationship was most similar between the medium and coarse woodchip mixtures as they were closest to zero while the opposite is true for contrasts between the fine and coarse mixtures fig 5a malicki et al 1996 used bulk density to account for differences in the θ v s ε b relationship in porous materials with different particle sizes in this study the bulk density values of the woodchip mixtures were virtually the same subroy et al 2014 thus a more probable explanation for these observed differences is how the woodchip particles and their pore network are spatially arranged in relation to the orientation of the em field ansoult et al 1985 roth et al 1990 jones and or 2002 for fine woodchip mixtures the pore network contains smaller pores that are likely to lead to a more continuous water phase that transmits the em pulse with less interference from components with low dielectric permittivity such as solid wood or air when this is the case the θ v s ε b relationship tends to be linear in contrast coarse woodchip mixtures have a more disconnected water phase caused by interferences with large woodchip particles or air voids resulting in a nonlinear θ v s ε b relationship another reason for the observed differences between particle size groups is that insufficient contact between the waveguides and coarse woodchips affected the reproducibility of the measurements this is evidenced by the increase in the mean rmse from eq 4 computed from the 40 000 samples in the posterior distribution for the fine 0 04 cm3 cm3 medium 0 06 cm3 cm3 and coarse 0 07 cm3 cm3 woodchip mixtures data not shown notice that the mean rmse values for the medium and coarse woodchips are most similar to each other and so are their 95 cr i s for their inferred parameters fig 5a with regard to temperature the θ v s ε b relationship was most similar at temperatures between 10 c and 37 c and at temperatures 55 c and 70 c fig 5b this also coincides with the rmse of the five temperature groups from eq 4 which increased greatly above 37 c fig 6 the mean rmse from eq 4 at and below 37 c was 0 04 cm3 cm3 while above 37 c it was 0 08 cm3 cm3 data not shown overall the measurements made at temperatures 24 c and 37 c were the most alike in terms of their 95 cr i for the contrasted parameter values potentially indicating that temperature may not need to be included as a covariate if measurements of ε b are taken between 24 c and 37 c fig 5b however it is common for the temperature to exceed 37 c within woodchip stockpiles especially towards the insulated center of large piles where metabolic processes are constantly producing heat li et al 2006 temperature conditions within agricultural denitrifying beds are typically less than 24 c addy et al 2016 the specific surface area of a material varies with particle size and controls how much water can be adsorbed which in turn affects the θ v s ε b relationship at varying temperature conditions or and wraith 1990 jones and or 2002 adsorbed water molecules that are bound by intermolecular forces to hydroxyl groups in the cell wall of the woodchip materials are rotationally hindered which results in a lower dielectric signature ε bw 5 than free liquid water molecules torgovnikov 1993 jones and or 2002 as a consequence at low water contents and low temperature bound water will reduce measurements of ε b through what is known as the thermodielectric effect or and wraith 1990 jones and or 2002 conversely as temperature increases bound water desorbs and values of ε b tend to increase without change in θ this phenomenon was most apparent at low water contents in the fine woodchip particles fig 6a which have a larger specific surface area than coarse particles bekhta and haziroglu 2002 at high water contents the thermodielectric effect has less influence because all possible sorption sites are occupied but increases in temperature may noticeably decrease the value of ε w e g values of ε w at 10 c and 70 c are about 84 and 66 respectively or and wraith 1990 this effect is slightly apparent in the medium and coarse woodchip mixtures fig 6b and c although the high variability in the measurements and reduced accuracy of the reflectometer at high temperature water content campbell scientific inc 2016 kapiliratne and lu 2017 makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions 3 2 calibration the ε sa of the particular woodchip mixture was subtracted from ε b in eq 5 so that the prediction of θ was not influenced by temperature when θ 0 cm3 cm3 table 3 torgovnikov 1993 reports that solid wood with a similar bulk density to the woodchip materials used in the experiments 0 2 g cm3 had ε s values between 1 14 and 1 18 measured at a tdr frequency of 100 1000 mhz in this study values of ε sa include the influence of air and can be used to infer the amount of contact between the woodchips and the waveguides values of ε sa close to 1 would indicate a prevalence of air voids i e poor contact between the sensor and the solid wood material whereas ε sa values close to ε s would indicate near perfect contact equation 5 with optimized parameter values for fine medium and coarse woodchip particle sizes fitted the data reasonably well but rmse increased with particle size table 3 consequently the 95 cr i and p i for the predictions of θ were narrower for the fine in comparison to the medium and coarse woodchip calibration relationships fig 7 this increase may have been caused by poorer contact between the sensor and the woodchips in the coarser mixtures than in fine this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that one of the fine woodchip replicates had a ε sa value closest to the dielectric permittivity of solid wood ε s whereas one of the coarse material replicates had the lowest value of ε sa table 3 the variability in the measurements also increased with temperature fig 6 according to the user manual the cs616 l reflectometers have an operational temperature range from 0 to 70 c although measurements made at 40 c can have as much as 2 and 6 error when the volumetric water content is 12 and 30 respectively measurement error above 40 c has not been quantified but is expected to be much larger especially as the woodchips become more saturated personal communication with campbell scientific inc which is apparent from the scatter of the data points displayed in the 55⁰ and 70 c subplots incorporated in fig 7 the goodness of fit statistics for eq 6 were only slightly lower than those for eq 5 for the medium and coarse woodchip mixtures table 3 application of eq 6 is best suited when the particle size distribution for a woodchip mixture is uncharacterized and or ε sa is unknown assuming ε sa 1 in eq 6 is somewhat arbitrary however since measurements of ε b should never be less than the dielectric permittivity of air this value was chosen so that the predicted value for θ could not be negative 3 3 validation the d g 1554 µm and bulk density 0 296 g cm3 of the woodchip mixture used to construct the field pile was determined at the beginning of the experiment and was comparable to the d g of the fine woodchip mixture used in the calibration fig 7 kannepalli 2014 using the mean parameter values for the fine particle size calibration equation table 3 the rmsd of the field measured water content was 0 13 cm3 cm3 and the bias was 19 however the validation measurements were taken at the end of the 6 month experimental period after there was sufficient time for the finer sized woodchip particles to migrate downward towards the bottom of the pile and after the woodchips had undergone decomposition and compaction when the mean parameter values for eq 6 i e all in table 3 were used to predict θ the rmsd was reduced to 0 11 cm3 cm3 and the bias was lowered to 10 the field validation points that were not contained within the 95 p i were located at the bottom edge of the pile two data points in the 37 c and one in the 55 c subplots of fig 7 where compaction is purported to be highest and where the finest particles tend to accumulate and directly in the center the one data point in the 70 c subplot of fig 7 where temperature is highest it should be noted that the field validation data points were not made exactly at the temperature of the graph they are displayed in which also could explain some of the variation outside of the temperature specific p i displayed in fig 7 the laboratory validation measurements were only made at room temperature but were completed for all particle sizes these measurements had a rmsd of 0 08 cm3 cm3 and a 4 bias using the mean parameter values for eq 5 and a rmsd of 0 06 cm3 cm3 and a 7 bias using the mean parameter values for eq 6 table 3 the laboratory validation measurement made at a target water content of about 0 6 cm3 cm3 in the coarse woodchip mixture had a residual error nearly two times as large as all others from its calibration equation fig 7 this is likely a result of the water being preferentially distributed towards the bottom of the container closer to where the waveguides were positioned resulting in an overestimation of θ 4 conclusions measurements of θ v s ε b in woodchip mixtures taken with a low frequency cs616 l water content reflectometer were highly influenced by temperature and to a lesser extent by particle size distribution incomplete contact between the probes and material that occurs in mixtures containing large woodchip particles reduces the accuracy of the calibration and poses a potential problem to practitioners future measurements of the θ v s ε b relationship taken in woodchip mixtures with particle size distributions different than the mixtures used here can be inserted in the same hierarchical bayesian framework by incorporating the information contained in the posterior distribution for the parameters provided in this paper table 3 as prior information for future inferences the calibration functions provided in this study are best suited for taking measurements in partially saturated woodchips at low 10 c to moderate 37 c temperature conditions like those found in agricultural denitrifying beds addy et al 2016 and towards the periphery of outdoor stockpiles kannepalli

6589,in this study several advanced data driven models are adopted for estimating water table levels in conjunction with a proposed data preprocessing procedure that includes detrending deseasonalization normalization outlier exclusion and formatting to verify the proposed strategy a non linear auto regressive exogenous model based on deep neural networks narx dnns a long short term memory lstm model a gated recurrent unit gru model and a reference model based on an auto regressive exogenous arx model are comparatively applied to water table level time series from the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk monitoring wells years 2005 2014 to test the developed preprocessing method estimates with and without the proposed detrending and deseasonalization dtds are compared quantitatively in the comparative applications all four models show reasonable prediction accuracies in addition it is found that the estimations from the narx and lstm models are superior to those of the other models in terms of prediction accuracy regardless of whether dtds is adopted in both data sets there is water table level depression during 2014 due to drought throughout the entire korean peninsula in multiple analyses stressed aquifer conditions are identified through estimations based on differences between estimates and observations where the differences are found to be more obvious with dtds preprocessing thus by using the proposed preprocessing method hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer can be effectively noticed at an earlier stage the results show that the advanced data driven models can be more effective when adopted in conjunction with the proposed preprocessing method and successfully utilized for monitoring and management of groundwater resources abbreviations

groundwater is an important source of freshwater in many regions it is well understood that compared to surface water groundwater resources are less influenced by external factors for this reason the value of groundwater is increasing due the global climate change and repeated droughts and floods however groundwater is still vulnerable to long term impacts such as prolonged drought excessive abstraction and constant pollutant introduction further once groundwater systems deteriorate quantitative and qualitative recovery usually takes a long time therefore to facilitate corrective action the influences from these adverse impacts should be detected at an appropriate time in groundwater management early corrections to prevent further groundwater deterioration are the most cost effective morris et al 2003 deployment of reversal action is inevitably slow because decisions regarding groundwater deterioration are often made manually by multiple decision makers early warnings or immediate management systems designed to ensure the quantity and quality of groundwater are essential for correcting problems in a timely manner however despite this necessity such a system has not been fully implemented along with the development of information and communication technology ict monitoring and management measures utilize automatic and real time characteristics cyber physical systems cpss proposed for intelligent manufacturing are a representative example of automated and real time management systems which can also be applied to groundwater management jeong et al 2017 jeong et al 2018 lee 2008 in such systems monitoring data are transmitted in real time and baseline estimates of groundwater quantity and quality are provided immediately from the predictive model or algorithm these two components real time data acquisition and estimation are the key factors of cps systems by comparing the observed data and estimates from the predictive models major discrepancies can be detected and reported to decision makers at an early stage discrepancies can potentially be associated with abnormal conditions such as excessive pumping contaminant introduction or failure of monitoring devices in the above system a model or algorithm that mimics the actual data generation process or natural phenomena hereafter referred to as digital twin has key importance because it can detect an abnormality in the real system through a comparison with actual observations there are multiple techniques for developing digital twins which can be categorized into process based and data driven models in groundwater problems process based models provide estimations based on partial differential equations pdes that govern the hydraulics and chemistry of groundwater however data driven models are based on linear or non linear regression analyses that mimic phenomenological patterns in the observed data process based models are rigorous in that they are based on mass balances given the precise required information regarding aquifers process based models may simulate the groundwater hydraulics and solute transport of an entire aquifer within a permissible error range however data driven models are limited to providing point wise estimates with a non physically based model however there are two major benefits of adopting a data driven model for groundwater problems 1 the model can be constructed without a priori information coulibaly et al 2001 and 2 the computational cost is significantly lower than the majority of the process based models while the results are often satisfactory owing to the computational efficiency of a data driven model reliable estimates can potentially be obtained based on an ensemble of repetitive estimations by bootstrap aggregating or bagging which may not be feasible with a process based model in practice time series data driven models based on artificial neural networks anns have been frequently used in water resources problems within the past two decades altunkaynak 2007 chang et al 2014 coulibaly et al 2001 maier and dandy 1996 wunsch et al 2018 young et al 2015 liu et al 2018 among the studies feedforward networks non linear auto regressive exogenous narx models and recurrent neural networks rnns have been used for groundwater level estimations recently chang et al 2014 kenda et al 2018 and wunsch et al 2018 adopted ann based narx models in which a single hidden layer with up to eight neurons was used to estimate surface and groundwater levels however these studies did not include comparisons between the narx and other deep neural network dnn models with multiple hidden layers regarding the applications of rnn coulibaly et al 2001 successfully used a simple recurrent network srn for groundwater level estimation however as can be inferred from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem of srn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the algorithm may not be efficient when the groundwater response depends on long term preceding explanatory variables especially in a region with significantly delayed water table responses due to precipitation although the long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 model is a state of the art technique among rnn based models relatively few researchers have applied it to the field of hydrogeology silva et al 2013 kratzert et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 among these studies zhang et al 2018 adopted an lstm model for the prediction of water table depth and the superiority of the lstm model was verified against simple feedforward neural network based on monthly estimates furthermore groundwater measurements often include various types of outliers such as irrelevant data from non major or extraneous data generating processes or measurements errors by considering the outlying data estimation quality may be significantly reduced and estimations may diverge therefore outliers should be ignored during model training the main purpose of this study was to develop tools for real time groundwater monitoring and management by adopting several advanced data driven models for this purpose multiple advanced data driven models were applied to water table level estimations and compared to obtain the characteristics of the estimates further an estimation procedure that is suitable for predicting water table levels was proposed as advanced estimation algorithms narx based on dnn narx dnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru cho et al 2014 models were adopted in this study along with suitable training networks although the lstm model has been applied recently to estimate water table depth zhang et al 2018 the estimates were restricted to monthly data and the performance comparisons were limited for this reason the key research objectives of the present study which is still open are as follows 1 to apply advanced data driven model as tools for real time groundwater monitoring and management and 2 to compare the model performances to further improve the performance of the models robust regression and outlier exclusion based on the least trimmed squares lts rousseeuw 1984 method was applied as a data preprocessor to validate the prediction ability of the suggested algorithms and procedure actual groundwater level and climatic data were used to estimate groundwater levels here the auto regressive exogenous arx model was comparatively applied as the reference model 2 methodology 2 1 estimation procedure the general procedure adopted for training and validating prediction models sequentially consists of data acquisition preprocessing model training and validation of the trained model in the early stage of implementation the data are divided into two parts one for training the suggested models and the other for testing the trained models because the model was designed to predict groundwater levels the response data consist of groundwater levels and the explanatory data consist of a few daily climate observations potentially affecting groundwater levels through recharge and evapotranspiration these include average temperature cumulative precipitation average relative humidity average atmospheric pressure and cumulative sunshine hours the reference data length which is the number of past and current explanatory data items to be referenced for estimation of the current groundwater level is considered to be a hyperparameter and determined by a combination of hyperparameter optimization methods i e grid search and trial and error tuning physically this value is related to the time lag between explanatory data such as precipitation and the water table response as explained by jeong and park 2017 and jeong et al 2018 however for the data driven model the reference data length is not directly correlated to the physical value the time span from infiltration to recharge during data preprocessing detrending subtraction of long term linear trends deseasonalization subtraction of long term periodicity normalization and outlier exclusion were conducted to enhance the training efficiency and estimation accuracy where detrending and deseasonalization are optional the initial preprocessing involves subtracting long term trends and periodicity in the groundwater level data for this purpose a robust regression model was applied the theoretical details are provided in the following section in this procedure long term trends and periodicity in groundwater level data were estimated from the training data that were subtracted from the entire data set in the second procedure during data preprocessing normalization was performed to adjust the scale of the data according to a common scale to improve estimation efficiency the third preprocessing procedure was identification of missing or outlying data in the explanatory and response data which were excluded in the training of the models the last preprocessing procedure was data formatting each model requires a different input data format and explanatory data were rearranged according to this requirement after the data preprocessing the models were trained based on the corresponding formatted data the time series prediction models narx dnn lstm and gru were then applied these models were implemented using python 3 6 https www python org and tensorflow 1 8 detailed explanations of the adopted models are provided in supplementary material i tensorflow is an open source machine learning library developed by the google brain team https www tensorflow org the hardware used for training was equipped with an intel xeon 2 30 ghz cpu 36 cores 2 sockets 128 gb memory and microsoft windows 10 in the training the models were optimized based on backpropagation for narx dnn or a backpropagation through time for lstm and gru algorithm with an adaptive moment estimation algorithm adam kignma and ba 2014 in which the mean squared error mse between the estimated and actual groundwater levels was supplied as the cost function to ensure a sufficiently small training error an appropriate number of iterations and stopping criterion were used however an excessively large number of iterations and small stopping criterion were avoided to prevent overfitting of the model in the testing of the trained model validation it was assumed that there were no informed actual groundwater levels in the entire prediction period except for a small fraction of earlier data corresponding to the length of the reference data at the beginning of the testing estimation therefore in continuing the validation the groundwater levels required in the explanatory data were substituted by the previously estimated values feedback connection in this sense assuming the total timespan of the data was 10 years and using 50 of the data for testing the latter five years of groundwater levels were estimated without referring to measured levels the testing portion was determined experimentally where the portion could be lengthened or shortened depending on the data characteristics 2 2 preprocessing of time series data it was reported that conventional time series models based on ann do not effectively represent long term trends and seasonal variability in the data zhang and qi 2005 meanwhile guzman et al 2017 demonstrated that the seasonality component was efficiently overcome by implementing narx ann in the present study it was assumed that subtracting trends detrending and seasonality deseasonalization from the observed data may or may not affect the estimation quality therefore from a neutral point of view the effect that detrending and deseasonalization have on the water table level prediction was evaluated based on applications of the actual data in the applications two types of comparative tests were performed in the first test detrending and deseasonalization were not conducted whereas they were conducted in the second test during the data preprocessing procedure to derive the long term trends and seasonal variability of the water table level from the observed data which typically include outliers and missing data the robust least trimmed square lts regression method was used for preprocessing of the response data the expected benefits of the proposed detrending and deseasonalization dtds using the robust estimators of the lts technique are twofold the first benefit is the efficiency of the estimation the proposed preprocessing with the lts technique eliminates the need to remove the outliers from the data which typically precedes the estimation the second benefit is that by assuming consistency of the trends and stationarity of seasonal variability the process changes that occur in a groundwater system can be effectively detected by the proposed dtds this agrees with the purpose of this study which is the development of a management tool for groundwater systems the adopted lts method is based on linear regression in the linear regression given n t observations y y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 y t t with sizes n t 1 at the corresponding time t t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 t t t n t 1 the predicted trend y of the observed data with time is given by 1 y x θ where x is a design matrix containing explanatory variables based on a first order linear function such that x 1 t 1 1 1 1 1 1 t n t 1 and θ is a vector of parameters 2 1 estimated by minimizing the objective function o of the mean squared error mse as follows 2 o t y θ 1 t i 1 n t i 2 t i y i θ 1 t y y t y y in the equation t y t y t i e the error between the observed data y t and the predicted values y t maximum likelihood estimation mle a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model from a set of observations was applied to the linear regression problems and the parameters corresponding to design matrix x were finally estimated by the following equation 3 θ x t x 1 x t y in case of seasonal variability in the time series x may be extended for example to 4 x 1 t ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 in eq 4 ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 are equal to the periodic functions sin 2 π l t cos 2 π l t sin 4 π l t and cos 4 π l t respectively corresponding to the elements of t where l is set to 365 days to account for the typical annual variability observed in groundwater level fluctuations according to annual precipitation it was confirmed through further analysis based on the above equations eqs 3 4 that the addition of more frequencies does not significantly improve the approximation of the time series the lts method optimizes the parameters θ l t s by iteratively minimizing the objective function eq 2 for a fraction of the data as shown in the following equation 5 θ l t s τ argmin θ lts i 1 n h i 2 t i y i θ l t s τ 1 where i is the i th smallest error i e 1 i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 t h τ is the number of the optimization and n h equals half the number of observations n h n t 2 in addition time series data are typically plagued with missing or outlying points which reduces the applicability of the models that adopt mse as a cost function and thus exacerbate the training and prediction quality to eliminate the influence of outlying data in the training process the outliers must be excluded from the observations for this purpose the 6 σ rule was adopted as a result data outside the range between x θ lts 6 σ neg 1 and x θ lts 6 σ pos 1 were considered to be outliers σ neg and σ pos are the standard deviations separately determined from the misfits in the half regions the observations lower and higher than x θ lts jeong et al 2017 the explanatory data were normalized into a standardized range data normalization to facilitate training convergence and the response data were normalized in a range to fit in the range of the activation function of the output layer for example if the activation function of the output layer was a sigmoid function with a range from 0 to 1 the following scaling method can be adopted 6 ξ t ξ t ξ min ξ max ξ min where ξ max and ξ min are the maximum and minimum values of the targeted time series data ξ t respectively and ξ t is the normalized time series with a range between 0 and 1 as the final preprocessing step the explanatory data must be rearranged to fit the data format requirements of a model data formatting for the arx and narx dnn models the general format of the explanatory data for estimation of the response data at time t is given by 7 x x t l 1 t 1 t x t l n t n t x t l n t n t y t l 0 t 1 t where x t l n t n is the n th type of explanatory variable for the estimation of the targeted response variable y t given n different types of explanatory variables whose expanded form is x t l n n x t l n 1 n x t 1 n x t n t and l n n 1 n is the number of past explanatory data points to be

described above to groundwater level estimations time series data from two different locations were used the following sections contain brief descriptions of the geography geology groundwater level data and climate in both locations 3 1 jindo uisin monitoring well the jindo uisin monitoring well is located on jindo island which is the third largest island in south korea located off the southwest corner of the korean peninsula the monitoring well is approximately 3 3 km from the southern coast of the island and the elevation of the location is 14 75 m above mean sea level msl the well is drilled to 70 m below the surface where the upper portion 0 12 6 m is encased and screens are installed at 24 28 32 36 and 40 44 m intervals below the surface in this study the daily averaged groundwater level data from 2005 through 2014 were used the mean level was 5 74 m and the standard deviation was 0 255 m therefore the mean thickness of the unsaturated zone was about 9 m composed of an uppermost clay layer 0 2 m coarse sand 2 6 m and weathered andesitic tuff 6 12 6 m the mean temperature of the area was 13 6 and the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation rate were 3 65 and 13 1 mm respectively in the data the average cumulative precipitation rate during the spring season february to may when irrigation water was required for agricultural activities was 374 4 mm however less than average precipitation was recorded during 2013 287 mm and 2014 316 5 mm there were only a few missing data in daily averaged relative humidity and atmospheric pressure whose influences were marginalized by taking the mean value of the corresponding data 3 2 pohang gibuk monitoring well the pohang gibuk monitoring well is located in the southeast area of the korean peninsula and is surrounded by mountains a few artificial reservoirs which are used for agricultural irrigation and regularly discharge water are located within 4 km of the well the monitoring well is located about 150 m away from a rill and the elevation is 121 1 m above msl the well is drilled to 70 m below the surface where the upper portion 0 8 9 m is encased and screens are installed at 50 54 58 62 and 66 70 m intervals below the surface the aquifer is composed of fractured shale while the unsaturated zone is mostly sand and gravel as with the previous jindo uisin data the daily averaged groundwater level data during years 2005 through 2014 were used to verify the performance of the suggested models the mean of the groundwater level was 116 32 m which indicates that the mean thickness of the unsaturated zone of the area was about 4 8 m the standard deviation was 0 722 m the mean temperature of the area was 14 6 c and the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation rate were 2 97 and 10 1 mm respectively the cumulative precipitation rate during the spring season february to may of 2014 was 207 5 mm which is 74 4 of the average of the other 10 years 278 9 mm 4 results and discussion in the model training the manipulation of model hyperparameters such as the numbers of hidden nodes and layers in the narx or hidden states in the lstm and gru is the most important factor for enhancing the prediction capability therefore the training network for estimating water table levels was repeatedly tested by changing the hyperparameters systematically to obtain the optimal hyperparameters for the data of a specific area the root mean square error rmse between the estimated and normalized actual water table level min and max values were 0 and 1 respectively was applied as the training target the training tolerance was set to be sufficiently small although excessively small values were intentionally avoided for regularization purposes based on multiple training tests it was confirmed that standard regularization methods such as l2 and drop out did not improve the water table level estimation quality fig 1 shows an example of the training blue line and testing orange line results based on the first and second halves of the water table level data black stars acquired from the jindo uisin monitoring well as shown in the figure the residuals of the first period were sufficiently small because the data from this period was targeted during the training of the model while those in the testing period were relatively large the larger residuals are attributed to the fact that no actual water table levels were involved in the estimation during the testing period during this period the previously estimated water table levels were fed back as the auto regressive explanatory variables for the subsequent estimations as the explanatory variables the daily average temperature cumulative precipitation average relative humidity average atmospheric pressure cumulative sunshine hours and preceding water table levels a total of six variables were used for the following case studies in which four different models arx narx lstm and gru were applied to estimate the water table levels the explanatory variables were determined by considering the factors affecting water table level fluctuation by recharge and evapotranspiration xu et al 2006 however the quality of the estimation can be improved with fewer explanatory variables through sensitivity analysis of the variables 4 1 jindo uisin monitoring well to train the models based on data from the jindo uisin monitoring well the optimal set of hyperparameters for each model was obtained by a combination of a grid search for integer type parameters and trial and error tuning for real type parameters except for the arx model from the hyperparameter search the past referenced data spanning a period of 10 d were determined for the arx model the network was composed of one input layer and one output layer with 59 and 1 node respectively 59 a b c 1 a of explanatory data 5 b of response data 1 c the number of days in the past reference data 10 the 1 indicates subtraction of the current or targeted response data the narx model also had one input layer with 59 nodes and one output layer while six hidden layers with 16 nodes were additionally used between the input and output layers in both lstm and gru estimations a total of 59 input nodes and 32 hidden states were used subsequently the outputs of the final cell 32 hidden states in the lstm and gru models were interpreted using one fully connected hidden layer with 32 nodes which was connected to one output value water table level estimation for model training and testing the data were evenly divided into two datasets each containing 1821 d i e the first five years and second five years of applied data i e the six types of explanatory variables during the model training the water table levels from the first half of the data were assumed to be fully known and used to optimize the model parameters or weights contrarily during the testing of the trained model only the water table levels of the initial 10 d which is equal to the timespan of the past reference data determined from hyperparameter search were assumed to be known for all the input data data preprocessing procedures outlier identification missing data control and data normalization section 2 2 were implemented and the explanatory data were formatted according to the appropriate data input format figs 2 and 3 shows the estimation results of the arx narx lstm and gru models the results were generated using the water table level data from the jindo uisin monitoring well years 2005 2014 figs 2 and 3 show the estimated water table levels blue solid lines without detrending and deseasonalization preprocessing non dtds and with detrending and deseasonalization preprocessing dtds respectively as seen in the testing estimation period 2010 2014 of the figures all the applied models reasonably captured the water table fluctuation pattern except for the last year 2014 the water table level estimates generated by the models for 2014 all significant overestimated the actual water table levels these observations suggest that the water table level generation process during 2014 was significantly altered from that of the preceding period 2005 2013 in fact the 2014 drought caused severe problems in the many parts of south korea including the jindo area therefore the significant deviation between the estimated and actual water table levels suggests that the model estimation can serve as a criterion for determining hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer by providing reference water table levels the accuracy of each model was evaluated based on the rmse and correlation coefficient between the estimated and actual water table levels the rmse values between the estimated and actual values in the non dtds case during p1 were 0 123 0 106 0 109 and 0 148 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 770 0 853 0 842 and 0 662 all four models exhibited reasonable prediction performance during p1 and among the models the narx and lstm models exhibited relatively higher prediction accuracy than the other two models arx and gru the prediction accuracies of the models deteriorated substantially during p2 in the non dtds case where the rmse values were 0 201 0 304 0 209 and 0 240 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 328 0 175 0 014 and 0 071 based on the deterioration in the models fits to the actual data sudden changes in hydrological processes can be detected meanwhile the rmse values achieved by adopting dtds preprocessing during p1 were 0 124 0 112 0 112 and 0 109 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients are 0 873 0 919 0 924 and 0 920 table 1 although the rmse values were similar to those of the non dtds case the correlation coefficients showed clear improvement the performance of the gru model was the lowest in terms of the mean rmse and correlation coefficient in the non dtds case whereas the gru model showed markedly improved performance when the dtds was utilized this suggests that dtds preprocessing was essential for improving the accuracy of the gru model when it was applied to the jindo uisin monitoring well for the case with dtds preprocessing the highly non linear models of narx lstm and gru were clearly superior to the arx model as in the previous case overestimations of the models were prominent in the dtds case during p2 where the rmse values were 0 310 0 330 0 376 and 0 344 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively these values were generally higher than those in the non dtds case the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 256 0 365 0 167 and 0 143 for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively these values also imply that the hydrological process was significantly altered to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of the dtds preprocessing in terms of the detectability of hydrological process changes the respective mean rmse and correlation coefficient values were separately computed for the non dtds and dtds preprocessing cases the means of the rmse values during period p1 were similar for both cases 0 122 m for non dtds and 0 114 m for dtds cases where that of the dtds case was slightly lower on the contrary during p2 the mean rmse of the dtds case 0 340 m was significantly larger than that of the non dtds case 0 239 m this aspect can also be seen by comparing the estimated water table levels blue solid line in figs 2 and 3 both cases exhibited similar prediction performances during p1 whereas during p2 the predictions achieved by adopting dtds preprocessing exhibited clear overestimations compared to those of the non dtds case by eliminating general trends and seasonal variability in the dtds case consistency of trends and stationarity of seasonal variability were naturally assumed thus the estimates with the dtds will generate water table levels without accounting for significant process changes in this sense it is expected that the model estimates with the proposed dtds preprocessing can be more effectively used to notice hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer whether from natural or anthropogenic causes anomalies in the aquifer conditions can be noticed at an early stage by computing the sequential discrepancy between the estimated and actual water table levels in time the orange bars in figs 2 and 3 show the change in the temporal window averaged rmse between the estimates and actual observations for non dtds and dtds cases respectively in the computations a moving average with a 60 day temporal window was applied as shown in both figures the rmse values prior to 2014 during p1 were nearly stationary for all the estimates generated by the arx narx lstm and gru models during this period the window averaged rmse values with small and constant variances can be considered as inherent estimation errors by applying the respective model in contrast the rmse values began to dramatically increase in the spring season of 2014 for the arx narx lstm and gru models the rmse values during 2014 p2 increased two to three times from these observations the changes in the hydrological conditions of the aquifers can be perceived early prior to any significant decline in the water table level in particular when comparing the results of the non dtds and dtds cases the changes in mean rmse values with dtds preprocessing are much clearer than those without dtds this result indicates that the estimation results achieved by applying detrending and deseasonalization were more reliable for detecting hydrological changes in an aquifer this superiority in discernibility of hydrological processes can be attributed to the stationarity assumptions used in dtds preprocessing therefore the proposed preprocessing method of detrending and deseasonalization can be effectively used for the purpose of surveilling groundwater resources by providing reliable reference estimates 4 2 pohang gibuk monitoring well similar to the previous case the models were applied to estimate the water table levels in the pohang gibuk monitoring well the structure of the arx model was identical to that in the previous application for the narx model one input with 59 nodes one output and one hidden layer with 16 nodes were used the applied lstm and gru networks were identically composed of 59 input nodes and two hidden states and the output of the last cell was interpreted by one fully connected hidden layer with two nodes connected to an output node the hyperparameters of the narx lstm and gru models were manipulated by combining a grid search for integer type parameters and trial and error tuning for real type parameters also 10 days of past referenced data were determined from the hyperparameter search the data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well showed gaussian like daily noise as shown figs 4 and 5 due to the noise it was difficult to train a model to fit all the points and by fitting all the points overfitting can occur therefore the minor noise was considered to be negligible in the training prior to the model estimates all the input data were preprocessed as in the previous application and divided equally into model training and testing data where the data from 2005 through 2009 were used for model training and the remaining data 2010 2014 were used for testing the trained models figs 4 and 5 show the estimated results from the four models applied to the water table level data 2005 2014 the results of the non dtds and dtds cases are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively similar to the previous applications for all the models the estimated water table levels blue solid lines without dtds preprocessing during p1 exhibited reasonable representations of the actual data except for the year 2014 the rmse values were 0 552 0 475 0 465 and 0 551 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 666 0 698 0 730 and 0 649 the rmses and correlation coefficients indicate that the narx and lstm models had reasonably high prediction capabilities compared to the arx and gru models but the differences were not significant as in the results for the jindo uisin monitoring well comparing the results for p1 and p2 shows that the four models significantly overestimated the p2 water table levels of pohang gibuk rmse 0 737 m arx 0 674 m narx 0 733 m lstm and 0 702 m gru similar to the jindo area the pohang region also suffered from severe drought during 2014 this is a potential cause of the hydrological process changes in the groundwater system as in the previous applications the resulting changes in the hydrological processes due to severe drought in 2014 are clearer in the results of the dtds case with dtds preprocessing the rmse values were 0 546 0 461 0 465 and 0 488 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively during p1 and the corresponding correlation coefficients are 0 629 0 709 0 710 and 0 674 table 1 meanwhile the rmse values and correlation coefficients for p2 significantly deteriorated compared to those of p1 rmse 1 081 m arx 1 045 m narx 0 963 m lstm 0 992 m gru correlation coefficient 0 561 arx 0 626 narx 0 663 lstm 0 624 gru these overestimations for p2 by the four models are also clear in fig 5 as in the previous applications the model estimates showed clear contrast in their fits of the actual observations for p1 and p2 where the excellent fit during p1 significantly decreased during p2 again the critical deterioration in the estimation accuracies may be related to the changes in hydrological processes among the models the narx estimates have the lowest rmse value during p1 where the difference in the rmse values of p1 and p2 was the greatest p1 0 0461 m p2 1 045 m as in the results for the jindo uisin area the performance of the gru model also significantly improved with dtds preprocessing compared to the non dtds case table 1 the orange bars in figs 4 and 5 show the moving average rmse based on a 60 day moving window for the non dtds and dtds cases respectively similar to the results from the jindo uisin area the values for the arx narx lstm and gru models remained nearly stationary before 2014 and began to dramatically increase in the spring season of that year comparing the values of the non dtds and dtds cases the increasing patterns achieved by adopting dtds preprocessing were more significant than those in the jindo uisin applications the consistent observation from the two different locations supports the fact that hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer can be detected at an early stage through the proposed preprocessing method of detrending and deseasonalization ultimately with the proposed method sound monitoring of a target aquifer is expected to be achieved by utilizing suitable thresholds specified by decision makers 5 summary and conclusions by providing reference estimates water table level forecasting can play an important role in the management of groundwater resources in the present study several advanced data driven models were adopted for water table level estimations and were paired with a newly proposed preprocessing procedure to improve the estimation efficiency and accuracy as advanced models the non linear auto regressive exogenous model based on deep neural networks narx dnns the long short term memory lstm model and the gated recurrent unit gru model were adopted and the auto regressive exogenous arx model was used a reference model the proposed preprocessing routine included detrending deseasonalization data normalization outlier exclusion and data formatting where detrending and deseasonalization dtds of the response data water table level data were optional actual water table level and climatic data from the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk areas were used to validate the prediction capabilities of the proposed models and determine the effect of the data preprocessing when applying the models to data from the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk locations all the applied models arx narx lstm and gru exhibited reasonable prediction accuracies where the applications with dtds preprocessing showed slight improvements in particular the highly nonlinear predictive models narx and lstm showed relatively higher prediction performance than the other two models the estimates based on the gru model had slightly higher or similar accuracies to those obtained from the arx model when dtds preprocessing was not used while the accuracy remarkably improved with dtds the overall results suggested that application of non linear prediction models provides adequate performance particularly when dtds preprocessing is associated by providing reference estimates water table level estimation from a data driven model can serve as a tool for monitoring aquifer conditions the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk data showed a decline in water table levels which is believed to have been caused by a severe drought in 2014 it is found that all the applied models can detect hydrological stress in an aquifer by overestimating the water table level during the period to quantitatively address this aspect the capabilities of detecting hydrological condition changes in an aquifer were comparatively tested during the normal period without hydrological changes 2005 2013 the prediction accuracies of the applied models were reasonable thus no hydrological changes were indicated however for 2014 the water table levels from the applied models were commonly overestimated compared to the actual data this observation indicates that the actual water table level declined because of hydrological changes which could be detected effectively based on the difference between the estimated and observed water table levels in depth analyses particularly those based on a proposed moving averaged rmse values confirmed that the model estimates generated using dtds preprocessing were more effective in detecting hydrological changes the effectiveness of estimates using dtds preprocessing was attributed to the implied assumption of consistency of trends and stationarity of seasonal variability the applications and analyses in this study showed that water table level estimation using non linear models such as narx and lstm in conjunction with the proposed preprocessing method is a promising method for monitoring and managing groundwater resources by detecting the quantitative or qualitative deterioration of groundwater resources at an early stage of an incident cost effective reversal measures can be implemented in this sense the method proposed in this study can be used as an effective tool for intelligent and efficient monitoring and management of groundwater resources to this end the general practicality of the proposed method should be evaluated based on extending the applications to a broader array of data from various aquifer conditions in addition the proposed method should be studied comparatively with process based estimation methods to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the both method types 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgement we thank

6589,in this study several advanced data driven models are adopted for estimating water table levels in conjunction with a proposed data preprocessing procedure that includes detrending deseasonalization normalization outlier exclusion and formatting to verify the proposed strategy a non linear auto regressive exogenous model based on deep neural networks narx dnns a long short term memory lstm model a gated recurrent unit gru model and a reference model based on an auto regressive exogenous arx model are comparatively applied to water table level time series from the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk monitoring wells years 2005 2014 to test the developed preprocessing method estimates with and without the proposed detrending and deseasonalization dtds are compared quantitatively in the comparative applications all four models show reasonable prediction accuracies in addition it is found that the estimations from the narx and lstm models are superior to those of the other models in terms of prediction accuracy regardless of whether dtds is adopted in both data sets there is water table level depression during 2014 due to drought throughout the entire korean peninsula in multiple analyses stressed aquifer conditions are identified through estimations based on differences between estimates and observations where the differences are found to be more obvious with dtds preprocessing thus by using the proposed preprocessing method hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer can be effectively noticed at an earlier stage the results show that the advanced data driven models can be more effective when adopted in conjunction with the proposed preprocessing method and successfully utilized for monitoring and management of groundwater resources abbreviations

groundwater is an important source of freshwater in many regions it is well understood that compared to surface water groundwater resources are less influenced by external factors for this reason the value of groundwater is increasing due the global climate change and repeated droughts and floods however groundwater is still vulnerable to long term impacts such as prolonged drought excessive abstraction and constant pollutant introduction further once groundwater systems deteriorate quantitative and qualitative recovery usually takes a long time therefore to facilitate corrective action the influences from these adverse impacts should be detected at an appropriate time in groundwater management early corrections to prevent further groundwater deterioration are the most cost effective morris et al 2003 deployment of reversal action is inevitably slow because decisions regarding groundwater deterioration are often made manually by multiple decision makers early warnings or immediate management systems designed to ensure the quantity and quality of groundwater are essential for correcting problems in a timely manner however despite this necessity such a system has not been fully implemented along with the development of information and communication technology ict monitoring and management measures utilize automatic and real time characteristics cyber physical systems cpss proposed for intelligent manufacturing are a representative example of automated and real time management systems which can also be applied to groundwater management jeong et al 2017 jeong et al 2018 lee 2008 in such systems monitoring data are transmitted in real time and baseline estimates of groundwater quantity and quality are provided immediately from the predictive model or algorithm these two components real time data acquisition and estimation are the key factors of cps systems by comparing the observed data and estimates from the predictive models major discrepancies can be detected and reported to decision makers at an early stage discrepancies can potentially be associated with abnormal conditions such as excessive pumping contaminant introduction or failure of monitoring devices in the above system a model or algorithm that mimics the actual data generation process or natural phenomena hereafter referred to as digital twin has key importance because it can detect an abnormality in the real system through a comparison with actual observations there are multiple techniques for developing digital twins which can be categorized into process based and data driven models in groundwater problems process based models provide estimations based on partial differential equations pdes that govern the hydraulics and chemistry of groundwater however data driven models are based on linear or non linear regression analyses that mimic phenomenological patterns in the observed data process based models are rigorous in that they are based on mass balances given the precise required information regarding aquifers process based models may simulate the groundwater hydraulics and solute transport of an entire aquifer within a permissible error range however data driven models are limited to providing point wise estimates with a non physically based model however there are two major benefits of adopting a data driven model for groundwater problems 1 the model can be constructed without a priori information coulibaly et al 2001 and 2 the computational cost is significantly lower than the majority of the process based models while the results are often satisfactory owing to the computational efficiency of a data driven model reliable estimates can potentially be obtained based on an ensemble of repetitive estimations by bootstrap aggregating or bagging which may not be feasible with a process based model in practice time series data driven models based on artificial neural networks anns have been frequently used in water resources problems within the past two decades altunkaynak 2007 chang et al 2014 coulibaly et al 2001 maier and dandy 1996 wunsch et al 2018 young et al 2015 liu et al 2018 among the studies feedforward networks non linear auto regressive exogenous narx models and recurrent neural networks rnns have been used for groundwater level estimations recently chang et al 2014 kenda et al 2018 and wunsch et al 2018 adopted ann based narx models in which a single hidden layer with up to eight neurons was used to estimate surface and groundwater levels however these studies did not include comparisons between the narx and other deep neural network dnn models with multiple hidden layers regarding the applications of rnn coulibaly et al 2001 successfully used a simple recurrent network srn for groundwater level estimation however as can be inferred from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem of srn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the algorithm may not be efficient when the groundwater response depends on long term preceding explanatory variables especially in a region with significantly delayed water table responses due to precipitation although the long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 model is a state of the art technique among rnn based models relatively few researchers have applied it to the field of hydrogeology silva et al 2013 kratzert et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 among these studies zhang et al 2018 adopted an lstm model for the prediction of water table depth and the superiority of the lstm model was verified against simple feedforward neural network based on monthly estimates furthermore groundwater measurements often include various types of outliers such as irrelevant data from non major or extraneous data generating processes or measurements errors by considering the outlying data estimation quality may be significantly reduced and estimations may diverge therefore outliers should be ignored during model training the main purpose of this study was to develop tools for real time groundwater monitoring and management by adopting several advanced data driven models for this purpose multiple advanced data driven models were applied to water table level estimations and compared to obtain the characteristics of the estimates further an estimation procedure that is suitable for predicting water table levels was proposed as advanced estimation algorithms narx based on dnn narx dnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru cho et al 2014 models were adopted in this study along with suitable training networks although the lstm model has been applied recently to estimate water table depth zhang et al 2018 the estimates were restricted to monthly data and the performance comparisons were limited for this reason the key research objectives of the present study which is still open are as follows 1 to apply advanced data driven model as tools for real time groundwater monitoring and management and 2 to compare the model performances to further improve the performance of the models robust regression and outlier exclusion based on the least trimmed squares lts rousseeuw 1984 method was applied as a data preprocessor to validate the prediction ability of the suggested algorithms and procedure actual groundwater level and climatic data were used to estimate groundwater levels here the auto regressive exogenous arx model was comparatively applied as the reference model 2 methodology 2 1 estimation procedure the general procedure adopted for training and validating prediction models sequentially consists of data acquisition preprocessing model training and validation of the trained model in the early stage of implementation the data are divided into two parts one for training the suggested models and the other for testing the trained models because the model was designed to predict groundwater levels the response data consist of groundwater levels and the explanatory data consist of a few daily climate observations potentially affecting groundwater levels through recharge and evapotranspiration these include average temperature cumulative precipitation average relative humidity average atmospheric pressure and cumulative sunshine hours the reference data length which is the number of past and current explanatory data items to be referenced for estimation of the current groundwater level is considered to be a hyperparameter and determined by a combination of hyperparameter optimization methods i e grid search and trial and error tuning physically this value is related to the time lag between explanatory data such as precipitation and the water table response as explained by jeong and park 2017 and jeong et al 2018 however for the data driven model the reference data length is not directly correlated to the physical value the time span from infiltration to recharge during data preprocessing detrending subtraction of long term linear trends deseasonalization subtraction of long term periodicity normalization and outlier exclusion were conducted to enhance the training efficiency and estimation accuracy where detrending and deseasonalization are optional the initial preprocessing involves subtracting long term trends and periodicity in the groundwater level data for this purpose a robust regression model was applied the theoretical details are provided in the following section in this procedure long term trends and periodicity in groundwater level data were estimated from the training data that were subtracted from the entire data set in the second procedure during data preprocessing normalization was performed to adjust the scale of the data according to a common scale to improve estimation efficiency the third preprocessing procedure was identification of missing or outlying data in the explanatory and response data which were excluded in the training of the models the last preprocessing procedure was data formatting each model requires a different input data format and explanatory data were rearranged according to this requirement after the data preprocessing the models were trained based on the corresponding formatted data the time series prediction models narx dnn lstm and gru were then applied these models were implemented using python 3 6 https www python org and tensorflow 1 8 detailed explanations of the adopted models are provided in supplementary material i tensorflow is an open source machine learning library developed by the google brain team https www tensorflow org the hardware used for training was equipped with an intel xeon 2 30 ghz cpu 36 cores 2 sockets 128 gb memory and microsoft windows 10 in the training the models were optimized based on backpropagation for narx dnn or a backpropagation through time for lstm and gru algorithm with an adaptive moment estimation algorithm adam kignma and ba 2014 in which the mean squared error mse between the estimated and actual groundwater levels was supplied as the cost function to ensure a sufficiently small training error an appropriate number of iterations and stopping criterion were used however an excessively large number of iterations and small stopping criterion were avoided to prevent overfitting of the model in the testing of the trained model validation it was assumed that there were no informed actual groundwater levels in the entire prediction period except for a small fraction of earlier data corresponding to the length of the reference data at the beginning of the testing estimation therefore in continuing the validation the groundwater levels required in the explanatory data were substituted by the previously estimated values feedback connection in this sense assuming the total timespan of the data was 10 years and using 50 of the data for testing the latter five years of groundwater levels were estimated without referring to measured levels the testing portion was determined experimentally where the portion could be lengthened or shortened depending on the data characteristics 2 2 preprocessing of time series data it was reported that conventional time series models based on ann do not effectively represent long term trends and seasonal variability in the data zhang and qi 2005 meanwhile guzman et al 2017 demonstrated that the seasonality component was efficiently overcome by implementing narx ann in the present study it was assumed that subtracting trends detrending and seasonality deseasonalization from the observed data may or may not affect the estimation quality therefore from a neutral point of view the effect that detrending and deseasonalization have on the water table level prediction was evaluated based on applications of the actual data in the applications two types of comparative tests were performed in the first test detrending and deseasonalization were not conducted whereas they were conducted in the second test during the data preprocessing procedure to derive the long term trends and seasonal variability of the water table level from the observed data which typically include outliers and missing data the robust least trimmed square lts regression method was used for preprocessing of the response data the expected benefits of the proposed detrending and deseasonalization dtds using the robust estimators of the lts technique are twofold the first benefit is the efficiency of the estimation the proposed preprocessing with the lts technique eliminates the need to remove the outliers from the data which typically precedes the estimation the second benefit is that by assuming consistency of the trends and stationarity of seasonal variability the process changes that occur in a groundwater system can be effectively detected by the proposed dtds this agrees with the purpose of this study which is the development of a management tool for groundwater systems the adopted lts method is based on linear regression in the linear regression given n t observations y y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 y t t with sizes n t 1 at the corresponding time t t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 t t t n t 1 the predicted trend y of the observed data with time is given by 1 y x θ where x is a design matrix containing explanatory variables based on a first order linear function such that x 1 t 1 1 1 1 1 1 t n t 1 and θ is a vector of parameters 2 1 estimated by minimizing the objective function o of the mean squared error mse as follows 2 o t y θ 1 t i 1 n t i 2 t i y i θ 1 t y y t y y in the equation t y t y t i e the error between the observed data y t and the predicted values y t maximum likelihood estimation mle a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model from a set of observations was applied to the linear regression problems and the parameters corresponding to design matrix x were finally estimated by the following equation 3 θ x t x 1 x t y in case of seasonal variability in the time series x may be extended for example to 4 x 1 t ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 in eq 4 ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 are equal to the periodic functions sin 2 π l t cos 2 π l t sin 4 π l t and cos 4 π l t respectively corresponding to the elements of t where l is set to 365 days to account for the typical annual variability observed in groundwater level fluctuations according to annual precipitation it was confirmed through further analysis based on the above equations eqs 3 4 that the addition of more frequencies does not significantly improve the approximation of the time series the lts method optimizes the parameters θ l t s by iteratively minimizing the objective function eq 2 for a fraction of the data as shown in the following equation 5 θ l t s τ argmin θ lts i 1 n h i 2 t i y i θ l t s τ 1 where i is the i th smallest error i e 1 i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 t h τ is the number of the optimization and n h equals half the number of observations n h n t 2 in addition time series data are typically plagued with missing or outlying points which reduces the applicability of the models that adopt mse as a cost function and thus exacerbate the training and prediction quality to eliminate the influence of outlying data in the training process the outliers must be excluded from the observations for this purpose the 6 σ rule was adopted as a result data outside the range between x θ lts 6 σ neg 1 and x θ lts 6 σ pos 1 were considered to be outliers σ neg and σ pos are the standard deviations separately determined from the misfits in the half regions the observations lower and higher than x θ lts jeong et al 2017 the explanatory data were normalized into a standardized range data normalization to facilitate training convergence and the response data were normalized in a range to fit in the range of the activation function of the output layer for example if the activation function of the output layer was a sigmoid function with a range from 0 to 1 the following scaling method can be adopted 6 ξ t ξ t ξ min ξ max ξ min where ξ max and ξ min are the maximum and minimum values of the targeted time series data ξ t respectively and ξ t is the normalized time series with a range between 0 and 1 as the final preprocessing step the explanatory data must be rearranged to fit the data format requirements of a model data formatting for the arx and narx dnn models the general format of the explanatory data for estimation of the response data at time t is given by 7 x x t l 1 t 1 t x t l n t n t x t l n t n t y t l 0 t 1 t where x t l n t n is the n th type of explanatory variable for the estimation of the targeted response variable y t given n different types of explanatory variables whose expanded form is x t l n n x t l n 1 n x t 1 n x t n t and l n n 1 n is the number of past explanatory data points to be referenced for the estimation because all the applied models include auto regressive explanatory variables the past response variables were also applied to x where l 0 indicates the number of past response variables y t l 0 t 1 to be considered for an estimation of y t for recurrent neural network models lstm and gru the format of the explanatory data at time t is given by 8 ξ ξ t l ξ t l 1 ξ t

t y t t the theoretical summaries of the applied time series models of arx narx dnn lstm and gru are provided in supplementary material i 3 study areas to verify the applicability of the models described above to groundwater level estimations time series data from two different locations were used the following sections contain brief descriptions of the geography geology groundwater level data and climate in both locations 3 1 jindo uisin monitoring well the jindo uisin monitoring well is located on jindo island which is the third largest island in south korea located off the southwest corner of the korean peninsula the monitoring well is approximately 3 3 km from the southern coast of the island and the elevation of the location is 14 75 m above mean sea level msl the well is drilled to 70 m below the surface where the upper portion 0 12 6 m is encased and screens are installed at 24 28 32 36 and 40 44 m intervals below the surface in this study the daily averaged groundwater level data from 2005 through 2014 were used the mean level was 5 74 m and the standard deviation was 0 255 m therefore the mean thickness of the unsaturated zone was about 9 m composed of an uppermost clay layer 0 2 m coarse sand 2 6 m and weathered andesitic tuff 6 12 6 m the mean temperature of the area was 13 6 and the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation rate were 3 65 and 13 1 mm respectively in the data the average cumulative precipitation rate during the spring season february to may when irrigation water was required for agricultural activities was 374 4 mm however less than average precipitation was recorded during 2013 287 mm and 2014 316 5 mm there were only a few missing data in daily averaged relative humidity and atmospheric pressure whose influences were marginalized by taking the mean value of the corresponding data 3 2 pohang gibuk monitoring well the pohang gibuk monitoring well is located in the southeast area of the korean peninsula and is surrounded by mountains a few artificial reservoirs which are used for agricultural irrigation and regularly discharge water are located within 4 km of the well the monitoring well is located about 150 m away from a rill and the elevation is 121 1 m above msl the well is drilled to 70 m below the surface where the upper portion 0 8 9 m is encased and screens are installed at 50 54 58 62 and 66 70 m intervals below the surface the aquifer is composed of fractured shale while the unsaturated zone is mostly sand and gravel as with the previous jindo uisin data the daily averaged groundwater level data during years 2005 through 2014 were used to verify the performance of the suggested models the mean of the groundwater level was 116 32 m which indicates that the mean thickness of the unsaturated zone of the area was about 4 8 m the standard deviation was 0 722 m the mean temperature of the area was 14 6 c and the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation rate were 2 97 and 10 1 mm respectively the cumulative precipitation rate during the spring season february to may of 2014 was 207 5 mm which is 74 4 of the average of the other 10 years 278 9 mm 4 results and discussion in the model training the manipulation of model hyperparameters such as the numbers of hidden nodes and layers in the narx or hidden states in the lstm and gru is the most important factor for enhancing the prediction capability therefore the training network for estimating water table levels was repeatedly tested by changing the hyperparameters systematically to obtain the optimal hyperparameters for the data of a specific area the root mean square error rmse between the estimated and normalized actual water table level min and max values were 0 and 1 respectively was applied as the training target the training tolerance was set to be sufficiently small although excessively small values were intentionally avoided for regularization purposes based on multiple training tests it was confirmed that standard regularization methods such as l2 and drop out did not improve the water table level estimation quality fig 1 shows an example of the training blue line and testing orange line results based on the first and second halves of the water table level data black stars acquired from the jindo uisin monitoring well as shown in the figure the residuals of the first period were sufficiently small because the data from this period was targeted during the training of the model while those in the testing period were relatively large the larger residuals are attributed to the fact that no actual water table levels were involved in the estimation during the testing period during this period the previously estimated water table levels were fed back as the auto regressive explanatory variables for the subsequent estimations as the explanatory variables the daily average temperature cumulative precipitation average relative humidity average atmospheric pressure cumulative sunshine hours and preceding water table levels a total of six variables were used for the following case studies in which four different models arx narx lstm and gru were applied to estimate the water table levels the explanatory variables were determined by considering the factors affecting water table level fluctuation by recharge and evapotranspiration xu et al 2006 however the quality of the estimation can be improved with fewer explanatory variables through sensitivity analysis of the variables 4 1 jindo uisin monitoring well to train the models based on data from the jindo uisin monitoring well the optimal set of hyperparameters for each model was obtained by a combination of a grid search for integer type parameters and trial and error tuning for real type parameters except for the arx model from the hyperparameter search the past referenced data spanning a period of 10 d were determined for the arx model the network was composed of one input layer and one output layer with 59 and 1 node respectively 59 a b c 1 a of explanatory data 5 b of response data 1 c the number of days in the past reference data 10 the 1 indicates subtraction of the current or targeted response data the narx model also had one input layer with 59 nodes and one output layer while six hidden layers with 16 nodes were additionally used between the input and output layers in both lstm and gru estimations a total of 59 input nodes and 32 hidden states were used subsequently the outputs of the final cell 32 hidden states in the lstm and gru models were interpreted using one fully connected hidden layer with 32 nodes which was connected to one output value water table level estimation for model training and testing the data were evenly divided into two datasets each containing 1821 d i e the first five years and second five years of applied data i e the six types of explanatory variables during the model training the water table levels from the first half of the data were assumed to be fully known and used to optimize the model parameters or weights contrarily during the testing of the trained model only the water table levels of the initial 10 d which is equal to the timespan of the past reference data determined from hyperparameter search were assumed to be known for all the input data data preprocessing procedures outlier identification missing data control and data normalization section 2 2 were implemented and the explanatory data were formatted according to the appropriate data input format figs 2 and 3 shows the estimation results of the arx narx lstm and gru models the results were generated using the water table level data from the jindo uisin monitoring well years 2005 2014 figs 2 and 3 show the estimated water table levels blue solid lines without detrending and deseasonalization preprocessing non dtds and with detrending and deseasonalization preprocessing dtds respectively as seen in the testing estimation period 2010 2014 of the figures all the applied models reasonably captured the water table fluctuation pattern except for the last year 2014 the water table level estimates generated by the models for 2014 all significant overestimated the actual water table levels these observations suggest that the water table level generation process during 2014 was significantly altered from that of the preceding period 2005 2013 in fact the 2014 drought caused severe problems in the many parts of south korea including the jindo area therefore the significant deviation between the estimated and actual water table levels suggests that the model estimation can serve as a criterion for determining hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer by providing reference water table levels the accuracy of each model was evaluated based on the rmse and correlation coefficient between the estimated and actual water table levels the rmse values between the estimated and actual values in the non dtds case during p1 were 0 123 0 106 0 109 and 0 148 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 770 0 853 0 842 and 0 662 all four models exhibited reasonable prediction performance during p1 and among the models the narx and lstm models exhibited relatively higher prediction accuracy than the other two models arx and gru the prediction accuracies of the models deteriorated substantially during p2 in the non dtds case where the rmse values were 0 201 0 304 0 209 and 0 240 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 328 0 175 0 014 and 0 071 based on the deterioration in the models fits to the actual data sudden changes in hydrological processes can be detected meanwhile the rmse values achieved by adopting dtds preprocessing during p1 were 0 124 0 112 0 112 and 0 109 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients are 0 873 0 919 0 924 and 0 920 table 1 although the rmse values were similar to those of the non dtds case the correlation coefficients showed clear improvement the performance of the gru model was the lowest in terms of the mean rmse and correlation coefficient in the non dtds case whereas the gru model showed markedly improved performance when the dtds was utilized this suggests that dtds preprocessing was essential for improving the accuracy of the gru model when it was applied to the jindo uisin monitoring well for the case with dtds preprocessing the highly non linear models of narx lstm and gru were clearly superior to the arx model as in the previous case overestimations of the models were prominent in the dtds case during p2 where the rmse values were 0 310 0 330 0 376 and 0 344 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively these values were generally higher than those in the non dtds case the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 256 0 365 0 167 and 0 143 for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively these values also imply that the hydrological process was significantly altered to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of the dtds preprocessing in terms of the detectability of hydrological process changes the respective mean rmse and correlation coefficient values were separately computed for the non dtds and dtds preprocessing cases the means of the rmse values during period p1 were similar for both cases 0 122 m for non dtds and 0 114 m for dtds cases where that of the dtds case was slightly lower on the contrary during p2 the mean rmse of the dtds case 0 340 m was significantly larger than that of the non dtds case 0 239 m this aspect can also be seen by comparing the estimated water table levels blue solid line in figs 2 and 3 both cases exhibited similar prediction performances during p1 whereas during p2 the predictions achieved by adopting dtds preprocessing exhibited clear overestimations compared to those of the non dtds case by eliminating general trends and seasonal variability in the dtds case consistency of trends and stationarity of seasonal variability were naturally assumed thus the estimates with the dtds will generate water table levels without accounting for significant process changes in this sense it is expected that the model estimates with the proposed dtds preprocessing can be more effectively used to notice hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer whether from natural or anthropogenic causes anomalies in the aquifer conditions can be noticed at an early stage by computing the sequential discrepancy between the estimated and actual water table levels in time the orange bars in figs 2 and 3 show the change in the temporal window averaged rmse between the estimates and actual observations for non dtds and dtds cases respectively in the computations a moving average with a 60 day temporal window was applied as shown in both figures the rmse values prior to 2014 during p1 were nearly stationary for all the estimates generated by the arx narx lstm and gru models during this period the window averaged rmse values with small and constant variances can be considered as inherent estimation errors by applying the respective model in contrast the rmse values began to dramatically increase in the spring season of 2014 for the arx narx lstm and gru models the rmse values during 2014 p2 increased two to three times from these observations the changes in the hydrological conditions of the aquifers can be perceived early prior to any significant decline in the water table level in particular when comparing the results of the non dtds and dtds cases the changes in mean rmse values with dtds preprocessing are much clearer than those without dtds this result indicates that the estimation results achieved by applying detrending and deseasonalization were more reliable for detecting hydrological changes in an aquifer this superiority in discernibility of hydrological processes can be attributed to the stationarity assumptions used in dtds preprocessing therefore the proposed preprocessing method of detrending and deseasonalization can be effectively used for the purpose of surveilling groundwater resources by providing reliable reference estimates 4 2 pohang gibuk monitoring well similar to the previous case the models were applied to estimate the water table levels in the pohang gibuk monitoring well the structure of the arx model was identical to that in the previous application for the narx model one input with 59 nodes one output and one hidden layer with 16 nodes were used the applied lstm and gru networks were identically composed of 59 input nodes and two hidden states and the output of the last cell was interpreted by one fully connected hidden layer with two nodes connected to an output node the hyperparameters of the narx lstm and gru models were manipulated by combining a grid search for integer type parameters and trial and error tuning for real type parameters also 10 days of past referenced data were determined from the hyperparameter search the data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well showed gaussian like daily noise as shown figs 4 and 5 due to the noise it was difficult to train a model to fit all the points and by fitting all the points overfitting can occur therefore the minor noise was considered to be negligible in the training prior to the model estimates all the input data were preprocessed as in the previous application and divided equally into model training and testing data where the data from 2005 through 2009 were used for model training and the remaining data 2010 2014 were used for testing the trained models figs 4 and 5 show the estimated results from the four models applied to the water table level data 2005 2014 the results of the non dtds and dtds cases are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively similar to the previous applications for all the models the estimated water table levels blue solid lines without dtds preprocessing during p1 exhibited reasonable representations of the actual data except for the year 2014 the rmse values were 0 552 0 475 0 465 and 0 551 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 666 0 698 0 730 and 0 649 the rmses and correlation coefficients indicate that the narx and lstm models had reasonably high prediction capabilities compared to the arx and gru models but the differences were not significant as in the results for the jindo uisin monitoring well comparing the results for p1 and p2 shows that the four models significantly overestimated the p2 water table levels of pohang gibuk rmse 0 737 m arx 0 674 m narx 0 733 m lstm and 0 702 m gru similar to the jindo area the pohang region also suffered from severe drought during 2014 this is a potential cause of the hydrological process changes in the groundwater system as in the previous applications the resulting changes in the hydrological processes due to severe drought in 2014 are clearer in the results of the dtds case with dtds preprocessing the rmse values were 0 546 0 461 0 465 and 0 488 m for the arx narx lstm and gru models respectively during p1 and the corresponding correlation coefficients are 0 629 0 709 0 710 and 0 674 table 1 meanwhile the rmse values and correlation coefficients for p2 significantly deteriorated compared to those of p1 rmse 1 081 m arx 1 045 m narx 0 963 m lstm 0 992 m gru correlation coefficient 0 561 arx 0 626 narx 0 663 lstm 0 624 gru these overestimations for p2 by the four models are also clear in fig 5 as in the previous applications the model estimates showed clear contrast in their fits of the actual observations for p1 and p2 where the excellent fit during p1 significantly decreased during p2 again the critical deterioration in the estimation accuracies may be related to the changes in hydrological processes among the models the narx estimates have the lowest rmse value during p1 where the difference in the rmse values of p1 and p2 was the greatest p1 0 0461 m p2 1 045 m as in the results for the jindo uisin area the performance of the gru model also significantly improved with dtds preprocessing compared to the non dtds case table 1 the orange bars in figs 4 and 5 show the moving average rmse based on a 60 day moving window for the non dtds and dtds cases respectively similar to the results from the jindo uisin area the values for the arx narx lstm and gru models remained nearly stationary before 2014 and began to dramatically increase in the spring season of that year comparing the values of the non dtds and dtds cases the increasing patterns achieved by adopting dtds preprocessing were more significant than those in the jindo uisin applications the consistent observation from the two different locations supports the fact that hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer can be detected at an early stage through the proposed preprocessing method of detrending and deseasonalization ultimately with the proposed method sound monitoring of a target aquifer is expected to be achieved by utilizing suitable thresholds specified by decision makers 5 summary and conclusions by providing reference estimates water table level forecasting can play an important role in the management of groundwater resources in the present study several advanced data driven models were adopted for water table level estimations and were paired with a newly proposed preprocessing procedure to improve the estimation efficiency and accuracy as advanced models the non linear auto regressive exogenous model based on deep neural networks narx dnns the long short term memory lstm model and the gated recurrent unit gru model were adopted and the auto regressive exogenous arx model was used a reference model the proposed preprocessing routine included detrending deseasonalization data normalization outlier exclusion and data formatting where detrending and deseasonalization dtds of the response data water table level data were optional actual water table level and climatic data from the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk areas were used to validate the prediction capabilities of the proposed models and determine the effect of the data preprocessing when applying the models to data from the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk locations all the applied models arx narx lstm and gru exhibited reasonable prediction accuracies where the applications with dtds preprocessing showed slight improvements in particular the highly nonlinear predictive models narx and lstm showed relatively higher prediction performance than the other two models the estimates based on the gru model had slightly higher or similar accuracies to those obtained from the arx model when dtds preprocessing was not used while the accuracy remarkably improved with dtds the overall results suggested that application of non linear prediction models provides adequate performance particularly when dtds preprocessing is associated by providing reference estimates water table level estimation from a data driven model can serve as a tool for monitoring aquifer conditions the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk data showed a decline in water table levels which is believed to have been caused by a severe drought in 2014 it is found that all the applied models can detect hydrological stress in an aquifer by overestimating the water table level during the period to quantitatively address this aspect the capabilities of detecting hydrological condition changes in an aquifer were comparatively tested during the normal period without hydrological changes 2005 2013 the prediction accuracies of the applied models were reasonable thus no hydrological changes were indicated however for 2014 the water table levels from the applied models were commonly overestimated compared to the actual data this observation indicates that the actual water table level declined because of hydrological changes which could be detected effectively based on the difference between the estimated and observed water table levels in depth analyses particularly those based on a proposed moving averaged rmse values confirmed that the model estimates generated using dtds preprocessing were more effective in detecting hydrological changes the effectiveness of estimates using dtds preprocessing was attributed to the implied assumption of consistency of trends and stationarity of seasonal variability the applications and analyses in this study showed that water table level estimation using non linear models such as narx and lstm in conjunction with the proposed preprocessing method is a promising method for monitoring and managing groundwater resources by detecting the quantitative or qualitative deterioration of groundwater resources at an early stage of an incident cost effective reversal measures can be implemented in this sense the method proposed in this study can be used as an effective tool for intelligent and efficient monitoring and management of groundwater resources to this end the general practicality of the proposed method should be evaluated based on extending the applications to a broader array of data from various aquifer conditions in addition the proposed method should be studied comparatively with process based estimation methods to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the both method types 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgement we thank
