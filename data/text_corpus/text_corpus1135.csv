5675,modeling saturated unsaturated flow in fractured rock formations remains a challenging issue due to the difficulties in properly calibrating the unsaturated flow properties for fractured rocks on the basis of the continuum approach this study uses inverse modeling to determine the unsaturated hydraulic parameters of fractured rocks loose sediments and geologic structures in a large scale slope under difficult hydrogeologic conditions at the baihetan dam site southwest china the saturated hydraulic conductivities were determined a priori by packer tests field data including time series of groundwater level observations and available discharge measurements is used a combined procedure of orthogonal design finite element forward analysis artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is adopted for the inverse analysis with high computational efficiency the numerical results well reproduce the typical features of multiple water tables and wedge shaped unsaturated zones controlled by gently sloping tuff zones of low vertical permeability showing 46 65 of groundwater flowing subhorizontally along each tuff zone and the remaining 35 54 infiltrating vertically and recharging deeper layers the drastic drawdown of groundwater level after 10 year site characterization is also reproduced the calculated discharge and water tables agree reasonably well with field observations indicating that the estimated parameters are representative of the unsaturated hydraulic properties at the site this work provides an efficient and effective methodology for seeking an optimal

applications such as nuclear waste disposal contaminant transport oil and gas extraction underground oil storage and landslide mitigation li et al 2017 liu et al 1998 rulon et al 1985 accurately characterizing this flow process is extremely difficult and has been one of the most challenging issues in subsurface hydrology mainly because of the multi scale geometries and complex interactions of the fracture matrix system the technical difficulties in measuring fracture flow in the field and the multi dimensional and heterogeneous flow behaviors evans and rasmussen 1991 liu et al 1998 in particular the groundwater typically moves preferentially through fractures and faults of large scales peters and klavetter 1988 illman and hughson 2005 besides multiple water tables and wedge shaped unsaturated zones may develop if the stratigraphy consists of subhorizontal layers of contrasting permeabilities rulon et al 1985 various modeling approaches have been proposed to describe the multi scale multi dimensional flow behaviors through the fracture matrix system including the equivalent continuum peters and klavetter 1988 finsterle 2000 liu et al 2003 lu and kwicklis 2012 dual continuum illman and hughson 2005 mathias et al 2006 triple continuum wu et al 2004 discrete fracture network evans and rasmussen 1991 percolation network kueper and mcwhorter 1992 and stochastic representation approaches illman and hughson 2005 lu and kwicklis 2012 the equivalent continuum model treats the fractured rock as a porous medium with an equivalent permeability obtained through homogenization of the flow process this approach has been widely used for its simplicity and high computational efficiency bathe and khoshgoftaar 1979 chen et al 2008 2016 desai and li 1983 li et al 2017 zheng et al 2005 the discrete fracture network model can explicitly simulate flow in all fractures in a rock mass evans and rasmussen 1991 however due to the large number of fractures involved it is often computationally prohibitive to adopt this approach in site scale applications the dual medium model simultaneously considers fast flow in the fractures and slow flow in the porous matrix barenblatt et al 1960 warren and root 1963 zimmerman et al 1993 illman and hughson 2005 mathias et al 2006 but its application still has great limitations due to the uncertainty of the spatial distribution of the fracture system the tripe continuum model introduces an additional continuum based on the dual continuum model that requires one more parameter set for small fractures wu et al 2004 which makes it even more difficult to use than the dual continuum model the stochastic approach assumes that the local hydraulic properties are realizations of spatially correlated random fields and derives the partial differential equations representing the large scale flow conditions through averaging the local governing equations over the ensemble of realizations mantoglou and gelhar 1987c 1987a 1987b yeh et al 1985a 1985b 1985c among these approaches the continuum model has dominated as the most commonly used one for its efficiency in addressing large scale problems because the presence of numerous fractures of different scales causes extreme difficulty in fracture network construction and flow modeling the performance of a continuum model however largely depends on whether the unsaturated hydraulic properties i e water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of fractured rocks are properly determined and representative of the site conditions field measurements of permeability and porosity for unsaturated fractured rocks prove to be feasible by single hole e g illman and neuman 2000 or cross hole illman and neuman 2001 2003 pneumatic injection tests without modifying the saturation as done by water infiltration tests this is not the case however for direct measurement of unsaturated hydraulic properties representative of field scale behavior due to the complexity and variability of fracture geometries national research council 1996 hughson and yeh 2000 zhang and fredlund 2003 wu et al 2006 even though these measurements could be performed for core scale samples of individual fracture wang and narasimhan 1985 pruess and tsang 1990 reitsma and kueper 1994 persoff and pruess 1995 bertels et al 2001 chen and horne 2006 weerakone et al 2012 li et al 2014 and rock matrix montazer and wilson 1984 peters and klavetter 1988 faybishenko and finsterle 2000 flint 2003 therefore the classic water retention curves brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 and relative permeability models burdine 1953 mualem 1976 developed for unsaturated soils and porous media are often borrowed for describing the unsaturated flow in fractured rocks the development or extension of the water retention relations for unsaturated fractured rocks is based on the dual or triple porosity concept peters and klavetter 1988 zhang and fredlund 2003 wu et al 2004 active fracture concept liu et al 1998 fractal fracture geometry guarracino 2006 and two dimensional fracture network simulation and upscaling technique liu and bodvarsson 2001 2003 lu and kwicklis 2012 inverse modeling provides a powerful tool for estimation of hydraulic parameters in water retention models from laboratory experiments field groundwater observations and hydraulic tests e g kool and parker 1988 liu et al 1998 2003 bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 wu et al 2004 2006 song et al 2014 younes et al 2018 however difficulties always arise in the inverse modeling due to the problems of ill posedness computational burden and scales zhou et al 2014 hughson and yeh 2000 the objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling saturated unsaturated flow in a large scale rock slope of 5 km long located at the baihetan dam site southwest china based on the continuum approach and inverse modeling this slope is characteristic of difficult hydrogeologic conditions with multiple water levels in natural state due to the presence of gently sloping low vertical permeability tuff zones and drastic depletion of water table after ten years of site characterization due to the excavation of exploratory adits and drilling of boreholes the unsaturated hydraulic parameters in the water retention relation and relative permeability model are estimated by inverse modeling with the saturated hydraulic conductivities of rocks determined a priori by packer tests the objective function is constructed by using the time series observations of groundwater level and the available measurements of discharge in order to achieve high computational efficiency the combined procedure of orthogonal design od finite element fe analysis artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithm ga presented by zhou et al 2015 is adopted to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic parameters of rocks at the site the numerical results are compared with field observations to deepen our understanding of the saturated unsaturated flow in the rock slope subjected to precipitation evaporation cycles and exploratory adits excavation 2 site characterization 2 1 general description the study site jiang et al 2014 is situated on the left bank of the lower jinsha river in southwest china where the world s second largest hydropower project i e baihetan project consisting of a double curvature arch dam of 289 m high and two large scale underground cavern systems is under construction fig 1 the jinsha river runs through the dam site from south to north with a water level of about 591 m a s l in dry seasons forming a v shaped valley by fast downcutting the study area is characteristic of a mountainous landscape with steep gradients of 50 80 below the valley shoulder and gentler gradients towards the watershed between the jinsha river and its tributary on the west side the yibu river fig 1 the site lies in the subtropical monsoon climate zone where over 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season between may and october precipitation increases with elevation with the measured mean annual rainfalls being 727 2 mm at 635 m a s l near the dam site and 811 0 mm at 1 357 m respectively the mean monthly rainfall and evaporation at the study site are shown in fig 2 the average annual temperature is between 15 and 21 surface runoff is infrequent and of short duration with only two small perennial streams nos 1 and 3 in fig 1 in the study area 2 2 geological settings as shown in fig 3 the bedrocks outcropping in the study area are basaltic formations originated from multiple magmatic and volcanic eruption episodes the formations belong to the emei mountain group of the upper permian system p 2 β which can be categorized into 4 basalt flow layers p 2 β 1 p 2 β 4 of 445 470 290 340 210 260 and 85 115 m thick respectively according to the eruption sequences the rock layers mainly contain tholeiitic basalt cryptocrystalline basalt microcrystalline basalt and amygdaloidal basalt typically with a layer of tuff developed on the top of each rock unit wang et al 2009 the tuff layers are 0 1 1 75 m thick and have regional continuity the tuff is nonwelded and is composed of vitric fragments and glass shards 40 50 volcanic ash 30 40 basalt clasts 5 10 and plagioclase clasts 5 wang et al 2009 each tuff layer contains a shear zone hereafter referred to as tuff zone of 5 40 cm thick the formations dip gently towards the right bank with an orientation of n30 50 e se 15 25 the basalt rocks are overlain by loose sediments q3 and q4 of several to tens of meters thick on gentle hillslopes and underlain by thick carbonate rocks p1 deposited during the early permian period fig 3a the main structures in the study area consist of subvertical faults e g f17 f129 f133 and f134 and gently sloping tuff zones e g c2 c3 1 and c3 and shear zones e g ls331 ls3318 and ls3319 as shown in fig 3b among them f17 is a large scale fault of 0 5 3 m thick extending over 1400 m and mainly composed of well cemented tectonic breccia and cataclasite of moderate permeability other faults e g f129 f133 and f134 are of smaller sizes about 0 1 1 m thick and extending up to hundreds of meters and bounded by the tuff zones these faults are also significant to groundwater infiltration as they outcrop and dip subvertically the tuff zones are developed in the tuff layers in which fault gouge layers of 1 5 cm thick are developed as a result of tectonic shear between basalt layers fig s1 in supplementary material which makes the permeability of the tuff zones highly anisotropic with a potential permeability contrast of 2 orders of magnitude between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the tuff layer except ls331 the shear zones within each basaltic formation are mostly of small scale and mainly composed of basalt fragments besides the geologic structures mentioned above four groups of critically oriented fractures are developed in the basalt rocks with their geometrical properties shown in fig 3b and table s1 in supplementary material 2 3 permeability of rocks a total of 4413 conventional packer tests at 173 boreholes and 669 high pressure packer tests chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 at 26 boreholes together with a large number of pumping tests recovery tests slug tests and in situ seepage tests were performed at the site to investigate the permeability of the fractured basalt rocks structures i e faults tuff zones and shear zones and loose sediments the boreholes were drilled vertically from the ground surface or from the floors of exploratory adits horizontally excavated at different elevations into the slope fig 3b and fig 4 the diameter of the boreholes was 76 mm and the length of the test sections varied between 3 7 and 6 4 m chen et al 2018 the packer test data were interpreted with the hvorslev 1951 equation the test results indicate that the permeability of the fractured basalt rocks generally decreases with increasing depth fig s2 in supplementary material and can be more correlated to the degree of weathering the density of tensional joints and the level of in situ stress rather than the lithology downward from the ground surface the hydraulic conductivity k can be classified into six categories or permeability zones pzs fig 3b high k 10 5 high moderate 10 5 k 3 10 6 moderate 3 10 6 k 10 6 moderate low 10 6 k 3 10 7 low 3 10 7 k 10 7 and very low k 10 7 all in units of m s the main structures are mostly of moderate low to moderate permeability but the permeability of the unweathered tuff zones and shear zones is highly anisotropic table 1 lists the statistics of the hydraulic conductivity of the rocks and sediments at the site 2 4 groundwater observations groundwater in the study area is principally recharged by precipitation and discharged to streams and the jinsha river the groundwater flow and water table configuration in the basaltic formations are primarily controlled by the fracture system and the backbone structures consisting of subvertical faults and gently sloping tuff zones and shear zones as shown in fig 4 due to the very low vertical permeability of the tuff zones and shear zones table 1 multiple water tables develop in the slope fig 4 a phenomenon that has been frequently observed and well understood in layered hillsides e g rulon et al 1985 observations of groundwater in the slope started from 2001 through boreholes and exploratory adits and lasted for over ten years the exploratory adits were excavated horizontally into the slope from which a few branches parallel to the river were also excavated fig 4 the boreholes were drilled downward from the ground surface or from the floors of the adits the mean groundwater levels in wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 4 the groundwater level in the slope although influenced locally by fractures generally increased with ground surface elevation the groundwater level varied in a larger range typically 10 20 m between wet and dry seasons in boreholes near the river bank consistent with the change in river water level than far away from the river bank the presence of tuff zones and shear zones significantly influences the distribution and movement of groundwater in the slope when an exploratory adit was excavated across the tuff zones or shear zones a significant amount of discharge was generally observed from the upper block of the tuff shear zones indicating that these structures are of low vertical permeability and hinder the vertical infiltration the discharge into each adit decayed due to the advance of neighboring adits but the total discharge into the whole adit system maintained a stable magnitude and was less influenced by precipitation events for example the total discharge during site characterization from the exploratory adit pd61 and its five branches pd61 1 pd61 5 which cut through a series of faults and tuff shear zones e g f17 and c3 had rather stable measurements around 110 l min by weirs furthermore when the tuff zones c3 1 and c3 were penetrated by the boreholes a sharp drawdown of groundwater level generally occurred multiple groundwater levels were observed after the boreholes were isolated with concrete plugs at the intersection with the tuff zones table 2 lists the vertical distance between the groundwater levels observed above and below the tuff zones in four typical boreholes fig 5 for example in borehole zk1119 a vertical distance of 24 4 m between the upper and lower groundwater levels was observed similarly in borehole zk412 a vertical distance of around 23 0 m between the groundwater levels was observed during the wet season it should be noted however that as commonly done in dam engineering the unsaturated zone was not monitored even though techniques e g tensiometers and neutron probes are available for the measurements of flow quantities such as pressure head and water content e g ireson et al 2006 this is a major limitation of this study but motivates us to examine if the unsaturated zone parameters could be reasonably estimated with the observations in the saturated zone 3 inverse modeling approach 3 1 saturated unsaturated flow model in the framework of continuum approach peters and klavetter 1988 where the fractured rocks are treated as equivalent continua the saturated unsaturated water flow is governed by the following mass balance equation e g mao et al 2011 also known as the richards 1931 equation 1 c w ω s s h t v 0 where h is the pressure head c w θ h is the specific moisture capacity θ is the volumetric water content s s is the specific storage ω is a step function of h ω 0 for h 0 in unsaturated zone and ω 1 for h 0 in saturated zone t is time and v is the flow velocity described by darcy s law 2 v k r k h z where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor k r is the relative permeability depending on h or θ z is the positive upward vertical coordinate and h z is the hydraulic head the water mass balance equation eq 1 is subjected to the following initial condition in the domain ω of interest 3 h t 0 h 0 in ω where h 0 is the initial distribution of pressure head in ω and the following boundary conditions 1 the water head boundary condition dirichlet boundary condition 4a h t h t on γ h where h is the prescribed pressure head on the water head boundary γ h 2 the flux boundary condition neumann boundary condition 4b q n t v t n q n t on γ q where q n is the prescribed flux positive for inflow on the flux boundary γ q and n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary 3 the unified lateral conditions on the third type boundaries including the seepage faces rain infiltration surfaces and evaporation surfaces borsi et al 2006 hu et al 2017 4c δ h h 0 δ q n q n 0 h h q n q n 0 on γ s γ i γ e where γ s γ i and γ e denote the seepage face boundary rain infiltration surface and the evaporation surface respectively δ is a sign indicator with δ 1 on γ s and γ i and δ 1 on γ e h and q n are the maximum allowable values of pressure head and flux respectively with h 0 and q n 0 on γ s h h p and q n i t on γ i and h h d and q n r e on γ e h p is the ponding depth of water on the infiltration boundary γ i and i t is the rainfall intensity h d is the minimum pressure head determined by temperature and air relative humidity on the evaporation boundary γ e and r e is a negative flux rate representing the maximum evaporation rate in the field eq 4c states that on the third type boundaries γ s γ i and γ e the boundary condition is either a prescribed pressure h h when the flux is no more than the allowable flux rate δq n δq n or a prescribed flux rate q n q n when the pressure is no more than the allowable pressure δh δh the presence of the lateral boundary conditions in eq 4c introduces strong nonlinearity of the partial differential equation pde in eq 1 for saturated unsaturated flow problems which can be rigorously and effectively solved with a numerical procedure based on the parabolic variational inequality pvi method hu et al 2017 the discretized pvi algorithm was detailed in hu et al 2017 and was implemented in the fe code thyme chen et al 2009 as clarified by site characterization fig 3 and fig 4 the groundwater at the site primarily flows along the direction perpendicular to the river i e along the trace of cross section i i in fig 1 and the flow along the river direction is rather slow a 2d fe mesh along section i i was therefore created for saturated unsaturated flow modeling which contains 24 782 four node isoparametric elements and 25 197 nodes as plotted in fig 6 the size of the model domain is 5000 m long and 2190 m high the topographic and geologic settings such as the strata faults tuff shear zones and pzs at cross section i i fig 1 were well represented it should be noted that the exploratory adits parallel to the profile e g pd 61 fig 4 could not be accurately represented in the 2d mesh and were modelled with equivalent spacing per unit length fig 6b and fig s3 in supplementary material the boundary conditions were specified as follows 1 the lateral boundaries on the mountain side and on the river side were both assumed to be groundwater divides and thus were prescribed with a no flow boundary 2 the riverbed surface was imposed with a water head boundary according to the fluctuation of the river water level 3 the surfaces of the exploratory adits were taken as a seepage face boundary 4 the slope surface was prescribed with a precipitation evaporation boundary with h p 0 m and h d 200 m corresponding to a saturation of 16 18 for loose sediments and tuff zones according to the site condition precipitation was assumed to occur in the middle ten days of a month and the mean monthly precipitation and evaporation rates were taken from fig 2 5 the base of the model was assumed to be impermeable the initial distribution of pressure head in the saturated zone of the slope h 0 0 was determined by estimating a water table that best fits the average groundwater level observations in boreholes with a steady state flow model in the unsaturated zone h 0 0 h 0 was roughly estimated by assuming a vertically linear reduction of saturation to 60 at the ground surface to eliminate the influence of h 0 distribution on groundwater flow a natural precipitation evaporation process was first simulated until the groundwater flow in each season became stable this process typically lasted for 360 months from may 1971 to may 2001 the site exploration process was then modelled see table 5 for the excavation process of the exploratory adit system lasting for 120 months from may 2001 to may 2011 the initial time step and maximum time step in each simulation were taken as 7 h and 7 days respectively 3 2 constitutive relations and hydraulic parameters the hydraulic properties that need to be determined for numerical modeling of water movement in saturated unsaturated fractured rocks include the saturated hydraulic conductivity k the specific storage s s the water content θ and the relative permeability k r the hydraulic conductivity tensor k or its isotropic counterpart k of fractured rocks at the field scale can be reasonably determined without technical difficulty by performing a sufficient number of field hydraulic tests e g hsieh and neuman 1985 owing to the experiences that have been long accumulated the determined hydraulic conductivity is generally of high confidence and representative of the field conditions table 1 the specific storage of rocks is estimated by s s ρ w g α r ϕα w where α r is the compressibility of rock α w is the compressibility of water ϕ is the porosity and ρ w is the density of water table 1 and table s2 in supplementary material the water content relation also called the water retention curve is defined as the relationship between the volumetric water content θ or the degree of saturation s e and suction s i e the negative pressure head s h quite a number of water retention curves have been developed for unsaturated soils and porous media brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 and extended to incorporate the effects of hydraulic hysteresis and soil deformation e g assouline et al 1998 nuth and laloui 2008 tarantino 2009 gallipoli 2012 zhou et al 2012 hu et al 2013 these models are often borrowed for unsaturated fractured rocks due to the technical difficulties in the field scale measurements of water content relation in rocks of much higher heterogeneity numerical simulations and validations peters and klavetter 1988 liu et al 1998 2003 liu and bodvarsson 2001 2003 wu et al 2004 have shown that the classic van genuchten 1980 model with a proper parameterization representative of field conditions is suitable for representing the water content relation in unsaturated fractured rocks which reads 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where s e is the effective saturation θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively and α m and n are empirical parameters with m 1 1 n the relative permeability k r as a function of the degree of saturation s e is another constitutive relation of great importance in modeling the unsaturated flow through porous and fractured media this relation can generally be obtained by using the water content relation in the classic conceptual models of burdine 1953 and mualem 1976 a major concern in the development of the relative permeability function is the tortuosity of the flow paths which is often correlated to the fractal dimension of flow geometries e g guarracino 2006 or the fraction of active fractures e g liu et al 1998 to improve the prediction accuracy hu et al 2015 proposed a modified mualem relation for deformable soils by taking into account the change in pore size distribution and the tortuosity of flow paths given by 6 k r 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 β where β is a positive parameter related to the fractal dimension d of flow paths by β 2d 2 a verification of the relation with experimental data hu et al 2015 yields a global optimal estimate of β 0 5 or d 1 25 with high confidence for five types of soils of quite different structures including loess silty loam sandy loam and coarse sand this suggests that similar to other modified van genuchten or brooks corey permeability models e g peters and klavetter 1988 liu et al 1998 liu and bodvarsson 2001 guarracino 2006 eq 6 may apply to fractured rocks if the parameter β is properly determined the constitutive relations in eqs 5 and 6 contain five parameters i e m α β θ s and θ r for each rock unit among which the saturated and residual volumetric water contents θ s and θ r can be empirically estimated with the porosity ϕ or the volume fraction of connected fractures and pores and the void structure of rocks it has been understood that the seepage field in fractured media is generally less sensitive to the residual saturation θ r liu et al 2003 and in the most simplified case one may assume θ s ϕ and θ r 0 the other three parameters m α and β are to be representatively determined by inverse modeling which will be stated in the next section the values of θ s and θ r and the ranges of m α and β for 6 rock zones are listed in table 3 3 3 the inverse modeling procedure as previously stated the parameters k or k θ s and θ r in the unsaturated flow model can be reasonably measured or empirically estimated with engineering accuracy but difficulty arises when the other parameters m α and β are to be measured for fractured rocks this difficulty can be overcome with inverse modeling techniques by reproducing the dynamics of the seepage field and tuning the parameters to represent the site characteristics 3 3 1 objective function suppose r is the number of materials of contrasting unsaturated hydraulic properties in the domain ω a vector p is defined to denote the hydraulic parameters of the media yet to be determined with p m 1 α 1 β 1 m 2 α 2 β 2 mr αr βr t in this study r is chosen to be 6 representing the following six types of media loose sediments high moderate moderate permeability zones pzs moderate low low pzs very low pz faults and tuff shear zones as listed in table 3 it is noted here that some pzs and geologic structures are grouped to reduce the number of unknowns and hence the uncertainties and difficulties in the inverse modeling to estimate the parameters p an objective function is needed which ensures a best fit between the field measurements and the numerical results carrera et al 2005 chen et al 2016 given by 7 min f i 1 m ϕ i p ϕ i 2 2 ϕ i 2 2 1 2 w j 1 n q j p q j 2 2 q j 2 2 1 2 where m is the number of groundwater observation boreholes ϕ i and ϕ i are the time series measurements of groundwater level and the corresponding numerical results in borehole i respectively n is the number of weirs q j and q j are the time series measurements of discharge and the numerical results at weir j respectively w is a weight coefficient and 2 denote the euclidean norm of a vector eq 7 utilizes all available time series measurements of both groundwater level and discharge to improve the inverse solution that is inevitably plagued by the problem of non uniqueness in this study the available time series observations of groundwater level in 9 boreholes table 4 drilled in the near bank region of the slope fig 4 and the available discharge measurements in may 2011 at 3 weirs table 5 installed in the exploratory adits fig 4 were chosen for construction of the objective function note that except zk929 the other boreholes were located in the neighbouring profiles with their distances to cross section i i figs 3 and 4 being listed in table 4 with the increase of distance the data may be less representative of the selected profile which is the other weakness of this study as discussed in section 5 the weight coefficient w is introduced to ensure a balance between the relative errors of the groundwater level and discharge measurements and a value of w 0 1 was adopted in this study by trials table s3 in supplementary material 3 3 2 inverse modeling procedure to efficiently and reliably address the large scale inverse problem in complex hydrogeologic conditions this study adopted a combined procedure of orthogonal design od finite element fe analysis artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithm ga recently presented in zhou et al 2015 the algorithms are given in figs s4 s6 in supplementary material od is an effective statistics method to arrange multifactorial experiments gong et al 2008 in this inverse modeling procedure od was employed to construct a small set of representative values for the hydraulic parameters p from a pre defined parameter space in this study a total of 18 parameters i e r 6 were to be estimated with 7 levels specified for each parameter from the ranges empirically given in table 3 consequently an orthogonal table l49 718 was constructed which produces a set of 49 parameter combinations these parameter combinations were then used as input parameters for forward modeling of saturated unsaturated flow chen et al 2009 hu et al 2017 yielding the numerical time series data of groundwater level and discharge at the corresponding observation points and times for each parameter combination by doing so only a limited number of time consuming fe simulations were performed and hence the computational cost was greatly reduced as a multivariate non linear mapping and predictive tool that has been successfully applied in hydrology problems e g garcia and shigidi 2006 a back propagation neural network bpnn model was then constructed and trained fig s5 in supplementary material using the parameter combinations and the prescribed time dependent precipitation evaporation boundary conditions input data as well as the numerical results output data consequently an implicit mapping from the parameter space to the unsaturated seepage fields at the observation points was obtained zhou et al 2015 the bpnn model contains four layers with 19 neurons in the input layer 22 and 35 neurons in the two hidden layers and 13 neurons in the output layer as shown in fig 7 as usual the sigmoid function was selected as the transfer function of the bpnn model the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm combined with bayesian regularization rafiai et al 2013 was adopted for training of the model in order to obtain quick training time and high generalization accuracy finally as an appropriate optimization tool in hydrology problems e g karpouzos et al 2001 ga was used to obtain a globally optimal estimate of p such that the objective function eq 7 is minimized and a best fit between the field measurements and the numerical results calculated by the trained bpnn model is ensured this is achieved by randomly generating an initial population of hydraulic parameter combinations and then iteratively invoking the genetic operations of selection reproduction crossover and mutation fig s6 in supplementary material in this study the size of the initial population was set to 100 and the probabilities for crossover and mutation operations were specified to 0 9 and 0 1 respectively the ga was run at least 10 times and the best solution was selected as the optimal result 4 results 4 1 the results of inverse modeling table 3 lists the estimated unsaturated hydraulic parameters for rocks in different zones and the corresponding water retention curves are plotted in fig 8 the inverse modeling showed that the unsaturated flow behavior in the slope is most sensitive to the value of α which controls the minimum threshold pressure at which air starts to penetrate fractured rocks a larger α results in a higher infiltration rate into the slope and a stronger fluctuation of groundwater level during the precipitation evaporation cycles the estimated value of α for loose sediments several to tens of meters thick is 0 60 m 1 which is comparable to the findings of perkins et al 2014 who showed that α is dependent on depth varying from 0 63 m 1 to 65 2 m 1 for depth from 39 2 m to 84 3 m the representative values of α for fractured rocks in different pzs ranges from 0 010 m 1 to 0 034 m 1 with lower value for rocks in lower pz table 3 this result is comparable to the calibrated values α 0 001 1 63 m 1 for rock matrix continuum at yucca mountain bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 flint 2003 for faults and tuff shear zones the estimated values of α are 3 03 m 1 and 4 65 m 1 respectively again comparable to the calibrated results α 5 26 58 3 m 1 for fractures at yucca mountain bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 liu and bodvarsson 2001 where the α value was found to be highly sensitive to the average aperture of fractures the parameter m determines the slope of the water retention curve here it is found that increasing m tends to suppress the fluctuation of groundwater level the estimated values of m for fractured rocks are in a narrow range between 0 31 and 0 43 corresponding to n 1 45 1 75 comparable to the calibrated results m 0 14 0 43 for rock samples collected from various depths in different hydrogeologic units at yucca mountain flint 2003 the representative value of m is moderate for loose sediments m 0 44 and higher for faults and tuff shear zones m 0 63 0 69 the unsaturated flow process is less sensitive to the parameter β but a larger β may result in smaller infiltration rate and groundwater level fluctuation the estimated values of β for different rock zones are in a narrow range between 0 53 and 0 79 corresponding to d 1 27 1 40 slightly larger but rather close to the optimal estimate for soils of quite different structures hu et al 2015 this indicates that as a first approximation a value of β 0 5 similarly applies to fractured rocks 4 2 comparison of field measurements with the estimated parameters given in table 3 and fig 8 as well as the numerical setup given in section 3 1 simulations of groundwater flow in the slope were performed for 30 years of natural precipitation evaporation cycles and 10 years of site exploration fig 9 shows the fluctuations of the observed and calculated groundwater levels over tuff zone c3 fig 4 in nine boreholes listed in table 4 a comparison between the curves shows that the numerical simulation roughly reproduces the groundwater level observations fig 9a and fig 9b except at boreholes zk37 and zk112 fig 9c and fig 9d located over 300 m away from the cross section table 4 this difference is attributed to local terrain changes fig 1 if the groundwater level is transformed to groundwater depth i e with the topography changes compensated then the difference becomes smaller the predicted groundwater level at zk1123 fig 9a is consistent with the rainfall time series but seems to have an opposite trend with the measurements the groundwater level over tuff zone c3 either remained rather stable fig 9a or exhibited seasonal fluctuations fig 9b d as influenced by the rainfall infiltration through faults e g f17 and f129 fig 4 even for the latter the numerical result well captures the trend of groundwater level variation simulated water pressure head distributions in long term stable state in wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 10 it is interesting to observe that the presence of tuff zones c3 and c3 1 of low vertical permeability caused the distribution of groundwater in multiple layers this phenomenon was well reproduced in the numerical model the development of faults e g f17 and f129 facilitated the infiltration of rainfall into the slope and resulted in the rise of groundwater level over the tuff zones in wet seasons the infiltrated groundwater discharged to the river either by subhorizontal movement along the tuff zones for their high in plane permeability or by vertical infiltration across the tuff zones the numerical simulation shows that for the groundwater across the ceiling of c3 about 46 of the water flowed along the tuff layer and 54 further infiltrated downward to recharge the layers below similarly for c3 1 65 of the groundwater flowed along it and the rest 35 infiltrated vertically through see inset in fig 4 consequently the water table below the tuff zones remained rather stable except the near bank region influenced by river water level fluctuations table 2 lists the vertical distance between the groundwater levels above and below the tuff zone c3 or c3 1 in four typical boreholes in the wet season showing that the numerical result is comparable to the field observations the weathering of tuff zones c3 and c3 1 makes their permeability isotropic k k in subzone b table 1 and fig 6b which facilitated the subvertical discharge of groundwater in the shallow region of the slope causing the tuff zones to mostly remain unsaturated and hence the unsaturated zone to be wedge shaped as shown in fig 11 the water head contours on may 15 2011 two years after the exploratory adit pd61 and its five branches pd61 1 pd61 5 were excavated table 5 indicated a marked alteration of the seepage field compare fig 10 and fig 11 the evolution of the calculated discharges out of pd61 and its three branches pd61 3 pd61 5 is shown in fig 12 where the discharges are compared with the available measurements on may 15 2011 table 5 the excavation of the adits led to increased vertical discharge of groundwater across the tuff zones and hence significant drawdown of water table the discharges fluctuated significantly during the excavation of the adits but overall tended to decrease to some stable magnitudes fig 12 in may 2011 the simulated discharge from the adit system was about 114 l min which is in excellent agreement with the field measurements table 5 at that time field observation showed that the 340 m near face section of adit pd61 and the branches pd61 1 and pd61 2 were in the unsaturated zone while the surrounding rocks of the rest section of pd61 and the branches pd61 3 pd61 5 remained saturated the numerical result see fig 11 well reproduces this observation 5 discussion this study has demonstrated the feasibility of modeling saturated unsaturated flow in fractured rock formations with the continuum approach this relies on proper estimation of the unsaturated hydraulic parameters of rocks in the van genuchten model and the modified mualem relation the estimates were obtained by inverse modeling of saturated unsaturated flow using the measurements of groundwater levels and discharges collected in the saturated zone a major concern is whether the saturated flow is sensitive enough to the hydraulic parameters in the unsaturated zone an additional sensitivity analysis table s4 in supplementary material confirms the sensitivities of α m and β in the unsaturated zone to the input data obtained from the saturated zone the parameter α is most sensitively influenced followed by m and β respectively in sensitivity which is consistent with the findings of gribb 1996 and liu et al 2003 besides the parameters are more sensitive in the rock zones where the water tables are located this partially justifies the inverse modeling strategy adopted in this study it should be noted however that the proposed approach contains quite a number of simplifications and assumptions first the flow was modeled with a continuum model where the details of the fracture system the flow in individual fractures and the fracture matrix interaction were not explicitly accounted for however given the difficulty in obtaining and thus the lack of sufficient fracture network information from site characterization the continuum model is arguably acceptable for this large scale problem this is partially justified by the capability of the continuum model in capturing the changes in groundwater level induced by changes in rainfall intensity during a typical period table s5 and fig s7 in supplementary material in fact the equivalent continuum approach has been successfully applied in a large number of studies e g peters and klavetter 1988 doughty 1999 wu et al 1999 finsterle 2000 liu et al 2003 second only the unsaturated hydraulic parameters were estimated by inverse modeling where the hydraulic conductivities of rocks were directly determined from the field hydraulic tests we made this choice because saturated hydraulic conductivities estimated from hydraulic tests have been shown to be representative of field scale flow properties of the rock gribb et al 1998 zhou et al 2015 hong et al 2017 it should be pointed out that the heterogeneity and scale effect of the parameters within each rock zone were not considered since the field test data do not support a more detailed delineation of the heterogeneity at the site it was technically infeasible to account for heterogeneity within each zone in the simulations eaton and mccord 1995 third the flow was assumed to be two dimensional in the slope where the flow component perpendicular to the cross section albeit slow was neglected due to insufficient data in the selected profile the use of measurements from the neighboring profiles further gave rise to uncertainties in the 2d modeling the 2d assumption is justifiable given the fact that the groundwater at the site the left bank primarily flows along the direction perpendicular to the river i e along the trace of section i i in fig 1 in addition the chosen cross section i i in fig 1 roughly represents the geological conditions including the topography lithology and geological structures at the site therefore the 2d model could be considered representative of the site characteristics the simplification of the model from 3d to 2d is common in seepage analysis due to the constraint of computational resource in inverse calculation of 3d model yan and jiao 2018 guo et al 2015 a 3d model will undoubtedly provide a more realistic and effective evaluation which is a focus of our future work finally the use of ann in the inverse modeling procedure significantly reduced the computational cost rafiai et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 hong et al 2017 as a surrogate model ann has become very popular and efficient in engineering problems zhang et al 2017 it is difficult to estimate the unsaturated parameters in large scale groundwater flow problems without using surrogate models asher et al 2015 salem and tomaso 2018 one should however be cautious when using surrogate models in inverse analysis because the reduced computational time possibly comes at the cost of oversmoothing the relation between the input and output data depending on the choice and size of the training samples in this study we used a combination of orthogonal design and forward modeling to create proper training samples for the ann model it is nevertheless acknowledged that further improvement is possible in the surrogate modeling despite of these limitations the proposed approach effectively reproduced the multiple water tables and wedge shaped unsaturated zones in a large scale rock slope the change of groundwater levels was predicted within a relatively small error by making full use of site characterization data the inversed unsaturated hydraulic parameters are comparable to existing results for rocks fractures and soils bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 flint 2003 hu et al 2015 without introducing sophisticated flow models and constitutive relations the numerical results are of engineering accuracy and useful for e g the design and performance assessment of impervious barriers li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 6 conclusions this study investigated the groundwater flow behavior in a large scale rock slope by means of inverse modeling using the continuum approach based on field observations spanning ten years at the baihetan dam site southwest china the inverse modeling showed that the unsaturated hydraulic parameters are in the range of α 0 01 4 65 m 1 m 0 31 0 69 n 1 45 3 23 and β 0 53 0 79 for fractured rocks loose sediments and geologic structures at the site comparable to existing results for rocks and fractures at yucca mountain bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 flint 2003 and or soils of different types hu et al 2015 the multiple water levels above and below the tuff zones and the drawdown of water table in the slope during site exploration were reasonably reproduced and the estimated parameters are overall representative of the unsaturated hydraulic properties of rock formations at the site it has been challenging to obtain the field scale unsaturated hydraulic parameters in fractured rocks here it is demonstrated that without using the difficult to acquire flow and saturation data in the unsaturated zone the unsaturated hydraulic parameters can be effectively obtained through the groundwater level and discharge data in the saturated zone it is concluded that the inverse modeling procedure adopted is efficient and effective in seeking an optimal solution in a complex large scale inverse problem furthermore this study boosts our confidence in the continuum approach for approximating the site scale saturated unsaturated flow

5675,modeling saturated unsaturated flow in fractured rock formations remains a challenging issue due to the difficulties in properly calibrating the unsaturated flow properties for fractured rocks on the basis of the continuum approach this study uses inverse modeling to determine the unsaturated hydraulic parameters of fractured rocks loose sediments and geologic structures in a large scale slope under difficult hydrogeologic conditions at the baihetan dam site southwest china the saturated hydraulic conductivities were determined a priori by packer tests field data including time series of groundwater level observations and available discharge measurements is used a combined procedure of orthogonal design finite element forward analysis artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is adopted for the inverse analysis with high computational efficiency the numerical results well reproduce the typical features of multiple water tables and wedge shaped unsaturated zones controlled by gently sloping tuff zones of low vertical permeability showing 46 65 of groundwater flowing subhorizontally along each tuff zone and the remaining 35 54 infiltrating vertically and recharging deeper layers the drastic drawdown of groundwater level after 10 year site characterization is also reproduced the calculated discharge and water tables agree reasonably well with field observations

applications such as nuclear waste disposal contaminant transport oil and gas extraction underground oil storage and landslide mitigation li et al 2017 liu et al 1998 rulon et al 1985 accurately characterizing this flow process is extremely difficult and has been one of the most challenging issues in subsurface hydrology mainly because of the multi scale geometries and complex interactions of the fracture matrix system the technical difficulties in measuring fracture flow in the field and the multi dimensional and heterogeneous flow behaviors evans and rasmussen 1991 liu et al 1998 in particular the groundwater typically moves preferentially through fractures and faults of large scales peters and klavetter 1988 illman and hughson 2005 besides multiple water tables and wedge shaped unsaturated zones may develop if the stratigraphy consists of subhorizontal layers of contrasting permeabilities rulon et al 1985 various modeling approaches have been proposed to describe the multi scale multi dimensional flow behaviors through the fracture matrix system including the equivalent continuum peters and klavetter 1988 finsterle 2000 liu et al 2003 lu and kwicklis 2012 dual continuum illman and hughson 2005 mathias et al 2006 triple continuum wu et al 2004 discrete fracture network evans and rasmussen 1991 percolation network kueper and mcwhorter 1992 and stochastic representation approaches illman and hughson 2005 lu and kwicklis 2012 the equivalent continuum model treats the fractured rock as a porous medium with an equivalent permeability obtained through homogenization of the flow process this approach has been widely used for its simplicity and high computational efficiency bathe and khoshgoftaar 1979 chen et al 2008 2016 desai and li 1983 li et al 2017 zheng et al 2005 the discrete fracture network model can explicitly simulate flow in all fractures in a rock mass evans and rasmussen 1991 however due to the large number of fractures involved it is often computationally prohibitive to adopt this approach in site scale applications the dual medium model simultaneously considers fast flow in the fractures and slow flow in the porous matrix barenblatt et al 1960 warren and root 1963 zimmerman et al 1993 illman and hughson 2005 mathias et al 2006 but its application still has great limitations due to the uncertainty of the spatial distribution of the fracture system the tripe continuum model introduces an additional continuum based on the dual continuum model that requires one more parameter set for small fractures wu et al 2004 which makes it even more difficult to use than the dual continuum model the stochastic approach assumes that the local hydraulic properties are realizations of spatially correlated random fields and derives the partial differential equations representing the large scale flow conditions through averaging the local governing equations over the ensemble of realizations mantoglou and gelhar 1987c 1987a 1987b yeh et al 1985a 1985b 1985c among these approaches the continuum model has dominated as the most commonly used one for its efficiency in addressing large scale problems because the presence of numerous fractures of different scales causes extreme difficulty in fracture network construction and flow modeling the performance of a continuum model however largely depends on whether the unsaturated hydraulic properties i e water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of fractured rocks are properly determined and representative of the site conditions field measurements of permeability and porosity for unsaturated fractured rocks prove to be feasible by single hole e g illman and neuman 2000 or cross hole illman and neuman 2001 2003 pneumatic injection tests without modifying the saturation as done by water infiltration tests this is not the case however for direct measurement of unsaturated hydraulic properties representative of field scale behavior due to the complexity and variability of fracture geometries national research council 1996 hughson and yeh 2000 zhang and fredlund 2003 wu et al 2006 even though these measurements could be performed for core scale samples of individual fracture wang and narasimhan 1985 pruess and tsang 1990 reitsma and kueper 1994 persoff and pruess 1995 bertels et al 2001 chen and horne 2006 weerakone et al 2012 li et al 2014 and rock matrix montazer and wilson 1984 peters and klavetter 1988 faybishenko and finsterle 2000 flint 2003 therefore the classic water retention curves brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 and relative permeability models burdine 1953 mualem 1976 developed for unsaturated soils and porous media are often borrowed for describing the unsaturated flow in fractured rocks the development or extension of the water retention relations for unsaturated fractured rocks is based on the dual or triple porosity concept peters and klavetter 1988 zhang and fredlund 2003 wu et al 2004 active fracture concept liu et al 1998 fractal fracture geometry guarracino 2006 and two dimensional fracture network simulation and upscaling technique liu and bodvarsson 2001 2003 lu and kwicklis 2012 inverse modeling provides a powerful tool for estimation of hydraulic parameters in water retention models from laboratory experiments field groundwater observations and hydraulic tests

problems of ill posedness computational burden and scales zhou et al 2014 hughson and yeh 2000 the objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling saturated unsaturated flow in a large scale rock slope of 5 km long located at the baihetan dam site southwest china based on the continuum approach and inverse modeling this slope is characteristic of difficult hydrogeologic conditions with multiple water levels in natural state due to the presence of gently sloping low vertical permeability tuff zones and drastic depletion of water table after ten years of site characterization due to the excavation of exploratory adits and drilling of boreholes the unsaturated hydraulic parameters in the water retention relation and relative permeability model are estimated by inverse modeling with the saturated hydraulic conductivities of rocks determined a priori by packer tests the objective function is constructed by using the time series observations of groundwater level and the available measurements of discharge in order to achieve high computational efficiency the combined procedure of orthogonal design od finite element fe analysis artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithm ga presented by zhou et al 2015 is adopted to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic parameters of rocks at the site the numerical results are compared with field observations to deepen our understanding of the saturated unsaturated flow in the rock slope subjected to precipitation evaporation cycles and exploratory adits excavation 2 site characterization 2 1 general description the study site jiang et al 2014 is situated on the left bank of the lower jinsha river in southwest china where the world s second largest hydropower project i e baihetan project consisting of a double curvature arch dam of 289 m high and two large scale underground cavern systems is under construction fig 1 the jinsha river runs through the dam site from south to north with a water level of about 591 m a s l in dry seasons forming a v shaped valley by fast downcutting the study area is characteristic of a mountainous landscape with steep gradients of 50 80 below the valley shoulder and gentler gradients towards the watershed between the jinsha river and its tributary on the west side the yibu river fig 1 the site lies in the subtropical monsoon climate zone where over 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season between may and october precipitation increases with elevation with the measured mean annual rainfalls being 727 2 mm at 635 m a s l near the dam site and 811 0 mm at 1 357 m respectively the mean monthly rainfall and evaporation at the study site are shown in fig 2 the average annual temperature is between 15 and 21 surface runoff is infrequent and of short duration with only two small perennial streams nos 1 and 3 in fig 1 in the study area 2 2 geological settings as shown in fig 3 the bedrocks outcropping in the study area are basaltic formations originated from multiple magmatic and volcanic eruption episodes the formations belong to the emei mountain group of the upper permian system p 2 β which can be categorized into 4 basalt flow layers p 2 β 1 p 2 β 4 of 445 470 290 340 210 260 and 85 115 m thick respectively according to the eruption sequences the rock layers mainly contain tholeiitic basalt cryptocrystalline basalt microcrystalline basalt and amygdaloidal basalt typically with a layer of tuff developed on the top of each rock unit wang et al 2009 the tuff layers are 0 1 1 75 m thick and have regional continuity the tuff is nonwelded and is composed of vitric fragments and glass shards 40 50 volcanic ash 30 40 basalt clasts 5 10 and plagioclase clasts 5 wang et al 2009 each tuff layer contains a shear zone hereafter referred to as tuff zone of 5 40 cm thick the formations dip gently towards the right bank with an orientation of n30 50 e se 15 25 the basalt rocks are overlain by loose sediments q3 and q4 of several to tens of meters thick on gentle hillslopes and underlain by thick carbonate rocks p1 deposited during the early permian period fig 3a the main structures in the study area consist of subvertical faults e g f17 f129 f133 and f134 and gently sloping tuff zones e g c2 c3 1 and c3 and shear zones e g ls331 ls3318 and ls3319 as shown in fig 3b among them f17 is a large scale fault of 0 5 3 m thick extending over 1400 m and mainly composed of well cemented tectonic breccia and cataclasite of moderate permeability other faults e g f129 f133 and f134 are of smaller sizes about 0 1 1 m thick and extending up to hundreds of meters and bounded by the tuff zones these faults are also significant to groundwater infiltration as they outcrop and dip subvertically the tuff zones are developed in the tuff layers in which fault gouge layers of 1 5 cm thick are developed as a result of tectonic shear between basalt layers fig s1 in supplementary material which makes the permeability of the tuff zones highly anisotropic with a potential permeability contrast of 2 orders of magnitude between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the tuff layer except ls331 the shear zones within each basaltic formation are mostly of small scale and mainly composed of basalt fragments besides the geologic structures mentioned above four groups of critically oriented fractures are developed in the basalt rocks with their geometrical properties shown in fig 3b and table s1 in supplementary material 2 3 permeability of rocks a total of 4413 conventional packer tests at 173 boreholes and 669 high pressure packer tests chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 at 26 boreholes together with a large number of pumping tests recovery tests slug tests and in situ seepage tests were performed at the site to investigate the permeability of the fractured basalt rocks structures i e faults tuff zones and shear zones and loose sediments the boreholes were drilled vertically from the ground surface or from the floors of exploratory adits horizontally excavated at different elevations into the slope fig 3b and fig 4 the diameter of the boreholes was 76 mm and the length of the test sections varied between 3 7 and 6 4 m chen et al 2018 the packer test data were interpreted with the hvorslev 1951 equation the test results indicate that the permeability of the fractured basalt rocks generally decreases with increasing depth fig s2 in supplementary material and can be more correlated to the degree of weathering the density of tensional joints and the level of in situ stress rather than the lithology downward from the ground surface the hydraulic conductivity k can be classified into six categories or permeability zones pzs fig 3b high k 10 5 high moderate 10 5 k 3 10 6 moderate 3 10 6 k 10 6 moderate low 10 6 k 3 10 7 low 3 10 7 k 10 7 and very low k 10 7 all in units of m s the main structures are mostly of moderate low to moderate permeability but the permeability of the unweathered tuff zones and shear zones is highly anisotropic table 1 lists the statistics of the hydraulic conductivity of the rocks and sediments at the site 2 4 groundwater observations groundwater in the study area is principally recharged by precipitation and discharged to streams and the jinsha river the groundwater flow and water table configuration in the basaltic formations are primarily controlled by the fracture system and the backbone structures consisting of subvertical faults and gently sloping tuff zones and shear zones as shown in fig 4 due to the very low vertical permeability of the tuff zones and shear zones table 1 multiple water tables develop in the slope fig 4 a phenomenon that has been frequently observed and well understood in layered hillsides e g rulon et al 1985 observations of groundwater in the slope started from 2001 through boreholes and exploratory adits and lasted for over ten years the exploratory adits were excavated horizontally into the slope from which a few branches parallel to the river were also excavated fig 4 the boreholes were drilled downward from the ground surface or from the floors of the adits the mean groundwater levels in wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 4 the groundwater level in the slope although influenced locally by fractures generally increased with ground surface elevation the groundwater level varied in a larger range typically 10 20 m between wet and dry seasons in boreholes near the river bank consistent with the change in river water level than far away from the river bank the presence of tuff zones and shear zones significantly influences the distribution and movement of groundwater in the slope when an exploratory adit was excavated across the tuff zones or shear zones a significant amount of discharge was generally observed from the upper block of the tuff shear zones indicating that these structures are of low vertical permeability and hinder the vertical infiltration the discharge into each adit decayed due to the advance of neighboring adits but the total discharge into the whole adit system maintained a stable magnitude and was less influenced by precipitation events for example the total discharge during site characterization from the exploratory adit pd61 and its five branches pd61 1 pd61 5 which cut through a series of faults and tuff shear zones e g f17 and c3 had rather stable measurements around 110 l min by weirs furthermore when the tuff zones c3 1 and c3 were penetrated by the boreholes a sharp drawdown of groundwater level generally occurred multiple groundwater levels were observed after the boreholes were isolated with concrete plugs at the intersection with the tuff zones table 2 lists the vertical distance between the groundwater levels observed above and below the tuff zones in four typical boreholes fig 5 for example in borehole zk1119 a vertical distance of 24 4 m between the upper and lower groundwater levels was observed similarly in borehole zk412 a vertical distance of around 23 0 m between the groundwater levels was observed during the wet season it should be noted however that as commonly done in dam engineering the unsaturated zone was not monitored even though techniques e g tensiometers and neutron probes are available for the measurements of flow quantities such as pressure head and water content e g ireson et al 2006 this is a major limitation of this study but motivates us to examine if the unsaturated zone parameters could be reasonably estimated with the observations in the saturated zone 3 inverse modeling approach 3 1 saturated unsaturated flow model in the framework of continuum approach peters and klavetter 1988 where the fractured rocks are treated as equivalent continua the saturated unsaturated water flow is governed by the following mass balance equation e g mao et al 2011 also known as the richards 1931 equation 1 c w ω s s h t v 0 where h is the pressure head c w θ h is the specific moisture capacity θ is the volumetric water content s s is the specific storage ω is a step function of h ω 0 for h 0 in unsaturated zone and ω 1 for h 0 in saturated zone t is time and v is the flow velocity described by darcy s law 2 v k r k h z where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor k r is the relative permeability depending on h or θ z is the positive upward vertical coordinate and h z is the hydraulic head the water mass balance equation eq 1 is subjected to the following initial condition in the domain ω of interest 3 h t 0 h 0 in ω where h 0 is the initial distribution of pressure head in ω and the following boundary conditions 1 the water head boundary condition dirichlet boundary condition 4a h t h t on γ h where h is the prescribed pressure head on the water head boundary γ h 2 the flux boundary condition neumann boundary condition 4b q n t v t n q n t on γ q where q n is the prescribed flux positive for inflow on the flux boundary γ q and n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary 3 the unified lateral conditions on the third type boundaries including the seepage faces rain infiltration surfaces and evaporation surfaces borsi et al 2006 hu et al 2017 4c δ h h 0 δ q n q n 0 h h q n q n 0 on γ s γ i γ e where γ s γ i and γ e denote the seepage face boundary rain infiltration surface and the evaporation surface respectively δ is a sign indicator with δ 1 on γ s and γ i and δ 1 on γ e h and q n are the maximum allowable values of pressure head and flux respectively with h 0 and q n 0 on γ s h h p and q n i t on γ i and h h d and q n r e on γ e h p is the ponding depth of water on the infiltration boundary γ i and i t is the rainfall intensity h d is the minimum pressure head determined by temperature and air relative humidity on the evaporation boundary γ e and r e is a negative flux rate representing the maximum evaporation rate in the field eq 4c states that on the third type boundaries γ s γ i and γ e the boundary condition is either a prescribed pressure h h when the flux is no more than the allowable flux rate δq n δq n or a prescribed flux rate q n q n when the pressure is no more than the allowable pressure δh δh the presence of the lateral boundary conditions in eq 4c introduces strong nonlinearity of the partial differential equation pde in eq 1 for saturated unsaturated flow problems which can be rigorously and effectively solved with a numerical procedure based on the parabolic variational inequality pvi method hu et al 2017 the discretized pvi algorithm was detailed in hu et al 2017 and was implemented in the fe code thyme chen et al 2009 as clarified by site characterization fig 3 and fig 4 the groundwater at the site primarily flows along the direction perpendicular to the river i e along the trace of cross section i i in fig 1 and the flow along the river direction is rather slow a 2d fe mesh along section i i was therefore created for saturated unsaturated flow modeling which contains 24 782 four node isoparametric elements and 25 197 nodes as plotted in fig 6 the size of the model domain is 5000 m long and 2190 m high the topographic and geologic settings such as the strata faults tuff shear zones and pzs at cross section i i fig 1 were well represented it should be noted that the exploratory adits parallel to the profile e g pd 61 fig 4 could not be accurately represented in the 2d mesh and were modelled with equivalent spacing per unit length fig 6b and fig s3 in supplementary material the boundary conditions were specified as follows 1 the lateral boundaries on the mountain side and on the river side were both assumed to be groundwater divides and thus were prescribed with a no flow boundary 2 the riverbed surface was imposed with a water head boundary according to the fluctuation of the river water level 3 the surfaces of the exploratory adits were taken as a seepage face boundary 4 the slope surface was prescribed with a precipitation evaporation boundary with h p 0 m and h d 200 m corresponding to a saturation of 16 18 for loose sediments and tuff zones according to the site condition precipitation was assumed to occur in the middle ten days of a month and the mean monthly precipitation and evaporation rates were taken from fig 2 5 the base of the model was assumed to be impermeable the initial distribution of pressure head in the saturated zone of the slope h 0 0 was determined by estimating a water table that best fits the average groundwater level observations in boreholes with a steady state flow model in the unsaturated zone h 0 0 h 0 was roughly estimated by assuming a vertically linear reduction of saturation to 60 at the ground surface to eliminate the influence of h 0 distribution on groundwater flow a natural precipitation evaporation process was first simulated until the groundwater flow in each season became stable this process typically lasted for 360 months from may 1971 to may 2001 the site exploration process was then modelled see table 5 for the excavation process of the exploratory adit system lasting for 120 months from may 2001 to may 2011 the initial time step and maximum time step in each simulation were taken as 7 h and 7 days respectively 3 2 constitutive relations and hydraulic parameters the hydraulic properties that need to be determined for numerical modeling of water movement in saturated unsaturated fractured rocks include the saturated hydraulic conductivity k the specific storage s s the water content θ and the relative permeability k r the hydraulic conductivity tensor k or its isotropic counterpart k of fractured rocks at the field scale can be reasonably determined without technical difficulty by performing a sufficient number of field hydraulic tests e g hsieh and neuman 1985 owing to the experiences that have been long accumulated the determined hydraulic conductivity is generally of high confidence and representative of the field conditions table 1 the specific storage of rocks is estimated by s s ρ w g α r ϕα w where α r is the compressibility of rock α w is the compressibility of water ϕ is the porosity and ρ w is the density of water table 1 and table s2 in supplementary material the water content relation also called the water retention curve is defined as the relationship between the volumetric water content θ or the degree of saturation s e and suction s i e the negative pressure head s h quite a number of water retention curves have been developed for unsaturated soils and porous media brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 and extended to incorporate the effects of hydraulic hysteresis and soil deformation e g assouline et al 1998 nuth and laloui 2008 tarantino 2009 gallipoli 2012 zhou et al 2012 hu et al 2013 these models are often borrowed for unsaturated fractured rocks due to the technical difficulties in the field scale measurements of water content relation in rocks of much higher heterogeneity numerical simulations and validations peters and klavetter 1988 liu et al 1998 2003 liu and bodvarsson 2001 2003 wu et al 2004 have shown that the classic van genuchten 1980 model with a proper parameterization representative of field conditions is suitable for representing the water content relation in unsaturated fractured rocks which reads 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where s e is the effective saturation θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively and α m and n are empirical parameters with m 1 1 n the relative permeability k r as a function of the degree of saturation s e is another constitutive relation of great importance in modeling the unsaturated flow through porous and fractured media this relation can generally be obtained by using the water content relation in the classic conceptual models of burdine 1953 and mualem 1976 a major concern in the development of the relative permeability function is the tortuosity of the flow paths which is often correlated to the fractal dimension of flow geometries e g guarracino 2006 or the fraction of active fractures e g liu et al 1998 to improve the prediction accuracy hu et al 2015 proposed a modified mualem relation for deformable soils by taking into account the change in pore size distribution and the tortuosity of flow paths given by 6 k r 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 β where β is a positive parameter related to the fractal dimension d of flow paths by β 2d 2 a verification of the relation with experimental data hu et al 2015 yields a global optimal estimate of β 0 5 or d 1 25 with high confidence for five types of soils of quite different structures including loess silty loam sandy loam and coarse sand this suggests that similar to other modified van genuchten or brooks corey permeability models e g peters and klavetter 1988 liu et al 1998 liu and bodvarsson 2001 guarracino 2006 eq 6 may apply to fractured rocks if the parameter β is properly determined the constitutive relations in eqs 5 and 6 contain five parameters i e m α β θ s and θ r for each rock unit among which the saturated and residual volumetric water contents θ s and θ r can be empirically estimated with the porosity ϕ or the volume fraction of connected fractures and pores and the void structure of rocks it has been understood that the seepage field in fractured media is generally less sensitive to the residual saturation θ r liu et al 2003 and in the most simplified case one may assume θ s ϕ and θ r 0 the other three parameters m α and β are to be representatively determined by inverse modeling which will be stated in the next section the values of θ s and θ r and the ranges of m α and β for 6 rock zones are listed in table 3 3 3 the inverse modeling procedure as previously stated the parameters k or k θ s and θ r in the unsaturated flow model can be reasonably measured or empirically estimated with engineering accuracy but difficulty arises when the other parameters m α and β are to be measured for fractured rocks this difficulty can be overcome with inverse modeling techniques by reproducing the dynamics of the seepage field and tuning the parameters to represent the site characteristics 3 3 1 objective function suppose r is the number of materials of contrasting unsaturated hydraulic properties in the domain ω a vector p is defined to denote the hydraulic parameters of the media yet to be determined with p m 1 α 1 β 1 m 2 α 2 β 2 mr αr βr t in this study r is chosen to be 6 representing the following six types of media loose sediments high moderate moderate permeability zones pzs moderate low low pzs very low pz faults and tuff shear zones as listed in table 3 it is noted here that some pzs and geologic structures are grouped to reduce the number of unknowns and hence the uncertainties and difficulties in the inverse modeling to estimate the parameters p an objective function is needed which ensures a best fit between the field measurements and the numerical results carrera et al 2005 chen et al 2016 given by 7 min f i 1 m ϕ i p ϕ i 2 2 ϕ i 2 2 1 2 w j 1 n q j p q j 2 2 q j 2 2 1 2 where m is the number of groundwater observation boreholes ϕ i and ϕ i are the time series measurements of groundwater level and the corresponding numerical results in borehole i respectively n is the number of weirs q j and q j are the time series measurements of discharge and the numerical results at weir j respectively w is a weight coefficient and 2 denote the euclidean norm of a vector eq 7 utilizes all available time series measurements of both groundwater level and discharge to improve the inverse solution that is inevitably plagued by the problem of non uniqueness in this study the available time series observations of groundwater level in 9 boreholes table 4 drilled in the near bank region of the slope fig 4 and the available discharge measurements in may 2011 at 3 weirs table 5 installed in the exploratory adits fig 4 were chosen for construction of the objective function note that except zk929 the other boreholes were located in the neighbouring profiles with their distances to cross section i i figs 3 and 4 being listed in table 4 with the increase of distance the data may be less representative of the selected profile which is the other weakness of this study as discussed in section 5 the weight coefficient w is introduced to ensure a balance between the relative errors of the groundwater level and discharge measurements and a value of w 0 1 was adopted in this study by trials table s3 in supplementary material 3 3 2 inverse modeling procedure to efficiently and reliably address the large scale inverse problem in complex hydrogeologic conditions this study adopted a combined procedure of orthogonal design od finite element fe analysis artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithm ga recently presented in zhou et al 2015 the algorithms are given in figs s4 s6 in supplementary material od is an effective statistics method to arrange multifactorial experiments gong et al 2008 in this inverse modeling procedure od was employed to construct a small set of representative values for the hydraulic parameters p from a pre defined parameter space in this study a total of 18 parameters i e r 6 were to be estimated with 7 levels specified for each parameter from the ranges empirically given in table 3 consequently an orthogonal table l49 718 was constructed which produces a set of 49 parameter combinations these parameter combinations were then used as input parameters for forward modeling of saturated unsaturated flow chen et al 2009 hu et al 2017 yielding the numerical time series data of groundwater level and discharge at the corresponding observation points and times for each parameter combination by doing so only a limited number of time consuming fe simulations were performed and hence the computational cost was greatly reduced as a multivariate non linear mapping and predictive tool that has been successfully applied in hydrology problems e g garcia and shigidi 2006 a back propagation neural network bpnn model was then constructed and trained fig s5 in supplementary material using the parameter combinations and the prescribed time dependent precipitation evaporation boundary conditions input data as well as the numerical results output data consequently an implicit mapping from the parameter space to the unsaturated seepage fields at the observation points was obtained zhou et al 2015 the bpnn model contains four layers with 19 neurons in the input layer 22 and 35 neurons in the two hidden layers and 13 neurons in the output layer as shown in fig 7 as usual the sigmoid function was selected as the transfer function of the bpnn model the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm combined with bayesian regularization rafiai et al 2013 was adopted for training of the model in order to obtain quick training time and high generalization accuracy finally as an appropriate optimization tool in hydrology problems e g karpouzos et al 2001 ga was used to obtain a globally optimal estimate of p such that the objective function eq 7 is minimized and a best fit between the field measurements and the numerical results calculated by the trained bpnn model is ensured this is achieved by randomly generating an initial population of hydraulic parameter combinations and then iteratively invoking the genetic operations of selection reproduction crossover and mutation fig s6 in supplementary material in this study the size of the initial population was set to 100 and the probabilities for crossover and mutation operations were specified to 0 9 and 0 1 respectively the ga was run at least 10 times and the best solution was selected as the optimal result 4 results 4 1 the results of inverse modeling table 3 lists the estimated unsaturated hydraulic parameters for rocks in different zones and the corresponding water retention curves are plotted in fig 8 the inverse modeling showed that the unsaturated flow behavior in the slope is most sensitive to the value of α which controls the minimum threshold pressure at which air starts to penetrate fractured rocks a larger α results in a higher infiltration rate into the slope and a stronger fluctuation of groundwater level during the precipitation evaporation cycles the estimated value of α for loose sediments several to tens of meters thick is 0 60 m 1 which is comparable to the findings of perkins et al 2014 who showed that α is dependent on depth varying from 0 63 m 1 to 65 2 m 1 for depth from 39 2 m to 84 3 m the representative values of α for fractured rocks in different pzs ranges from 0 010 m 1 to 0 034 m 1 with lower value for rocks in lower pz table 3 this result is comparable to the calibrated values α 0 001 1 63 m 1 for rock matrix continuum at yucca mountain bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 flint 2003 for faults and tuff shear zones the estimated values of α are 3 03 m 1 and 4 65 m 1 respectively again comparable to the calibrated results α 5 26 58 3 m 1 for fractures at yucca mountain bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 liu and bodvarsson 2001 where the α value was found to be highly sensitive to the average aperture of fractures the parameter m determines the slope of the water retention curve here it is found that increasing m tends to suppress the fluctuation of groundwater level the estimated values of m for fractured rocks are in a narrow range between 0 31 and 0 43 corresponding to n 1 45 1 75 comparable to the calibrated results m 0 14 0 43 for rock samples collected from various depths in different hydrogeologic units at yucca mountain flint 2003 the representative value of m is moderate for loose sediments m 0 44 and higher for faults and tuff shear zones m 0 63 0 69 the unsaturated flow process is less sensitive to the parameter β but a larger β may result in smaller infiltration rate and groundwater level fluctuation the estimated values of β for different rock zones are in a narrow range between 0 53 and 0 79 corresponding to d 1 27 1 40 slightly larger but rather close to the optimal estimate for soils of quite different structures hu et al 2015 this indicates that as a first approximation a value of β 0 5 similarly applies to fractured rocks 4 2 comparison of field measurements with the estimated parameters given in table 3 and fig 8 as well as the numerical setup given in section 3 1 simulations of groundwater flow in the slope were performed for 30 years of natural precipitation evaporation cycles and 10 years of site exploration fig 9 shows the fluctuations of the observed and calculated groundwater levels over tuff zone c3 fig 4 in nine boreholes listed in table 4 a comparison between the curves shows that the numerical simulation roughly reproduces the groundwater level observations fig 9a and fig 9b except at boreholes zk37 and zk112 fig 9c and fig 9d located over 300 m away from the cross section table 4 this difference is attributed to local terrain changes fig 1 if the groundwater level is transformed to groundwater depth i e with the topography changes compensated then the difference becomes smaller the predicted groundwater level at zk1123 fig 9a is consistent with the rainfall time series but seems to have an opposite trend with the measurements the groundwater level over tuff zone c3 either remained rather stable fig 9a or exhibited seasonal fluctuations fig 9b d as influenced by the rainfall infiltration through faults e g f17 and f129 fig 4 even for the latter the numerical result well captures the trend of groundwater level variation simulated water pressure head distributions in long term stable state in wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 10 it is interesting to observe that the presence of tuff zones c3 and c3 1 of low vertical permeability caused the distribution of groundwater in multiple layers this phenomenon was well reproduced in the numerical model the development of faults e g f17 and f129 facilitated the infiltration of rainfall into the slope and resulted in the rise of groundwater level over the tuff zones in wet seasons the infiltrated groundwater discharged to the river either by subhorizontal movement along the tuff zones for their high in plane permeability or by vertical infiltration across the tuff zones the numerical simulation shows that for the groundwater across the ceiling of c3 about 46 of the water flowed along the tuff layer and 54 further infiltrated downward to recharge the layers below similarly for c3 1 65 of the groundwater flowed along it and the rest 35 infiltrated vertically through see inset in fig 4 consequently the water table below the tuff zones remained rather stable except the near bank region influenced by river water level fluctuations table 2 lists the vertical distance between the groundwater levels above and below the tuff zone c3 or c3 1 in four typical boreholes in the wet season showing that the numerical result is comparable to the field observations the weathering of tuff zones c3 and c3 1 makes their permeability isotropic k k in subzone b table 1 and fig 6b which facilitated the subvertical discharge of groundwater in the shallow region of the slope causing the tuff zones to mostly remain unsaturated and hence the unsaturated zone to be wedge shaped as shown in fig 11 the water head contours on may 15 2011 two years after the exploratory adit pd61 and its five branches pd61 1 pd61 5 were excavated table 5 indicated a marked alteration of the seepage field compare fig 10 and fig 11 the evolution of the calculated discharges out of pd61 and its three branches pd61 3 pd61 5 is shown in fig 12 where the discharges are compared with the available measurements on may 15 2011 table 5 the excavation of the adits led to increased vertical discharge of groundwater across the tuff zones and hence significant drawdown of water table the discharges fluctuated significantly during the excavation of the adits but overall tended to decrease to some stable magnitudes fig 12 in may 2011 the simulated discharge from the adit system was about 114 l min which is in excellent agreement with the field measurements table 5 at that time field observation showed that the 340 m near face section of adit pd61 and the branches pd61 1 and pd61 2 were in the unsaturated zone while the surrounding rocks of the rest section of pd61 and the branches pd61 3 pd61 5 remained saturated the numerical result see fig 11 well reproduces this observation 5 discussion this study has demonstrated the feasibility of modeling saturated unsaturated flow in fractured rock formations with the continuum approach this relies on proper estimation of the unsaturated hydraulic parameters of rocks in the van genuchten model and the modified mualem relation the estimates were obtained by inverse modeling of saturated unsaturated flow using the measurements of groundwater levels and discharges collected in the saturated zone a major concern is whether the saturated flow is sensitive enough to the hydraulic parameters in the unsaturated zone an additional sensitivity analysis table s4 in supplementary material confirms the sensitivities of α m and β in the unsaturated zone to the input data obtained from the saturated zone the parameter α is most sensitively influenced followed by m and β respectively in sensitivity which is consistent with the findings of gribb 1996 and liu et al 2003 besides the parameters are more sensitive in the rock zones where the water tables are located this partially justifies the inverse modeling strategy adopted in this study it should be noted however that the proposed approach contains quite a number of simplifications and assumptions first the flow was modeled with a continuum model where the details of the fracture system the flow in individual fractures and the fracture matrix interaction were not explicitly accounted for however given the difficulty in obtaining and thus the lack of sufficient fracture network information from site characterization the continuum model is arguably acceptable for this large scale problem this is partially justified by the capability of the continuum model in capturing the changes in groundwater level induced by changes in rainfall intensity during a typical period table s5 and fig s7 in supplementary material in fact the equivalent continuum approach has been successfully applied in a large number of studies e g peters and klavetter 1988 doughty 1999 wu et al 1999 finsterle 2000 liu et al 2003 second only the unsaturated hydraulic parameters were estimated by inverse modeling where the hydraulic conductivities of rocks were directly determined from the field hydraulic tests we made this choice because saturated hydraulic conductivities estimated from hydraulic tests have been shown to be representative of field scale flow properties of the rock gribb et al 1998 zhou et al 2015 hong et al 2017 it should be pointed out that the heterogeneity and scale effect of the parameters within each rock zone were not considered since the field test data do not support a more detailed delineation of the heterogeneity at the site it was technically infeasible to account for heterogeneity within each zone in the simulations eaton and mccord 1995 third the flow was assumed to be two dimensional in the slope where the flow component perpendicular to the cross section albeit slow was neglected due to insufficient data in the selected profile the use of measurements from the neighboring profiles further gave rise to uncertainties in the 2d modeling the 2d assumption is justifiable given the fact that the groundwater at the site the left bank primarily flows along the direction perpendicular to the river i e along the trace of section i i in fig 1 in addition the chosen cross section i i in fig 1 roughly represents the geological conditions including the topography lithology and geological structures at the site therefore the 2d model could be considered representative of the site characteristics the simplification of the model from 3d to 2d is common in seepage analysis due to the constraint of computational resource in inverse calculation of 3d model yan and jiao 2018 guo et al 2015 a 3d model will undoubtedly provide a more realistic and effective evaluation which is a focus of our future work finally the use of ann in the inverse modeling procedure significantly reduced the computational cost rafiai et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 hong et al 2017 as a surrogate model ann has become very popular and efficient in engineering problems zhang et al 2017 it is difficult to estimate the unsaturated parameters in large scale groundwater flow problems without using surrogate models asher et al 2015 salem and tomaso 2018 one should however be cautious when using surrogate models in inverse analysis because the reduced computational time possibly comes at the cost of oversmoothing the relation between the input and output data depending on the choice and size of the training samples in this study we used a combination of orthogonal design and forward modeling to create proper training samples for the ann model it is nevertheless acknowledged that further improvement is possible in the surrogate modeling despite of these limitations the proposed approach effectively reproduced the multiple water tables and wedge shaped unsaturated zones in a large scale rock slope the change of groundwater levels was predicted within a relatively small error by making full use of site characterization data the inversed unsaturated hydraulic parameters are comparable to existing results for rocks fractures and soils bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 flint 2003 hu et al 2015 without introducing sophisticated flow models and constitutive relations the numerical results are of engineering accuracy and useful for e g the design and performance assessment of impervious barriers li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 6 conclusions this study investigated the groundwater flow behavior in a large scale rock slope by means of inverse modeling using the continuum approach based on field observations spanning ten years at the baihetan dam site southwest china the inverse modeling showed that the unsaturated hydraulic parameters are in the range of α 0 01 4 65 m 1 m 0 31 0 69 n 1 45 3 23 and β 0 53 0 79 for fractured rocks loose sediments and geologic structures at the site comparable to existing results for rocks and fractures at yucca mountain bandurraga and bodvarsson 1999 flint 2003 and or soils of different types hu et al 2015 the multiple water levels above and below the tuff zones and the drawdown of water table in the slope during site exploration were reasonably reproduced and the estimated parameters are overall representative of the unsaturated hydraulic properties of rock formations at the site it has been challenging to obtain the field scale unsaturated hydraulic parameters in fractured rocks here it is demonstrated that without using the difficult to acquire flow and saturation data in the unsaturated zone the unsaturated hydraulic parameters can be effectively obtained through the groundwater level and discharge data in the saturated zone it is concluded that the inverse modeling procedure adopted is efficient and effective in seeking an optimal solution in a complex large scale inverse problem furthermore this study boosts our confidence in the continuum approach for approximating the site scale saturated unsaturated flow

separation trends in annual total streamflow baseflow runoff baseflow index precipitation snowmelt rate and peak snow water equivalent swe were evaluated from 1980 to 2015 using the non parametric mann kendall trend test results indicate that baseflow forms a large component of total streamflow contributing an average of 49 of total discharge upstream of albuquerque nm during 1980 to 2015 decreasing trends in total streamflow occurred at 9 of 12 sites and were almost always associated with decreases in baseflow suggesting that baseflow volumes can respond to changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions within decades decreasing snowmelt rates were more frequently associated with decreases in baseflow and total streamflow than were decreases in precipitation and peak swe highlighting the importance of snowmelt rate as a process controlling streamflow generation if snow accumulation and snowmelt rates continue to decrease in the future results indicate that total

snowmelt trend analysis upper rio grande 1 introduction understanding how changing climatic conditions affect streamflow availability and timing is critical for effective water management this is especially true in the southwest united states where demand for water remains high while in recent decades water supply has decreased due to hydroclimatic changes and fluctuations dettinger et al 2015 hoerling et al 2013 lehner et al 2017 because water is a critical resource for municipalities agriculture and growth in the southwest dettinger et al 2015 extensive research has sought to understand

of snowpacks stewart et al 2005 and the transition from snow to rain knowles et al 2006 are altering the timing and availability of streamflow to water users stewart et al 2005 adding complications to existing water challenges many of these changes have been observed in the rio grande lehner et al 2017 chavarria and gutzler 2018 a basin facing significant water supply challenges in the southwest dettinger et al 2015 with projections estimating that a decreasing water supply will continue into the future along with increasing streamflow variability and changes in the timing of streamflow llewellyn and vaddey 2013 because trends are projected to continue in the coming decades dettinger et al 2015 hamlet et al 2005 mote et al 2005 it is imperative to understand how climatic fluctuations affect water budgets now and into the future because groundwater discharge to streams often sustains surface water miller et al 2016 it is necessary to consider the surface water groundwater connection when evaluating water budgets and how they change through time in the snowmelt dominated upper colorado river basin it was estimated that 56 of the total streamflow originates from groundwater discharge miller et al 2016 suggesting that this component of flow is likely also important for the rio grande basin understanding how groundwater discharge to streams responds to climate fluctuations is important for evaluating the current and future effects of changing climatic conditions on water supplies water budgets geochemical processes and ecosystems in a basin ficklin et al 2016 and aids water management agencies in meeting water supply requirements groundwater discharge to streams referred to hereafter as baseflow is defined here as any water that travels through the subsurface prior to discharging in a stream it integrates groundwater from a variety of flowpaths ranging from shallow subsurface flow to deep groundwater miller et al 2014 price 2011 and is considered the slowly varying component of streamflow ficklin et al 2016 baseflow originates as snow and rain that infiltrate to the subsurface and depending on its flowpath discharges to streams within days to years winter et al 1998 both climate and basin characteristics affect the amount of baseflow discharged to streams price 2011 rumsey et al 2015 climatic conditions such as precipitation and temperature affect baseflow by altering rates of evapotranspiration infiltration and recharge and the timing and rate of snowmelt runoff brutsaert 2005 tague and grant 2009 winograd et al 1998 barnhart et al 2016 in a study of sites across the u s ficklin et al 2016 found that recent trends in climate are related to changes in baseflow where increasing precipitation was linked to increasing baseflow and increasing potential evapotranspiration was related to decreasing baseflow snowmelt dynamics have also been shown to affect baseflow barnhart et al 2016 found that the rate of snowmelt affects streamflow production where faster snowmelt rates are related to higher baseflow generation efficiencies exact streamflow and baseflow responses to climate fluctuations will vary by region depending on the unique characteristics of each basin ficklin et al 2016 to begin to understand how streamflow components have responded to recent hydroclimatic trends in the upper rio grande basin urgb this study evaluates how changing precipitation and snow conditions affected baseflow total streamflow and hydrologic partitioning streamflow components included in this work are total streamflow the total amount of water in the stream hereafter referred to as streamflow baseflow water that travels through the subsurface before discharging to streams and runoff water that travels over the land surface before reaching the stream we assume that streamflow is equal to the combined volumes of baseflow and runoff hydrologic partitioning refers to the fraction of baseflow or runoff in a stream giving an indication of the dominant flow path water takes prior to reaching a given stream site our main focus is to explore how changing snow conditions related to streamflow components and hydrologic partitioning in the urgb specific study objectives were to 1 quantify baseflow and runoff contributions to streamflow in the snowmelt dominated region of the urgb 2 evaluate how trends in

processes that affect streamflow and baseflow generation in the basin 2 methodology 2 1 study area the rio grande flows over 3000 km from southern colorado to the gulf of mexico llewellyn and vaddey 2013 the urgb as defined here includes the northernmost 550 km of the river extending from the headwaters in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains to the city of albuquerque in central new mexico the study area covers 38 250 km2 with elevations ranging from 1507 m at the streamgage at albuquerque to over 4372 m at blanca peak in the sangre de cristo mountains major tributaries to the rio grande include the rio chama the jemez river and the red river affinati and myers 2015 headwater inflows from the southern rocky mountains and the san luis valley form over 60 of the native inflow to the rio grande the rio chama and the jemez river contribute about 25 of the rio grande s streamflow llewellyn and vaddey 2013 physiography and climate are diverse in the urgb ranging from snow dominated mountains to arid intermontane valleys hearne and dewey 1988 precipitation varies with topography and latitude hearne and dewey 1988 where mean annual precipitation increases with altitude and decreases southward ellis et al 1993 the san juan mountains can receive over 150 cm of precipitation per year ortiz partida et al 2017 with the majority occurring as snow hearne and dewey 1988 in the spring snowmelt causes peak streamflows in april may and june pascolini campbell et al 2017 and is estimated to contribute 50 to 75 of the total streamflow in the rio grande rango 2006 robson and banta 1995 arid intermontane areas receive much less precipitation than the mountains e g the annual precipitation at albuquerque is roughly 20 cm 2010 2016 ortiz partida et al 2017 precipitation falling in mountainous areas is the primary source of recharge to the rio grande aquifer system with larger quantities of recharge occurring in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains robson and banta 1995 there is a close hydraulic connection between the river and subsurface aquifers and groundwater levels near the river affect streamflow in the rio grande and its tributaries during periods of high runoff groundwater recharge can occur but generally groundwater discharge to streams occurs along much of the length of the rio grande and its tributaries hearne and dewey 1988 robson and banta 1995 the rio grande is a net gaining stream from the headwaters to otowi bridge site 9 and becomes a net losing stream downstream of otowi bridge to albuquerque affinati and myers 2015 passell et al 2004 2 2 baseflow estimation to determine the importance of baseflow in streams in the urgb a conductivity mass balance cmb hydrograph separation approach was used to estimate daily and long term mean annual baseflow discharge following the methodology outlined in miller et al 2014 2015 and applied in rumsey et al 2015 this approach requires daily streamflow and daily specific conductance as inputs measured daily streamflow q and discrete specific conductance sc data were obtained from 17 u s geological survey usgs stream gages from the national water information system nwis database https waterdata usgs gov nwis data spanned water years wy 1980 2015 with periods of record varying from 5 to 36 years median length of record was 21 years due to data limitations data span different time periods at different gages to estimate daily and long term mean annual baseflow discharge q bf daily estimates of sc were required at each stream gage site using discrete sc data fluxmaster schwarz et al 2006 was used to estimate daily sc with four regression models table s1a supporting information si which calculated sc loads as a function of mean daily streamflow time and season for the calculation of long term mean annual baseflow estimation sc loads were detrended to a base year of 2000 for all sites and models to allow for comparison of loads among sites with differing periods of record sample sizes and temporal variability in discharge detrending provides estimates of sc that are independent of changes in climate or management by applying the environmental conditions of the base year to all years in the period of record schwarz et al 2006 estimated daily sc loads were subsequently converted to daily sc values µs cm for use in calculating baseflow discharge a second set of three fluxmaster regression models was used to estimate non detrended daily sc to estimate daily baseflow discharge for use in trend analyses trend analysis discussed in section 2 3 models listed in table s1b models were eliminated if estimated and observed loads differed by 15 percent the best fit regression model was selected as the model with the lowest akaike information criteria aicc value fluxmaster fit statistics provided in table s2 additional model information and outputs are provided in rumsey 2019 to ensure a robust estimation of baseflow discharge streamflow and sc at each site were required to meet criteria for cmb hydrograph separation miller et al 2014 rumsey et al 2015 which include 1 discharge must be inversely related to sc as described by a power function 2 there must be a snowmelt peak in the mean annual hydrograph defined as a peak in discharge due to melting snow during spring and early summer months that is roughly an order of magnitude greater than low flow conditions 3 sites must have a relatively large range of sc 100 µs cm and minimum sc values close to the runoff end member sc concentration defined below 4 the ranges of observed and modeled sc or q values must be similar see fig s1 in si for plots comparing observed and modeled sc and 5 stream gage sites must be at least 2 km downstream of reservoirs a detailed discussion of these criteria is included in rumsey et al 2015 this filtering process resulted in 17 sites with suitable data for baseflow estimation all sites are located in snowmelt dominated watersheds with drainage areas ranging from 94 km2 to 45 169 km2 additional site information in table s3 elevations range from 1509 to 2578 m above sea level with an average elevation of 2012 m it is important to note that the urgb is heavily regulated with dams and diversions and many of these gage sites are impacted by anthropogenic modifications to the natural hydrology three of the selected sites represent near native basins and include the rio grande at wagon wheel the rio chama near la puente and the jemez river near jemez estimating baseflow with cmb hydrograph separation has been shown to work well in snowmelt dominated watersheds and is compatible with regression derived daily sc miller et al 2014 2015 the method assumes there are two components to streamflow runoff and baseflow and that each source water has a distinct sc signature using cmb baseflow discharge is calculated from a mass balance equation pinder and jones 1969 1 q bf q s c sc ro sc bf sc ro where q bf is baseflow discharge q is the total stream discharge sc is specific conductance in the stream estimated from regression modeling sc ro is the sc of the runoff component of flow and sc bf is the sc of the baseflow component of flow long term mean annual baseflow discharge was calculated as the sum of mean daily baseflow discharge the baseflow index bfi was calculated as the sum of mean daily baseflow divided by the sum of mean daily streamflow 2 b f i m e a n d a i l y q b f m e a n d a i l y q sc bf represents all subsurface flow to streams integrating multiple groundwater flow paths time variable sc bf were estimated for the period of record by linearly interpolating between the 95th percentile of daily sc values for each year sc ro represents low sc water that discharges to streams from surface snowmelt runoff and is estimated to be 33 µs cm based on measurements made during snowmelt at high elevation watersheds in the headwaters of the upper colorado river basin miller et al 2014 although snowmelt sc can be as low as 5 to 10 µs cm sc ro represents meltwater runoff that has traveled to the stream and has a slightly higher sc value a sensitivity analysis in miller et al 2014 showed that using an sc ro of 10 µs cm yielded statistically equivalent baseflow estimates as using 33 µs cm since the geology of urgb headwaters is similar to the upper colorado it is assumed that the sc of runoff in the urgb is comparable note that three assumptions are used when applying the cmb method 1 no other sources of water except runoff and baseflow contribute to streamflow 2 sc ro does not change during the period of record and 3 sc ro and sc bf are significantly different from each other miller et al 2014 demonstrated that cmb hydrograph separation provides reasonable estimates of baseflow within these constraints for a more detailed discussion of model assumptions see miller et al 2014 the statistical uncertainty of q bf estimates was calculated by considering error from discharge measurements sc measurements fluxmaster regression modeling sc ro and sc bf the variability of sc measured as the coefficient of variation of sc measurements was also included these sources of error were propagated through each step of the analysis to quantify the coefficient of variation cov of detrended baseflow discharge the cov also known as relative standard deviation or relative error is error proportional to the magnitude of estimated loads mac berthouex and brown 2002 the uncertainty equation and derivations are provided in rumsey et al 2017 a principal component analysis pca was run on select watershed characteristics climate topography hydrologic disturbance and land cover variables to identify relations among these variables and estimated baseflow yield all watershed characteristic data were obtained from the gages ii dataset falcone 2011 input data were fourth root transformed to down weight the importance of variables with high absolute values and were standardized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one prior to running the pca pca was run using the primer package clarke and gorley 2006 2 3 trend analyses of streamflow baseflow and precipitation trend analyses were completed to determine whether changing precipitation and snow conditions were related to trends in streamflow baseflow or the hydrologic partitioning of runoff and baseflow i e bfi trends were estimated at streamgage sites with at least 10 years of estimated baseflow discharge only 12 out of the 17 sites where daily baseflow discharge was estimated met this criteria the median length of record for the 12 sites was 29 years ranging from 13 to 36 years only three sites represent near native conditions the remaining nine sites are affected by dams diversions and water withdrawals streamflow trends analyzed at affected sites will reflect changing climatic conditions and changes in water use and management over time unexplained variability in comparisons of trends in climate variables and streamflow components is expected to be due to anthropogenic or unaccounted for natural influences while an analysis of all hydrologic components would provide a comprehensive view of how streamflow components change in relation to various aspects of the hydrologic cycle this was beyond the scope of this work which was focused specifically on how changing precipitation and snow conditions affected streamflow components and hydrologic partitioning the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 was used to evaluate trends in annual and seasonal streamflow baseflow runoff and bfi using the rkt package marchetto 2017 in r r core team 2018 input streamflow and baseflow data were normalized to drainage area in order to obtain runoff values mm yr that could be directly compared to precipitation metrics trends are presented as slopes change year since there are different periods of record at each site and it would be inappropriate to compare absolute trends over inconsistent time periods four seasons were used to assess seasonal patterns fall october december winter january march spring april june and summer july september an adjustment was applied to all mann kendall test p values to remove autocorrelation using the zyp package bronaugh and werner 2013 in r input variables were log transformed prior to analysis to ensure constant variance with time helsel and hirsch 2002 daily measurements of precipitation and snow water equivalent swe were obtained from snowpack telemetry snotel stations in the urgb https www wcc nrcs usda gov snow snotel data allowed for the analysis of several precipitation metrics including peak swe maximum value recorded during the snow accumulation season cumulative precipitation on may 1 may 1p annual precipitation rain snow as recorded on september 30 annual p the percent of annual precipitation that fell as snow and snowmelt rate the percent of annual precipitation that fell as snow was calculated as peak swe divided by annual precipitation recorded on september 30 the snowmelt rate mm day is an estimate of how quickly the snowpack melted in a given year and was included to explore whether the rate of snowmelt which influences infiltration and water movement across the landscape affects streamflow and baseflow generation as suggested in barnhart et al 2016 the snowmelt rate was calculated as peak swe mm divided by the number of days it took to go from peak swe to zero swe to pair streamflow trends with precipitation trends snotel stations were assigned to streamgages if they were located within the delineated watershed of each streamgage see table s4 the period of record at each snotel station was trimmed to match the period of available baseflow discharge data available at each streamgage resulting in 14 snotel stations with periods of record that overlapped baseflow discharge data the average elevation at these 14 snotel stations was 3032 m ranging from 2560 to 3429 m table s4 the non parametric regional kendall test for trend was performed on the group of snotel stations within each streamgage watershed using the rkt package this test adds an increased power of trend detection because it combines trends from multiple stations helsel and frans 2006 all input variables were log transformed prior to analysis to ensure constant variance with time helsel and hirsch 2002 an adjustment for serial autocorrelation was applied to all regional kendall tests for trend using the rkt r package 2 4 interannual comparison of precipitation and streamflow variables to explore relations between precipitation streamflow generation and hydrologic partitioning annual values of snowmelt rate the percent of precipitation that fell as snow peak swe annual rainfall and annual precipitation were compared to annual streamflow volume baseflow volume and bfi for three near native sites in the urgb rio grande at wagon wheel the rio chama near la puente and the jemez river near jemez annual streamflow baseflow volumes were calculated as the sum of daily streamflow baseflow volumes annual rainfall was calculated as annual precipitation minus annual peak swe at each snotel station additionally runoff coefficients were compared to bfi to understand how hydrologic partitioning is related to high or low flow years runoff coefficients were calculated as annual streamflow in mm yr divided by annual precipitation mm yr and are used to quantify the amount of precipitation that becomes streamflow each year scatterplots and kendall s tau correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the strength of relations between precipitation and streamflow variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variation in baseflow estimated mean annual detrended baseflow discharge in the urgb ranged from 13 106 m3 yr to 933 106 m3 yr fig 1 table s5 baseflow volumes generally increased downstream with increasing drainage area however at the rio grande near lobatos co site 2 in fig 1 annual baseflow discharge was less than that observed at the most upstream site rio grande at wagon wheel site 1 even though the drainage area is nearly six times larger and is expected to be a net gaining reach hearne and dewey 1988 bexfield and anderholm 2010 the rio grande near lobatos site 2 is downstream of the san luis valley an extensive agricultural area that uses an average of over 1 billion m3 of rio grande water to irrigate over 500 000 acres bexfield and anderholm 2010 illustrating that water withdrawals may decrease baseflow volumes in the basin baseflow discharge increases from lobatos site 2 to otowi bridge site 9 where it receives inflow from the rio chama and several tributary streams draining the sangre de cristo mountains baseflow discharge decreases downstream of otowi bridge site 9 where the rio grande becomes a net losing stream affinati and myers 2015 passell et al 2004 water use occurs along the main stem of the rio grande from lobatos site 2 to albuquerque site 12 where it is used primarily for agriculture ellis et al 1993 the statistical uncertainty of baseflow estimates ranged from 10 to 39 with a median uncertainty of 22 table s5 while the baseflow estimates presented here represent actual conditions in the streams they may not be solely representative of natural processes that occur in watersheds but may be affected by various water management practices that occur in the basin it is possible that baseflow estimation at several sites is affected by irrigation return flows which occur upstream of the following sites rio grande near lobatos site 2 the rio chama near chamita site 8 and the rio grande near otowi bridge san felipe and albuquerque sites 9 10 and 12 langman and anderholm 2004 in the case of irrigation return flows transported via the subsurface the time variable baseflow end member 95th percentile of annual sc see eq 1 would account for increases in annual sc values due to irrigation therefore the annual estimate of baseflow is expected to be unaffected miller et al 2014 conversely baseflow may be overestimated if irrigation return flows with high sc are transported via surface runoff to streams where any water with sc 33 µs cm is considered to be baseflow additionally because the rio grande upstream of lobatos receives diversions from groundwater in the closed basin of the san luis valley dinatale water consultants 2015 baseflow estimates at the rio grande near lobatos are likely higher than what they would be without imports from the closed basin lastly it is important to note that the san juan chama project sjc project which is a transbasin diversion transporting water from the upper san juan basin into the rio chama basin affects streamflow and water quality at rio chama at chamita site 8 as well as from the rio grande at otowi to albuquerque sites 9 10 and 12 langman and anderholm 2004 for sites affected by the sjc project baseflow estimates represent processes occurring in the rio chama the rio grande and the imported water to assess the spatial variability of baseflow generation across the urgb baseflow yield was calculated as area normalized baseflow discharge baseflow yield in the urgb ranged from 8 3 mm yr to 154 mm yr with a median value of 38 mm yr fig 2 the highest baseflow yields occurred in high elevation streams draining the san juan mountains and the sangre de cristo mountains including the rio hondo near valdez 154 mm yr the rio grande at wagon wheel 99 mm yr and the rio chama near la puente 73 mm yr baseflow yields decreased longitudinally downstream for the rio chama this pattern is consistent with observations in the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 miller et al 2016 and is expected in largely unaltered systems baseflow yields followed a less consistent pattern along the rio grande main stem with the lowest yields observed along the main stem of the rio grande at lobatos 8 mm yr and near cerro nm 13 mm yr downstream of the san luis valley water use likely contributes to the lack of a consistent upstream downstream pattern in baseflow yield along the main stem of the rio grande the first and second axes of the pca accounted for 57 and 23 respectively of the variability in climate topography hydrologic disturbance and land use fig s2a and baseflow yield was positively correlated with axis 1 pca scores fig s2b the pca analysis indicates that more baseflow is generated in high elevation areas with steeper land slope higher precipitation small order streams and a higher percent evergreen forest areas with lower baseflow yield occur in basins with greater percent shrubland agriculture and pastureland higher temperatures larger order streams and a greater degree of hydrologic disturbance which is a metric based on the presence of several variables including for example the number of dams amount of water withdrawal and number of canals falcone 2011 fig s2a it is important to note that while the pca identifies variables that are correlated with baseflow yield it does not provide causative information rather results provide a useful screening tool that can be used in future analyses to identify specific drivers of observed spatial trends in baseflow yield comparing the mean annual baseflow generation efficiency mean annual baseflow yield divided by mean annual precipitation gages ii falcone 2011 to elevation across the urgb illustrates that a higher fraction of precipitation infiltrates and becomes baseflow at higher elevation sites as compared to lower elevation sites in the urgb on average 14 of precipitation becomes baseflow in basins with average elevations of 2990 3330 m highest 25 which is statistically greater p 0 05 than at the lowest elevations 2430 2580 m lowest 25 where only 7 of precipitation becomes baseflow increased water use along the main stem of the rio grande contributes to lower baseflow generation in lower elevation areas of the basin however with a few noted exceptions findings are generally similar to patterns observed in the upper colorado river basin where greater baseflow yield and baseflow generation occurred in high elevation regions with greater precipitation higher percent snow steeper slopes and a higher percentage of sandy soils rumsey et al 2015 other studies have also shown that greater amounts of precipitation infiltrate and become baseflow in steep high elevation areas winograd et al 1998 santhi et al 2008 miller et al 2016 the fraction of total streamflow that is estimated to be baseflow in a stream or the bfi provides a measure of the importance of groundwater discharge to total streamflow for these 17 sites in the urgb bfi ranged from 0 29 to 0 69 with a median bfi of 0 45 demonstrating that baseflow forms a large component of streamflow in the urgb fig s3 table s5 urgb bfi values are very similar to those observed in the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 where the median bfi was 0 48 also similar to findings in the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 miller et al 2016 a clear spatial pattern in bfi values occurs in the urgb where low bfis generally occur in high elevation tributary streams and high bfis occur in the most downstream sites along the main stem of the rio grande and the rio chama fig s3 this indicates that high elevation low discharge streams are dominated by runoff that occurs during the snowmelt season whereas larger downstream sites are mostly composed of baseflow discharge however liu et al 2008 found that baseflow discharge accounted for over 80 of streamflow in two small catchments of the valles caldera in the jemez mountains illustrating that baseflow can form large fractions of streamflow in some headwater areas overall mean annual baseflow estimates demonstrate that groundwater discharge to streams forms an important fraction median 0 45 range of 0 29 0 69 of total streamflow in the urgb high elevation areas of the urgb generated more baseflow per unit area and more baseflow per unit of precipitation than downstream areas highlighting the importance of baseflow generation in these regions tague and grant 2009 found that baseflow in high elevation areas may be affected by climatic changes that alter precipitation timing of snowmelt and temperature indicating that baseflow from high elevations in the urgb may be vulnerable to changing climatic conditions 3 2 trends in baseflow streamflow snow and precipitation downward trends in streamflow baseflow runoff snow and precipitation were observed at many of the 12 streams and watersheds during 1980 2015 table 1 and fig 3 observed decreasing trends are expected considering that analyses were conducted over a period with the strongest downward trends in precipitation and streamflow in over 400 years when streamflows were very high in the 1980s followed by some of the lowest flows in the early 2000s lehner et al 2017 however in this analysis we are less interested in absolute trends than we are in how streamflow components and hydroclimate change in relation to one another over time trends in total streamflow were almost always associated with trends in baseflow and runoff fig 3a c nine of the twelve 75 streams had statistically significant decreasing trends in streamflow ranging from 0 39 mm yr yr to 10 88 mm yr yr with a median trend of 0 65 mm yr yr eight of those nine sites also had statistically significant decreases in baseflow and runoff with median decreases of 0 37 mm yr yr and 0 26 mm yr yr for baseflow and runoff respectively no site had statistically significant increasing trends in streamflow baseflow or runoff while we may have expected limited change in baseflow due to its long flowpaths and transit times findings show that baseflow undergoes significant change over multi decadal timescales indicating that it is vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic changes occurring in the watershed the age of the baseflow is unknown and likely includes flowpaths ranging in age from days to decades however percent changes in baseflow were typically lower than percent changes in streamflow and runoff table 1 indicating that the baseflow was less responsive to multi decadal changes than runoff possibly due to the effects of older water contributing to the baseflow fraction of streamflow a comparison of standard deviations of interannual flow for streamflow components shows that baseflow is consistently less variable than streamflow and runoff from year to year fig s4 indicating that baseflow has a larger proportion of old water that is less sensitive to interannual climatic and anthropogenic change solder et al 2016 trends in bfi indicate whether the hydrologic partitioning of runoff and baseflow has changed with time three of the twelve 25 streams had statistically significant increasing trends in bfi ranging from 0 002 to 0 003 per year table 1 and fig 3d these streams also had statistically significant decreasing trends in baseflow runoff and streamflow at these three sites the bfi trends show that there was a higher fraction of baseflow during recent years that the runoff fraction of streamflow decreased more rapidly than baseflow over the period of record and that baseflow is becoming an increasingly important component of streamflow no statistically significant decreasing trends in bfi were observed to understand changes in streamflow components in the context of climatic variability streamflow trends were compared to the trends of several precipitation metrics table 1 and fig 3 statistically significant decreasing trends in annual precipitation were observed in four watersheds fig 3e ranging from 4 46 mm yr to 6 64 mm yr these watersheds also had significant decreasing trends in baseflow runoff and streamflow ficklin et al 2016 also observed consistent decreases in baseflow and runoff in the southwest from 1980 to 2010 and found that trends were related to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration only one watershed had statistically significant decreasing trends in may 1 precipitation 3 96 mm yr fig 3f and only two watersheds had statistically significant decreasing trends in peak swe 3 97 mm yr and 4 72 mm yr fig 3g there was no change in the percentage of annual precipitation that falls as snow for any site during the time periods analyzed fig 3h decreasing streamflow baseflow and runoff occurred more frequently with decreasing snowmelt rates than decreasing peak swe and precipitation six of the nine sites 75 with decreasing streamflow and six of the eight 86 sites with decreasing baseflow and runoff also had statistically significant decreases in snowmelt rate fig 3i decreasing snowmelt rates ranged from 0 10 to 0 22 mm day yr and occurred across the study area at sites on the rio grande rio chama and the jemez river indicating that snow is melting slower in the urgb significant increases in temperature were also observed at 9 of the 12 stream basins during these time periods table s6 and are a likely contributor to changing snowmelt rates this is consistent with findings from musselman et al 2017 who highlighted that slower snowmelt is projected to occur in a warmer world as a result of the snowmelt season contracting to a time of lower available energy under warmer conditions they suggest that less snow cover will occur during times of high energy fluxes i e spring and summer that are required to drive high snowmelt rates slower snowmelt rates are expected to affect snowmelt dominated watersheds like the urgb and may result in decreased streamflow production musselman et al 2017 in fact barnhart et al 2016 found that streamflow production in the southern rockies is sensitive to changes in snowmelt rate where slower snowmelt occurs with lower streamflow observed concurrent trends in streamflow and snowmelt rate indicate that snowmelt rate is an important process associated with changing streamflow and baseflow volumes in the urgb and requires further investigation see section 3 4 forest disturbances including bark beetle infestations and wildfires have occurred in recent decades in the urgb and may also have hydrologic implications affecting snowmelt infiltration streamflow and hydrologic partitioning doerr et al 2006 benson et al 2018 wildfires and bark beetle attacks remove or reduce the tree canopy leading to increases in snow accumulation and water yield as interception sublimation and evapotranspiration decrease pugh and gordon 2013 further as tree canopies lose needles and other woody material after forest disturbance snow albedo decreases and incoming solar radiation increases causing faster snowmelt rates pugh and gordon 2013 and potentially increased amounts of water infiltrated to the subsurface barnhart et al 2016 however no increases in streamflow baseflow or snowmelt rate were observed in the period of analysis of this study in the case of wildfire and depending on the severity of the fire infiltration of precipitation and snowmelt may be affected by increasing soil repellency and the plugging of soil pores with ash this leads to decreased infiltration capacity increased overland flow runoff and increased peak flows earles et al 2004 pugh and gordon 2013 as was observed after the cerro grande wildfire in 2000 earles et al 2004 and after the las cochas fire in 2011 dahm et al 2015 both of which occurred in the urgb increased runoff may also occur after a fire due to the removal of vegetation and litter doerr et al 2006 however no increases in runoff or in the fraction of runoff in the stream 1 bfi were detected in this study the fact that multi decadal trends analyzed here do not follow predicted hydrological patterns following disturbance suggests that the extent of forest disturbances in the urgb may not have been large enough to affect hydrologic processes at the regional scale hallema et al 2018 wine and cadol 2016 or that multi decadal trends 10 years estimated in this study may not capture the acute effects of forest disturbance where the hydrological effects occur within months to several years pugh and gordon 2013 while mann kendall trend tests used here accounted for increased uncertainty of trend results due to serial correlation they did not account for uncertainty that may occur due to scaling or longer term climatic variability hamed 2008 to test whether scaling was an issue for streamflow and precipitation variables in the urgb a modified mann kendall trend test that accounts for scaling was applied using the mannkendallltp function in the r package hkprocess tegos et al 2017 tyralis 2016 for streamflow baseflow and runoff uncertainty in the trend results increased when scaling was taken into account table s7 particularly for baseflow this is likely a result of the relatively short periods of record that were available for analysis which were constrained at each site by the availability of the baseflow record when the modified mann kendall trend test was applied to streamflow records spanning from 1980 to 2015 results show that total streamflow likely decreased during this time table s8 runoff also decreased at many sites even after accounting for scaling table s7 further using tree ring based reconstructions of streamflow since 1571 lehner et al 2017 found that the strongest 30 year declining trends in streamflow and runoff ratio in the entire four century record occurred from the early 1980s to the early 2000s in the upper rio grande thus we have confidence that the original mann kendall trend results for runoff and total streamflow table 1 are representative of patterns that occurred in the basin trends in baseflow are much more uncertain when scaling is accounted for and suggest that longer baseflow records are needed if data are available future trend analyses should utilize longer periods of baseflow record to verify the trends in baseflow presented here for precipitation metrics trend results accounting for scaling were very similar to those reported using the original mann kendall method table 1 giving us confidence that calculated trends are representative of patterns that occurred in the basin 3 3 seasonal trends of streamflow components to understand seasonal changes trends in streamflow baseflow and runoff were analyzed for winter january march spring april june summer july september and fall october december at 9 sites with statistically significant decreases in annual streamflow the largest decreases in streamflow baseflow and runoff discharge occurred in the spring season fig 4 a 43 to 83 of the estimated decrease in annual streamflow occurred in spring similarly 41 to 67 and 47 to 101 of the estimated decrease in annual baseflow and runoff respectively occurred in spring the second largest magnitude changes occurred in summer for streamflow and baseflow and in winter for runoff sites for which these patterns of change were observed include the near native basins of the jemez river near jemez and the rio chama near la puente there was no trend in annual streamflow at the rio grande at wagon wheel thus it was not included in the seasonal analysis where decreases in spring streamflow accounted for 66 and 83 of the decrease in annual streamflow respectively the large decreases in streamflow baseflow and runoff during spring indicate that conditions are changing during the snowmelt season and highlight the importance of this time period for generating streamflow it is important to note that streamflow baseflow and runoff peak during spring months driven by snowmelt runoff therefore there is the largest potential for change in discharge during this season when seasonal trends were evaluated relative to seasonal discharge fig 4b similar patterns emerged the greatest percent changes in seasonal streamflow components occurred in spring with median decreases of 2 4 2 1 and 3 1 for streamflow baseflow and runoff respectively in near native basins the largest percent decreases in streamflow and baseflow also occurred in spring the lowest percent change for all seasons occurred in the baseflow component of streamflow overall changes occurring in the snowmelt season dominated annual decreasing streamflow baseflow and runoff in the urgb in an analysis of streamflow trends and timing across the western u s stewart et al 2005 also observed widespread decreasing trends in streamflow from april to july months they estimated contributed 50 80 of the annual total in snowmelt dominated watersheds decreases in spring streamflow were largely attributed to a shift toward earlier snowmelt causing increased streamflows earlier in the year stewart et al 2005 slower snowmelt rates could also explain observed reductions in spring streamflow musselman et al 2017 in the urgb while significant changes in baseflow and streamflow volumes occurred in the snowmelt season only 2 3 of 12 stream sites had a statistically significant decrease in the number of days at which 50 of annual streamflow baseflow was measured at a gage that would indicate streamflow discharge is shifting to earlier in the year however chavarria and gutzler 2018 observed a shift toward earlier snowmelt in the rio grande upstream of lobatos from 1958 to 2015 showing that earlier runoff is occurring in the region others have also shown that earlier shifts in streamflow are occurring across the western united states regonda et al 2005 clow 2010 stewart et al 2005 barnett et al 2008 3 4 correlation between annual precipitation and streamflow variables to further understand how snowmelt rate and the form of precipitation relate to streamflow and hydrologic partitioning annual precipitation metrics were compared to annual cumulative streamflow and baseflow and to the bfi at three near native sites minimally affected by water withdrawals and other anthropogenic influences annual precipitation rain snow and peak swe were significantly correlated p 0 05 with streamflow baseflow and bfi at all three near native sites fig 5 table s9 indicating that total precipitation and snowfall amounts affect streamflow and baseflow volumes as well as hydrologic partitioning in a given year the amount of annual rainfall was not significantly correlated p 0 05 to annual streamflow baseflow or bfi at any site suggesting it is less important for generating streamflow at these sites higher percentages of precipitation falling as snow were related to increased streamflow and baseflow volumes at the rio grande at wagon wheel and the jemez river near jemez where there was a statistically significant positive correlation between streamflow baseflow volumes and percent snow fig 6 a table s9 there was no relation at the rio chama near la puente which differs from the two other sites in that it has higher estimated subsurface flow contact time faster infiltration rates falcone 2011 and it has a greater percentage of annual precipitation that is snow figure s5 suggesting that soil conditions allow for similar rates of infiltration of precipitation irrespective of precipitation form or it may not have reached a threshold where low annual percentages of snow begin to decrease streamflow and baseflow further investigation into rio chama basin characteristics and streamflow generation is needed to explain this discrepancy percent snow also relates to hydrologic partitioning where 2 out of 3 sites showed statistically significant negative correlations between percent snow and bfi that is years with higher percent snow occur in years with a higher fraction of runoff and a lower fraction of baseflow this temporal relationship is consistent with previously observed spatial relationships where sites at high elevations with more snow also had a consistently higher fraction of runoff overall a greater fraction of annual precipitation falling as snow relates to higher streamflow and baseflow volumes and also affects the hydrologic partitioning of water increasing the amount of water that enters a stream via surface runoff it is important to note that years with a greater percentage of snow often occur in years with high amounts of annual precipitation thus the observed correlations fig 6a are not solely due to the effect of snow but are also likely affected by annual precipitation for further evidence of the importance of snow linear regression models were generated to predict annual streamflow baseflow and runoff using percent snow and annual precipitation although annual precipitation explained most of the variability in annual streamflow models performed better in almost all cases when percent snow was used in conjunction with annual precipitation as a predictor variable table s10 providing additional evidence that snow as a form of precipitation is an important element for streamflow generation the rate at which snow melts off the land surface also relates to streamflow volumes and hydrologic partitioning fig 6b there was a statistically significant positive correlation between snowmelt rate and streamflow baseflow volumes in all cases except for baseflow at rio grande at wagon wheel table s9 years with higher streamflow and baseflow volumes occurred in years with faster snowmelt rates while streamflow and baseflow volumes were less in years with slow snowmelt rates snowmelt rates were also significantly p 0 05 correlated with peak swe and it was difficult to tease out the effect of peak swe from snowmelt rates however interannual correlations of snowmelt rates vs streamflow and baseflow are consistent with observed multi decadal trends which showed that the majority of sites with decreasing streamflow and baseflow discharge also had decreasing snowmelt rates snowmelt rate was also correlated to bfi with all near native sites having a statistically significant negative correlation years with a lower fraction of baseflow occurred in years with fast snowmelt rates and years with high fractions of baseflow occurred in years with slow snowmelt rates observations demonstrate that slower snowmelt rates are associated with lower streamflow and baseflow volumes and an increased fraction of baseflow in streams observed correlations are corroborated by previous modeling analyses showing that decreasing snowmelt rates reduce streamflow production barnhart et al 2016 found that snowmelt rate controlled streamflow production whereby snowmelt rates that exceed evapotranspiration deliver water to the soil column induce percolation and lead to subsurface flow that increases streamflow and baseflow generation efficiencies slower snowmelt rates result in increased partitioning to evapotranspiration as snow melts slowly on the landscape leading to lower streamflow production barnhart et al 2016 musselman et al 2017 also found that reductions in high snowmelt rates and an increase in slow snowmelt rates were associated with decreases in the total meltwater volume produced observed trends and relations between snowmelt rate baseflow runoff and streamflow in the urgb support the predictions and processes previously modeled by barnhart et al 2016 and musselman et al 2017 the effect of changing snowmelt rates and percent snow on hydrologic partitioning infers that the fraction of flow that is baseflow i e bfi increases as streamflow and baseflow decrease to test this directly the runoff coefficient annual streamflow yield annual precipitation was compared to bfi at each site for all three near native stream sites in the urgb there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the runoff coefficient and bfi fig 7 that is years with a high runoff coefficient occurred in years with a higher fraction of runoff while years with a low runoff coefficient occurred in years with a higher fraction of baseflow further high peak swe values typically occurred in years with a higher runoff coefficient a characteristic also observed by lehner et al 2017 who found that high runoff coefficients required higher than average precipitation in the urgb these observations illustrate that when the runoff coefficient is high there is typically a greater amount of snow and a higher fraction of water enters the stream as runoff during years with a low runoff coefficient and lower amounts of snow baseflow sustains a greater fraction of streamflow snow and the rate of snowmelt are key factors producing streamflow and dictating hydrologic partitioning in the west hammond et al 2018 barnhart et al 2016 in this study we have identified that changes in snow and snowmelt processes relate to changing streamflow components and their hydrologic partitioning in the urgb the melting of snow is a slower and longer process than rainfall and it allows water to more readily infiltrate into the subsurface stephenson and freeze 1974 where it contributes to the baseflow that sustains streamflow miller et al 2016 however if snowmelt rates become too slow hydrologic connectivity between subsurface and surface flow may decline as a result of increased loss to evapotranspiration decreased water delivered to the soil column and its inability to overcome the field capacity musselman et al 2017 barnhart et al 2016 this will affect streamflow generation as large amounts of snowmelt reach streams via the subsurface barnhart et al 2016 stephenson and freeze 1974 4 conclusions and implications in this study we investigate the effects of changing hydroclimate on streamflow baseflow and hydrologic partitioning baseflow or groundwater discharge to streams forms a significant percentage of total streamflow in the urgb accounting for an average of 49 of streamflow upstream of albuquerque nm consistent decreases in streamflow baseflow and runoff were observed during 1980 to 2015 and occurred more frequently with decreases in snowmelt rate than with decreases in peak swe or annual precipitation the largest decreases for all streamflow components occurred during the snowmelt season illustrating that processes and conditions during spring months have a large impact on annual streamflow and its components snowmelt rate and the percent of precipitation falling as snow also relate to hydrologic partitioning and streamflow generation in the urgb on annual time steps where slower snowmelt rates and lower percentages of snow are associated with decreased streamflow and baseflow volumes and a higher fraction of baseflow in streams the mann kendall trend test applied here indicates that significant declines in baseflow volume occurred during 1980 2015 suggesting that baseflow is vulnerable to changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions that occur over multi decadal time scales ficklin et al 2016 however application of a modified mann kendall trend test that considers the effects of scaling indicates that longer baseflow records may be needed to verify that these multi decadal trends are not an artifact of short periods of record future trend analyses that can use longer periods of baseflow record should be conducted to verify the baseflow trends presented here future projections of climate indicate that temperatures will continue to increase in the urgb which will likely cause decreases in water availability earlier snowmelt runoffs and slower snowmelt in the basin llewellyn and vaddey 2013 musselman et al 2017 barnhart et al 2016 if observed relations between snow processes and streamflow continue in the future results indicate that streamflow and baseflow volumes will decline and that baseflow will become a larger fraction of streamflow as we move toward a warmer world with a higher fraction of rain and earlier snowmelt timing streamflow production will depend on whether the rate of water delivery exceeds the rate of evaporative loss to the atmosphere barnhart et al 2016 and whether the rate of water delivery allows for infiltration and transport in the subsurface stephenson and freeze 1974 findings from this study help to advance the understanding of the hydrologic system in the urgb as well as inform the impacts that climate fluctuations may have on water supply and water budgets by understanding how streamflow components change in relation to each other and in response to climate water managers will be better equipped to address issues that are important to communities and

5676,understanding how changing climatic conditions affect streamflow volume and timing is critical for effective water management in the rio grande basin of the southwest u s decreasing snowpack increasing minimum temperatures and decreasing streamflow have been observed in recent decades but the effects of hydroclimatic changes on baseflow or groundwater discharge to streams have not been investigated in this study we determine how trends in precipitation snowpack accumulation and snowmelt rate relate to total streamflow baseflow and the hydrologic partitioning of baseflow and runoff at 12 sites in the upper rio grande basin urgb during 1980 to 2015 total streamflow was partitioned into baseflow and runoff components at a daily time step using conductivity mass balance hydrograph separation trends in annual total streamflow baseflow runoff baseflow index precipitation snowmelt rate and peak snow water equivalent swe were evaluated from 1980 to 2015 using the non parametric mann kendall trend test results indicate that baseflow forms a large component of total streamflow contributing an average of 49 of total discharge upstream of albuquerque nm during 1980 to 2015 decreasing trends in total streamflow occurred at 9 of 12 sites and were almost always associated with decreases in baseflow suggesting that baseflow volumes can respond to changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions within decades decreasing snowmelt rates were more frequently associated with decreases in baseflow and total streamflow than were decreases in precipitation and peak swe highlighting the importance of snowmelt rate as a process controlling streamflow generation if snow accumulation and snowmelt rates continue to decrease in the future results indicate that total streamflow and baseflow volumes will decline and that baseflow will become a larger fraction of total streamflow in the urgb keywords baseflow groundwater discharge to streams hydrologic partitioning snowmelt trend analysis upper rio grande 1 introduction understanding how changing climatic conditions affect streamflow availability and timing is critical for effective water management this is especially true in the southwest united states where demand for water remains high while in recent decades water supply has decreased due to hydroclimatic changes and fluctuations dettinger et al 2015 hoerling et al 2013 lehner et al 2017 because water is a critical resource for municipalities agriculture and growth in the southwest dettinger et al 2015 extensive research has sought to understand the effects of climate fluctuation on water resources in the region observations of rising temperatures barnett et al 2008 bonfils et al 2008 chavarria and gutzler 2018 hoerling et al 2013 knowles et al 2006 lehner et al 2017 and decreasing snowpack barnett et al 2008 chavarria and gutzler 2018 mote et al 2005 pierce et al 2008 in recent decades coincide with observed declines in annual streamflow chavarria and gutzler 2018 hoerling et al 2013 and annual peak streamflow hirsch and ryberg 2012 in the region further hydroclimate changes indicate the southwest is experiencing a longer term trend toward a warmer climate observed decreases in snowpack hamlet et al 2005 mote et al 2005 pierce et al 2008 increasing minimum temperatures earlier runoff and a decreased fraction of annual precipitation falling as snow barnett et al 2008 have occurred in the region with over half of these changes attributed to climate responses from anthropogenic emissions pierce et al 2008 barnett et al 2008 concurrent decreases in annual streamflow hoerling et al 2013 lehner et al 2017 ruhí et al 2016 have stressed water resources in the region dettinger et al 2015 while observed earlier melting of snowpacks stewart et al 2005 and the transition from snow to rain knowles et al 2006 are altering the timing and availability of streamflow to water users stewart et al 2005 adding complications to existing water challenges many of these changes have been observed in the rio grande lehner et al 2017 chavarria and gutzler 2018 a basin facing significant water supply challenges in the southwest dettinger et al 2015 with projections estimating that a decreasing water supply will continue into the future along with increasing streamflow variability and changes in the timing of streamflow llewellyn and vaddey 2013 because trends are projected to continue in the coming decades dettinger et al 2015 hamlet et al 2005 mote et al 2005 it is imperative to understand how climatic fluctuations affect water budgets now and into the future because groundwater discharge to streams often sustains surface water miller et al 2016 it is necessary to consider the surface water groundwater connection when evaluating water budgets and how they change through time in the snowmelt dominated upper colorado river basin it was estimated that 56 of the total streamflow originates from groundwater discharge miller et al 2016 suggesting that this component of flow is likely also important for the rio grande basin understanding how groundwater discharge to streams responds to climate fluctuations is important for evaluating the current and future effects of changing climatic conditions on water supplies water budgets geochemical processes and ecosystems in a basin ficklin et al 2016 and aids water management agencies in meeting water supply requirements groundwater discharge to streams referred to hereafter as baseflow is defined here as any water that travels through the subsurface prior to discharging in a stream it integrates groundwater from a variety of flowpaths ranging from shallow subsurface flow to deep groundwater miller et al 2014 price 2011 and is considered the slowly varying component of streamflow ficklin et al 2016 baseflow originates as snow and rain that infiltrate to the subsurface and depending on its flowpath discharges to streams within days to years winter et al 1998 both climate and basin characteristics affect the amount of baseflow discharged to streams price 2011 rumsey et al 2015 climatic conditions such as precipitation and temperature affect baseflow by altering rates of evapotranspiration infiltration and recharge and the timing and rate of snowmelt runoff brutsaert 2005 tague and grant 2009 winograd et al 1998 barnhart et al 2016 in a study of sites across the u s ficklin et al 2016 found that recent trends in climate are related to changes in baseflow where increasing precipitation was linked to increasing baseflow and increasing potential evapotranspiration was related to decreasing baseflow snowmelt dynamics have also been shown to affect baseflow barnhart et al 2016 found that the rate of snowmelt affects streamflow production where faster snowmelt rates are related to higher baseflow generation efficiencies exact streamflow and baseflow responses to climate fluctuations will vary by region depending on the unique characteristics of each basin ficklin et al 2016 to begin to understand how streamflow components have responded to recent hydroclimatic trends in the upper rio grande basin urgb this study evaluates how changing precipitation and snow conditions affected baseflow total streamflow and hydrologic partitioning streamflow components included in this work are total streamflow the total amount of water in the stream hereafter referred to as streamflow baseflow water that travels through the subsurface before discharging to streams and runoff water that travels over the land surface before reaching the stream we assume that streamflow is equal to the combined volumes of baseflow and runoff hydrologic partitioning refers to the fraction of baseflow or runoff in a stream giving an indication of the dominant flow path water takes prior to reaching a given stream site our main focus is to explore how changing snow conditions related to streamflow components and hydrologic partitioning in the urgb specific study objectives were to 1 quantify baseflow and runoff contributions to streamflow in the snowmelt dominated region of the urgb 2 evaluate how trends in precipitation and snow related to trends in streamflow metrics over a multi decadal time scale during 1980 2015 and 3 understand how snowmelt rate and the form of precipitation relate to streamflow generation and hydrologic partitioning annually in the methodology section we describe how conductivity mass balance hydrograph separation was used to quantify baseflow runoff and hydrologic partitioning section 2 2 additionally we present the statistical methods used to conduct trend and correlation analyses of hydrologic and climatic variables section 2 3 the results and discussion section presents estimates of baseflow volume how it varies spatially and how it relates to watershed characteristics in the urgb a comparison of multi decadal trends in baseflow runoff streamflow and baseflow index to trends in annual precipitation peak snow water equivalent and snowmelt rate at each streamflow site an evaluation of seasonal trends for each streamflow component and finally an investigation of how streamflow generation relates to snowmelt rate and the form of precipitation in a given year in conclusions and implications we summarize key findings through this effort we determine the importance of baseflow for sustaining streamflow in the urgb assess how streamflow baseflow and precipitation have changed in relation to each other in recent decades and identify snow processes that affect streamflow and baseflow generation in the basin 2 methodology 2 1 study area the rio grande flows over 3000 km from southern colorado to the gulf of mexico llewellyn and vaddey 2013 the urgb as defined here includes the northernmost 550 km of the river extending from the headwaters in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains to the city of albuquerque in central new mexico the study area covers 38 250 km2 with elevations ranging from 1507 m at the streamgage at albuquerque to over 4372 m at blanca peak in the sangre de cristo mountains major tributaries to the rio grande include the rio chama the jemez river and the red river affinati and myers 2015 headwater inflows from the southern rocky mountains and the san luis valley form over 60 of the native inflow to the rio grande the rio chama and the jemez river contribute about 25 of the rio grande s streamflow llewellyn and vaddey 2013 physiography and climate are diverse in the urgb ranging from snow dominated mountains to arid intermontane valleys hearne and dewey 1988 precipitation varies with topography and latitude hearne and dewey 1988 where mean annual precipitation increases with altitude and decreases southward ellis et al 1993 the san juan mountains can receive over 150 cm of precipitation per year ortiz partida et al 2017 with the majority occurring as snow hearne and dewey 1988 in the spring snowmelt causes peak streamflows in april may and june pascolini campbell et al 2017 and is estimated to contribute 50 to 75 of the total streamflow in the rio grande rango 2006 robson and banta 1995 arid intermontane areas receive much less precipitation than the mountains e g the annual precipitation at albuquerque is roughly 20 cm 2010 2016 ortiz partida et al 2017 precipitation falling in mountainous areas is the primary source of recharge to the rio grande aquifer system with larger quantities of recharge occurring in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains robson and banta 1995 there is a close hydraulic connection between the river and subsurface aquifers and groundwater levels near the river affect streamflow in the rio grande and its tributaries during periods of high runoff groundwater recharge can occur but generally groundwater discharge to streams occurs along much of the length of the rio grande and its tributaries hearne and dewey 1988 robson and banta 1995 the rio grande is a net gaining stream from the headwaters to otowi bridge site 9 and becomes a net losing stream downstream of otowi bridge to albuquerque affinati and myers 2015 passell et al 2004 2 2 baseflow estimation to determine the importance of baseflow in streams in the urgb a conductivity mass balance cmb hydrograph separation approach was used to estimate daily and long term mean annual baseflow discharge following the methodology outlined in miller et al 2014 2015 and applied in rumsey et al 2015 this approach requires daily streamflow and daily specific conductance as inputs measured daily streamflow q and discrete specific conductance sc data were obtained from 17 u s geological survey usgs stream gages from the national water information system nwis database https waterdata usgs gov nwis data spanned water years wy 1980 2015 with periods of record varying from 5 to 36 years median length of record was 21 years due to data limitations data span different time periods at different gages to estimate daily and long term mean annual baseflow discharge q bf daily estimates of sc were required at each stream gage site using discrete sc data fluxmaster schwarz et al 2006 was used to estimate daily sc with four regression models table s1a supporting information si which calculated sc loads as a function of mean daily streamflow time and season for the calculation of long term mean annual baseflow estimation sc loads were detrended to a base year of 2000 for all sites and models to allow for comparison of loads among sites with differing periods of record sample sizes and temporal variability in discharge detrending provides estimates of sc that are independent of changes in climate or management by applying the environmental conditions of the base year to all years in the period of record schwarz et al 2006 estimated daily sc loads were subsequently converted to daily sc values µs cm for use in calculating baseflow discharge a second set of three fluxmaster regression models was used to estimate non detrended daily sc to estimate daily baseflow discharge for use in trend analyses trend analysis discussed in section 2 3 models listed in table s1b models were eliminated if estimated and observed loads differed by 15 percent the best fit regression model was selected as the model with the lowest akaike information criteria aicc value fluxmaster fit statistics provided in table s2 additional model information and outputs are provided in rumsey 2019 to ensure a robust estimation of baseflow discharge streamflow and sc at each site were required to meet criteria for cmb hydrograph separation miller et al 2014 rumsey et al 2015 which include 1 discharge must be inversely related to sc as described by a power function 2 there must be a snowmelt peak in the mean annual hydrograph defined as a peak in discharge due to melting snow during spring and early summer months that is roughly an order of magnitude greater than low flow conditions 3 sites must have a relatively large range of sc 100 µs cm and minimum sc values close to the runoff end member sc concentration defined below 4 the ranges of observed and modeled sc or q values must be similar see fig s1 in si for plots comparing observed and modeled sc and 5 stream gage sites must be at least 2 km downstream of reservoirs a detailed discussion of these criteria is included in rumsey et al 2015 this filtering process resulted in 17 sites with suitable data for baseflow estimation all sites are located in snowmelt dominated watersheds with drainage areas ranging from 94 km2 to 45 169 km2 additional site information in table s3 elevations range from 1509 to 2578 m above sea level with an average elevation of 2012 m it is important to note that the urgb is heavily regulated with dams and diversions and many of these gage sites are impacted by anthropogenic modifications to the natural hydrology three of the selected sites represent near native basins and include the rio grande at wagon wheel the rio chama near la puente and the jemez river near jemez estimating baseflow with cmb hydrograph separation has been shown to work well in snowmelt dominated watersheds and is compatible with regression derived daily sc miller et al 2014 2015 the method assumes there are two components to streamflow runoff and baseflow and that each source water has a distinct sc signature using cmb baseflow discharge is calculated from a mass balance equation pinder and jones 1969 1 q bf q s c sc ro sc bf sc ro where q bf is baseflow discharge q is the total stream discharge sc is specific conductance in the stream estimated from regression modeling sc ro is the sc of the runoff component of flow and sc bf is the sc of the baseflow component of flow long term mean annual baseflow discharge was calculated as the sum of mean daily baseflow discharge the baseflow index bfi was calculated as the sum of mean daily baseflow divided by the sum of mean daily streamflow 2 b f i m e a n d a i l y q b f m e a n d a i l y q sc bf represents all subsurface flow to streams integrating multiple groundwater flow paths time variable sc bf were estimated for the period of record by linearly interpolating between the 95th percentile of daily sc values for each year sc ro represents low sc water that discharges to streams from surface snowmelt runoff and is estimated to be 33 µs cm based on measurements made during snowmelt at high elevation watersheds in the headwaters of the upper colorado river basin miller et al 2014 although snowmelt sc can be as low as 5 to 10 µs cm sc ro represents meltwater runoff that has traveled to the stream and has a slightly higher sc value a sensitivity analysis in miller et al 2014 showed that using an sc ro of 10 µs cm yielded statistically equivalent baseflow estimates as using 33 µs cm since the geology of urgb headwaters is similar to the upper colorado it is assumed that the sc of runoff in the urgb is comparable note that three assumptions are used when applying the cmb method 1 no other sources of water except runoff and baseflow contribute to streamflow 2 sc ro does not change during the period of record and 3 sc ro and sc bf are significantly different from each other miller et al 2014 demonstrated that cmb hydrograph separation provides reasonable estimates of baseflow within these constraints for a more detailed discussion of model assumptions see miller et al 2014 the statistical uncertainty of q bf estimates was calculated by considering error from discharge measurements sc measurements fluxmaster regression modeling sc ro and sc bf the variability of sc measured as the coefficient of variation of sc measurements was also included these sources of error were propagated through each step of the analysis to quantify the coefficient of variation cov of detrended baseflow discharge the cov also known as relative standard deviation or relative error is error proportional to the magnitude of estimated loads mac berthouex and brown 2002 the uncertainty equation and derivations are provided in rumsey et al 2017 a principal component analysis pca was run on select watershed characteristics climate topography hydrologic disturbance and land cover variables to identify relations among these variables and estimated baseflow yield all watershed characteristic data were obtained from the gages ii dataset falcone 2011 input data were fourth root transformed to down weight the importance of variables with high absolute values and were standardized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one prior to running the pca pca was run using the primer package clarke and gorley 2006 2 3 trend analyses of streamflow baseflow and precipitation trend analyses were completed to determine whether changing precipitation and snow conditions were related to trends in streamflow baseflow or the hydrologic partitioning of runoff and baseflow i e bfi trends were estimated at streamgage sites with at least 10 years of estimated baseflow discharge only 12 out of the 17 sites where daily baseflow discharge was estimated met this criteria the median length of record for the 12 sites was 29 years ranging from 13 to 36 years only three sites represent near native conditions the remaining nine sites are affected by dams diversions and water withdrawals streamflow trends analyzed at affected sites will reflect changing climatic conditions and changes in water use and management over time unexplained variability in comparisons of trends in climate variables and streamflow components is expected to be due to anthropogenic or unaccounted for natural influences while an analysis of all hydrologic components would provide a comprehensive view of how streamflow components change in relation to various aspects of the hydrologic cycle this was beyond the scope of this work which was focused specifically on how changing precipitation and snow conditions affected streamflow components and hydrologic partitioning the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 was used to evaluate trends in annual and seasonal streamflow baseflow runoff and bfi using the rkt package marchetto 2017 in r r core team 2018 input streamflow and baseflow data were normalized to drainage area in order to obtain runoff values mm yr that could be directly compared to precipitation metrics trends are presented as slopes change year since there are different periods of record at each site and it would be inappropriate to compare absolute trends over inconsistent time periods four seasons were used to assess seasonal patterns fall october december winter january march spring april june and summer july september an adjustment was applied to all mann kendall test p values to remove autocorrelation using the zyp package bronaugh and werner 2013 in r input variables were log transformed prior to analysis to ensure constant variance with time helsel and hirsch 2002 daily measurements of precipitation and snow water equivalent swe were obtained from snowpack telemetry snotel stations in the urgb https www wcc nrcs usda gov snow snotel data allowed for the analysis of several precipitation metrics including peak swe maximum value recorded during the snow accumulation season cumulative precipitation on may 1 may 1p annual precipitation rain snow as recorded on september 30 annual p the percent of annual precipitation that fell as snow and snowmelt rate the percent of annual precipitation that fell as snow was calculated as peak swe divided by annual precipitation recorded on september 30 the snowmelt rate mm day is an estimate of how quickly the snowpack melted in a given year and was included to explore whether the rate of snowmelt which influences infiltration and water movement across the landscape affects streamflow and baseflow generation as suggested in barnhart et al 2016 the snowmelt rate was calculated as peak swe mm divided by the number of days it took to go from peak swe to zero swe to pair streamflow trends with precipitation trends snotel stations were assigned to streamgages if they were located within the delineated watershed of each streamgage see table s4 the period of record at each snotel station was trimmed to match the period of available baseflow discharge data available at each streamgage resulting in 14 snotel stations with periods of record that overlapped baseflow discharge data the average elevation at these 14 snotel stations was 3032 m ranging from 2560 to 3429 m table s4 the non parametric regional kendall test for trend was performed on the group of snotel stations within each streamgage watershed using the rkt package this test adds an increased power of trend detection because it combines trends from multiple stations helsel and frans 2006 all input variables were log transformed prior to analysis to ensure constant variance with time helsel and hirsch 2002 an adjustment for serial autocorrelation was applied to all regional kendall tests for trend using the rkt r package 2 4 interannual comparison of precipitation and streamflow variables to explore relations between precipitation streamflow generation and hydrologic partitioning annual values of snowmelt rate the percent of precipitation that fell as snow peak swe annual rainfall and annual precipitation were compared to annual streamflow volume baseflow volume and bfi for three near native sites in the urgb rio grande at wagon wheel the rio chama near la puente and the jemez river near jemez annual streamflow baseflow volumes were calculated as the sum of daily streamflow baseflow volumes annual rainfall was calculated as annual precipitation minus annual peak swe at each snotel station additionally runoff coefficients were compared to bfi to understand how hydrologic partitioning is related to high or low flow years runoff coefficients were calculated as annual streamflow in mm yr divided by annual precipitation mm yr and are used to quantify the amount of precipitation that becomes streamflow each year scatterplots and kendall s tau correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the strength of relations between precipitation and streamflow variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variation in baseflow estimated mean annual detrended baseflow discharge in the urgb ranged from 13 106 m3 yr to 933 106 m3 yr fig 1 table s5 baseflow volumes generally increased downstream with increasing drainage area however at the rio grande near lobatos co site 2 in fig 1 annual baseflow discharge was less than that observed at the most upstream site rio grande at wagon wheel site 1 even though the drainage area is nearly six times larger and is expected to be a net gaining reach hearne and dewey 1988 bexfield and anderholm 2010 the rio grande near lobatos site 2 is downstream of the san luis valley an extensive agricultural area that uses an average of over 1 billion m3 of rio grande water to irrigate over 500 000 acres bexfield and anderholm 2010 illustrating that water withdrawals may decrease baseflow volumes in the basin baseflow discharge increases from lobatos site 2 to otowi bridge site 9 where it receives inflow from the rio chama and several tributary streams draining the sangre de cristo mountains baseflow discharge decreases downstream of otowi bridge site 9 where the rio grande becomes a net losing stream affinati and myers 2015 passell et al 2004 water use occurs along the main stem of the rio grande from lobatos site 2 to albuquerque site 12 where it is used primarily for agriculture ellis et al 1993 the statistical uncertainty of baseflow estimates ranged from 10 to 39 with a median uncertainty of 22 table s5 while the baseflow estimates presented here represent actual conditions in the streams they may not be solely representative of natural processes that occur in watersheds but may be affected by various water management practices that occur in the basin it is possible that baseflow estimation at several sites is affected by irrigation return flows which occur upstream of the following sites rio grande near lobatos site 2 the rio chama near chamita site 8 and the rio grande near otowi bridge san felipe and albuquerque sites 9 10 and 12 langman and anderholm 2004 in the case of irrigation return flows transported via the subsurface the time variable baseflow end member 95th percentile of annual sc see eq 1 would account for increases in annual sc values due to irrigation therefore the annual estimate of baseflow is expected to be unaffected miller et al 2014 conversely baseflow may be overestimated if irrigation return flows with high sc are transported via surface runoff to streams where any water with sc 33 µs cm is considered to be baseflow additionally because the rio grande upstream of lobatos receives diversions from groundwater in the closed basin of the san luis valley dinatale water consultants 2015 baseflow estimates at the rio grande near lobatos are likely higher than what they would be without imports from the closed basin lastly it is important to note that the san juan chama project sjc project which is a transbasin diversion transporting water from the upper san juan basin into the rio chama basin affects streamflow and water quality at rio chama at chamita site 8 as well as from the rio grande at otowi to albuquerque sites 9 10 and 12 langman and anderholm 2004 for sites affected by the sjc project baseflow estimates represent processes occurring in the rio chama the rio grande and the imported water to assess the spatial variability of baseflow generation across the urgb baseflow yield was calculated as area normalized baseflow discharge baseflow yield in the urgb ranged from 8 3 mm yr to 154 mm yr with a median value of 38 mm yr fig 2 the highest baseflow yields occurred in high elevation streams draining the san juan mountains and the sangre de cristo mountains including the rio hondo near valdez 154 mm yr the rio grande at wagon wheel 99 mm yr and the rio chama near la puente 73 mm yr baseflow yields decreased longitudinally downstream for the rio chama this pattern is consistent with observations in the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 miller et al 2016 and is expected in largely unaltered systems baseflow yields followed a less consistent pattern along the rio grande main stem with the lowest yields observed along the main stem of the rio grande at lobatos 8 mm yr and near cerro nm 13 mm yr downstream of the san luis valley water use likely contributes to the lack of a consistent upstream downstream pattern in baseflow yield along the main stem of the rio grande the first and second axes of the pca accounted for 57 and 23 respectively of the variability in climate topography hydrologic disturbance and land use fig s2a and baseflow yield was positively correlated with axis 1 pca scores fig s2b the pca analysis indicates that more baseflow is generated in high elevation areas with steeper land slope higher precipitation small order streams and a higher percent evergreen forest areas with lower baseflow yield occur in basins with greater percent shrubland agriculture and pastureland higher temperatures larger order streams and a greater degree of hydrologic disturbance which is a metric based on the presence of several variables including for example the number of dams amount of water withdrawal and number of canals falcone 2011 fig s2a it is important to note that while the pca identifies variables that are correlated with baseflow yield it does not provide causative information rather results provide a useful screening tool that can be used in future analyses to identify specific drivers of observed spatial trends in baseflow yield comparing the mean annual baseflow generation efficiency mean annual baseflow yield divided by mean annual precipitation gages ii falcone 2011 to elevation across the urgb illustrates that a higher fraction of precipitation infiltrates and becomes baseflow at higher elevation sites as compared to lower elevation sites in the urgb on average 14 of precipitation becomes baseflow in basins with average elevations of 2990 3330 m highest 25 which is statistically greater p 0 05 than at the lowest elevations 2430 2580 m lowest 25 where only 7 of precipitation becomes baseflow increased water use along the main stem of the rio grande contributes to lower baseflow generation in lower elevation areas of the basin however with a few noted exceptions findings are generally similar to patterns observed in the upper colorado river basin where greater baseflow yield and baseflow generation occurred in high elevation regions with greater precipitation higher percent snow steeper slopes and a higher percentage of sandy soils rumsey et al 2015 other studies have also shown that greater amounts of precipitation infiltrate and become baseflow in steep high elevation areas winograd et al 1998 santhi et al 2008 miller et al 2016 the fraction of total streamflow that is estimated to be baseflow in a stream or the bfi provides a measure of the importance of groundwater discharge to total streamflow for these 17 sites in the urgb bfi ranged from 0 29 to 0 69 with a median bfi of 0 45 demonstrating that baseflow forms a large component of streamflow in the urgb fig s3 table s5 urgb bfi values are very similar to those observed in the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 where the median bfi was 0 48 also similar to findings in the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 miller et al 2016 a clear spatial pattern in bfi values occurs in the urgb where low bfis generally occur in high elevation tributary streams and high bfis occur in the most downstream sites along the main stem of the rio grande and the rio chama fig s3 this indicates that high elevation low discharge streams are dominated by runoff that occurs during the snowmelt season whereas larger downstream sites are mostly composed of baseflow discharge however liu et al 2008 found that baseflow discharge accounted for over 80 of streamflow in two small catchments of the valles caldera in the jemez mountains illustrating that baseflow can form large fractions of streamflow in some headwater areas overall mean annual baseflow estimates demonstrate that groundwater discharge to streams forms an important fraction median 0 45 range of 0 29 0 69 of total streamflow in the urgb high elevation areas of the urgb generated more baseflow per unit area and more baseflow per unit of precipitation than downstream areas highlighting the importance of baseflow generation in these regions tague and grant 2009 found that baseflow in high elevation areas may be affected by climatic changes that alter precipitation timing of snowmelt and temperature indicating that baseflow from high elevations in the urgb may be vulnerable to changing climatic conditions 3 2 trends in baseflow streamflow snow and precipitation downward trends in streamflow baseflow runoff snow and precipitation were observed at many of the 12 streams and watersheds during 1980 2015 table 1 and fig 3 observed decreasing trends are expected considering that analyses were conducted over a period with the strongest downward trends in precipitation and streamflow in over 400 years when streamflows were very high in the 1980s followed by some of the lowest flows in the early 2000s lehner et al 2017 however in this analysis we are less interested in absolute trends than we are in how streamflow components and hydroclimate change in relation to one another over time trends in total streamflow were almost always associated with trends in baseflow and runoff fig 3a c nine of the twelve 75 streams had statistically significant decreasing trends in streamflow ranging from 0 39 mm yr yr to 10 88 mm yr yr with a median trend of 0 65 mm yr yr eight of those nine sites also had statistically significant decreases in baseflow and runoff with median decreases of 0 37 mm yr yr and 0 26 mm yr yr for baseflow and runoff respectively no site had statistically significant increasing trends in streamflow baseflow or runoff while we may have expected limited change in baseflow due to its long flowpaths and transit times findings show that baseflow undergoes significant change over multi decadal timescales indicating that it is vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic changes occurring in the watershed the age of the baseflow is unknown and likely includes flowpaths ranging in age from days to decades however percent changes in baseflow were typically lower than percent changes in streamflow and runoff table 1 indicating that the baseflow was less responsive to multi decadal changes than runoff possibly due to the effects of older water contributing to the baseflow fraction of streamflow a comparison of standard deviations of interannual flow for streamflow components shows that baseflow is consistently less variable than streamflow and runoff from year to year fig s4 indicating that baseflow has a larger proportion of old water that is less sensitive to interannual climatic and anthropogenic change solder et al 2016 trends in bfi indicate whether the hydrologic partitioning of runoff and baseflow has changed with time three of the twelve 25 streams had statistically significant increasing trends in bfi ranging from 0 002 to 0 003 per year table 1 and fig 3d these streams also had statistically significant decreasing trends in baseflow runoff and streamflow at these three sites the bfi trends show that there was a higher fraction of baseflow during recent years that the runoff fraction of streamflow decreased more rapidly than baseflow over the period of record and that baseflow is becoming an increasingly important component of streamflow no statistically significant decreasing trends in bfi were observed to understand changes in streamflow components in the context of climatic variability streamflow trends were compared to the trends of several precipitation metrics table 1 and fig 3 statistically significant decreasing trends in annual precipitation were observed in four watersheds fig 3e ranging from 4 46 mm yr to 6 64 mm yr these watersheds also had significant decreasing trends in baseflow runoff and streamflow ficklin et al 2016 also observed consistent decreases in baseflow and runoff in the southwest from 1980 to 2010 and found that trends were related to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration only one watershed had statistically significant decreasing trends in may 1 precipitation 3 96 mm yr fig 3f and only two watersheds had statistically significant decreasing trends in peak swe 3 97 mm yr and 4 72 mm yr fig 3g there was no change in the percentage of annual precipitation that falls as snow for any site during the time periods analyzed fig 3h decreasing streamflow baseflow and runoff occurred more frequently with decreasing snowmelt rates than decreasing peak swe and precipitation six of the nine sites 75 with decreasing streamflow and six of the eight 86 sites with decreasing baseflow and runoff also had statistically significant decreases in snowmelt rate fig 3i decreasing snowmelt rates ranged from 0 10 to 0 22 mm day yr and occurred across the study area at sites on the rio grande rio chama and the jemez river indicating that snow is melting slower in the urgb significant increases in temperature were also observed at 9 of the 12 stream basins during these time periods table s6 and are a likely contributor to changing snowmelt rates this is consistent with findings from musselman et al 2017 who highlighted that slower snowmelt is projected to occur in a warmer world as a result of the snowmelt season contracting to a time of lower available energy under warmer conditions they suggest that less snow cover will occur during times of high energy fluxes i e spring and summer that are required to drive high snowmelt rates slower snowmelt rates are expected to affect snowmelt dominated watersheds like the urgb and may result in decreased streamflow production musselman et al 2017 in fact barnhart et al 2016 found that streamflow production in the southern rockies is sensitive to changes in snowmelt rate where slower snowmelt occurs with lower streamflow observed concurrent trends in streamflow and snowmelt rate indicate that snowmelt rate is an important process associated with changing streamflow and baseflow volumes in the urgb and requires further investigation see section 3 4 forest disturbances including bark beetle infestations and wildfires have occurred in recent decades in the urgb and may also have hydrologic implications affecting snowmelt infiltration streamflow and hydrologic partitioning doerr et al 2006 benson et al 2018 wildfires and bark beetle attacks remove or reduce the tree canopy leading to increases in snow accumulation and water yield as interception sublimation and evapotranspiration decrease pugh and gordon 2013 further as tree canopies lose needles and other woody material after forest disturbance snow albedo decreases and incoming solar radiation increases causing faster snowmelt rates pugh and gordon 2013 and potentially increased amounts of water infiltrated to the subsurface barnhart et al 2016 however no increases in streamflow baseflow or snowmelt rate were observed in the period of analysis of this study in the case of wildfire and depending on the severity of the fire infiltration of precipitation and snowmelt may be affected by increasing soil repellency and the plugging of soil pores with ash this leads to decreased infiltration capacity increased overland flow runoff and increased peak flows earles et al 2004 pugh and gordon 2013 as was observed after the cerro grande wildfire in 2000 earles et al 2004 and after the las cochas fire in 2011 dahm et al 2015 both of which occurred in the urgb increased runoff may also occur after a fire due to the removal of vegetation and litter doerr et al 2006 however no increases in runoff or in the fraction of runoff in the stream 1 bfi were detected in this study the fact that multi decadal trends analyzed here do not follow predicted hydrological patterns following disturbance suggests that the extent of forest disturbances in the urgb may not have been large enough to affect hydrologic processes at the regional scale hallema et al 2018 wine and cadol 2016 or that multi decadal trends 10 years estimated in this study may not capture the acute effects of forest disturbance where the hydrological effects occur within months to several years pugh and gordon 2013 while mann kendall trend tests used here accounted for increased uncertainty of trend results due to serial correlation they did not account for uncertainty that may occur due to scaling or longer term climatic variability hamed 2008 to test whether scaling was an issue for streamflow and precipitation variables in the urgb a modified mann kendall trend test that accounts for scaling was applied using the mannkendallltp function in the r package hkprocess tegos et al 2017 tyralis 2016 for streamflow baseflow and runoff uncertainty in the trend results increased when scaling was taken into account table s7 particularly for baseflow this is likely a result of the relatively short periods of record that were available for analysis which were constrained at each site by the availability of the baseflow record when the modified mann kendall trend test was applied to streamflow records spanning from 1980 to 2015 results show that total streamflow likely decreased during this time table s8 runoff also decreased at many sites even after accounting for scaling table s7 further using tree ring based reconstructions of streamflow since 1571 lehner et al 2017 found that the strongest 30 year declining trends in streamflow and runoff ratio in the entire four century record occurred from the early 1980s to the early 2000s in the upper rio grande thus we have confidence that the original mann kendall trend results for runoff and total streamflow table 1 are representative of patterns that occurred in the basin trends in baseflow are much more uncertain when scaling is accounted for and suggest that longer baseflow records are needed if data are available future trend analyses should utilize longer periods of baseflow record to verify the trends in baseflow presented here for precipitation metrics trend results accounting for scaling were very similar to those reported using the original mann kendall method table 1 giving us confidence that calculated trends are representative of patterns that occurred in the basin 3 3 seasonal trends of streamflow components to understand seasonal changes trends in streamflow baseflow and runoff were analyzed for winter january march spring april june summer july september and fall october december at 9 sites with statistically significant decreases in annual streamflow the largest decreases in streamflow baseflow and runoff discharge occurred in the spring season fig 4 a 43 to 83 of the estimated decrease in annual streamflow occurred in spring similarly 41 to 67 and 47 to 101 of the estimated decrease in annual baseflow and runoff respectively occurred in spring the second largest magnitude changes occurred in summer for streamflow and baseflow and in winter for runoff sites for which these patterns of change were observed include the near native basins of the jemez river near jemez and the rio chama near la puente there was no trend in annual streamflow at the rio grande at wagon wheel thus it was not included in the seasonal analysis where decreases in spring streamflow accounted for 66 and 83 of the decrease in annual streamflow respectively the large decreases in streamflow baseflow and runoff during spring indicate that conditions are changing during the snowmelt season and highlight the importance of this time period for generating streamflow it is important to note that streamflow baseflow and runoff peak during spring months driven by snowmelt runoff therefore there is the largest potential for change in discharge during this season when seasonal trends were evaluated relative to seasonal discharge fig 4b similar patterns emerged the greatest percent changes in seasonal streamflow components occurred in spring with median decreases of 2 4 2 1 and 3 1 for streamflow baseflow and runoff respectively in near native basins the largest percent decreases in streamflow and baseflow also occurred in spring the lowest percent change for all seasons occurred in the baseflow component of streamflow overall changes occurring in the snowmelt season dominated annual decreasing streamflow baseflow and runoff in the urgb in an analysis of streamflow trends and timing across the western u s stewart et al 2005 also observed widespread decreasing trends in streamflow from april to july months they estimated contributed 50 80 of the annual total in snowmelt dominated watersheds decreases in spring streamflow were largely attributed to a shift toward earlier snowmelt causing increased streamflows earlier in the year stewart et al 2005 slower snowmelt rates could also explain observed reductions in spring streamflow musselman et al 2017 in the urgb while significant changes in baseflow and streamflow volumes occurred in the snowmelt season only 2 3 of 12 stream sites had a statistically significant decrease in the number of days at which 50 of annual streamflow baseflow was measured at a gage that would indicate streamflow discharge is shifting to earlier in the year however chavarria and gutzler 2018 observed a shift toward earlier snowmelt in the rio grande upstream of lobatos from 1958 to 2015 showing that earlier runoff is occurring in the region others have also shown that earlier shifts in streamflow are occurring across the western united states regonda et al 2005 clow 2010 stewart et al 2005 barnett et al 2008 3 4 correlation between annual precipitation and streamflow variables to further understand how snowmelt rate and the form of precipitation relate to streamflow and hydrologic partitioning annual precipitation metrics were compared to annual cumulative streamflow and baseflow and to the bfi at three near native sites minimally affected by water withdrawals and other anthropogenic influences annual precipitation rain snow and peak swe were significantly correlated p 0 05 with streamflow baseflow and bfi at all three near native sites fig 5 table s9 indicating that total precipitation and snowfall amounts affect streamflow and baseflow volumes as well as hydrologic partitioning in a given year the amount of annual rainfall was not significantly correlated p 0 05 to annual streamflow baseflow or bfi at any site suggesting it is less important for generating streamflow at these sites higher percentages of precipitation falling as snow were related to increased streamflow and baseflow volumes at the rio grande at wagon wheel and the jemez river near jemez where there was a statistically significant positive correlation between streamflow baseflow volumes and percent snow fig 6 a table s9 there was no relation at the rio chama near la puente which differs from the two other sites in that it has higher estimated subsurface flow contact time faster infiltration rates falcone 2011 and it has a greater percentage of annual precipitation that is snow figure s5 suggesting that soil conditions allow for similar rates of infiltration of precipitation irrespective of precipitation form or it may not have reached a threshold where low annual percentages of snow begin to decrease streamflow and baseflow further investigation into rio chama basin characteristics and streamflow generation is needed to explain this discrepancy percent snow also relates to hydrologic partitioning where 2 out of 3 sites showed statistically significant negative correlations between percent snow and bfi that is years with higher percent snow occur in years with a higher fraction of runoff and a lower fraction of baseflow this temporal relationship is consistent with previously observed spatial relationships where sites at high elevations with more snow also had a consistently higher fraction of runoff overall a greater fraction of annual precipitation falling as snow relates to higher streamflow and baseflow volumes and also affects the hydrologic partitioning of water increasing the amount of water that enters a stream via surface runoff it is important to note that years with a greater percentage of snow often occur in years with high amounts of annual precipitation thus the observed correlations fig 6a are not solely due to the effect of snow but are also likely affected by annual precipitation for further evidence of the importance of snow linear regression models were generated to predict annual streamflow baseflow and runoff using percent snow and annual precipitation although annual precipitation explained most of the variability in annual streamflow models performed better in almost all cases when percent snow was used in conjunction with annual precipitation as a predictor variable table s10 providing additional evidence that snow as a form of precipitation is an important element for streamflow generation the rate at which snow melts off the land surface also relates to streamflow volumes and hydrologic partitioning fig 6b there was a statistically significant positive correlation between snowmelt rate and streamflow baseflow volumes in all cases except for baseflow at rio grande at wagon wheel table s9 years with higher streamflow and baseflow volumes occurred in years with faster snowmelt rates while streamflow and baseflow volumes were less in years with slow snowmelt rates snowmelt rates were also significantly p 0 05 correlated with peak swe and it was difficult to tease out the effect of peak swe from snowmelt rates however interannual correlations of snowmelt rates vs streamflow and baseflow are consistent with observed multi decadal trends which showed that the majority of sites with decreasing streamflow and baseflow discharge also had decreasing snowmelt rates snowmelt rate was also correlated to bfi with all near native sites having a statistically significant negative correlation years with a lower fraction of baseflow occurred in years with fast snowmelt rates and years with high fractions of baseflow occurred in years with slow snowmelt rates observations demonstrate that slower snowmelt rates are associated with lower streamflow and baseflow volumes and an increased fraction of baseflow in streams observed correlations are corroborated by previous modeling analyses showing that decreasing snowmelt rates reduce streamflow production barnhart et al 2016 found that snowmelt rate controlled streamflow production whereby snowmelt rates that exceed evapotranspiration deliver water to the soil column induce percolation and lead to subsurface flow that increases streamflow and baseflow generation efficiencies slower snowmelt rates result in increased partitioning to evapotranspiration as snow melts slowly on the landscape leading to lower streamflow production barnhart et al 2016 musselman et al 2017 also found that reductions in high snowmelt rates and an increase in slow snowmelt rates were associated with decreases in the total meltwater volume produced observed trends and relations between snowmelt rate baseflow runoff and streamflow in the urgb support the predictions and processes previously modeled by barnhart et al 2016 and musselman et al 2017 the effect of changing snowmelt rates and percent snow on hydrologic partitioning infers that the fraction of flow that is baseflow i e bfi increases as streamflow and baseflow decrease to test this directly the runoff coefficient annual streamflow yield annual precipitation was compared to bfi at each site for all three near native stream sites in the urgb there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the runoff coefficient and bfi fig 7 that is years with a high runoff coefficient occurred in years with a higher fraction of runoff while years with a low runoff coefficient occurred in years with a higher fraction of baseflow further high peak swe values typically occurred in years with a higher runoff coefficient a characteristic also observed by lehner et al 2017 who found that high runoff coefficients required higher than average precipitation in the urgb these observations illustrate that when the runoff coefficient is high there is typically a greater amount of snow and a higher fraction of water enters the stream as runoff during years with a low runoff coefficient and lower amounts of snow baseflow sustains a greater fraction of streamflow snow and the rate of snowmelt are key factors producing streamflow and dictating hydrologic partitioning in the west hammond et al 2018 barnhart et al 2016 in this study we have identified that changes in snow and snowmelt processes relate to changing streamflow components and their hydrologic partitioning in the urgb the melting of snow is a slower and longer process than rainfall and it allows water to more readily infiltrate into the subsurface stephenson and freeze 1974 where it contributes to the baseflow that sustains streamflow miller et al 2016 however if snowmelt rates become too slow hydrologic connectivity between subsurface and surface flow may decline as a result of increased loss to evapotranspiration decreased water delivered to the soil column and its inability to overcome the field capacity musselman et al 2017 barnhart et al 2016 this will affect streamflow generation as large amounts of snowmelt reach streams via the subsurface barnhart et al 2016 stephenson and freeze 1974 4 conclusions and implications in this study we investigate the effects of changing hydroclimate on streamflow baseflow and hydrologic partitioning baseflow or groundwater discharge to streams forms a significant percentage of total streamflow in the urgb accounting for an average of 49 of streamflow upstream of albuquerque nm consistent decreases in streamflow baseflow and runoff were observed during 1980 to 2015 and occurred more frequently with decreases in snowmelt rate than with decreases in peak swe or annual precipitation the largest decreases for all streamflow components occurred during the snowmelt season illustrating that processes and conditions during spring months have a large impact on annual streamflow and its components snowmelt rate and the percent of precipitation falling as snow also relate to hydrologic partitioning and streamflow generation in the urgb on annual time steps where slower snowmelt rates and lower percentages of snow are associated with decreased streamflow and baseflow volumes and a higher fraction of baseflow in streams the mann kendall trend test applied here indicates that significant declines in baseflow volume occurred during 1980 2015 suggesting that baseflow is vulnerable to changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions that occur over multi decadal time scales ficklin et al 2016 however application of a modified mann kendall trend test that considers the effects of scaling indicates that longer baseflow records may be needed to verify that these multi decadal trends are not an artifact of short periods of record future trend analyses that can use longer periods of baseflow record should be conducted to verify the baseflow trends presented here future projections of climate indicate that temperatures will continue to increase in the urgb which will likely cause decreases in water availability earlier snowmelt runoffs and slower snowmelt in the basin llewellyn and vaddey 2013 musselman et al 2017 barnhart et al 2016 if observed relations between snow processes and streamflow continue in the future results indicate that streamflow and baseflow volumes will decline and that baseflow will become a larger fraction of streamflow as we move toward a warmer world with a higher fraction of rain and earlier snowmelt timing streamflow production will depend on whether the rate of water delivery exceeds the rate of evaporative loss to the atmosphere barnhart et al 2016 and whether the rate of water delivery allows for infiltration and transport in the subsurface stephenson and freeze 1974 findings from this study help to advance the understanding of the hydrologic system in the urgb as well as inform the impacts that climate fluctuations may have on water supply and water budgets by understanding how streamflow components change in relation to each other and in response to climate water managers will be better equipped to address issues that are important to communities and

5677,this study evaluates the performance of iowa flood center s real time distributed hydrologic model hillslope link model hlm the hlm provides information about current and future streamflow conditions for over 1000 locations in iowa including small communities and stream gauge locations the hlm uses a calibration free approach in which a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations represents the processes of rainfall to runoff translation as well as the transport of water in the river network the authors developed a comprehensive evaluation framework to improve the model performance through modification of its structure and not by parameter calibration the authors explored modifications to the runoff generation modeling and to the approach for routing water in channels model performance was assessed using different metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge mean absolute error of river stages mae percent bias pb annual peak difference ratio of hits misses and false alarms and timing difference the inclusion of an interflow component alleviated problems of volume underestimation timing of model simulations was found to be more accurate when the routing component considered the channel stream order in the study effect of rainfall input on the model performance was verified with stage iv which includes bias adjustment using gauge information and a radar rainfall product created in real time by ifc without bias correction open loop simulations obtained with stage iv and ifc rainfall show similar performance out of all the simulations obtained with stage iv 88 have nse 0 95 have kge 0 65 have mae 1 foot 83 have pb 40 35 have hit rate 40 average peak estimation errors are below 5 at large basins and below 20 at small basins and the average timing difference is smaller than three hours the characteristics of landforms and the impact of agricultural practices in the region are related to the spatial distribution of model performance the study provides the basis for future improvements of the model keywords hlm performance floods interflow routing stage iv iowa 1 introduction the iowa flood center ifc was established by state of iowa legislators in 2009 after the severe floods in 2008 budikova et al 2010 gupta et al 2010 smith et al 2013 the main purpose of the center is to provide the general public in iowa with information that helps mitigate the devastating effect of floods and to the best of the authors knowledge is the only academic institution in the united states providing real time flood forecasting at state level as part of this effort the ifc developed a real time hydrologic model that makes streamflow predictions every 15 min for well over 1000 locations including small communities and stream gauge locations krajewski et al 2017 streamflow predictions at gauges with available rating curves are converted into stages which can be easier to interpret than discharge values at small communities the model streamflow predictions are transformed into a potential flood index quintero et al 2020 while at larger communities where inundation maps have been precalculated stage estimates are transformed into the corresponding inundation map the continuous rainfall runoff model is called hlm hillslope link model and has roots in the scaling studies of river networks and water transport therein gupta et al 2010 maritan et al 1996 rodriguez iturbe et al 2008 following mantilla et al 2006 the model uses hillslopes and channel links as the primary units for landscape decomposition where hydrologic processes are modeled major components of the ifc s real time flood forecasting system include rainfall and evapotranspiration inputs and the hlm with streamflow routing rainfall conversion to runoff is modeled through soil moisture accounting at hillslopes channel routing is based on a non linear representation of water velocity that considers the discharge amount as well as the upstream drainage area ghimire et al 2018 gupta et al 2010 mathematically the model represents a large system of ordinary differential equations organized following river network topology the ifc also developed an efficient numerical solver suitable for high performance computing architecture with variable step size using an error control structure small et al 2013 several recent studies demonstrated various capabilities of the model ayalew et al 2014 ayalew and krajewski 2017 cunha et al 2012 elsaadani and krajewski 2017 quintero et al 2016 all information generated by the model execution is communicated to the general public through a browser based comprehensive and interactive platform called iowa flood information system demir and krajewski 2013 krajewski et al 2017 the ifc began using the model operationally in real time in 2012 providing streamflow forecasts for up to the next ten days the main driver of the system is a radar derived composite rain rate map with time and space resolutions of five minutes and approximately 500 m respectively the ifc quantitative precipitation estimation qpe algorithms include polarimetric data based quality control seo and krajewski 2015 seo et al 2015b rain rate conversion using nexrad reflectivity rain rate relation and correction for radar temporal sampling error seo and krajewski 2015 rain gauge correction is not yet implemented in the algorithms as there is no uniform coverage of the state by high quality rain gauge networks rainfall input is in fact one of the main uncertainty sources of the model predictions radar rainfall estimates are often affected by a number of uncertainty factors hunter 1996 villarini and krajewski 2010 accurate rainfall estimation requires corrections for multiple error sources including ground clutter hubbert et al 2009 range effect due to variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity vignal et al 2003 overall bias smith and krajewski 1991 steiner et al 1999 among others it is well recognized that uncertainties in rainfall input propagate through hydrologic simulations hossain et al 2004 quintero et al 2012 and thus have significant impacts on hydrologic predictions berne and krajewski 2013 borga 2002 krajewski and smith 2002 this paper presents a thorough evaluation of the performance of hlm that considers long term datasets of rainfall observations and evaluation of results using streamflow observations at hundreds of locations the authors plan this paper will be the first of a series reporting hlm performance improvements performance is examined in an open loop simulation mode assuming that observed rainfall is always known but subject to the typical estimation uncertainty therefore the results we obtained from this long term simulations are not directly comparable to those generated in a real time forecasting mode for multiple lead times e g zalenski et al 2017 we focus the attention on the errors generated by different model structures and use simulation instead of forecasting while krajewski et al 2017 reported preliminary evaluation results for multiple years this study further extends the analysis period and performs a more comprehensive evaluation using a variety of performance metrics this offers insightful understanding about overall performance of the hlm as well as details that are relevant to the problem of flood prediction such as errors in peak estimation and timing of the rising limb we discuss the linkage between performance and the characteristics of the landscape in localized regions of the state and how the evaluation results can be used to orient improvements in our hydrologic modelling effort the study also proposes changes in the model structure to include processes that were not considered in the original krajewski et al 2017 version and are important in iowa the inclusion of an interflow component that resembles the function of tile drainage and a modification to the routing component that considers the stream order of each channel we explain in detail the changes in the model structure and their influence on the model performance there are several other factors that can impact the model performance for narrowing our research we did not include them in this paper but it is in our agenda to report their effect these include among others a the errors in the initialization of the hydrologic state variables e g soil moisture and groundwater storage b the contribution from data assimilation c the impact of radar rainfall products with bias correction and dual polarization capabilities we used two different rainfall products to test the sensitivity of the hydrologic simulations to rainfall inputs our in house product obtained in real time here called ifc rainfall which is a radar only product without any correction using rain gauges and stage iv lin and mitchell 2005 that is known as unbiased but contains not only correction based on rain gauge data but also human operator s experience it is not available in real time the performance evaluation includes examining the effect of the model input we conduct retrospective hlm simulations between 2009 and 2016 the simulations have temporal resolution of 15 min and are compared to discharge observations with the same resolution the evaluation is done at about 150 locations in iowa where streamflow observations from usgs are available observations at many of these locations are affected by human activities such as artificial diversions storage and other activities in the drainage basin that affect the natural flow of watercourse those locations impose a challenge to the ifc plan of developing a model with good performance for iowa literature provides the basis for defining the metrics that are used for evaluation of hydrologic model performance smith et al 2012 2004 present the results of the distributed model intercomparison project dmip a framework to analyze the performance of different model structures in testbed basins over the united states comparing to the number of studies available in hydrologic modeling relatively few literature studies have explored systematically the performance of hydrologic models in extended regions e g entire state considering a wide range of basin size most hydrologic studies focus in detail on a small number of watersheds providing comprehensive but highly local insights and may be limited in their ability to inform general hydrologic concepts applicable across regions gupta et al 2014 newman et al 2015 notable exception is zhang et al 2012 who evaluated the performance of hl rdhm model in 63 basins located in oklahoma arkansas and missouri with sizes ranging from 37 km2 to 2484 km2 knowledge about the performance of other hydrologic models in the state of iowa is obviously more limited green et al 2006 checked the performance of daily simulations obtained with swat model between 1995 and 2004 in south fork watershed in iowa salas et al 2017 reported the performance of the model used by national water center across the continental united states over a short simulation period of three months in summer of 2015 newman et al 2015 developed a hydro meteorological dataset for the contiguous united states using the sac sma model and included hydrologic model performance evaluation at 671 basins six of them located in iowa 2 incremental improvements in model structure accurate streamflow simulations in all communities within the state require a continuous evaluation effort and application of sequential improvements to the model to achieve this the natural and artificial features that control the hydrologic processes in iowa must be considered we note that it is difficult to create a unique model that can handle all the different aspects that govern water dynamics in iowa watersheds one way to improve the model performance is to define a model structure and find the most adequate set of model parameter that minimizes the differences between simulated and observed discharge at each basin however we consider this approach to obscure the understanding of the hydrologic system and that the parameters derived from model calibration compensate for the errors in the model inputs and modeling processes we promote the view that the key model components including the rainfall input should be evaluated on their own merit separately from the other ones the approach proposed in this study is based on identifying the particular processes that control the hydrologic regime in different regions of iowa and modeling them by applying sequential changes to the model structure only when structural changes result in better performance the hlm model is updated see fig 3 changes to model structure have no effect in compensating for precipitation input errors in this study we examine the performance of the original hlm configuration e g krajewski et al 2017 and propose two updates in the structure aiming to gain better representation of the relevant hydrologic processes which leads to our better understanding of water transport in the region 2 1 original hlm structure hlm builds on the concept of the landscape decomposition into hillslopes and channels mantilla and gupta 2005 and allows for flexible structure and the representation of the physical processes of runoff generation and water transport these processes include initial abstraction infiltration overland flow percolation base flow and channel routing the model is calibration free i e a common configuration of parameters determined a priori applies for all the model inputs and no adjustments are made for particular basins a representation of the model structure is shown in fig 1 it consists of four water storage components for every hillslope link channel flow q t m 3 s 1 water ponded on hillslope surface s p t m effective water depth in the top soil layer s t t m and effective water depth in hillslope subsurface s s t m the mass conservation equations of the water storages are defined in terms of ordinary differential equations in the original model configuration flow components contributing to streamflow in the channel are the overland flow coming from the water ponded on hillslope surface q pc and the baseflow coming from water stored in the hillslope subsurface q sc we solve the set of differential equations describing change in water storages and discharge using a modern parallelized implementation of numerical runge kutta methods small et al 2013 details about the hlm equations and their configuration are documented in quintero et al 2016 according to the original model the velocity of flow at channel link in the network is a power law function of the form 1 v t v 0 q t λ 1 a λ 2 where exponents λ 1 and λ 2 are related to the nonlinearity of flow velocity that is denoted as a function of discharge and drainage area the key advantage of this formulation is that as the model moves water along the river network the two predictors are always know the discharge coming from the upstream and obtained through aggregation of by the branching structure of the river network and the upstream area one of the attributes of the channel links the water moves faster for higher flows moderated by the increase of the drainage area the v0 corresponds to the unit area discharge values of v 0 and λ 1 and λ 2 were obtained by fitting the observed pairs of discharge velocity data collected periodically by usgs at about 132 stations across the entire state for over 50 years the concept of downstream change of velocity in rivers is taken into account implicitly in the hlm routing by linking discharge and upstream area into the hlm formulation while ghimire et al 2018 extensively explored this model formulation by considering various basins separately the original model used a fixed set of the values of v 0 and λ 1 and λ 2 2 2 inclusion of an interflow component in iowa there are significant number of tiling drainage systems installed by farmers to increase the yields the tiles artificially drain the water excess stored in the upper layer of soil below to the surface tiling systems affect the timing of delivery of water to streams and increase the amount of runoff that contributes to the system guan et al 2011 we modified the structure of the original model and included a component that produces flow from the upper layer of soil that goes directly into the channel this flow component resembles the tile drainage interflow the equation of the flow component is given by 2 q tc k tc s t where q tc is the flow from the upper layer of soil to the channel s t is the water stored in soil and k tc is a linear reservoir coefficient controlling the flow rate the rate is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the upper layer of soil topography root depth and the amount of water that is stored in the soil pores the hydrologic response of the interflow component should be slower than the response of surface flow but faster than the flow component originated in the groundwater storage 2 3 modification of the routing component the hlm original routing structure shown in eq 1 uses the same values of v 0 λ 1 and λ 2 for all the channels despite the observation by leopold 1953 that velocity scales with stream order since stream order is also known as the model moves water over the network one can replace the dependence on the drainage area with that on the stream order without losing the convenience of the model formulation we examined a modification to the routing component where the parameters are obtained by previously classifying the discharge velocity data according to the horton strahler order ω of the channel the classification leads to the routing models for each stream order ω of the form 3 v t v 0 ω q t λ 1 ω fig 4 shows the regressions derived for each stream order based on the observed streamflow velocity data differences in the regression for stream order 2 respect to the others might be explained by the lack of available of data using multiple routing models instead of a single model representative of all the data reduces the uncertainty of the estimation of velocity based on discharge we implemented these routing models into hlm and examined the effect on the model performance the values found for v 0 and λ 1 for each stream order are shown in table 3 2 4 model runs hlm was used to produce discharge simulations with 15 min temporal resolution between 2009 and 2016 both included simulations are run for each year during the warm season i e from april 1st to december 1st which corresponds to the period when most flooding occurs in iowa villarini et al 2011 initial conditions for each year are obtained with model spin up starting january 1st of each year using stage iv we also evaluate and compare the hlm performance for the different rainfall inputs of the stage iv and ifc products the model produces discharge simulations at every channel of the drainage network the results of the simulations are stored for those channels where discharge observations are available 3 data 3 1 study area the study domain includes all iowa basins that drain into the mississippi and missouri rivers the state s surface area is about 145 700 km2 and the population of about 3 134 000 inhabitants one third of them living in rural areas the landscape is predominantly agricultural characterized by low relief fertile soils and high drainage density and thus numerous rivers prior 1991 the combination of the characteristics of its landscape together with significant rainfall during the summer months makes the state prone to the occurrence of floods since 1953 fifty four 54 out of fifty nine 59 presidential disaster declarations in iowa have been related to floods iowa homeland security and emergency management 2018 the mission of developing a hydrologic model that provides accurate predictions over all the state is challenged by the heterogeneity of its land use topography and hydrogeology despite the popular notion that all iowa is flat iowa s landscapes are remarkably diverse fig 2 shows seven topographic regions of the state that are distinguished based on the characteristics of terrain table 1 some features that are of special interest for the problem of hydrologic modeling include 1 the absence of a well connected drainage system over the des moines lobe and 2 the steep relief of the loess hills in western iowa in contrast with the plain terrain predominant in the rest of the state besides the heterogeneities of the drainage system caused by natural properties of terrain there are alterations caused by agricultural practice including the installation of tiling drainage systems and river channelization the tiling artificially drains the water excess stored in the upper layer of soil below to the surface increasing the amount of flow that contributes to the system the hlm requires a decomposition of the landscape to delineate the drainage network for all basins our current implementation uses a river network derived from at 90 m dem the resulting network is made of about 420 000 pairs of hillslopes and channel links the average area of the hillslopes is 0 4 km2 and the average length of the channels is about 700 m quintero and krajewski 2018 3 2 observed discharge data there are some 150 active usgs stream gauges with discharge data available we used data from these stations reporting streamflow in the period between 2009 and 2016 the stations are spread across the state and they cover upstream areas ranging between 10 km2 and 30 000 km2 this study does not include the stream stage data of the network of more than 250 bridge mounted ultrasonic sensors deployed by ifc kruger et al 2016 because they lack rating curves 3 3 rainfall and evapotranspiration data we used two radar based composite rainfall products in this study the ifc and stage iv products the ifc product is the nexrad composite of seven s band weather radars covering the entire state of iowa seo et al 2015a 2018 seo and krajewski 2015 the product used in this study has not benefitted from dual polarization capability because the nws upgrade of dual polarization for the seven radars covering iowa was completed in the spring of 2013 the ifc rainfall estimates are available at 5 min time resolution and a spatial resolution of 0 004 decimal degrees approximately 0 4 0 5 km the radar product has not been adjusted with rain gauges data due to lack of adequate state wide automatic rain gauge network stage iv is a national mosaic derived from the hourly multi sensor radar and rain gauges precipitation estimates with some manual quality controls lin and mitchell 2005 the regional analyses produced by the river forecast centers rfcs are merged and the national coverage of precipitation estimates is distributed by the national center for environmental prediction ncep for the evapotranspiration et estimates our study uses climatology based on 12 years of north american land data assimilation system mitchell et al 2004 this approach captures the seasonal effects but fails to account for year to year and day to day variability the ifc is working on a more time and place specific et estimation method krajewski et al 2017 for the current operational real time mode the ifc generates hourly et product using outputs from high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model benjamin et al 2015 however those et estimates are not available for the period of the retrospective analysis as the hrrr came on line in 2015 4 evaluation methodology we used a standard set of metrics in this study to measure model performance paying special attention to characteristics of the model that are desirable for an accurate flood forecasting system nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is traditionally used to evaluate hydrologic model simulations nse is defined as 4 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where s i is the simulated discharge for each time step i o i is the observed value n is the total number of values within the time period of analysis nse is the ratio of the residual variance to the initial or no model variance and it represents the proportion of the initial variance explained by the model values of nse vary from negative infinity to 1 0 values closer to 1 0 indicate good agreement while negative values of nse indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model kling gupta efficiency kge is an alternative metric that was proposed to improve nse s deficiency that the optimal reference is given by the observed mean details can be found in gupta et al 2009 kge is calculated using the correlation and the ratios of mean and standard deviation of simulated and observed streamflow as 5 kge 1 ρ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where ρ α and β denote correlation the ratio of standard deviation σ s σ o and the ratio of mean μ s μ o between simulated and observed streamflow respectively similar to nse kge values close to 1 implies an optimal estimation mean absolute error hydrologic models are traditionally evaluated in terms of differences of simulated and observed discharge however from a practical point of view operational hydrologic forecasting is more helpful to general public and emergency managers when they are provided in terms of river stages we converted observations and simulations of discharge to river stages using the gauge rating curve and calculated mean absolute errors mae in centimeters using the equation 6 mae i 1 n s r s i ors i n where sr s i and or s i are the simulated and observed river stages for each time step i and n is the total number of observations the most recent rating curve for each gauge was used to map discharge to stages because historical rating curves are not publicly available we acknowledge there is uncertainty of the rating curves for accurate estimates especially for high flow values where the rating curve has fewer stage discharge measurements this source of error is important and deserves careful evaluation in future studies we omitted it to avoid extending the paper percent bias the percent bias pb measures the difference in volume of the simulated hydrograph with respect to the observed discharge volume it is obtained as 7 pb i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 where positive bias indicates model discharge overestimation and negative bias indicates volume underestimation hits misses and false alarms ratio we accounted the number of times where simultaneously observed discharge and model predictions exceeded a flood threshold level we used as threshold the flood stage of the national weather service nws at each gauge location https www weather gov aprfc terminology we counted the number of instances of a b c and d of the contingency table shown in table 2 the hit rate is the fraction of observed events that is predicted correctly and is calculated as 8 h a a c ranging from 0 at the poor end to 1 at the good end miss rate is calculated as 9 m 1 h false alarms ratio counts the number of times where model predictions are over the threshold but observations are not and is calculated as 10 f b a b timing difference accurate hydrologic predictions requires that the model have skill in predicting the time where discharge increases and reaches peak levels model predictions with correct timing are very helpful to emergency responders it is of special interest for flood forecasting having an accurate prediction of the time where risings limbs and top discharge of individual events occur we evaluated differences in time between observed and simulated features of the full hydrograph not only of the peak of the simulations we calculated the errors in timing of the model by finding the time shifting that when applied to the simulated hydrographs maximizes the correlation with observations time shifts where applied in steps of 15 min positive timing errors indicate that model simulations are late with respect to observations and negative errors indicate that model features occur earlier than observations differences in annual peaks we examined the accuracy of the model to predict correctly the annual maximum discharge at each gauge annual maximum has a special meaning as this represents the worst case scenario for a given year it is also very easy to find searching through the observed and predicted time series accurate peak prediction of the model result in a helpful tool for extrapolating flood frequency analysis where observations might not be available we compared the annual maximum values of simulations and observations the relative peak difference is obtained as 11 pd s p o p o p where s p is the simulated annual peak and o p is the observed annual peak 5 results 5 1 performance of the hlm original configuration this subsection shows the results of the metrics described previously each metric is evaluated for the simulations derived from stage iv and ifc rainfall the metrics are described in four ways 1 maps showing the annual averages obtained at every station 2 histograms showing fractions for the ranges of the metric values 3 box and whisker plots showing the relation between drainage area and the metric values obtained at each site and 4 histograms showing the average values obtained year to year 5 1 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency maps in fig 5 show higher values of nse in eastern and central iowa and lower nse values in western iowa the histogram with the distribution of nse values shows that higher nse values are obtained with stage iv nse increases with drainage area for all the analyzed years the median of nse obtained using stage iv is larger than the one obtained using the ifc estimates the higher average nse values were obtained at the iowa river and maquoketa river basins ranging between 0 6 and 0 7 the lower annual average nse values were obtained at two locations in little sioux river and soldier river in western iowa with values ranging between 0 6 and 0 9 upon closer examination of the results at little sioux river and soldier river we found that the model of the drainage network used by hlm at this particular basins differs from the actual path of the river which has been substantially altered artificially for irrigation purposes the differences in the model network affect the amounts of modeled streamflow at the gauges for evaluation considering the definition of nse the model is a better predictor of streamflow than the observed mean discharge i e nse 0 in 88 of the simulations when using the stage iv forcing and in 69 of the simulations when using ifc rainfall 5 1 2 kling gupta efficiency results obtained for kge in fig 6 agree with what we found for nse the model performs best at eastern and central iowa whereas lower values of kge were obtained at the tributaries of the missouri river in western iowa this is even more visible when using ifc rainfall compared to stage iv which is also an indicator of the differences between both rainfall products the histograms show that the bulk of the distribution narrows between kge values of 0 2 and 0 8 with a flatter distribution obtained for ifc rainfall similar to nse kge increases with drainage area the higher annual average values where obtained during 2013 a year where numerous flood events affected iowa 5 1 3 mean absolute error the outputs of the model were analyzed in terms of differences in river stage compared to observations in fig 7 maps do not show spatial patterns where mae values are lower or higher mae values increase with drainage area of the basins smaller mae are obtained at basins with drainage areas smaller than 100 km2 most common mae are smaller than 1 foot 30 5 cm with both rainfall products the number of simulations with mae less than one foot is greater when using stage iv compared to using the ifc product averaged mae did not exceed one foot along the analyzed years from an operational river forecasting perspective errors smaller than one foot can be very helpful to support river stage predictions in an automated hydrologic modeling system e g zalenski et al 2017 5 1 4 percentage bias the maps in fig 8 show patterns of volume underestimation around eastern iowa and overestimation in the tributaries to the missouri river in western iowa with ifc rainfall sites scattered across all the state exhibit larger positive and negative biases compared to stage iv the histograms show differences in the statistical distribution of bias values with stage iv most of the bias values are within the range 0 to 40 whereas with ifc rainfall there is a larger number of simulations with negative bias overall it is fair to state that the hlm tends to underestimate runoff estimates the bias values do not exhibit a clear relation with the drainage area the year to year comparison of average values shows large differences between both rainfall products 5 1 5 timing results of fig 9 indicate that timing is not related strongly with rainfall input maps show that timing obtained with the model is similar using any of the rainfall products model simulations are late compared to observations especially in southwestern iowa at the nishnabotna river western iowa watersheds have rapid surface runoff response due to the steep slopes and low permeability because of the terrain characteristics of the loess hills landform problems with timing of the simulations can be due to misconfiguration of the model which is set to reproduce surface flow velocity from low relief terrain the histogram of timing values is also similar for both rainfall products most of the simulations are late between zero and three hours there is strong relation between timing and increase of the drainage area the deviation of timing tends to be bigger at larger basins as would be expected due to the physics of the water movement across the rivers the spread of differences in timing is smaller for catchments between 10 km2 and 1000 km2 probably due to the short travel time in basins with drainage areas greater than 1000 km2 the timing increases for scales between thousands and tens of thousands km2 the timing differences can be up to 48 h at some catchments 5 1 6 hits misses and false alarms the first row of maps in fig 10 shows the spatial variability of the hit rate the hit rate does not depend strongly on rainfall forcing the model has ability to capture the occurrence of flood events across the state especially in eastern iowa along the entire iowa river basin and in northwestern iowa however one can see from the maps of the second row that there are several locations where miss rate is high meaning that the model does not produce enough discharge simulations above flood level when they are observed high miss rates are frequent in basins of western iowa and central iowa along the raccoon river basin several occurrences of high miss rates are due to problems with the ability of the model to reproduce the hydrograph recession at some locations although the model simulates accurately the rising limb of the hydrograph and its peak the recession occurs faster than what is observed in the streamflow data during flood events this implies that after the occurrence of the peak discharge the model simulations decrease too quickly compared to observed streamflow causing that the predictions miss portions of the flood event high values of miss rates are also due occasionally to rainfall underestimation the occurrence of false alarms is shown in the third row of fig 10 the annual average false alarms of the model are smaller than 1 fig 11 the figure shows that there are more occurrences of false alarms when using ifc rainfall than with stage iv there is relation between the occurrence of false alarms and the drainage area of the basin exists 5 1 7 peak differences fig 12 compares the observed and simulated maximum annual peaks the peaks that do not coincide with observations in a temporal window of 48 h were excluded from the analysis in order to compare peaks produced in the same rainfall events the histograms show that most of the times peaks are slightly underestimated between 20 and 40 with stage iv and with ifc rainfall between 0 and 20 with ifc rainfall however about 15 of the simulations produced peak flows that doubled the observed peak the map shows that these peak overestimates are mostly focused in the upper part of the des moines river and the little sioux river which could indicate problems of the configuration of the hydrologic model in this basin and or problems with radar rainfall estimation in the northwestern part of the state with both rainfall inputs the skill in peak flow estimation increases with the increase of catchment area the median of the peak difference is close to zero at basins larger than 10 000 km2 and the peak difference deviation is small as upstream area decreases the deviation of the peak difference tends to increase the coefficient of determination of the linear regression obtained with stage iv is 0 82 and is higher than the value of 0 76 obtained with ifc rainfall forcing in both cases it can be stated that the model is a good predictor of the observed annual maxima at spatial scales larger than 100 km2 5 2 factors affecting the model performance overall the metrics exhibit good model performance especially in the gauges located over the iowan surface the paleozoic plateau the northwestern iowa plains and the southern iowa drift plain see fig 2 the design of the original hlm model structure was intended to reproduce runoff generation and transport in hillslopes and channels with terrain characteristics of these landforms see table 1 examples of hydrographs located on those landforms are shown in fig 13 for clear creek near coralville cedar river at charles city and cedar river at vinton smaller basins are more sensitive to errors in precipitation estimates and exhibit lower performance the performance increases with basin size due to the averaging of inputs and modeling errors the areas the model showed lower performance require a careful analysis that considers what particularities dominate the hydrologic response of the areas we provide some discussion about how performance of hlm is related to natural terrain characteristics and human alterations of the landscape when examining all the metrics analyzed in this study it can be seen that the lower performance of the model is obtained at gauges located over the des moines lobe and the loess hills landforms examples of performance at those landforms are shown in fig 14 for des moines river at emmetsburg and des moines river near stratford hydrologic regime in the des moines lobe is particularly difficult to simulate unless the model structure is adapted to replicate its particular terrain characteristics such as the threshold based connectivity of the drainage network and the infiltration processes at the glacial drift a similar idea applies with the characteristics of the basins over the loess hills although drainage network is well defined in this landform some problems arise when resembling the flow velocity at the surface of the hillslopes and in the channels the steep slopes of the terrain produce a very fast response different from what the model is configured to replicate the rest of the state in terrain with low relief terrain on the other hand agricultural practices in western iowa include altering the hillslopes by building terraces for farming these practices affect the hydrologic response of the watershed making difficulty to the model reproducing the observed flow in altered environments hydraulic factors affect also the performance of the model at particular locations the routing component of the model is not able to simulate the backwater effect observed in gauges upstream of the reservoirs in iowa river and des moines river and in the alluvial zones of the mississippi and the missouri rivers the channelization of rivers for irrigation is not taken into account by the model structure and causes a decrease in the model performance as shown in fig 14 for little sioux river near turin better values of performance were obtained with stage iv compared to using ifc rainfall fig 15 this result was expected considering that stage iv contains bias correction from rain gauge data as well as human expert intervention at the nws river forecast centers nevertheless considering that ifc rainfall estimates are not gauge corrected the model has remarkable performance for a radar only product and with data availability every five minutes suitable for real time flood forecasting one signature shown in simulated hydrographs at many locations is that sometimes the model was not able to reproduce correctly the falling limb of the hydrographs see figs 13 and 14 falling limbs in some model simulations drop much faster than observed consequently total volume of the simulations is underestimated as shown in the results obtained for the percent bias also missed rates increase because model simulations go below flood level faster than observations this means that there is a volume of water not converted to flow into the channels therefore not reflected in the discharge output of the model in the next section we explore how modifying the hlm structure by including an additional flow component from the upper soil layer to the channel helps to resolve volume underestimation 5 3 addition of an interflow component fig 16 shows the effect of including the interflow component on the performance of the model the most noticeable change of performance is obtained in terms of the total discharge volume as can be seen from the results of the percent bias the discharge volume underestimation of the original hlm configuration is reduced significantly with the inclusion of the interflow component this result is an evidence that the outputs of the original model configuration were missing an important amount of water that was being retained in the upper layer of soil subsequently evaporated or percolated and never was converted into discharge however although the addition of the interflow component mostly improves the errors of volume underestimation it creates sometimes cases of volume overestimation in addition the model correction does not fully represent the nonlinear dynamics of agricultural drainage tiles there are improvements in nse a considerable number of simulations with nse values between 0 0 and 0 4 in the original model increase their nse to values between 0 4 and 1 0 but also some negative values appear this implies that there are locations where the model structure is not adequate there is unfortunately little information about the locations where tile drainage systems are installed therefore it is uncertain that what hillslopes should be augmented with the inclusion of this flow component similar behavior is observed in terms of kge producing simulations with values above 0 6 and some tradeoff of values below zero in terms of mae the distribution of errors in the original and the examined model configuration is similar about five percent of simulations that had mae errors smaller than one foot in the original configuration increase their errors slightly additional metrics do not show significant changes in terms of the timing of the simulations hit rate false alarms or peak estimation 5 4 consideration of the stream order into the routing component the inclusion of the stream order routing component led mainly to improvement of the timing of the simulations compared to the original model the results of the experiment are summarized in fig 17 simulations that where between 6 and 36 h late in the original model configuration shifted and diminished their time difference with observations from the point of view of operational flood forecasting improvements in timing of the simulations is one of the more desirable features small changes in performance are reflected in other metrics in terms of nse there is an increase of values between 0 4 and 0 6 but also a number of simulations with values above 0 0 that become negative however in terms of kge simulations with values between 0 0 and 0 4 increased their performance to values between 0 4 and 0 8 this questions the suitability of nse to evaluate model performance compared to a more robust metric like kge gupta et al 2009 6 conclusions and recommendations we tested the performance of hlm model conducting an exhaustive comparison between simulated and observed stream flow at 150 locations in iowa the study provided a comprehensive evaluation that allows us to understand the aspects that influence the hlm model performance we examined four aspects 1 the landscape characteristics of the locations where model forecasts are provided 2 the spatial scale of the watershed of these locations 3 the differences of using two radar rainfall inputs in the operation of the model and 4 the temporal variability of the performance the ifc is developing synthetic rating curves for the ifc bridge sensors that will provide streamflow data at additional 250 locations this will allow extending the evaluation of hlm to the spatial scales of communities results show that for the simulations obtained with stage iv 88 have nse 0 95 have kge 0 65 have mae 1 foot 83 have pb 40 35 have hit rate 40 average peak estimation errors are below 5 at large basins and below 20 at small basins and the average timing difference is smaller than three hours for simulations obtained with the ifc rainfall product 69 have nse 0 82 have kge 0 59 have mae 1 foot 67 have pb 40 42 have hit rate 40 average peak estimation errors are close to zero but have large deviation in basins between 1000 and 10 000 km2 and the average timing difference is also smaller than three hours in general better performance was obtained with stage iv compared to using ifc rainfall nevertheless considering that ifc rainfall estimates are not gauge corrected we think that the model has remarkable performance for a radar only product available every five minutes to improve the accuracy of the ifc product we have been testing a new polarimetric qpe algorithm ryzhkov et al 2014 wang et al 2019 and will soon report improvements in both rainfall estimation and hydrologic prediction using the new product we will further investigate and learn about the benefits of using the high space and time resolution product e g for flash flooding a fair comparison of the effect of two different inputs is only possible if the hydrologic model is not calibrated to favor any of the products calibrating the model to both products would likely lead to different values of the parameters questioning those that have physical interpretation the original configuration of the model provides simulations with good performance across the state especially over the landforms where the drainage network is integrated in low relief terrain which includes the iowan surface the paleozoic plateau the southern iowa drift plain and the northwest iowa plains the performance is lower in two regions 1 in the landscape of the des moines lobe where the absence of a well defined drainage network and presence of wetlands adds difficulty to the correct simulation of the rainfall runoff processes and 2 the tributaries of the missouri river where high slopes thick loess hillslope terraces and channel alteration requires a different configuration of the model to achieve better performance we explored the effects in model performance by modifying its structure including an interflow component and routing model adapted to the flow velocity of each stream order the modification significantly improved discharge volume underestimation and timing of the original model configuration the approach of model performance verification followed by structure modification is from our point of view more insightful than attempting to improve performance by localized model parameter calibration in our opinion calibration kills understanding and we argue that focusing on the

5677,this study evaluates the performance of iowa flood center s real time distributed hydrologic model hillslope link model hlm the hlm provides information about current and future streamflow conditions for over 1000 locations in iowa including small communities and stream gauge locations the hlm uses a calibration free approach in which a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations represents the processes of rainfall to runoff translation as well as the transport of water in the river network the authors developed a comprehensive evaluation framework to improve the model performance through modification of its structure and not by parameter calibration the authors explored modifications to the runoff generation modeling and to the approach for routing water in channels model performance was assessed using different metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge mean absolute error of river stages mae percent bias pb annual peak difference ratio of hits misses and false alarms and timing difference the inclusion of an interflow component alleviated problems of volume underestimation timing of model simulations was found to be more accurate when the routing component considered the channel stream order in the study effect of rainfall input on the model performance was verified with stage iv which includes bias adjustment using gauge information and a radar rainfall product created in real time by ifc without bias correction open loop simulations obtained with stage iv and ifc rainfall show similar performance out of all the simulations obtained with stage iv 88 have nse 0 95 have kge 0 65 have mae 1 foot 83 have pb 40 35 have hit rate 40 average peak estimation errors are below 5 at large basins and below 20 at small basins and the average timing difference is smaller than three hours the characteristics of landforms and the impact of agricultural practices in the region are related to the spatial distribution of model performance the study provides the basis for future improvements of the model keywords hlm performance floods interflow routing stage iv iowa 1 introduction the iowa flood center ifc was established by state of iowa legislators in 2009 after the severe floods in 2008 budikova et al 2010 gupta et al 2010 smith et al 2013 the main purpose of the center is to provide the general public in iowa with information that helps mitigate the devastating effect of floods and to the best of the authors knowledge is the only academic institution in the united states providing real time flood forecasting at state level as part of this effort the ifc developed a real time hydrologic model that makes streamflow predictions every 15 min for well over 1000 locations including small communities and stream gauge locations krajewski et al 2017 streamflow predictions at gauges with available rating curves are converted into stages which can be easier to interpret than discharge values at small communities the model streamflow predictions are transformed into a potential flood index quintero et al 2020 while at larger communities where inundation maps have been precalculated stage estimates are transformed into the corresponding inundation map the continuous rainfall runoff model is called hlm hillslope link model and has roots in the scaling studies of river networks and water transport therein gupta et al 2010 maritan et al 1996 rodriguez iturbe et al 2008 following mantilla et al 2006 the model uses hillslopes and channel links as the primary units for landscape decomposition where hydrologic processes are modeled major components of the ifc s real time flood forecasting system include rainfall and evapotranspiration inputs and the hlm with streamflow routing rainfall conversion to runoff is modeled through soil moisture accounting at hillslopes channel routing is based on a non linear representation of water velocity that considers the discharge amount as well as the upstream drainage area ghimire et al 2018 gupta et al 2010 mathematically the model represents a large system of ordinary differential equations organized following river network topology the ifc also developed an efficient numerical solver suitable for high performance computing architecture with variable step size using an error control structure small et al 2013 several recent studies demonstrated various capabilities of the model ayalew et al 2014 ayalew and krajewski 2017 cunha et al 2012 elsaadani and krajewski 2017 quintero et al 2016 all information generated by the model execution is communicated to the general public through a browser based comprehensive and interactive platform called iowa flood information system demir and krajewski 2013 krajewski et al 2017 the ifc began using the model operationally in real time in 2012 providing streamflow forecasts for up to the next ten days the main driver of the system is a radar derived composite rain rate map with time and space resolutions of five minutes and approximately 500 m respectively the ifc quantitative precipitation estimation qpe algorithms include polarimetric data based quality control seo and krajewski 2015 seo et al 2015b rain rate conversion using nexrad reflectivity rain rate relation and correction for radar temporal sampling error seo and krajewski 2015 rain gauge correction is not yet implemented in the algorithms as there is no uniform coverage of the state by high quality rain gauge networks rainfall input is in fact one of the main uncertainty sources of the model predictions radar rainfall estimates are often affected by a number of uncertainty factors hunter 1996 villarini and krajewski 2010 accurate rainfall estimation requires corrections for multiple error sources including ground clutter hubbert et al 2009 range effect due to variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity vignal et al 2003 overall bias smith and krajewski 1991 steiner et al 1999 among others it is well recognized that uncertainties in rainfall input propagate through hydrologic simulations hossain et al 2004 quintero et al 2012 and thus have significant impacts on hydrologic predictions berne and krajewski 2013 borga 2002 krajewski and smith 2002 this paper presents a thorough evaluation of the performance of hlm that considers long term datasets of rainfall observations and evaluation of results using streamflow observations at hundreds of locations the authors plan this paper will be the first of a series reporting hlm performance improvements performance is examined in an open loop simulation mode assuming that observed rainfall is always known but subject to the typical estimation uncertainty therefore the results we obtained from this long term simulations are not directly comparable to those generated in a real time forecasting mode for multiple lead times e g zalenski et al 2017 we focus the attention on the errors generated by different model structures and use simulation instead of forecasting while krajewski et al 2017 reported preliminary evaluation results for multiple years this study further extends the analysis period and performs a more comprehensive evaluation using a variety of performance metrics this offers insightful understanding about overall performance of the hlm as well as details that are relevant to the problem of flood prediction such as errors in peak estimation and timing of the rising limb we discuss the linkage between performance and the characteristics of the landscape in localized regions of the state and how the evaluation results can be used to orient improvements in our hydrologic modelling effort the study also proposes changes in the model structure to include processes that were not considered in the original krajewski et al 2017 version and are important in iowa the inclusion of an interflow component that resembles the function of tile drainage and a modification to the routing component that considers the stream order of each channel we explain in detail the changes in the model structure and their influence on the model performance there are several other factors that can impact the model performance for narrowing our research we did not include them in this paper but it is in our agenda to report their effect these include among others a the errors in the initialization of the hydrologic state variables e g soil moisture and groundwater storage b the contribution from data assimilation c the impact of radar rainfall products with bias correction and dual polarization capabilities we used two different rainfall products to test the sensitivity of the hydrologic simulations to rainfall inputs our in house product obtained in real time here called ifc rainfall which is a radar only product without any correction using rain gauges and stage iv lin and mitchell 2005 that is known as unbiased but contains not only correction based on rain gauge data but also human operator s experience it is not available in real time the performance evaluation includes examining the effect of the model input we conduct retrospective hlm simulations between 2009 and 2016 the simulations have temporal resolution of 15 min and are compared to discharge observations with the same resolution the evaluation is done at about 150 locations in iowa where streamflow observations from usgs are available observations at many of these locations are affected by human activities such as artificial diversions storage and other activities in the drainage basin that affect the natural flow of watercourse those locations impose a challenge to the ifc plan of developing a model with good performance for iowa literature provides the basis for defining the metrics that are used for evaluation of hydrologic model performance smith et al 2012 2004 present the results of the distributed model intercomparison project dmip a framework to analyze the performance of different model structures in testbed basins over the united states comparing to the number of studies available in hydrologic modeling relatively few literature studies have explored systematically the performance of hydrologic models in extended regions e g entire state considering a wide range of basin size most hydrologic studies focus in detail on a small number of watersheds providing comprehensive but highly local insights and may be limited in their ability to inform general hydrologic concepts applicable across regions gupta et al 2014 newman et al 2015 notable exception is zhang et al 2012 who evaluated the performance of hl rdhm model in 63 basins located in oklahoma arkansas and missouri with sizes ranging from 37 km2 to 2484 km2 knowledge about the performance of other hydrologic models in the state of iowa is obviously more limited green et al 2006 checked the performance of daily simulations obtained with swat model between 1995 and 2004 in south fork watershed in iowa salas et al 2017 reported the performance of the model used by national water center across the continental united states over a short simulation period of three months in summer of 2015 newman et al 2015 developed a hydro meteorological dataset for the contiguous united states using the sac sma model and included hydrologic model performance evaluation at 671 basins six of them located in iowa 2 incremental improvements in model structure accurate streamflow simulations in all communities within the state require a continuous evaluation effort and application of sequential improvements to the model to achieve this the natural and artificial features that control the hydrologic processes in iowa must be considered we note that it is difficult to create a unique model that can handle all the different aspects that govern water dynamics in iowa watersheds one way to improve the model performance is to define a model structure and find the most adequate set of model parameter that minimizes the differences between simulated and observed discharge at each basin however we consider this approach to obscure the understanding of the hydrologic system and that the parameters derived from model calibration compensate for the errors in the model inputs and modeling processes we promote the view that the key model components including the rainfall input should be evaluated on their own merit separately from the other ones the approach proposed in this study is based on identifying the particular processes that control the hydrologic regime in different regions of iowa and modeling them by applying sequential changes to the model structure only when structural changes result in better performance the hlm model is updated see fig 3 changes to model structure have no effect in compensating for precipitation input errors in this study we examine the performance of the original hlm configuration e g krajewski et al 2017 and propose two updates in the structure aiming to gain better representation of the relevant hydrologic processes which leads to our better understanding of water transport in the region 2 1 original hlm structure hlm builds on the concept of the landscape decomposition into hillslopes and channels mantilla and gupta 2005 and allows for flexible structure and the representation of the physical processes of runoff generation and water transport these processes include initial abstraction infiltration overland flow percolation base flow and channel routing the model is calibration free i e a common configuration of parameters determined a priori applies for all the model inputs and no adjustments are made for particular basins a representation of the model structure is shown in fig 1 it consists of four water storage components for every hillslope link channel flow q t m 3 s 1 water ponded on hillslope surface s p t m effective water depth in the top soil layer s t t m and effective water depth in hillslope subsurface s s t m the mass conservation equations of the water storages are defined in terms of ordinary differential equations in the original model configuration flow components contributing to streamflow in the channel are the overland flow coming from the water ponded on hillslope surface q pc and the baseflow coming from water stored in the hillslope subsurface q sc we solve the set of differential equations describing change in water storages and discharge using a modern parallelized implementation of numerical runge kutta methods small et al 2013 details about the hlm equations and their configuration are documented in quintero et al 2016 according to the original model the velocity of flow at channel link in the network is a power law function of the form 1 v t v 0 q t λ 1 a λ 2 where exponents λ 1 and λ 2 are related to the nonlinearity of flow velocity that is denoted as a function of discharge and drainage area the key advantage of this formulation is that as the model moves water along the river network the two predictors are always know the discharge coming from the upstream and obtained through aggregation of by the branching structure of the river network and the upstream area one of the attributes of the channel links the water moves faster for higher flows moderated by the increase of the drainage area the v0 corresponds to the unit area discharge values of v 0 and λ 1 and λ 2 were obtained by fitting the observed pairs of discharge velocity data collected periodically by usgs at about 132 stations across the entire state for over 50 years the concept of downstream change of velocity in rivers is taken into account implicitly in the hlm routing by linking discharge and upstream area into the hlm formulation while ghimire et al 2018 extensively explored this model formulation by considering various basins separately the original model used a fixed set of the values of v 0 and λ 1 and λ 2 2 2 inclusion of an interflow component in iowa there are significant number of tiling drainage systems installed by farmers to increase the yields the tiles artificially drain the water excess stored in the upper layer of soil below to the surface tiling systems affect the timing of delivery of water to streams and increase the amount of runoff that contributes to the system guan et al 2011 we modified the structure of the original model and included a component that produces flow from the upper layer of soil that goes directly into the channel this flow component resembles the tile drainage interflow the equation of the flow component is given by 2 q tc k tc s t where q tc is the flow from the upper layer of soil to the channel s t is the water stored in soil and k tc is a linear reservoir coefficient controlling the flow rate the rate is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the upper layer of soil topography root depth and the amount of water that is stored in the soil pores the hydrologic response of the interflow component should be slower than the response of surface flow but faster than the flow component originated in the groundwater storage 2 3 modification of the routing component the hlm original routing structure shown in eq 1 uses the same values of v 0 λ 1 and λ 2 for all the channels despite the observation by leopold 1953 that velocity scales with stream order since stream order is also known as the model moves water over the network one can replace the dependence on the drainage area with that on the stream order without losing the convenience of the model formulation we examined a modification to the routing component where the parameters are obtained by previously classifying the discharge velocity data according to the horton strahler order ω of the channel the classification leads to the routing models for each stream order ω of the form 3 v t v 0 ω q t λ 1 ω fig 4 shows the regressions derived for each stream order based on the observed streamflow velocity data differences in the regression for stream order 2 respect to the others might be explained by the lack of available of data using multiple routing models instead of a single model representative of all the data reduces the uncertainty of the estimation of velocity based on discharge we implemented these routing models into hlm and examined the effect on the model performance the values found for v 0 and λ 1 for each stream order are shown in table 3 2 4 model runs hlm was used to produce discharge simulations with 15 min temporal resolution between 2009 and 2016 both included simulations are run for each year during the warm season i e from april 1st to december 1st which corresponds to the period when most flooding occurs in iowa villarini et al 2011 initial conditions for each year are obtained with model spin up starting january 1st of each year using stage iv we also evaluate and compare the hlm performance for the different rainfall inputs of the stage iv and ifc products the model produces discharge simulations at every channel of the drainage network the results of the simulations are stored for those channels where discharge observations are available 3 data 3 1 study area the study domain includes all iowa basins that drain into the mississippi and missouri rivers the state s surface area is about 145 700 km2 and the population of about 3 134 000 inhabitants one third of them living in rural areas the landscape is predominantly agricultural characterized by low relief fertile soils and high drainage density and thus numerous rivers prior 1991 the combination of the characteristics of its landscape together with significant rainfall during the summer months makes the state prone to the occurrence of floods since 1953 fifty four 54 out of fifty nine 59 presidential disaster declarations in iowa have been related to floods iowa homeland security and emergency management 2018 the mission of developing a hydrologic model that provides accurate predictions over all the state is challenged by the heterogeneity of its land use topography and hydrogeology despite the popular notion that all iowa is flat iowa s landscapes are remarkably diverse fig 2 shows seven topographic regions of the state that are distinguished based on the characteristics of terrain table 1 some features that are of special interest for the problem of hydrologic modeling include 1 the absence of a well connected drainage system over the des moines lobe and 2 the steep relief of the loess hills in western iowa in contrast with the plain terrain predominant in the rest of the state besides the heterogeneities of the drainage system caused by natural properties of terrain there are alterations caused by agricultural practice including the installation of tiling drainage systems and river channelization the tiling artificially drains the water excess stored in the upper layer of soil below to the surface increasing the amount of flow that contributes to the system the hlm requires a decomposition of the landscape to delineate the drainage network for all basins our current implementation uses a river network derived from at 90 m dem the resulting network is made of about 420 000 pairs of hillslopes and channel links the average area of the hillslopes is 0 4 km2 and the average length of the channels is about 700 m quintero and krajewski 2018 3 2 observed discharge data there are some 150 active usgs stream gauges with discharge data available we used data from these stations reporting streamflow in the period between 2009 and 2016 the stations are spread across the state and they cover upstream areas ranging between 10 km2 and 30 000 km2 this study does not include the stream stage data of the network of more than 250 bridge mounted ultrasonic sensors deployed by ifc kruger et al 2016 because they lack rating curves 3 3 rainfall and evapotranspiration data we used two radar based composite rainfall products in this study the ifc and stage iv products the ifc product is the nexrad composite of seven s band weather radars covering the entire state of iowa seo et al 2015a 2018 seo and krajewski 2015 the product used in this study has not benefitted from dual polarization capability because the nws upgrade of dual polarization for the seven radars covering iowa was completed in the spring of 2013 the ifc rainfall estimates are available at 5 min time resolution and a spatial resolution of 0 004 decimal degrees approximately 0 4 0 5 km the radar product has not been adjusted with rain gauges data due to lack of adequate state wide automatic rain gauge network stage iv is a national mosaic derived from the hourly multi sensor radar and rain gauges precipitation estimates with some manual quality controls lin and mitchell 2005 the regional analyses produced by the river forecast centers rfcs are merged and the national coverage of precipitation estimates is distributed by the national center for environmental prediction ncep for the evapotranspiration et estimates our study uses climatology based on 12 years of north american land data assimilation system mitchell et al 2004 this approach captures the seasonal effects but fails to account for year to year and day to day variability the ifc is working on a more time and place specific et estimation method krajewski et al 2017 for the current operational real time mode the ifc generates hourly et product using outputs from high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model benjamin et al 2015 however those et estimates are not available for the period of the retrospective analysis as the hrrr came on line in 2015 4 evaluation methodology we used a standard set of metrics in this study to measure model performance paying special attention to characteristics of the model that are desirable for an accurate flood forecasting system nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is traditionally used to evaluate hydrologic model simulations nse is defined as 4 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where s i is the simulated discharge for each time step i o i is the observed value n is the total number of values within the time period of analysis nse is the ratio of the residual variance to the initial or no model variance and it represents the proportion of the initial variance explained by the model values of nse vary from negative infinity to 1 0 values closer to 1 0 indicate good agreement while negative values of nse indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model kling gupta efficiency kge is an alternative metric that was proposed to improve nse s deficiency that the optimal reference is given by the observed mean details can be found in gupta et al 2009 kge is calculated using the correlation and the ratios of mean and standard deviation of simulated and observed streamflow as 5 kge 1 ρ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where ρ α and β denote correlation the ratio of standard deviation σ s σ o and the ratio of mean μ s μ o between simulated and observed streamflow respectively similar to nse kge values close to 1 implies an optimal estimation mean absolute error hydrologic models are traditionally evaluated in terms of differences of simulated and observed discharge however from a practical point of view operational hydrologic forecasting is more helpful to general public and emergency managers when they are provided in terms of river stages we converted observations and simulations of discharge to river stages using the gauge rating curve and calculated mean absolute errors mae in centimeters using the equation 6 mae i 1 n s r s i ors i n where sr s i and or s i are the simulated and observed river stages for each time step i and n is the total number of observations the most recent rating curve for each gauge was used to map discharge to stages because historical rating curves are not publicly available we acknowledge there is uncertainty of the rating curves for accurate estimates especially for high flow values where the rating curve has fewer stage discharge measurements this source of error is important and deserves careful evaluation in future studies we omitted it to avoid extending the paper percent bias the percent bias pb measures the difference in volume of the simulated hydrograph with respect to the observed discharge volume it is obtained as 7 pb i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 where positive bias indicates model discharge overestimation and negative bias indicates volume underestimation hits misses and false alarms ratio we accounted the number of times where simultaneously observed discharge and model predictions exceeded a flood threshold level we used as threshold the flood stage of the national weather service nws at each gauge location https www weather gov aprfc terminology we counted the number of instances of a b c and d of the contingency table shown in table 2 the hit rate is the fraction of observed events that is predicted correctly and is calculated as 8 h a a c ranging from 0 at the poor end to 1 at the good end miss rate is calculated as 9 m 1 h false alarms ratio counts the number of times where model predictions are over the threshold but observations are not and is calculated as 10 f b a b timing difference accurate hydrologic predictions requires that the model have skill in predicting the time where discharge increases and reaches peak levels model predictions with correct timing are very helpful to emergency responders it is of special interest for flood forecasting having an accurate prediction of the time where risings limbs and top discharge of individual events occur we evaluated differences in time between observed and simulated features of the full hydrograph not only of the peak of the simulations we calculated the errors in timing of the model by finding the time shifting that when applied to the simulated hydrographs maximizes the correlation with observations time shifts where applied in steps of 15 min positive timing errors indicate that model simulations are late with respect to observations and negative errors indicate that model features occur earlier than observations differences in annual peaks we examined the accuracy of the model to predict correctly the annual maximum discharge at each gauge annual maximum has a special meaning as this represents the worst case scenario for a given year it is also very easy to find searching through the observed and predicted time series accurate peak prediction of the model result in a helpful tool for extrapolating flood frequency analysis where observations might not be available we compared the annual maximum values of simulations and observations the relative peak difference is obtained as 11 pd s p o p o p where s p is the simulated annual peak and o p is the observed annual peak 5 results 5 1 performance of the hlm original configuration this subsection shows the results of the metrics described previously each metric is evaluated for the simulations derived from stage iv and ifc rainfall the metrics are described in four ways 1 maps showing the annual averages obtained at every station 2 histograms showing fractions for the ranges of the metric values 3 box and whisker plots showing the relation between drainage area and the metric values obtained at each site and 4 histograms showing the average values obtained year to year 5 1 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency maps in fig 5 show higher values of nse in eastern and central iowa and lower nse values in western iowa the histogram with the distribution of nse values shows that higher nse values are obtained with stage iv nse increases with drainage area for all the analyzed years the median of nse obtained using stage iv is larger than the one obtained using the ifc estimates the higher average nse values were obtained at the iowa river and maquoketa river basins ranging between 0 6 and 0 7 the lower annual average nse values were obtained at two locations in little sioux river and soldier river in western iowa with values ranging between 0 6 and 0 9 upon closer examination of the results at little sioux river and soldier river we found that the model of the drainage network used by hlm at this particular basins differs from the actual path of the river which has been substantially altered artificially for irrigation purposes the differences in the model network affect the amounts of modeled streamflow at the gauges for evaluation considering the definition of nse the model is a better predictor of streamflow than the observed mean discharge i e nse 0 in 88 of the simulations when using the stage iv forcing and in 69 of the simulations when using ifc rainfall 5 1 2 kling gupta efficiency results obtained for kge in fig 6 agree with what we found for nse the model performs best at eastern and central iowa whereas lower values of kge were obtained at the tributaries of the missouri river in western iowa this is even more visible when using ifc rainfall compared to stage iv which is also an indicator of the differences between both rainfall products the histograms show that the bulk of the distribution narrows between kge values of 0 2 and 0 8 with a flatter distribution obtained for ifc rainfall similar to nse kge increases with drainage area the higher annual average values where obtained during 2013 a year where numerous flood events affected iowa 5 1 3 mean absolute error the outputs of the model were analyzed in terms of differences in river stage compared to observations in fig 7 maps do not show spatial patterns where mae values are lower or higher mae values increase with drainage area of the basins smaller mae are obtained at basins with drainage areas smaller than 100 km2 most common mae are smaller than 1 foot 30 5 cm with both rainfall products the number of simulations with mae less than one foot is greater when using stage iv compared to using the ifc product averaged mae did not exceed one foot along the analyzed years from an operational river forecasting perspective errors smaller than one foot can be very helpful to support river stage predictions in an automated hydrologic modeling system e g zalenski et al 2017 5 1 4 percentage bias the maps in fig 8 show patterns of volume underestimation around eastern iowa and overestimation in the tributaries to the missouri river in western iowa with ifc rainfall sites scattered across all the state exhibit larger positive and negative biases compared to stage iv the histograms show differences in the statistical distribution of bias values with stage iv most of the bias values are within the range 0 to 40 whereas with ifc rainfall there is a larger number of simulations with negative bias overall it is fair to state that the hlm tends to underestimate runoff estimates the bias values do not exhibit a clear relation with the drainage area the year to year comparison of average values shows large differences between both rainfall products 5 1 5 timing results of fig 9 indicate that timing is not related strongly with rainfall input maps show that timing obtained with the model is similar using any of the rainfall products model simulations are late compared to observations especially in southwestern iowa at the nishnabotna river western iowa watersheds have rapid surface runoff response due to the steep slopes and low permeability because of the terrain characteristics of the loess hills landform problems with timing of the simulations can be due to misconfiguration of the model which is set to reproduce surface flow velocity from low relief terrain the histogram of timing values is also similar for both rainfall products most of the simulations are late between zero and three hours there is strong relation between timing and increase of the drainage area the deviation of timing tends to be bigger at larger basins as would be expected due to the physics of the water movement across the rivers the spread of differences in timing is smaller for catchments between 10 km2 and 1000 km2 probably due to the short travel time in basins with drainage areas greater than 1000 km2 the timing increases for scales between thousands and tens of thousands km2 the timing differences can be up to 48 h at some catchments 5 1 6 hits misses and false alarms the first row of maps in fig 10 shows the spatial variability of the hit rate the hit rate does not depend strongly on rainfall forcing the model has ability to capture the occurrence of flood events across the state especially in eastern iowa along the entire iowa river basin and in northwestern iowa however one can see from the maps of the second row that there are several locations where miss rate is high meaning that the model does not produce enough discharge simulations above flood level when they are observed high miss rates are frequent in basins of western iowa and central iowa along the raccoon river basin several occurrences of high miss rates are due to problems with the ability of the model to reproduce the hydrograph recession at some locations although the model simulates accurately the rising limb of the hydrograph and its peak the recession occurs faster than what is observed in the streamflow data during flood events this implies that after the occurrence of the peak discharge the model simulations decrease too quickly compared to observed streamflow causing that the predictions miss portions of the flood event high values of miss rates are also due occasionally to rainfall underestimation the occurrence of false alarms is shown in the third row of fig 10 the annual average false alarms of the model are smaller than 1 fig 11 the figure shows that there are more occurrences of false alarms when using ifc rainfall than with stage iv there is relation between the occurrence of false alarms and the drainage area of the basin exists 5 1 7 peak differences fig 12 compares the observed and simulated maximum annual peaks the peaks that do not coincide with observations in a temporal window of 48 h were excluded from the analysis in order to compare peaks produced in the same rainfall events the histograms show that most of the times peaks are slightly underestimated between 20 and 40 with stage iv and with ifc rainfall between 0 and 20 with ifc rainfall however about 15 of the simulations produced peak flows that doubled the observed peak the map shows that these peak overestimates are mostly focused in the upper part of the des moines river and the little sioux river which could indicate problems of the configuration of the hydrologic model in this basin and or problems with radar rainfall estimation in the northwestern part of the state with both rainfall inputs the skill in peak flow estimation increases with the increase of catchment area the median of the peak difference is close to zero at basins larger than 10 000 km2 and the peak difference deviation is small as upstream area decreases the deviation of the peak difference tends to increase the coefficient of determination of the linear regression obtained with stage iv is 0 82 and is higher than the value of 0 76 obtained with ifc rainfall forcing in both cases it can be stated that the model is a good predictor of the observed annual maxima at spatial scales larger than 100 km2 5 2 factors affecting the model performance overall the metrics exhibit good model performance especially in the gauges located over the iowan surface the paleozoic plateau the northwestern iowa plains and the southern iowa drift plain see fig 2 the design of the original hlm model structure was intended to reproduce runoff generation and transport in hillslopes and channels with terrain characteristics of these landforms see table 1 examples of hydrographs located on those landforms are shown in fig 13 for clear creek near coralville cedar river at charles city and cedar river at vinton smaller basins are more sensitive to errors in precipitation estimates and exhibit lower performance the performance increases with basin size due to the averaging of inputs and modeling errors the areas the model showed lower performance require a careful analysis that considers what particularities dominate the hydrologic response of the areas we provide some discussion about how performance of hlm is related to natural terrain characteristics and human alterations of the landscape when examining all the metrics analyzed in this study it can be seen that the lower performance of the model is obtained at gauges located over the des moines lobe and the loess hills landforms examples of performance at those landforms are shown in fig 14 for des moines river at emmetsburg and des moines river near stratford hydrologic regime in the des moines lobe is particularly difficult to simulate unless the model structure is adapted to replicate its particular terrain characteristics such as the threshold based connectivity of the drainage network and the infiltration processes at the glacial drift a similar idea applies with the characteristics of the basins over the loess hills although drainage network is well defined in this landform some problems arise when resembling the flow velocity at the surface of the hillslopes and in the channels the steep slopes of the terrain produce a very fast response different from what the model is configured to replicate the rest of the state in terrain with low relief terrain on the other hand agricultural practices in western iowa include altering the hillslopes by building terraces for farming these practices affect the hydrologic response of the watershed making difficulty to the model reproducing the observed flow in altered environments hydraulic factors affect also the performance of the model at particular locations the routing component of the model is not able to simulate the backwater effect observed in gauges upstream of the reservoirs in iowa river and des moines river and in the alluvial zones of the mississippi and the missouri rivers the channelization of rivers for irrigation is not taken into account by the model structure and causes a decrease in the model performance as shown in fig 14 for little sioux river near turin better values of performance were obtained with stage iv compared to using ifc rainfall fig 15 this result was expected considering that stage iv contains bias correction from rain gauge data as well as human expert intervention at the nws river forecast centers nevertheless considering that ifc rainfall estimates are not gauge corrected the model has remarkable performance for a radar only product and with data availability every five minutes suitable for real time flood forecasting one signature shown in simulated hydrographs at many locations is that sometimes the model was not able to reproduce correctly the falling limb of the hydrographs see figs 13 and 14 falling limbs in some model simulations drop much faster than observed consequently total volume of the simulations is underestimated as shown in the results obtained for the percent bias also missed rates increase because model simulations go below flood level faster than observations this means that there is a volume of water not converted to flow into the channels therefore not reflected in the discharge output of the model in the next section we explore how modifying the hlm structure by including an additional flow component from the upper soil layer to the channel helps to resolve volume underestimation 5 3 addition of an interflow component fig 16 shows the effect of including the interflow component on the performance of the model the most noticeable change of performance is obtained in terms of the total discharge volume as can be seen from the results of the percent bias the discharge volume underestimation of the original hlm configuration is reduced significantly with the inclusion of the interflow component this result is an evidence that the outputs of the original model configuration were missing an important amount of water that was being retained in the upper layer of soil subsequently evaporated or percolated and never was converted into discharge however although the addition of the interflow component mostly improves the errors of volume underestimation it creates sometimes cases of volume overestimation in addition the model correction does not fully represent the nonlinear dynamics of agricultural drainage tiles there are improvements in nse a considerable number of simulations with nse values between 0 0 and 0 4 in the original model increase their nse to values between 0 4 and 1 0 but also some negative values appear this implies that there are locations where the model structure is not adequate there is unfortunately little information about the locations where tile drainage systems are installed therefore it is uncertain that what hillslopes should be augmented with the inclusion of this flow component similar behavior is observed in terms of kge producing simulations with values above 0 6 and some tradeoff of values below zero in terms of mae the distribution of errors in the original and the examined model configuration is similar about five percent of simulations that had mae errors smaller than one foot in the original configuration increase their errors slightly additional metrics do not show significant changes in terms of the timing of the simulations hit rate false alarms or peak estimation 5 4 consideration of the stream order into the routing component the inclusion of the stream order routing component led mainly to improvement of the timing of the simulations compared to the original model the results of the experiment are summarized in fig 17 simulations that where between 6 and 36 h late in the original model configuration shifted and diminished their time difference with observations from the point of view of operational flood forecasting improvements in timing of the simulations is one of the more desirable features small changes in performance are reflected in other metrics in terms of nse there is an increase of values between 0 4 and 0 6 but also a number of simulations with values above 0 0 that become negative however in terms of kge simulations with values between 0 0 and 0 4 increased their performance to values between 0 4 and 0 8 this questions the suitability of nse to evaluate model performance compared to a more robust metric like kge gupta et al 2009 6 conclusions and recommendations we tested the performance of hlm model conducting an exhaustive comparison between simulated and observed stream flow at 150 locations in iowa the study provided a comprehensive evaluation that allows us to understand the aspects that influence the hlm model performance we examined four aspects 1 the landscape characteristics of the locations where model forecasts are provided 2 the spatial scale of the watershed of these locations 3 the differences of using two radar rainfall inputs in the operation of the model and 4 the temporal variability of the performance the ifc is developing synthetic rating curves for the ifc bridge sensors that will provide streamflow data at additional 250 locations this will allow extending the evaluation of hlm to the spatial scales of communities results show that for the simulations obtained with stage iv 88 have nse 0 95 have kge 0 65 have mae 1 foot 83 have pb 40 35 have hit rate 40 average peak estimation errors are below 5 at large basins and below 20 at small basins and the average timing difference is smaller than three hours for simulations obtained with the ifc rainfall product 69 have nse 0 82 have kge 0 59 have mae 1 foot 67 have pb 40 42 have hit rate 40 average peak estimation errors are close to zero but have large deviation in basins between 1000 and 10 000 km2 and the average timing difference is also smaller than three hours in general better performance was obtained with stage iv compared to using ifc rainfall nevertheless considering that ifc rainfall estimates are not gauge corrected we think that the model has remarkable performance for a radar only product available every five minutes to improve the accuracy of the ifc product we have been testing a new polarimetric qpe algorithm ryzhkov et al 2014 wang et al 2019 and will soon report improvements in both rainfall estimation and hydrologic prediction using the new product we will further investigate and learn about the benefits of using the high space and time resolution product e g for flash flooding a fair comparison of the effect of two different inputs is only possible if the hydrologic model is not calibrated to favor any of the products calibrating the model to both products would likely lead to different values of the parameters questioning those that have physical interpretation the original configuration of the model provides simulations with good performance across the state especially over the landforms where the drainage network is integrated in low relief terrain which includes the iowan surface the paleozoic plateau the southern iowa drift plain and the northwest iowa plains the performance is lower in two regions 1 in the landscape of the des moines lobe where the absence of a well defined drainage network and presence of wetlands adds difficulty to the correct simulation of the rainfall runoff processes and 2 the tributaries of the missouri river where high slopes thick loess hillslope terraces and channel alteration requires a different configuration of the model to achieve better performance we explored the effects in model performance by modifying its structure including an interflow component and routing model adapted to the flow velocity of each stream order the modification significantly improved discharge volume underestimation and timing of the original model configuration the approach of model performance verification followed by structure modification is from our point of view more insightful than attempting to improve performance by localized model parameter calibration in our opinion calibration kills understanding and we argue that focusing on the components that represent physical processes is a more productive approach to improve hydrologic models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5678,the common practice to improve the assessments of design upper quantiles of annual flow maxima distribution is incorporating historical data into flood frequency estimates which in general are greater than the systematic flood maxima records a big body of literature was dedicated to this issue showing the advantages and constraints of this approach but the research was not concentrated on the largest floods which for many reasons cannot be treated in the same way as less important ones assuming that only few k largest flood peaks in the specified time period m are known we applied maximum likelihood censoring type ii method to estimate a hundred year flow quantile the relative bias supported by the relative root mean square error of the estimates were evaluated in numerical simulation experiments for different values of k and m performed under true and false distribution assumptions the main and surprising result of the experiments is that in case of a false model assumption the estimation of the upper tail quantiles based on few largest floods in a given period can provide comparable or even better estimates in the sense of the relative bias and relative root mean square error than the estimation for the whole sample encouraged by the results of numerical experiments in the aspect of historical heavily censored samples we found that it might be reasonable to use this approach in a situation where all elements of the series of observation are known but the upper tail of the distribution in our case f 0 99 quantile will be assessed using only the largest records the results are presented in the case study research keywords flood frequency analysis historical information peak flows heavy censoring type ii maximum likelihood 1 introduction the key problems encountered in the flood frequency analysis ffa are the size and the low accuracy of the peak flow series used for estimation of the quantiles of long return period the data series are usually too short to properly reproduce the upper tails of the probability distribution functions and the flow assessments although better and better thanks to modern measurement devices and development of flow rate curves construction methods they still remain inaccurate especially in the range of the largest waters therefore assuming stationarity of the main flood generating processes and extending the systematic observation series by including estimates of the peak flows of the largest historical floods is the most popular way to improve the accuracy of upper quantile estimates e g kjeldsen et al 2014 nguyen et al 2014 halbert et al 2016 england et al 2018 davis et al 2019 obviously systematic datasets are available only for gauged stations whereas the historical information usually constitutes the only if any flood information for the ungauged rivers the effects of addition of historical data to the systematic observations has already been analysed in various contexts in a number of papers stedinger baker 1987 francés et al 1994 bayliss reed 2001 calenda et al 2009 elleder et al 2013 herget et al 2014 machado et al 2015 strupczewski et al 2014 2017 volpi et al 2019 and many other when some historical information is available in addition to systematic records one deals in fact with two random samples i a complete dataset from systematic observations period and ii a heavily censored sample of historical floods when analysing a censored historical series one has to remember and take into account that the systematic series sometimes includes values greater than the historical floods both datasets i and ii represent the same but unknown population stationarity assumption therefore they are jointly used both for selection of a proper distribution model and estimation of its parameters and quantiles of interest at first the procedures for extending systematic measurements by historical flood information were based on plotting positions and graphical concepts zhang 1982 bernieur et al 1986 wang adams 1984 hirsch 1987 stedinger cohn 1986 ding yang 1988 and later hosking 1995 introduced the probability weighted moments pwm with their modification the l moments to modelling of the incomplete records additionally hosking and wallis 1986a b applied the maximum likelihood ml estimation method whereas vigilione et al 2013 and lumbroso et al 2019 incorporated the bayesian estimation paradigm to address the problem of historical floods in systematic datasets despite the fact that practically all methods of estimation known in the ffa may be used in estimation of upper quantiles the maximum likelihood method mlm is commonly applied for the systematic data combined with historical information the mlm s estimators of parameters and quantiles are asymptotically unbiased when the assumed model is true but the method itself concentrates on the main mass of the probability so usually far from the upper quantiles strupczewski 2000 the theoretical benefits of the mlm e g unbiasness and good efficiency of estimators disappear when the parent distribution remains unknown and other so misspecified distributional model is fitted to the dataset strupczewski et al 2002a b because apart from sampling errors one faces also the model error strupczewski et al 2014 proved inter alia that optimal estimator of return period of one historical flood is the period twice as long as the time interval since historical event until the date of the first systematic measurement moreover they showed that in some cases the profit resulting from using historical information in systematic dataset is small in another paper strupczewski et al 2017 estimated maximal theoretical gain which can be achieved when one or two historical floods are adjoined to the systematic annual peak flow dataset this profit is of course bigger for two historical floods than for one but remains small and should be confronted with usually high the cost of reconstruction of historical floods while working on the latter article we discovered that the model and sampling bias besides there is another type of bias which we called by analogy the censoring bias of the maximum likelihood estimate of parameters and quantiles the ungauged rivers usually outnumber the gauged ones so the statistical modelling of floods without reliable information about the rivers became a challenge for scientists and practitioners kohnová et al 2015 in such case one deals with the censored data during the historical period apart from regional estimation methods or techniques based on hydrological similarity the appreciation of pre instrumental hydrological data seems to point the promising direction towards flood modelling in ungauged rivers therefore we aim in answering the question whether the historical data by themselves constitute valuable information about contemporary floods occurring in the ungauged rivers in this paper we scrutinize the censoring bias as a part of total bias apart from sampling and model biases of the design quantile estimated by means of the maximum likelihood method mlm when only the highest peak flow data are available please note that highest peak flows do not have to belong to the historical period although they usually do here we employ the two parameter distribution functions models used in flood frequency analysis namely generalised exponential ge gupta kundu 1999 and weibull we weibull 1951 distribution functions for various sizes of historical datasets we decided to employ the two parameter distribution functions with the location parameter equal to 0 mainly for practical reasons because the results of calculations for two parameter distribution functions are easier to present and more vivid no third degree of freedom i e cs without the loss of generalisation however we are aware that in general two parameter models suffer more for bias than three and multi parameter ones strupczewski et al 2005 kochanek et al 2005 we consider both true and false assumption of the underlying statistical distribution of annual peak flows for brevity we assumed that the synthetic historical datasets used in our experiments are homogeneous independent and stationary although we are aware that in real cases such assumptions are mostly false the article is organised in 5 sections as follows we define the problem in the first section section 2 contains the description of numerical simulation experiments and their results are presented in section 3 the case study research can be found in section 4 and the discussion with conclusions in the last section 2 problem formulation usually the highest floods are best remembered and hence recorded in historical annals of monasteries abbeys courts and town halls when we interpret this information to receive the dataset of largest historical discharge values as a result we deal with a censored sample type ii of censoring of size m containing the k largest available remembered interpreted elements fig 1 the floods marked as unknown in fig 1 can also have the status of treated as unknown if we know all elements of the m year long series and we want to estimate the upper quantiles on the base of the largest elements only note that censoring type ii and truncation are not the same procedures truncated samples or distributions are often used in ffa to capture the upper tail behaviour in the form of e g peak over threshold pot or partial duration series pds analysis when we set a threshold on the data and consider only peaks or the elements of the sample larger than the chosen threshold in the censoring type ii procedure the threshold is imposed not on the flow data but on the order statistics e g we keep only k largest elements of the sample for the inference about the distribution of upper tail to find the maximum of likelihood function l the number of known elements in the sample k should be at least equal to the number of the parameters to be estimated θ and consequently the number of likelihood equations to be solved as two parameter models are considered in our study k 2 is the smallest number that allows estimation of parameters the likelihood function for the censored sample consists of two factors e g francés et al 1994 1a l m k f θ x k m k i 1 k f θ x i or in the form more convenient for calculations 1b ln l m k l n f θ x k i 1 k l n f θ x i where l likelihood function m the length of the dataset k the number of known historical elements f probability cumulative function of the assumed statistical model f probability density function of the statistical model θ vector of model parameters xi i th element of the historical dataset in general the exact date of the historical floods may be unknown therefore the function of likelihood l should be multiplied by the term m k see eq 1a however it was removed from the eq 1b because this term does not influence the results of the optimisation in both cases i e known or unknown year of occurrence estimation of the flood quantiles consists on the optimisation of l function with respect to the θ parameters with the use of the sample xi i 1 2 k the relative bias rb of the upper quantile x f serves here as the basic criterion of the accuracy of the estimation the values of the rb are to reflect the total bias and are calculated as the mean difference between the quantile estimator x f obtained by means of the censored dataset and the population quantile xf referred to the population true value of quantile 2 r b x f e x f x f x f 100 in our case the relative bias rb of the quantile of interest x f can be decomposed into 3 parts namely model bias due to model misspecification sampling bias due to limited time m and censoring bias due to the censoring degree m k m i e the ratio of the number of unknown elements and the total time period m however it is impossible to calculate these biases separately and only the total bias can be assessed by eq 2 we will return to this issue in section 3 for completion the relative root mean square error rrmse of the upper quantile x f was calculated 3 r r m s e x f e x f x f 2 x f 100 the rrmse was implemented in the analysis because together with the br it provides information about the standard error of the quantiles estimators 3 numerical experiments to mitigate the effects of randomness that may blur the results the monte carlo experiment was carried out which enables to obtain expected values of estimators based on 10 000 semi randomly generated samples every sample consists of the population values of the ordered sample of size m which is called the synthetic sample from m generated numbers only k known largest ones are selected and as a result we obtain synthetic censored sample for further calculations it means that the value of the smallest element in the dataset xk changes in each of the generated 10 000 synthetic samples however the effect of the large scale averages the resulting bias our previous research revealed that this method of generation provides more accurate sample elements than the values based on plotting positions compare strupczewski et al 2017 table 2 where each element of the synthetic sample was an average value of 1000 elements of the same plotting position from every of 1000 generated synthetic samples as a result unlike in this research we obtained one averaged sample of m elements for further analysis we have chosen 2 two parameter distribution functions for the experiment generalised exponential ge and weibull we though quite different in their features see table 1 these both models are the extension of the classical exponential distributions but in different way gupta and kundu 1999 2001a 2003 note that when the shape parameters b λ 1 both weibull and generalised exponential distributions become the exponential distribution with constant skewness coefficient equal to 2 both models are also similar in their features to the gamma pearson type 3 distribution function barreto souza et al 2010 so to the certain extend they can be used alternatively gupta kundu 2001b the ge distribution is considered to have a heavier tail than the we so the estimators of quantiles of the same probability are smaller for the we than for ge distribution especially for smaller probability of non exceedance up to f 0 9999 gupta kundu 2003 analysed the discrimination between these two models and observed that in many situations ge distribution provides better fit to datasets than the weibull s the weibull model is commonly used in flood frequency analysis institute of meteorology and water management imgw 2005 kochanek et al 2012 rao and hamed 2000 rizwan et al 2018 whereas the generalised exponential is relatively new model in the hydrology introduced to polish hydrology by brzeziński 2010 but its performance in the estimation of annual peak flows for polish lowland rivers seems to be promising markiewicz et al 2015 and therefore it was considered in the experiment we scrutinised both true and false assumptions of the estimation models in the hydrological literature there are at least few versions of parametrisation of the competing distributions but for we used the convenient formulae proposed by rao hamed 2000 and for ge recently published by markiewicz et al 2015 see table 1 the two competing models were used to generate particular m elements synthetic samples for various values of the coefficient of variation cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 and different sizes m 30 50 100 and 200 it was assumed that of these m elements only k largest elements are known in our experiment k 2 m the size of the samples reflects the usual datasets numbers used in flood frequency analysis there is no use to conduct any statistical analysis for peak flows datasets smaller than 30 elements on the other hand the samples that exceed 200 years hardly ever happen in hydrology obviously the number of known historical floods k is usually much lower than the period m they represent the population generator of the synthetic samples mean value μ equals to 10 for all generated samples and was chosen for the numerical reasons however theoretically the mean value has no impact for the relative bias results the presumed variability of the synthetic samples reflects the range of the cv values characteristic for flow maxima series in polish rivers compare kochanek et al 2012 table i markiewicz et al 2015 diagram 1 for two parameter distributions the cv values are functions of the shape parameters which for cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 are equal to λ 92 35 5 91 1 0 for generalised exponential respectively and b 4 54 2 1 1 0 for weibull respectively for completeness it is important to recall that the skewness coefficient for both distributions is the function of the shape parameter only and for cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 it equals cs 1 15 1 31 and 2 respectively for generalised exponential for weibull the cs values are far more diversified cs 0 19 for cv 0 25 cs 0 57 cv 0 5 and cs 2 cv 1 the experiment was carried out for 100 year flood quantiles t 100 years probability of non exceedance f 0 99 as this quantile is of capital interest for anti flood policies in european countries including poland and whose accurate estimation strongly impacts the costs of hydrological design besides this quantile lies far in the right tail of the distribution function where usually the highest floods locate usually the number of annual maxima k re constructed by means historical hydrological information is small because the process of re construction is costly and time consuming and the credibility of such result is often insufficient for the ffa purposes nevertheless we carried out our experiment for k 2 m in order to analyse the accuracy of estimation with growing fraction of the known historical annual maxima referred to the datasets for which all the elements are known the results of relative bias of quantile estimators x f 0 99 vs k for the true and false assumption of the population models are discussed in detail in the following chapter please bear in mind that the results presented in this paper refer to the errors averaged on the 10 000 of monte carlo single estimations and as such should not be generalised into specific cases 4 results 4 1 true assumption of the model the relative bias for case of the true assumption of the model shown in fig 2 is a sum of the sampling bias and censoring bias the first one results from the insufficient length of the samples used for estimation whereas the latter by definition should strongly depend on heaviness of the censoring of the sample both types of the bias can be of different sign which paradoxically may lead to reduction of the overall value of the total bias generally both the employed distribution functions with the method of the maximum likelihood produce quite small relative bias of the upper quantile for f 0 99 yet not equal to zero the rb values revolve mostly around few percent even though the number of known elements is small heavily censored samples the bias of upper quantile estimator does not exceed 13 for weibull m 30 k 2 cv 1 0 which is good result when we consider that only 2 the minimal number of known elements that enable estimation of 2 models parameters out of 30 sample elements are known one has to bear in mind however that in the same conditions the method of quantiles not shown based on comparison of the theoretical quantiles with the equivalent empirical quantiles produces zero relative bias nacházel 1993 the values of the relative bias rely on the coefficient of variation and generally are smaller for smaller cv note that the relative bias of the upper quantile depend on the number of known elements k when referred to the sample size m the general rule is that the rb tend to 0 when k m see also diagrams in fig 6 because the effect of the heavy censoring is expected to become less influential in the whole value of the bias however interesting is that for the certain range of the k most cases depicted in fig 2 the absolute relative bias slightly rises despite the growing number of known elements in the sample because it is easier to adjust a function to 2 points than for several ones this effect is best observable for average hydrological samples i e m 50 and 100 and for large values of the coefficient of variation cv 1 0 it means that it is worth using only 2 5 highest elements of the re constructed pre instrumental samples with the maximum likelihood method to obtain acceptable accuracy of the estimation of x f 0 99 this is a finding of fundamental importance for the flood frequency analysis and hydrological design carried on the ungauged rivers because the reconstruction of historical peak flows is complex and expensive yet the results of such operations are hardly ever satisfactory for small and large m m 30 and 200 and for smaller cv cv 0 25 and 0 5 this effect is less evident especially for the weibull s model the results for the relative root mean square error of the 100 year quantile fig 3 complete the information about the estimation accuracy provided by the relative bias the values of the rrmse for the true assumption of the model both ge and we are relatively small especially for smaller values of the coefficient of variation cv 0 25 and 0 5 and drop with the rise of k and m obviously the values of the rrmse rise with the coefficient of variation and for instance for weibull m 30 cv 1 0 and small k they exceed even 30 tending to 0 at the infinity they do not reach 0 within the analysed ranges of k and m which informs on small but distinct standard error of the quantile estimator the graphs show also that the length of the recording period m seems to be as important as the number of available estimated discharge values k compare payrastre et al 2011 4 2 the case of a misspecified model when we analyse the errors of the upper quantiles estimation by means of assumed wrong misspecified model the overall bias is then the sum of three types of the biases the model bias sampling and censoring bias see the table 2 the first type of the bias depend on the adequacy of model selection in this study the competing models are quite similar nonetheless the model bias reveals its domination over the other two types of biases in consequence in such a case the total relative bias of the flood quantile x f 0 99 is generally higher than or at least the same for cv 1 0 to the one for true assumption of the model within the whole analysed range of k and m fig 4 usually the differences between the values of relative bias values by true and false models range from a few percent for small values of k up to 30 for cases when k m for these cases both for ge and we as the parent distributions the bias of quantile rises dramatically with k revealing stronger domination of the model bias over the sampling and censoring biases it means that when we are not sure what population the historical sample represents it is better to use only a few highest elements of the sample in other words use heavily censored sample and apply maximum likelihood method of estimation this effect is more noticeable for false assumption of the model than for the true one compare also fig 7 which is very important from the practical point of view because a true underlying model in hydrology is unknown this peculiar behaviour is not observed for cv 1 0 where the rb values of the flood quantile for both true and false models are the same and become exponential distribution since for this value of coefficient of variation both ge and we models produce the same value of quantiles i e the model bias is minimal as far as the relative root mean square error of the x f 0 99 is concerned the values of the rrmse are relatively higher except for cv 1 0 than for the true assumption of the model especially for larger values of k fig 5 the biggest discrepancies between the true and false assumption of the model are observed for weibull as the parent distribution in this case the effect of the improper assumption of the model is particularly noticeable by means of a dramatic rise of the rrmse with k m however it is also visible to a lesser extent in case of the ge as the parent distribution the values for cv 1 0 are the same as for the true assumption of the estimating model the values of the rrmse confirm the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the rb for x f 0 99 4 3 constant ratio of k m results of the relative bias of x f 0 99 related to constant ratio of k m are presented in fig 6 true model assumed and fig 7 misspecified model this presentation of the results provides deeper insight into the behaviour of the censoring sample in both assumptions of the model because the result enables the analysis of the upper quantile relative bias with regard to the fraction of known elements of the historical sample one can observe that this fraction corresponds approximately to empirical probability of exceedance of k th element we use in estimation and that is why the results for different observation periods m can be compared directly with the rise of the k m ratio the impact of the censoring bias component gradually diminishes in the total sum of bias at the expense of the other two components namely sampling bias and model bias if exists obviously regardless whether we apply the true or a false model for estimation of the upper quantile f 0 99 when k m i e k m 1 the values of the sampling bias become smaller and therefore for true assumption of the parent distribution the overall sum of bias for k m 1 is close to 0 the diagrams for true assumption of the model show it clearly that when we deal with the hydrological samples m 50 and 100 there is certain range of the k m ratio where the rb is within acceptable extend even though only few elements of the sample are known and used for estimation which means that the censoring bias is negligible when compared to sampling bias or they are of the reverse signs when a false model is assumed with k m the model bias starts overweighting in the total sum of the upper quantile relative bias the presentation of the relative bias versus the k m ratio shows evidently the effect of the bias variation with the fraction of known elements in the sample the diagrams in fig 7 point into the ranges of the k m ratio for which the absolute systematic error of the upper quantile estimation is minimal or less than for k m when all elements of a sample are known and taken into account in the estimation procedure 5 the vistula at warsaw and the warta at poznan case studies research selection of the appropriate probability distribution of maximum flows as the statistical model to be used in design practice is a crucial decision as the true underlying distribution is not known we support this decision by the tests of model conformity with the sample or some discrimination criteria which do not give a unique nor an optimum solution e g mitosek et al 2006 strupczewski et al 2006 bogdanowicz 2010 markiewicz et al 2015 besides the best model parameters and type chosen for a given data may differ with growing sample size giving significant changes in the upper tail so in design return levels another difficulty is the accuracy of peak flood data especially when historical information is taken into account a common practice in this case is neglecting the data error as we did in this paper however this analysis is advisable and often applied e g gaume 2018 the objective of these case studies is to show how the approach and the results of the simulation experiments presented above can be helpful in applied hydrology two hydrological stations with the longest peak flood data were used i e warsaw with total 210 years of observations from the period 1799 2011 reconstructed by fal from 1799 to 1950 based on the water stages collected and presented in fal and dąbrowski 2001a b and systematic measurements from 1951 and poznan olejnik 1991 of daily discharges of warta at poznan covering the period 1822 1950 linked with further systematic records as a considerable reduction of flood peaks at poznan is played by the jeziorsko reservoir put to use in 1986 in the central river course hence the ninety year annual daily maximum series 1896 1985 was chosen for the research the main characteristics of annual maxima at both hydrological stations are shown in table 3 when dealing with so long series a problem of stationarity of flood formation processes may be encountered the need for long series is obvious from statistical inference efficiency point of view but the longer the series we analyse the more aggravated this problem may be however taking into account the non stationarity of the processes involved in floods formation one introduces additional significant uncertainty in the evaluation of design quantiles related to the uncertainty of the models describing non stationarity which require much detailed information and data analyses e g neppel et al 2010 serinaldi kilsby 2015 and many others for this reason the principle of rational ignorance introduced in economy and social sciences by downs in 1957 can be applied i e that the cost of using a non stationary model to make an informed decision due to its uncertainty can outweigh any potential benefit one could reasonably expect to gain from that decision and so it would be irrational according to this principle we assumed the stationarity of flood formation processes what is however easier to accept for the large catchments as presented in this study than for small ones as stated in rodriguez et al 2010 a possible explanation for the lack of response of land use and land cover changes in flood characteristics including climate background and feedbacks at larger scales could be the non linear integration of hydrological processes across scales combined with a variety of land uses and land history which increase in heterogeneity with catchment size fitting a set of probability distributions usually used in the flood frequency analysis composed of weibull gamma log normal gumbel and generalised exponential distributions to the whole data series by means of mlm is presented in fig 8 a and b and in table 4 to be consistent with the theoretical part of this article we decided to use here only two parameter distribution functions as it can be expected keeping in mind the properties of ml method all fitted distributions describe rather closely the main body of the probability whilst exhibit discrepancies in their upper tails the 99 quantiles presented in table 4 quantify the differences in design quantile what is a real problem for practitioners the range of 99 quantiles got by fitting the selected 5 distributions is equal 1650 m3s 1 at warsaw and 175 m3 s 1 at poznan it is worth noting that these differences can be much greater in the case of shorter data series the best fitted distributions in the sense of aic criterion are ge distribution warsaw and log normal poznan if we admit that all information about the magnitude of floods at our disposal is limited to several largest floods in the given time period see fig 9 the heavily censored sample approach can be used for both hydrological stations warsaw and poznan we performed the estimation on the base of 2 3 4 and 5 largest elements of the series according to eq 1 the results are presented in fig 10 for k 2 only and table 5 having estimated the parameters for 5 candidate distributions their values were used to calculate if possible the return levels for the entire range of probability see fig 10 just to show the inverse picture than depicted in fig 8 when the main body of the distribution is located not in moderate but extreme peak flows the estimation method based on censored samples gives strong conformity of estimates of 99 quantiles for all distributions used in the study as can be seen in table 5 this conformity slightly decreases as the next large elements are added and the estimated quantiles also differ however these differences do not exceed those obtained for the entire sample table 4 the question how many largest elements are necessary to obtain reliable estimates of 99 quantile is answered in the simulation studies in the third section of this paper the mean relative bias and the relative root mean square error of 99 quantile estimated on the base of heavily censored sample in the case of false distribution assumption figs 4 5 and 7 depends mainly on the time period from which these largest flows originate when we use only 2 largest elements in a given period we can expect that the absolute bias will be lower than the absolute bias obtained if all elements of the sample are known and even close to zero for sample sizes of 100 mean relative root square error also shows a similar regularity albeit for short sample sizes e g of 30 elements it can be at most comparable to the assessment based on the entire sample the bias and root square error presented in figs 4 5 and 7 are the mean values from about 10 000 simulations so in specific cases the results can be different from averaged values however it does not change the main features of errors behaviour in censored samples given the historical largest peak flows it seems to be reasonable to analyse all let us say k largest historical records estimating the 99 quantile for i 1 k note that we can use misspecified distribution without much worry about its compatibility heavily censored sample approach seems to be helpful in regional analysis when in ungauged sites we have only the historical peak flow assessments it may happen that only 2 historical largest flows in a given period are known then the advantage is to use the any distribution function to get the estimate of 99 quantile but this estimation can fail when this 2 largest elements are the same or very close to each other 6 discussion and conclusions the maximum likelihood method for heavily censored samples type ii exhibits good properties with regard to the relative bias and the root mean square error of hundred year maximum flow quantile these properties are much better when we assumed a false model what is the case in the ffa as the parent distribution remains unknown the heavy censoring can provide satisfactory assessments when dealing with the series composed with historical and systematic data when only the largest flows generally composed with historical data are in use the method can also be applied when only few peak flows of the largest historical floods are available e g for ungauged rivers providing estimates of the design quantile the question is whether using only historical information to estimate design quantiles is rational due to its high uncertainty and so its influence on the results of the design quantile estimation payrastre et al 2011 indeed historical flows reconstructed even with all diligence and use of authentic sources of information cannot reach the accuracy of contemporary flow rate measurements one of the main reasons is usually the lack of information about the ancient shape and the slope of the riverbed rarely studied and documented in historical materials therefore the largest errors in the assessment of flows will occur for rivers with an unstable riverbed alluvial meandering etc the uncertainties of assessment of flow for historical data and its influence on ffa results has been discussed by numerous authors e g cook 1987 neppel et al 2010 payrastre et al 2011 serinaldi kilsby 2015 and many others however it should be stressed that other existing methods for design quantile assessment for ungauged catchments hydrological analogy method application of hydrological models and others do not guarantee the desired accuracy as well e g kohnová et al 2015 nwaogazie et al 2018 the proposed methodology can be used also when the whole sample of m years of observation is available performing the estimation on the base of few largest elements in the sample one can obtain the assessment of the design quantile less biased than for entire sample and with root mean square error comparable with full data set assessment and additionally almost not depending on the chosen distributional model the upper tail discrepancies in this case due to the estimation of various candidate models are almost negligible and they keep almost stable i e slightly decreasing with growing m until a flood greater than the smallest historical flood will occur the method presented here can be competitive in respect to threshold methods truncated series when the tails of distributions above the chosen threshold are modelled using the generalised pareto distribution e g macdonald black 2010 note that the minimum number of the largest elements to perform the estimation in this case is 3 while for heavily censored samples and two parameter distributions 2 elements is enough the results of heavily censored samples depend on the length of the time period the historical and systematic data if any comes from and the skewness of the data the best results were observed for moderate skewness and time period of about 100 years we consider that the approach presented in our paper for the 100 year quantile could be a turning point in the estimation of the upper tails of the distribution

5678,the common practice to improve the assessments of design upper quantiles of annual flow maxima distribution is incorporating historical data into flood frequency estimates which in general are greater than the systematic flood maxima records a big body of literature was dedicated to this issue showing the advantages and constraints of this approach but the research was not concentrated on the largest floods which for many reasons cannot be treated in the same way as less important ones assuming that only few k largest flood peaks in the specified time period m are known we applied maximum likelihood censoring type ii method to estimate a hundred year flow quantile the relative bias supported by the relative root mean square error of the estimates were evaluated in numerical simulation experiments for different values of k and m performed under true and false distribution assumptions the main and surprising result of the experiments is that in case of a false model assumption the estimation of the upper tail quantiles based on few largest floods in a given period can provide comparable or even better estimates in the sense of the relative bias and relative root mean square error than the estimation for the whole sample encouraged by the results of numerical experiments in the aspect of historical heavily censored samples we found that it might be reasonable to use this approach in a situation where all elements of the series of observation are known but the upper tail of the distribution in our case f 0 99 quantile will be assessed using only the largest records the results are presented in the case study research keywords flood frequency analysis historical information peak flows heavy censoring type ii maximum likelihood 1 introduction the key problems encountered in the flood frequency analysis ffa are the size and the low accuracy of the peak flow series used for estimation of the quantiles of long return period the data series are usually too short to properly reproduce the upper tails of the probability distribution functions and the flow assessments although better and better thanks to modern measurement devices and development of flow rate curves construction methods they still remain inaccurate especially in the range of the largest waters therefore assuming stationarity of the main flood generating processes and extending the systematic observation series by including estimates of the peak flows of the largest historical floods is the most popular way to improve the accuracy of upper quantile estimates e g kjeldsen et al 2014 nguyen et al 2014 halbert et al 2016 england et al 2018 davis et al 2019 obviously systematic datasets are available only for gauged stations whereas the historical information usually constitutes the only if any flood information for the ungauged rivers the effects of addition of historical data to the systematic observations has already been analysed in various contexts in a number of papers stedinger baker 1987 francés et al 1994 bayliss reed 2001 calenda et al 2009 elleder et al 2013 herget et al 2014 machado et al 2015 strupczewski et al 2014 2017 volpi et al 2019 and many other when some historical information is available in addition to systematic records one deals in fact with two random samples i a complete dataset from systematic observations period and ii a heavily censored sample of historical floods when analysing a censored historical series one has to remember and take into account that the systematic series sometimes includes values greater than the historical floods both datasets i and ii represent the same but unknown population stationarity assumption therefore they are jointly used both for selection of a proper distribution model and estimation of its parameters and quantiles of interest at first the procedures for extending systematic measurements by historical flood information were based on plotting positions and graphical concepts zhang 1982 bernieur et al 1986 wang adams 1984 hirsch 1987 stedinger cohn 1986 ding yang 1988 and later hosking 1995 introduced the probability weighted moments pwm with their modification the l moments to modelling of the incomplete records additionally hosking and wallis 1986a b applied the maximum likelihood ml estimation method whereas vigilione et al 2013 and lumbroso et al 2019 incorporated the bayesian estimation paradigm to address the problem of historical floods in systematic datasets despite the fact that practically all methods of estimation known in the ffa may be used in estimation of upper quantiles the maximum likelihood method mlm is commonly applied for the systematic data combined with historical information the mlm s estimators of parameters and quantiles are asymptotically unbiased when the assumed model is true but the method itself concentrates on the main mass of the probability so usually far from the upper quantiles strupczewski 2000 the theoretical benefits of the mlm e g unbiasness and good efficiency of estimators disappear when the parent distribution remains unknown and other so misspecified distributional model is fitted to the dataset strupczewski et al 2002a b because apart from sampling errors one faces also the model error strupczewski et al 2014 proved inter alia that optimal estimator of return period of one historical flood is the period twice as long as the time interval since historical event until the date of the first systematic measurement moreover they showed that in some cases the profit resulting from using historical information in systematic dataset is small in another paper strupczewski et al 2017 estimated maximal theoretical gain which can be achieved when one or two historical floods are adjoined to the systematic annual peak flow dataset this profit is of course bigger for two historical floods than for one but remains small and should be confronted with usually high the cost of reconstruction of historical floods while working on the latter article we discovered that the model and sampling bias besides there is another type of bias which we called by analogy the censoring bias of the maximum likelihood estimate of parameters and quantiles the ungauged rivers usually outnumber the gauged ones so the statistical modelling of floods without reliable information about the rivers became a challenge for scientists and practitioners kohnová et al 2015 in such case one deals with the censored data during the historical period apart from regional estimation methods or techniques based on hydrological similarity the appreciation of pre instrumental hydrological data seems to point the promising direction towards flood modelling in ungauged rivers therefore we aim in answering the question whether the historical data by themselves constitute valuable information about contemporary floods occurring in the ungauged rivers in this paper we scrutinize the censoring bias as a part of total bias apart from sampling and model biases of the design quantile estimated by means of the maximum likelihood method mlm when only the highest peak flow data are available please note that highest peak flows do not have to belong to the historical period although they usually do here we employ the two parameter distribution functions models used in flood frequency analysis namely generalised exponential ge gupta kundu 1999 and weibull we weibull 1951 distribution functions for various sizes of historical datasets we decided to employ the two parameter distribution functions with the location parameter equal to 0 mainly for practical reasons because the results of calculations for two parameter distribution functions are easier to present and more vivid no third degree of freedom i e cs without the loss of generalisation however we are aware that in general two parameter models suffer more for bias than three and multi parameter ones strupczewski et al 2005 kochanek et al 2005 we consider both true and false assumption of the underlying statistical distribution of annual peak flows for brevity we assumed that the synthetic historical datasets used in our experiments are homogeneous independent and stationary although we are aware that in real cases such assumptions are mostly false the article is organised in 5 sections as follows we define the problem in the first section section 2 contains the description of numerical simulation experiments and their results are presented in section 3 the case study research can be found in section 4 and the discussion with conclusions in the last section 2 problem formulation usually the highest floods are best remembered and hence recorded in historical annals of monasteries abbeys courts and town halls when we interpret this information to receive the dataset of largest historical discharge values as a result we deal with a censored sample type ii of censoring of size m containing the k largest available remembered interpreted elements fig 1 the floods marked as unknown in fig 1 can also have the status of treated as unknown if we know all elements of the m year long series and we want to estimate the upper quantiles on the base of the largest elements only note that censoring type ii and truncation are not the same procedures truncated samples or distributions are often used in ffa to capture the upper tail behaviour in the form of e g peak over threshold pot or partial duration series pds analysis when we set a threshold on the data and consider only peaks or the elements of the sample larger than the chosen threshold in the censoring type ii procedure the threshold is imposed not on the flow data but on the order statistics e g we keep only k largest elements of the sample for the inference about the distribution of upper tail to find the maximum of likelihood function l the number of known elements in the sample k should be at least equal to the number of the parameters to be estimated θ and consequently the number of likelihood equations to be solved as two parameter models are considered in our study k 2 is the smallest number that allows estimation of parameters the likelihood function for the censored sample consists of two factors e g francés et al 1994 1a l m k f θ x k m k i 1 k f θ x i or in the form more convenient for calculations 1b ln l m k l n f θ x k i 1 k l n f θ x i where l likelihood function m the length of the dataset k the number of known historical elements f probability cumulative function of the assumed statistical model f probability density function of the statistical model θ vector of model parameters xi i th element of the historical dataset in general the exact date of the historical floods may be unknown therefore the function of likelihood l should be multiplied by the term m k see eq 1a however it was removed from the eq 1b because this term does not influence the results of the optimisation in both cases i e known or unknown year of occurrence estimation of the flood quantiles consists on the optimisation of l function with respect to the θ parameters with the use of the sample xi i 1 2 k the relative bias rb of the upper quantile x f serves here as the basic criterion of the accuracy of the estimation the values of the rb are to reflect the total bias and are calculated as the mean difference between the quantile estimator x f obtained by means of the censored dataset and the population quantile xf referred to the population true value of quantile 2 r b x f e x f x f x f 100 in our case the relative bias rb of the quantile of interest x f can be decomposed into 3 parts namely model bias due to model misspecification sampling bias due to limited time m and censoring bias due to the censoring degree m k m i e the ratio of the number of unknown elements and the total time period m however it is impossible to calculate these biases separately and only the total bias can be assessed by eq 2 we will return to this issue in section 3 for completion the relative root mean square error rrmse of the upper quantile x f was calculated 3 r r m s e x f e x f x f 2 x f 100 the rrmse was implemented in the analysis because together with the br it provides information about the standard error of the quantiles estimators 3 numerical experiments to mitigate the effects of randomness that may blur the results the monte carlo experiment was carried out which enables to obtain expected values of estimators based on 10 000 semi randomly generated samples every sample consists of the population values of the ordered sample of size m which is called the synthetic sample from m generated numbers only k known largest ones are selected and as a result we obtain synthetic censored sample for further calculations it means that the value of the smallest element in the dataset xk changes in each of the generated 10 000 synthetic samples however the effect of the large scale averages the resulting bias our previous research revealed that this method of generation provides more accurate sample elements than the values based on plotting positions compare strupczewski et al 2017 table 2 where each element of the synthetic sample was an average value of 1000 elements of the same plotting position from every of 1000 generated synthetic samples as a result unlike in this research we obtained one averaged sample of m elements for further analysis we have chosen 2 two parameter distribution functions for the experiment generalised exponential ge and weibull we though quite different in their features see table 1 these both models are the extension of the classical exponential distributions but in different way gupta and kundu 1999 2001a 2003 note that when the shape parameters b λ 1 both weibull and generalised exponential distributions become the exponential distribution with constant skewness coefficient equal to 2 both models are also similar in their features to the gamma pearson type 3 distribution function barreto souza et al 2010 so to the certain extend they can be used alternatively gupta kundu 2001b the ge distribution is considered to have a heavier tail than the we so the estimators of quantiles of the same probability are smaller for the we than for ge distribution especially for smaller probability of non exceedance up to f 0 9999 gupta kundu 2003 analysed the discrimination between these two models and observed that in many situations ge distribution provides better fit to datasets than the weibull s the weibull model is commonly used in flood frequency analysis institute of meteorology and water management imgw 2005 kochanek et al 2012 rao and hamed 2000 rizwan et al 2018 whereas the generalised exponential is relatively new model in the hydrology introduced to polish hydrology by brzeziński 2010 but its performance in the estimation of annual peak flows for polish lowland rivers seems to be promising markiewicz et al 2015 and therefore it was considered in the experiment we scrutinised both true and false assumptions of the estimation models in the hydrological literature there are at least few versions of parametrisation of the competing distributions but for we used the convenient formulae proposed by rao hamed 2000 and for ge recently published by markiewicz et al 2015 see table 1 the two competing models were used to generate particular m elements synthetic samples for various values of the coefficient of variation cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 and different sizes m 30 50 100 and 200 it was assumed that of these m elements only k largest elements are known in our experiment k 2 m the size of the samples reflects the usual datasets numbers used in flood frequency analysis there is no use to conduct any statistical analysis for peak flows datasets smaller than 30 elements on the other hand the samples that exceed 200 years hardly ever happen in hydrology obviously the number of known historical floods k is usually much lower than the period m they represent the population generator of the synthetic samples mean value μ equals to 10 for all generated samples and was chosen for the numerical reasons however theoretically the mean value has no impact for the relative bias results the presumed variability of the synthetic samples reflects the range of the cv values characteristic for flow maxima series in polish rivers compare kochanek et al 2012 table i markiewicz et al 2015 diagram 1 for two parameter distributions the cv values are functions of the shape parameters which for cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 are equal to λ 92 35 5 91 1 0 for generalised exponential respectively and b 4 54 2 1 1 0 for weibull respectively for completeness it is important to recall that the skewness coefficient for both distributions is the function of the shape parameter only and for cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 it equals cs 1 15 1 31 and 2 respectively for generalised exponential for weibull the cs values are far more diversified cs 0 19 for cv 0 25 cs 0 57 cv 0 5 and cs 2 cv 1 the experiment was carried out for 100 year flood quantiles t 100 years probability of non exceedance f 0 99 as this quantile is of capital interest for anti flood policies in european countries including poland and whose accurate estimation strongly impacts the costs of hydrological design besides this quantile lies far in the right tail of the distribution function where usually the highest floods locate usually the number of annual maxima k re constructed by means historical hydrological information is small because the process of re construction is costly and time consuming and the credibility of such result is often insufficient for the ffa purposes nevertheless we carried out our experiment for k 2 m in order to analyse the accuracy of estimation with growing fraction of the known historical annual maxima referred to the datasets for which all the elements are known the results of relative bias of quantile estimators x f 0 99 vs k for the true and false assumption of the population models are discussed in detail in the following chapter please bear in mind that the results presented in this paper refer to the errors averaged on the 10 000 of monte carlo single estimations and as such should not be generalised into specific cases 4 results 4 1 true assumption of the model the relative bias for case of the true assumption of the model shown in fig 2 is a sum of the sampling bias and censoring bias the first one results from the insufficient length of the samples used for estimation whereas the latter by definition should strongly depend on heaviness of the censoring of the sample both types of the bias can be of different sign which paradoxically may lead to reduction of the overall value of the total bias generally both the employed distribution functions with the method of the maximum likelihood produce quite small relative bias of the upper quantile for f 0 99 yet not equal to zero the rb values revolve mostly around few percent even though the number of known elements is small heavily censored samples the bias of upper quantile estimator does not exceed 13 for weibull m 30 k 2 cv 1 0 which is good result when we consider that only 2 the minimal number of known elements that enable estimation of 2 models parameters out of 30 sample elements are known one has to bear in mind however that in the same conditions the method of quantiles not shown based on comparison of the theoretical quantiles with the equivalent empirical quantiles produces zero relative bias nacházel 1993 the values of the relative bias rely on the coefficient of variation and generally are smaller for smaller cv note that the relative bias of the upper quantile depend on the number of known elements k when referred to the sample size m the general rule is that the rb tend to 0 when k m see also diagrams in fig 6 because the effect of the heavy censoring is expected to become less influential in the whole value of the bias however interesting is that for the certain range of the k most cases depicted in fig 2 the absolute relative bias slightly rises despite the growing number of known elements in the sample because it is easier to adjust a function to 2 points than for several ones this effect is best observable for average hydrological samples i e m 50 and 100 and for large values of the coefficient of variation cv 1 0 it means that it is worth using only 2 5 highest elements of the re constructed pre instrumental samples with the maximum likelihood method to obtain acceptable accuracy of the estimation of x f 0 99 this is a finding of fundamental importance for the flood frequency analysis and hydrological design carried on the ungauged rivers because the reconstruction of historical peak flows is complex and expensive yet the results of such operations are hardly ever satisfactory for small and large m m 30 and 200 and for smaller cv cv 0 25 and 0 5 this effect is less evident especially for the weibull s model the results for the relative root mean square error of the 100 year quantile fig 3 complete the information about the estimation accuracy provided by the relative bias the values of the rrmse for the true assumption of the model both ge and we are relatively small especially for smaller values of the coefficient of variation cv 0 25 and 0 5 and drop with the rise of k and m obviously the values of the rrmse rise with the coefficient of variation and for instance for weibull m 30 cv 1 0 and small k they exceed even 30 tending to 0 at the infinity they do not reach 0 within the analysed ranges of k and m which informs on small but distinct standard error of the quantile estimator the graphs show also that the length of the recording period m seems to be as important as the number of available estimated discharge values k compare payrastre et al 2011 4 2 the case of a misspecified model when we analyse the errors of the upper quantiles estimation by means of assumed wrong misspecified model the overall bias is then the sum of three types of the biases the model bias sampling and censoring bias see the table 2 the first type of the bias depend on the adequacy of model selection in this study the competing models are quite similar nonetheless the model bias reveals its domination over the other two types of biases in consequence in such a case the total relative bias of the flood quantile x f 0 99 is generally higher than or at least the same for cv 1 0 to the one for true assumption of the model within the whole analysed range of k and m fig 4 usually the differences between the values of relative bias values by true and false models range from a few percent for small values of k up to 30 for cases when k m for these cases both for ge and we as the parent distributions the bias of quantile rises dramatically with k revealing stronger domination of the model bias over the sampling and censoring biases it means that when we are not sure what population the historical sample represents it is better to use only a few highest elements of the sample in other words use heavily censored sample and apply maximum likelihood method of estimation this effect is more noticeable for false assumption of the model than for the true one compare also fig 7 which is very important from the practical point of view because a true underlying model in hydrology is unknown this peculiar behaviour is not observed for cv 1 0 where the rb values of the flood quantile for both true and false models are the same and become exponential distribution since for this value of coefficient of variation both ge and we models produce the same value of quantiles i e the model bias is minimal as far as the relative root mean square error of the x f 0 99 is concerned the values of the rrmse are relatively higher except for cv 1 0 than for the true assumption of the model especially for larger values of k fig 5 the biggest discrepancies between the true and false assumption of the model are observed for weibull as the parent distribution in this case the effect of the improper assumption of the model is particularly noticeable by means of a dramatic rise of the rrmse with k m however it is also visible to a lesser extent in case of the ge as the parent distribution the values for cv 1 0 are the same as for the true assumption of the estimating model the values of the rrmse confirm the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the rb for x f 0 99 4 3 constant ratio of k m results of the relative bias of x f 0 99 related to constant ratio of k m are presented in fig 6 true model assumed and fig 7 misspecified model this presentation of the results provides deeper insight into the behaviour of the censoring sample in both assumptions of the model because the result enables the analysis of the upper quantile relative bias with regard to the fraction of known elements of the historical sample one can observe that this fraction corresponds approximately to empirical probability of exceedance of k th element we use in estimation and that is why the results for different observation periods m can be compared directly with the rise of the k m ratio the impact of the censoring bias component gradually diminishes in the total sum of bias at the expense of the other two components namely sampling bias and model bias if exists obviously regardless whether we apply the true or a false model for estimation of the upper quantile f 0 99 when k m i e k m 1 the values of the sampling bias become smaller and therefore for true assumption of the parent distribution the overall sum of bias for k m 1 is close to 0 the diagrams for true assumption of the model show it clearly that when we deal with the hydrological samples m 50 and 100 there is certain range of the k m ratio where the rb is within acceptable extend even though only few elements of the sample are known and used for estimation which means that the censoring bias is negligible when compared to sampling bias or they are of the reverse signs when a false model is assumed with k m the model bias starts overweighting in the total sum of the upper quantile relative bias the presentation of the relative bias versus the k m ratio shows evidently the effect of the bias variation with the fraction of known elements in the sample the diagrams in fig 7 point into the ranges of the k m ratio for which the absolute systematic error of the upper quantile estimation is minimal or less than for k m when all elements of a sample are known and taken into account in the estimation procedure 5 the vistula at warsaw and the warta at poznan case studies research selection of the appropriate probability distribution of maximum flows as the statistical model to be used in design practice is a crucial decision as the true underlying distribution is not known we support this decision by the tests of model conformity with the sample or some discrimination criteria which do not give a unique nor an optimum solution e g mitosek et al 2006 strupczewski et al 2006 bogdanowicz 2010 markiewicz et al 2015 besides the best model parameters and type chosen for a given data may differ with growing sample size giving significant changes in the upper tail so in design return levels another difficulty is the accuracy of peak flood data especially when historical information is taken into account a common practice in this case is neglecting the data error as we did in this paper however this analysis is advisable and often applied e g gaume 2018 the objective of these case studies is to show how the approach and the results of the simulation experiments presented above can be helpful in applied hydrology two hydrological stations with the longest peak flood data were used i e warsaw with total 210 years of observations from the period 1799 2011 reconstructed by fal from 1799 to 1950 based on the water stages collected and presented in fal and dąbrowski 2001a b and systematic measurements from 1951 and poznan olejnik 1991 of daily discharges of warta at poznan covering the period 1822 1950 linked with further systematic records as a considerable reduction of flood peaks at poznan is played by the jeziorsko reservoir put to use in 1986 in the central river course hence the ninety year annual daily maximum series 1896 1985 was chosen for the research the main characteristics of annual maxima at both hydrological stations are shown in table 3 when dealing with so long series a problem of stationarity of flood formation processes may be encountered the need for long series is obvious from statistical inference efficiency point of view but the longer the series we analyse the more aggravated this problem may be however taking into account the non stationarity of the processes involved in floods formation one introduces additional significant uncertainty in the evaluation of design quantiles related to the uncertainty of the models describing non stationarity which require much detailed information and data analyses e g neppel et al 2010 serinaldi kilsby 2015 and many others for this reason the principle of rational ignorance introduced in economy and social sciences by downs in 1957 can be applied i e that the cost of using a non stationary model to make an informed decision due to its uncertainty can outweigh any potential benefit one could reasonably expect to gain from that decision and so it would be irrational according to this principle we assumed the stationarity of flood formation processes what is however easier to accept for the large catchments as presented in this study than for small ones as stated in rodriguez et al 2010 a possible explanation for the lack of response of land use and land cover changes in flood characteristics including climate background and feedbacks at larger scales could be the non linear integration of hydrological processes across scales combined with a variety of land uses and land history which increase in heterogeneity with catchment size fitting a set of probability distributions usually used in the flood frequency analysis composed of weibull gamma log normal gumbel and generalised exponential distributions to the whole data series by means of mlm is presented in fig 8 a and b and in table 4 to be consistent with the theoretical part of this article we decided to use here only two parameter distribution functions as it can be expected keeping in mind the properties of ml method all fitted distributions describe rather closely the main body of the probability whilst exhibit discrepancies in their upper tails the 99 quantiles presented in table 4 quantify the differences in design quantile what is a real problem for practitioners the range of 99 quantiles got by fitting the selected 5 distributions is equal 1650 m3s 1 at warsaw and 175 m3 s 1 at poznan it is worth noting that these differences can be much greater in the case of shorter data series the best fitted distributions in the sense of aic criterion are ge distribution warsaw and log normal poznan if we admit that all information about the magnitude of floods at our disposal is limited to several largest floods in the given time period see fig 9 the heavily censored sample approach can be used for both hydrological stations warsaw and poznan we performed the estimation on the base of 2 3 4 and 5 largest elements of the series according to eq 1 the results are presented in fig 10 for k 2 only and table 5 having estimated the parameters for 5 candidate distributions their values were used to calculate if possible the return levels for the entire range of probability see fig 10 just to show the inverse picture than depicted in fig 8 when the main body of the distribution is located not in moderate but extreme peak flows the estimation method based on censored samples gives strong conformity of estimates of 99 quantiles for all distributions used in the study as can be seen in table 5 this conformity slightly decreases as the next large elements are added and the estimated quantiles also differ however these differences do not exceed those obtained for the entire sample table 4 the question how many largest elements are necessary to obtain reliable estimates of 99 quantile is answered in the simulation studies in the third section of this paper the mean relative bias and the relative root mean square error of 99 quantile estimated on the base of heavily censored sample in the case of false distribution assumption figs 4 5 and 7 depends mainly on the time period from which these largest flows originate when we use only 2 largest elements in a given period we can expect that the absolute bias will be lower than the absolute bias obtained if all elements of the sample are known and even close to zero for sample sizes of 100 mean relative root square error also shows a similar regularity albeit for short sample sizes e g of 30 elements it can be at most comparable to the assessment based on the entire sample the bias and root square error presented in figs 4 5 and 7 are the mean values from about 10 000 simulations so in specific cases the results can be different from averaged values however it does not change the main features of errors behaviour in censored samples given the historical largest peak flows it seems to be reasonable to analyse all let us say k largest historical records estimating the 99 quantile for i 1 k note that we can use misspecified distribution without much worry about its compatibility heavily censored sample approach seems to be helpful in regional analysis when in ungauged sites we have only the historical peak flow assessments it may happen that only 2 historical largest flows in a given period are known then the advantage is to use the any distribution function to get the estimate of 99 quantile but this estimation can fail when this 2 largest elements are the same or very close to each other 6 discussion and conclusions the maximum likelihood method for heavily censored samples type ii exhibits good properties with regard to the relative bias and the root mean square error of hundred year maximum flow quantile these properties are much better when we assumed a false model what is the case in the ffa as the parent distribution remains unknown the heavy censoring can provide satisfactory assessments when dealing with the series composed with historical and systematic data when only the largest flows generally composed with historical data are in use the method can also be applied when only few peak flows of the largest historical floods are available e g for ungauged rivers providing estimates of the design quantile the question is whether using only historical information to estimate design quantiles is rational due to its high uncertainty and so its influence on the results of the design quantile estimation payrastre et al 2011 indeed historical flows reconstructed even with all diligence and use of authentic sources of information cannot reach the accuracy of contemporary flow rate measurements one of the main reasons is usually the lack of information about the ancient shape and the slope of the riverbed rarely studied and documented in historical materials therefore the largest errors in the assessment of flows will occur for rivers with an unstable riverbed alluvial meandering etc the uncertainties of assessment of flow for historical data and its influence on ffa results has been discussed by numerous authors e g cook 1987 neppel et al 2010 payrastre et al 2011 serinaldi kilsby 2015 and many others however it should be stressed that other existing methods for design quantile assessment for ungauged catchments hydrological analogy method application of hydrological models and others do not guarantee the desired accuracy as well e g kohnová et al 2015 nwaogazie et al 2018 the proposed methodology can be used also when the whole sample of m years of observation is available performing the estimation on the base of few largest elements in the sample one can obtain the assessment of the design quantile less biased than for entire sample and with root mean square error comparable with full data set assessment and additionally almost not depending on the chosen distributional model the upper tail discrepancies in this case due to the estimation of various candidate models are almost negligible and they keep almost stable i e slightly decreasing with growing m until a flood greater than the smallest historical flood will occur the method presented here can be competitive in respect to threshold methods truncated series when the tails of distributions above the chosen threshold are modelled using the generalised pareto distribution e g macdonald black 2010 note that the minimum number of the largest elements to perform the estimation in this case is 3 while for heavily censored samples and two parameter distributions 2 elements is enough the results of heavily censored samples depend on the length of the time period the historical and systematic data if any comes from and the skewness of the data the best results were observed for moderate skewness and time period of about 100 years we consider that the approach presented in our paper for the 100 year quantile could be a turning point in the estimation of the upper tails of the distribution

5679,erosion is the process of land degradation due to rainfall and other environmental factors and it can be described by indices such as the kinetic energy of rainfall ke microphysical data from disdrometers have been used to determine the relationship between kinetic energy content kemm in j m 2 mm 1 and rainfall intensity r in mm h 1 optical disdrometer pws100 measurements were gathered between 2014 and 2018 at five sampling sites across mexico and the data analyzed to study the characteristics of kemm r relationships with altitude a pws100 unit at each of the sampling sites was collocated a few meters from a tipping bucket rain gauge to record r simultaneously individual raindrops fall speeds measured with the disdrometers were found to agree well with theoretical estimations using the environmental conditions at each sampling site the mean fall velocities indicated that raindrops detected at the continental sampling sites medium and high altitudes have greater speeds than those near coastal areas low altitudes comparisons of the estimated kemm for rainy periods with comparable r show greater values as the altitude increases this result is attributed to the increase of raindrop fall speed due to the air density decrement with altitude exponential relations between kemm and r based on one minute sampling periods were fitted for each sampling site producing high values of coefficients of determination and suggesting a good response finally the maximum kinetic energy parameter kemax in the empirical kemm r equations was found to increase with altitude these findings indicate that the detachment of soil particles by individual drops are magnified at higher altitude locations keywords rainfall kinetic energy content soil erosion raindrop fall velocity optical disdrometers mexico 1 introduction soils are produced by weathering processes from solid unweathered rock or loose rock material such as gravel or sand soil erosion is a degradation process caused by natural rainfall wind and runoff among other natural processes and anthropogenic urbanization clearing and logging of forested areas construction and mining factors weggel and rustom 1992 fornis et al 2005 petan et al 2010 angulo martínez and barros 2015 this degradation process affects important soil functions such as food production and the soil s capacity to filter buffer and transform materials in the biosphere blum et al 2006 erosion can be classified as interrill and rill erosion fornis et al 2005 in interrill erosion the impact of raindrops is a key agent for soil loss and a dominant agent of water erosion ellison 1952 rose 1960 lattanzi et al 1974 salles and poesen 2000 during impact drops exert a force on the surface which is converted to shear stress that separates the soil particles from the soil matrix ellison 1945 according to bako et al 2017 the total amount of detached soil during a rainfall event is essentially the sum of soil detached by individual raindrops furbish et al 2007 demonstrated that the extent of the area affected by the impact of raindrops depends on the type of soil grain size the raindrop properties drop diameter and the surface slope rainfall erosivity is the ability of rainfall to detach soil particles salles and poesen 2000 van dijk et al 2002 lobo and bonilla 2015 angulo martínez et al 2016 and its knowledge is helpful to quantify erosion processes sanchez moreno et al 2012 which are highly dependent on rainfall energy therefore rainfall erosivity depends on the intensity and amount of rainfall and on the size of the raindrops jayawardena and rezaur 2000 since the last century there have been studies and experiments on erosion and its relation to various rainfall parameters such as kinetic energy ke but the global diversity of topography and other characteristics have made it necessary to conduct locally targeted investigations to estimate the relations between ke and rain erosivity petan et al 2010 empirical models have mainly related rain erosivity to kinetic energy equal to half the particle mass times the square of its velocity kinnell 1981 van dijk et al 2002 morgan 2005 or to momentum the particle mass times its velocity salles et al 2002 fornis et al 2005 lim et al 2015 there are two different forms to relate the ke of rainfall to its intensity r in mm h 1 the rate of expenditure of rainfall ke ket expressed in units of energy area time and the flux of rainfall ke expended by the unit quantity of rain when the amount of rain is expressed as a depth kemm kemm is also known as kinetic energy content and is expressed in units of energy area depth rosewell 1986 petan et al 2010 based on its definition kemm represents the average squared velocity of the population of raindrops arriving at the soil sempere torres 1994 in most of the reported relationships ke is not linearly related to soil loss lobo and bonilla 2015 according to kinnell 1981 an exponential expression provides a better description of the relationship of kemm and r of rainfall the exponential relationship is also a continuous equation with a positive value at zero rainfall intensity that predicts acceptable estimates of kemm at low r the typical rainfall condition during the occurrence of rain events and at high intensities it asymptotically approaches a value with physical meaning brown and foster 1987 lobo and bonilla 2015 the equation has the following general form 1 k e mm k e max 1 a e b r where kemax is the maximum ke content j m 2 mm 1 and a and b are empirical constants a determines the ke content at very low rainfall intensities the minimum kinetic energy content and b determines the shape of the curve kinnell 1981 van dijk et al 2002 sanchez moreno et al 2012 according to the literature the applicability of empirical parameterizations following eq 1 is limited because of their dependence on geographical and meteorological conditions for a detailed discussion see serio et al 2019 other studies have suggested that momentum produces slightly better results with lower uncertainty than kinetic energy in estimating soil detachment rose 1960 salles and poesen 2000 lim et al 2015 furbish et al 2007 performed high speed imaging of drop impacts on sand targets under controlled laboratory conditions and their results showed that the amount of displaced grains increases in proportion to the momentum of the drop and drop size and varies with grain size even so rainfall kinetic energy is widely used in many empirical models to estimate rainfall erosivity van dijk et al 2002 morgan 2005 several studies have presented various equations relating ke with r and there seems to be a consensus about regression parameters being unique and highly dependent on the geographic locations lobo and bonilla 2015 angulo martínez et al 2016 besides it is well known that the terminal velocity of raindrops changes with altitude and there are expressions that allow terminal velocities to be adjusted for this best 1950 foote and du toit 1969 beard 1985 among others because the parameters used to estimate ke are the mass and fall speed of the raindrops it should be expected that ke and the momentum of storms change with altitude which restricts the use of relationships found in various places and computing rainfall erosivity becomes very limited for most places on the planet the objective of this work is not to identify an equation that provides the best fit to the local characteristics of rainfall ke but to address another general question using data obtained at five different sampling sites in particular this study explores the influence of the measured fall velocity of raindrops on the ke of storms as a function of the sampling site altitude the analysis of the results for ke and the regression parameters for an exponential equation like that proposed by kinnell 1981 should suggest a tendency for kemax with respect to the altitude and thus the air pressure or air density of the study sites these results could potentially be used in models for predicting the erosiveness of rainfall for soil erosion in a wide variety of locations 2 data and methods 2 1 sampling sites data were gathered at five observatories of the university network of atmospheric observatories ruoa https www ruoa unam mx which are located in different areas throughout mexico fig 1 the observatories in mexico city unam and juriquilla jqro are in urban areas on the high plateau of mexico the rest are in natural protected areas one in a national park in the high mountain region of central mexico altz and the other two in coastal biological research stations near the pacific ocean cham and the gulf of mexico ltux except for altz which is located on a hillside all the other sites are situated on plain grounds the differences of the climatic characteristics between most of the chosen sites see details in the corresponding sections below are important because environmental conditions affect the processes of rain formation a brief summary of the environmental parameters pressure and temperature is provided for each sampling site the air temperature and atmospheric pressure are decisive in the estimation of the density of the air which is a key factor for calculating terminal velocities and for evaluating the actual fall velocities of the raindrops 2 1 1 chamela observatory the chamela observatory cham is located in the estación de biología chamela in the state of jalisco near the pacific coast 19 50 n 105

the juriquilla observatory jqro 20 70 n 100 45 w 1945 m a s l is located in central mexico 14 km north of the city of querétaro the climate classification of the site is bsk intermediate between cold

rainy season is from may to october cna 2007 the rain events chosen for this study occurred between january and march 2015 and from july to august 2016 the temperature range during the events was between 8 and 22 c 2 1 4 unam observatory unam observatory is in the southwest part of mexico city at the main campus of the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico mexico city s metropolitan area is in the southwest of the mexico basin occupying an area with a radius of about 30 km that is roughly centered at downtown at approximately 19 4 n latitude and 99 1 w longitude it is surrounded by mountains except to the northeast with some of them having altitudes above 4000 m a s l the mean annual precipitation varies from about 450 mm in the northeastern part of the basin to almost 1200 mm over the southwestern area thus exhibiting a gradient with more intense and frequent precipitation along the southern and western slopes jáuregui 2000 the climate of the city is classified as cwb temperate dry winter warm summer the sampling platform is located 15 m above the ground on the roof of the main building of the centro de ciencias de la atmósfera 19 33 n 99 18 w 2280 m a s l the annual precipitation in the area is around 830 mm cna 2007 the average atmospheric pressure is 780 hpa and the mean temperature is about 17 c the main rainy season is from may to october and precipitation mainly originates from convective clouds with warm bases and cold tops montero martínez et al 2011 the sampling period in this location was from may to october 2015 temperature oscillated from 12 to 22 c 2 1 5 altzomoni observatory the altzomoni observatory altz is situated in the iztaccíhuatl popocatépetl national park 19 12 n 98 66 w 3985 m a s l approximately 60 km southeast of mexico city and between the two volcanoes that give the park its name due to its altitude the bases of the typical convective clouds in the area are at about the same altitude as the sampling platform montero martínez et al 2011 the air temperature range is 2 to 15 c throughout the year and the average atmospheric pressure is 635 hpa there were two sampling periods for this site one from october 2014 to may 2015 and one from october to november 2016 according to the collected data mixed precipitation solid and liquid particles and windy conditions are common in this area 2 2 instrumentation the instrumentation at each ruoa observatory includes diverse sensors for the measurement of common meteorological parameters temperature pressure wind direction and intensity etc for precipitation assessment each site counts with several rain gauges as well as with a pws100 optical present weather sensor manufactured by campbell scientific inc texas electronics tr 525 m tipping bucket rain gauges were chosen in all cases to simultaneously record rainfall intensity due to their resolution 0 1 mm and accuracy 1 all meteorological information gathered in the ruoa platforms is recorded with a one minute time resolution the pws100 is a laser based sensor that can distinguish between different classes of hydrometeors solid and liquid it consists of a transmitter and two detectors that receive scattered light through an angle of 20 off the vertical and horizontal planes of the beam propagation axis and it estimates precipitation intensity by accurately determining the size and velocity of individual particles ellis et al 2006 the instrument configuration defines an area of 40 cm2 by the overlap of the measurement regions of two detectors thus the pws100 is capable of classifying precipitation as rain snow hail etc and it delivers output messages about the type of particles detected it also provides visibility measurements such features are useful for various meteorological and hydrological studies and for aviation and roadside applications the particle velocity and size are estimated from the time displacement of refractive beams scattered from the hydrometeors nakatani et al 1993 lin et al 2000 the nominal detection size and velocity for individual particles range from 0 1 to 30 mm and from 0 1 to 30 m s 1 respectively the outputs are arranged in 34 by 34 bins for size and velocity campbell scientific 2015 according to the manufacturer the accuracy is 5 for both size and velocity the time resolution data for the pws100 at all sampling sites is one minute 2 3 methodology rainfall data were recorded with a resolution of one minute the pws100 device is capable of characterizing raindrops falling with different velocities into different categories the fall speeds of raindrops were compared with the theoretical raindrop terminal velocity v t which was assessed according to the parametric equations given by beard 1976 using the typical atmospheric conditions for each sampling site given the pws100 size detection range of hydrometeors v t was estimated for different size ranges based on the raindrop shape and its flow regime 1 rigid spheres moving at low and intermediate reynolds numbers re 300 and 2 raindrops with equilibrium shapes falling at moderate to large reynolds numbers 300 re 4000 a drop size of 1 1 mm was used to limit both intervals at all the sampling platforms with the exception of altz where the limit for the raindrop diameter was 1 3 mm in the latter case the analysis was done using only sampling periods with temperatures greater than 3 5 c and output messages indicating the absence of ice particles this method was particularly useful for separating events with the occurrence of solid precipitation hailstones ice pellets or snowflakes as well as for periods when there are particles with anomalous fall speeds several authors best 1950 foote and du toit 1969 atlas et al 1973 beard 1976 brandes et al 2002 among others have proposed semi empirical formulae to compare v t estimates with laboratory measurements by gunn and kinzer 1949 at sea level conditions and to adjust them according to air density i e altitude best 1950 foote and du toit 1969 beard 1977 1985 the methodology used here is in agreement with wang et al 2010 in that beard s 1976 theoretical equations provide the best estimate of v t over the full range of measurements carried out by gunn and kinzer 1949 drops with the same size but different speeds are not uncommon montero martínez et al 2009 which means that drops classified in the same size category may attain diverse values of ke the ke of a raindrop in j is estimated as 2 ke 1 2 m v 2 10 9 π 12 ρ d 3 v 2 where ρ is the density of water kg m 3 m is the mass kg v is the measured velocity m s 1 and d is the diameter mm of the drop for each sampling minute ke in each bin size is defined as 3 ke d 10 9 π 12 ρ d 3 i 1 n i v i 2 where n i is the number of detected drops falling with a velocity in the range of a given v i class finally the total ke for each one minute period is equal to the sum of the ke calculated for each diameter category kemm in j m 2 mm 1 was computed as the ke content encountered in a surface area of 1 m2 per unit depth of rainfall the calculation was done by dividing the total ke by the product of the sampling area a s 0 004 m2 and by the amount of accumulated rain water p acc in one minute 4 ke mm i 1 ke di a s p acc the uncertainty on kemm was estimated by 5 δ ke mm ke mm 6 δ d d 2 2 δ v v 2 where δ d d and δ v v are the diameter and velocity instrumental accuracies uncertainties respectively this uncertainty amounts to 14 2 4 validation criteria to examine the performance of the instruments the rainfall accumulation results from the pws100 measurements were compared with rain gauge data at each sampling site using standard descriptive statistics the pws100 data were used to define a single rain event as an episode of continuous detection of precipitation which ended when the instrument stopped recording raindrops for a 60 minute period this criterion allows for the distinction between two or more consecutive rain events the percent bias pbias was used to estimate the discrepancies between the rain gauge and the disdrometer at each sampling platform here bias refers to the difference between the disdrometer and the rain gauge measurements consequently this parameter is interpreted walther and moore 2005 as an under or overestimation with respect to the reference value i e the rain gauge by considering that the disdrometers can detect individual drops and thus provide a better resolution for determining the duration of single precipitation events as defined above 3 results 3 1 measurement validation more than 18 732 observations of one minute rainfall periods were available for this study of which only 12 173 that showed rainfall intensities greater than 0 1 mm h 1 and at least 30 drops detected in the period were used r calculations were performed considering only drops with d 6 mm for each sampling period these criteria were utilized to consider the dispersion of the data and to ensure their statistical reliability the maximum r was 184 mm h 1 the main results regarding the descriptive statistics gathered for each sampling site are shown in table 1 which shows the number of events studied ne at each site the pbias outcomes clearly suggest that the disdrometers usually detect more rain for any event than the rain gauges this is consistent with the mean values of accumulated water obtained with the pws100 which are greater than the rain gauge measurements at all the sampling sites considering the manufacturers uncertainties for water accumulation measurements of 10 and 1 for the disdrometer and the rain gauge respectively the bias results are beyond the instrumental error exception made of those for ltux and altz these observations can be explained by considering that the pws100 has the advantage over the rain gauge of measuring the duration of rain from the detection of the first to the last raindrop in the event this also suggests that the rain gauges are prone to miss light rain which is one reason why optical disdrometers usually detect larger amounts of rain and longer event durations than rain gauges in particular it should be noticed that most of the selected events at jqro occurred during the winter when the rain originates from fronts and is mainly stratiform as suggested by the fact that storms detected during the sampling period from january to march were usually light to moderate in intensity thus the large pbias value at jqro can be explained by realizing that the proportion of light events recorded is larger than in the other four locations see table 2 in the following sections the analyses of raindrop fall speeds and kinetic energy content will be presented for the cham ltux jqro and unam sites due to its particular characteristics the results for altz are discussed in a latter section section 3 4 3 2 analysis of raindrop fall speeds the mean raindrop fall speeds for representative rain periods detected at the cham ltux jqro and unam sampling sites are shown in fig 2 the vertical axis is the ratio of the measured fall speed v to the theoretical terminal velocity v t 0 v t 0 is evaluated according to beard 1976 for standard conditions i e 1013 hpa and 20 c the dotted line in each panel represents the expected behavior for raindrops falling at sea level with respect to the corresponding terminal velocity v v t 0 1 the shaded area indicates the ratio v t v t 0 at each sampling site with a 5 uncertainty according to the instrumental specifications where v t is the terminal velocity calculated with beard s 1976 equations and adjusted for the typical prevailing pressure and temperature at each platform note that this shaded area departs from the standard condition dotted line depending on the altitude of the site for the coastal sites cham and ltux it remains around the dotted line v t v t 0 1 but for the other platforms v t increases due to lower air drag and the ratio of terminal velocities becomes greater than unity v t v t 0 1 the mean values of v v t 0 for measurements during periods with low to moderate horizontal wind w 3 5 m s 1 are represented by crosses whereas the circles correspond to values of v v t 0 obtained during high wind conditions the error bars correspond to one standard deviation and should be interpreted as a measure of the width of v distributions for each size category note that each point in the graphs represents the average of at least 100 drops detected in each drop size category during the time interval shown δt the outcomes of v v t 0 during periods with light wind at coastal low altitude sites show that the fall speeds are very close to the terminal velocity i e v t at cham and ltux are close to v t 0 therefore there are no noticeable deviations between the shaded areas and the dotted lines furthermore these data are consistent with previous observations that show that small drops d 0 8 mm can fall with much greater v than the corresponding v t montero martínez et al 2009 larsen et al 2014 angulo martínez et al 2016 montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 wilken et al 2018 as indicated by the large error bars for raindrops larger than 1 mm the vertical bars are significantly reduced and similar to the pws100 s uncertainty for periods with high winds w 3 5 m s 1 the means of v v t 0 deviate from both the dotted line and the instrumental threshold especially in cham an important effect observed during these windy periods is the appearance of a significant amount of subterminal drops i e drops falling slower than v t montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 larger than 1 5 mm as suggests the broadening of the velocity distributions this is in good agreement with previous observations during natural rainfall events niu et al 2010 thurai et al 2013 montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 bringi et al 2018 thurai et al 2019 the mean fall speed data in fig 2 also show that raindrops fall faster at sites with higher altitude assuming that its mass does not change the terminal velocity of a given raindrop decreases as it falls through lower air layers see fig 2 in foote and du toit 1969 this implies that the ratio v t v t 0 should be greater than unity as the altitude increases as shown in fig 2 for jqro and unam by the displacement of the shaded area v t was estimated using the parametric equations of beard 1976 with representative atmospheric conditions for each sampling site these results were compared with calculations performed using the adjustments of foote and du toit 1969 and beard 1985 and no significant inconsistencies were observed the differences are less than the instrumental uncertainty the results for jqro and unam for moderate wind periods indicate that most drops with diameters between 0 5 and 3 mm fall with speeds similar to the v t estimated for the sampling conditions this indicates that raindrops actually fall with greater between 9 and 14 speeds at these platforms than those detected at coastal sites as expected see supplementary material for further results on the other hand as in the low altitude sites the mean values of v v t 0 for rainy lapses with w 6 m s 1 suggest that the relative number of subterminal drops with d 1 5 mm increases it is worth noticing that during high wind episodes and regardless of the altitude the presence of a substantial number of subterminal raindrops d 1 5 mm dominates fall speed distributions this fact seems to reduce the pressure effect mentioned above the terminal velocity of a raindrop is achieved when the sum of the forces gravity buoyancy and aerodynamic forces acting on the drop equals zero jones et al 2013 for a solid sphere the drag force f d can be expressed as 6 f d 1 2 ρ a v t 2 c d a c where ρ a is the air density v t is the terminal velocity and c d and a c are the drag coefficient and the cross sectional area of the precipitating particle respectively comes et al 1995 when f d is fixed a decrease in air density produces an increase in the terminal velocity of the raindrop the differences in ρ a between the continental and coastal sites in the present study are around 20 and 30 for medium jqro and unam and high altitude altz sites respectively thus the decrease in the atmospheric pressure i e the air density as the altitude increases is a key parameter to explain the measured increase in the mean fall speed of raindrops at the continental sites compared to those located near the coast fig 3 shows the drop size distributions dsd for the same periods presented in fig 2 these dsd were obtained under the same statistical considerations regarding the number of drops for each point of the spectra the number of drops detected in the size category during the period is greater than 100 all dsd in the figure correspond to the main rainy season in central and southern mexico which occurs from may to october it is also worth pointing out that cham and ltux are located in coastal plains whereas jqro and unam are in high plains along valleys the dsd agree with the r estimations in the sense that large drops d 3 mm are more common in periods of heavy rain interestingly the number of drops with d 3 5 mm is statistically significant for the rain spectra obtained at the medium altitude sites jqro and unam for r 60 mm h 1 but this is not the case for the distributions obtained at cham even though the r of the analyzed periods is greater table 2 shows the total number of one minute periods observed n t the number of analyzed periods n that corresponds to the number of those one minute periods with at least 30 drops detected and the percentage of one minute periods with r 1 mm h 1 and r 10 mm h 1 at each sampling site the outcomes indicate that more than about 80 of the one minute rainfall intensity estimates were less than 10 mm h 1 for all sampling sites and less than 30 of the estimates were less than 1 mm h 1 3 3 kinetic energy content in cham ltux jqro and unam sites kemax is a key parameter in eq 1 but its determination is not clear for example wischmeier and smith 1978 considered that kemm would remain constant for periods with r 76 mm h 1 but lim et al 2015 evaluated kemax with values using r 60 mm h 1 rainy periods with such high r values are not common in the areas here studied and represent only up to 2 of the data intervals with r values corresponding to the 95th percentile of rainfall intensity were used here to determine kemax table 3 with a representative sample thus kemax was estimated as the mean value of kemm calculated for these intervals the results in table 3 show a clear tendency of the increase of kemax with altitude an analysis of variance anova was carried out for the cham ltux jqro and unam sites which indicated significant differences between the kemax values fischer test f 2 6 with a confidence level 1 α of 95 since f does not give information on which groups are responsible for those differences post hoc tests were used to provide information about which groups within the study are different from each other for details see montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 scheffe s method is more appropriate and robust for pair wise comparisons of means when the sample sizes between groups are different but also for all complex comparisons of means without affecting the confidence level neter et al 1996 this method gives narrow confidence limits when rejecting the null hypothesis the significance of the result is very high morales vallejo 2008 and it has the larger likelihood of resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon exists greene 2000 scheffe s t value is computed from the number of groups and the fcrit value previously used for the anova analyses t 2 8 the t statistic is obtained with 7 t ke m a x i ke m a x j mse bet 1 n i 1 n j and it is used to compare the difference kemax i kemax j between the measurement platforms i and j msebet refers to the mean square error within categories from the anova and n is the number of 1 min periods collected in each sampling site morales vallejo 2008 the outcomes show significant differences between the kemax estimates obtained in these four platforms t 8 31 correct result interpretation is essential to extract the meaning of data and observations in turn effect size is an important tool for interpreting the effectiveness of a particular phenomenon effect size is a statistic that estimates the magnitude of an effect provides a relevant interpretation nakagawa and cuthill 2007 and can be expressed as the cohen effect size statistic d cohen 1988 computed as 8 d ke m a x i ke m a x j mse bet the d statistic can be taken as exactly equivalent to a z score of a standard normal distribution coe 2002 morales vallejo 2008 the effect on kemm due to the change in altitude is very substantial when considering the results of the effect size statistic d 0 9 for the comparison between the cham ltux jqro and unam sites fig 4 shows scatter plots of the kemm estimations as a function of r for the cham ltux jqro and unam sites the logarithmic scale on the abscissa exhibits in detail the behavior of kemm with r and shows that kemm increases with r a large dispersion of kemm for the whole rainfall intensity range can be observed kemm estimations obtained for calm light and moderate wind intensities w 3 5 m s 1 represented by crosses show a similar dispersion as those for high wind periods w 3 5 m s 1 represented by circles this seems to be in disagreement with the clear wind effect on the drop fall speed seen in fig 2 but it has to be noticed that velocity distributions that represent averages of sub super and terminal drops over a time period of a few minutes can produce a large range of individual one minute kemm estimates as reported by wilken et al 2018 the criterion used to classify the measurements in terms of wind intensity was based on the deviation of the mean v v t 0 value with respect to the uncertainty threshold of the pws100 see jqro panel in fig 2 fig 4 also illustrates that kemm increases with r between 0 5 mm h 1 and 20 to 30 mm h 1 depending of the site where most of the data lie table 2 furthermore fig 4 demonstrates an increase of the kemm range with the altitude of the sampling site for example the kemm estimates are usually below 20 j m 2 mm 1 in the cases of cham and ltux for rainfall intensities of 10 mm h 1 however for periods with similar r kemm values are close to 30 j m 2 mm 1 at jqro and unam where the altitudes are around 1950 and 2300 m a s l respectively this is because kemm is related to the average squared velocity of the raindrop population arriving at the ground sempere torres 1994 finally the data clearly show a similar behavior to that found by wischmeier and smith 1978 and lim et al 2015 in that kemm seems to reach an upper limit when r reaches a threshold of 60 mm h 1 the exponential expression proposed by kinnell 1981 is related to the average maximum of kemm found at high rain rates angulo martínez et al 2016 the parametric coefficients of the exponential relationship eq 1 between kemm and r at each sampling site are shown in table 4 kemax for cham ltux jqro and unam correspond to the average outcomes obtained from the kemm estimations for the one minute periods with r in the 95th percentile as mentioned before the a coefficient in eq 1 is related to the minimum kemm value for periods with very low rainfall intensities thus its value was estimated by 9 a 1 ke max ke min where kemin is the mean value of the kemm estimates for the one minute periods with r less than the 5th percentile table 3 the b coefficient was obtained with the matlab software using the levenberg marquardt algorithm and the least absolute residuals lar fitting method the coefficients of determination r2 indicate a strong correlation between kemm and r 3 4 the altz case the analysis of altz data is presented as a particular case because of its location which is a few meters below the level of the cloud base in the central area of mexico on the slope of the sierra nevada a crucial issue is the altitude of almost 4 km a s l of altz which implies that the environmental temperature during the rainfall events is very commonly around or just above 0 c thus the occurrence of mixed precipitation liquid water and ice particles is common this explains why severe liquid precipitation episodes in altz are uncommon only 2 one minute periods with rainfall rates greater than 60 mm h 1 were recorded over the sampling period nonetheless the pws100 is capable of distinguishing the phase of the precipitation which is a helpful characteristic for selecting the measurement periods without the presence of ice hydrometeors fig 5 shows the mean raindrop fall speeds expressed as v v t 0 as a function of the drop diameter for two sampling periods with different wind conditions the corresponding dsds are also presented as in fig 2 the shaded area represents the expected value for v t according to the environmental conditions at the site atmospheric pressure 635 hpa temperature between 3 5 and 10 c and the instrumental uncertainty in the case of light wind conditions top panel no significant raindrop fall speed deviations are observed however under high wind conditions w 3 5 m s 1 central panel the appearance of subterminal drops is evident as in the other sites prat and barros 2010 showed that the right hand side of dsd collected in valleys are heavier than those measured in ridges in this regards the mean raindrop diameter may be used as a proxy for the width of raindrop spectra for a given rainfall rate the larger it is the wider heavier the dsd is expected to be fig 6 displays the range of variation of the mean raindrop diameter d for 1 minute periods obtained from the disdrometer measurements for selected rainfall rates with an uncertainty of 10 similar to that of the water accumulation of the pws100 the central rectangle spans the interquartile range of d and the segment inside the rectangle corresponds to the median value obtained in each of the five sampling sites in contrast with the behavior described by prat and barros 2010 the results shown in fig 6 do not suggest any clear tendency to heavier dsd at the low altitude sites with respect to those gathered at higher altitude platforms for a given rainfall rate montero martínez et al 2011 revealed that the mass contents of solid hydrometeors are significant during the development of precipitation events over the mexico basin therefore the measurement of a significant amount of large raindrops resulting in high values of d in altz and unam and possibly in jqro would be the result of the melting of ice particles present in the mixed precipitation aloft thus the results presented in fig 6 suggest that raindrop diameter is not a major factor for the change of kemm with altitude fig 7 shows the kemm estimates for the one minute periods obtained at altz as a function of r as in fig 4 these results are presented in terms of wind conditions the dispersion in the diagram is larger than those obtained for the other sampling sites but it does not suggest any effect of wind on kemm also the results do not point out a clear tendency to estimate the kemax value in this location nevertheless the results in table 4 show a tendency toward larger values of kemax as the altitude of the sampling site increases thus based on the kemax and environmental data of the other four sampling sites the least squares regression method was used to obtain the following equations to describe the relationship between kemax and atmospheric pressure p in hpa which corresponds to the altitude 10 ke max 119 32 e 0 002 p r 2 0 88 11 ke max 295 16 39 63 ln p r 2 0 89 the r2 values for the exponential and logarithmic expressions are practically the same but the predicted values for kemax from both expressions are quite different the typical environmental pressure at altz is about 635 hpa the estimated kemax values for this pressure are 33 51 j m 2 mm 1 for the exponential expression and 39 40 j m 2 mm 1 for the logarithmic one and the estimated errors are 1 1 and 2 3 j m 2 mm 1 respectively as in the other four cases section 3 3 the a coefficients were obtained using eq 9 using the kemax values predicted by eqs 10 and 11 and the kemm mean value of the one minute periods with r less than the 5th percentile for altz the estimated a values are consistent with the results obtained for the other sites table 4 thus the equations obtained to estimate kemm for altz are 12 k e mm 33 51 1 0 803 e 0 121 r r 2 0 88 and 13 k e mm 39 40 1 0 832 e 0 076 r r 2 0 87 the evaluation for the goodness of fit for kemm using kemax from the exponential model suggests a better response than when using the logarithmic one however given the tendency of kemax for the other four sites see table 3 the value of 39 40 j m 2 mm 1 seems to be more coherent the results from eqs 12 and 13 are shown in fig 7 3 5 comparison of the results with previous studies the parameters for the exponential expression eq 1 obtained from optical and acoustic disdrometer data in previous studies by several investigators are presented in table 5 the expressions by rosewell 1986 and lim et al 2015 are the only ones based on direct drop fall speed measurements in all the other cases the resulting equation was obtained using data corrected for hydrometeor velocities the kemax values obtained by rosewell 1986 and lim et al 2015 are comparable to those found for the cham and ltux coastal low altitude sites and suggest a trend of larger kemax values as the altitude increases rosewell 1986 mentions that differences in kemax may be produced by changes in storm energy in relation to the maximum temperatures at the studied locations angulo martínez and barros 2015 and angulo martínez et al 2016 also discussed these kemax changes and attributed them to geographical meteorological and instrumental factors blanchard 1953 suggested that changes in dsd and liquid water content may be produced by evaporation when small drops falling through long distances from the cloud base may evaporate completely before reaching the ground this may in turn affect the energy of the rain event thus for events with equal r estimates of ke at lower elevations might be expected to be greater than those at higher locations although this is not easy to prove nonetheless other results suggest the opposite petan et al 2010 used drop fall speed data corrected according to gunn and kinzer 1949 and reported greater values of kemax at kozjane 595 m a s l than at koseze 405 m a s l finally morgan 2005 mentioned that rainfall energy increases with air density and altitude but did not provide any reason the definition of kinetic energy content relates the kinetic energy flux to the total drop mass flux see eq 4 then it is expected that similar amounts of water should fall during rainfall with comparable r over the same time periods the displayed data demonstrate that altitude and thus pressure and air density of a location is a key factor for the increase of raindrop fall speed with respect to sea level therefore the present results imply that the kemm anomalies observed with altitude for rain events with comparable intensities are related to the difference of the mean fall speeds of the raindrops as suggested by sempere torres 1994 furthermore in a pioneer work best 1950 proposed the following parametric form for terminal velocity 14 v t v t 0 a 0 e β z 1 e α d γ where z is the altitude and a 0 α β and γ are parameters of the fit note that eq 14 which considers the effect of altitude on v t has the same functional form as eq 1 4 summary and conclusions microphysical rain measurements were analyzed to study the differences in the kinetic energy content of rain events due to changes in the fall speed of raindrops the microphysical data were collected at five different sites across mexico using four optical disdrometers between 2014 and 2018 the sampling locations have very different environments and altitudes two of the measurement platforms are considered coastal with altitudes less than 200 m a s l whereas the other three are continental two at about 2000 m a s l and one at almost 4000 m a s l comparisons between pws100 and rain gauge measurements showed that the optical instruments usually detect a larger amount of water at all the sampling sites this is attributed to the pws100 ability to measure the duration of rain events from the first to the last raindrop which also allows this instrument to better detect light rain than the rain gauges the measurements of the fall speed of the raindrops from the disdrometers were compared to the theoretical terminal velocity adjusted for altitude at each site the outcomes showed that observations of fall speed during periods with low wind intensities w 3 5 m s 1 correspond to the theoretical estimations therefore the comparisons of the mean fall velocities indicated that hydrometeors detected at the continental sampling sites have greater speeds than those near coastal areas furthermore the results agree well with the decrease of the air drag force produced by the reduction in the air density as the altitude increases in the cases of rainy periods with high wind conditions the occurrence of subterminal drops produces a clear decrease in the mean fall speed for drops with d 1 5 mm as previously reported montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 bringi et al 2018 thurai et al 2019 even though wind intensity affects raindrop fall speed the present results do not indicate any effects on the kinetic energy of the storms the kemm estimates obtained for rainy periods with comparable rainfall rates showed the same behavior as the raindrops fall speeds increase with altitude the kemax parameters obtained for these equations from one minute periods with r greater than the 95th percentile show the same tendency with larger values occurring as the altitude increases this behavior is consistent with the expectations based on sempere torres 1994 concerning the relationship of kemm to the mean squared velocity of the raindrop population arriving at the ground and with best s 1950 exponential parameterization of terminal speed with altitude an empirical equation was proposed to estimate the coefficient a of the exponential expression based on kemax and the mean kemm estimates for one minute intervals with r less than the 5th percentile the equation provides a values in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 for all sites with these considerations the r2 values r2 0 83 for cham jqro unam and ltux indicated good correlation between kemm and r in the derived exponential relationships it should be noticed that the parametric values presented in table 4 will be different in diverse places although the results obtained with the methodology proposed here indicate that the geographical environment latitude altitude air density etc influences the kemax and a parameter values in eq 1 other factors related to the dominant processes that cause rain also have an effect due to the lack of rain periods with r 60 mm h 1 at the altz site the values of kemax obtained for the other four sites cham ltuz jqro and unam were used to evaluate a pair of mathematical expressions to obtain kemax for the typical pressure at altz eqs 10 and 11 are proposed as an example on how to model the change of kemm with altitude and due to the number of sites used in this study circumspection when applying them for other regions should be exercised the goodness of fit results for the kemm r exponential parameterizations at altz observatory suggest a good response r2 0 87 when using kemax values of 33 5 j m 2 mm 1 or 39 4 j m 2 mm 1 these results show that the methodology may be suitable for estimating rainfall ke content at diverse altitudes finally these findings indicate that the detachment of soil particles by individual drops can be magnified at places with higher altitude respect to coastal locations although there are other factors that have to be considered such as the type of soil and terrain slope the amount of detached soil by the impact of raindrops may produce an important enhancement of interill erosion as altitude increases credit authorship contribution statement guillermo montero martínez conceptualization methodology formal

5679,erosion is the process of land degradation due to rainfall and other environmental factors and it can be described by indices such as the kinetic energy of rainfall ke microphysical data from disdrometers have been used to determine the relationship between kinetic energy content kemm in j m 2 mm 1 and rainfall intensity r in mm h 1 optical disdrometer pws100 measurements were gathered between 2014 and 2018 at five sampling sites across mexico and the data analyzed to study the characteristics of kemm r relationships with altitude a pws100 unit at each of the sampling sites was collocated a few meters from a tipping bucket rain gauge to record r simultaneously individual raindrops fall speeds measured with the disdrometers were found to agree well with theoretical estimations using the environmental conditions at each sampling site the mean fall velocities indicated that raindrops detected at the continental sampling sites medium and high altitudes have greater speeds than those near coastal areas low altitudes comparisons of the estimated kemm for rainy periods with comparable r show greater values as the altitude increases this result is attributed to the increase of raindrop fall speed due to the air density decrement with altitude exponential relations between kemm and r based on one minute sampling periods were fitted for each sampling site producing high values of coefficients of determination and suggesting a good response finally the maximum kinetic energy parameter kemax in the empirical kemm r equations was found to increase with altitude these findings indicate that the detachment of soil particles by individual drops are magnified at higher altitude locations keywords rainfall kinetic energy content soil erosion raindrop fall velocity optical disdrometers mexico 1 introduction soils are produced by weathering processes from solid unweathered rock or loose rock material such as gravel or sand soil erosion is a degradation process caused by natural rainfall wind and runoff among other natural processes and anthropogenic urbanization clearing and logging of forested areas construction and mining factors weggel and rustom 1992 fornis et al 2005 petan et al 2010 angulo martínez and barros 2015 this degradation process affects important soil functions such as food production and the soil s capacity to filter buffer and transform materials in the biosphere blum et al 2006 erosion can be classified as interrill and rill erosion fornis et al 2005 in interrill erosion the impact of raindrops is a key agent for soil loss and a dominant agent of water erosion ellison 1952 rose 1960 lattanzi et al 1974 salles and poesen 2000 during impact drops exert a force on the surface which is converted to shear stress that separates the soil particles from the soil matrix ellison 1945 according to bako et al 2017 the total amount of detached soil during a rainfall event is essentially the sum of soil detached by individual raindrops furbish et al 2007 demonstrated that the extent of the area affected by the impact of raindrops depends on the type of soil grain size the raindrop properties drop diameter and the surface slope rainfall erosivity is the ability of rainfall to detach soil particles salles and poesen 2000 van dijk et al 2002 lobo and bonilla 2015 angulo martínez et al 2016 and its knowledge is helpful to quantify erosion processes sanchez moreno et al 2012 which are highly dependent on rainfall energy therefore rainfall erosivity depends on the intensity and amount of rainfall and on the size of the raindrops jayawardena and rezaur 2000 since the last century there have been studies and experiments on erosion and its relation to various rainfall parameters such as kinetic energy ke but the global diversity of topography and other characteristics have made it necessary to conduct locally targeted investigations to estimate the relations between ke and rain erosivity petan et al 2010 empirical models have mainly related rain erosivity to kinetic energy equal to half the particle mass times the square of its velocity kinnell 1981 van dijk et al 2002 morgan 2005 or to momentum the particle mass times its velocity salles et al 2002 fornis et al 2005 lim et al 2015 there are two different forms to relate the ke of rainfall to its intensity r in mm h 1 the rate of expenditure of rainfall ke ket expressed in units of energy area time and the flux of rainfall ke expended by the unit quantity of rain when the amount of rain is expressed as a depth kemm kemm is also known as kinetic energy content and is expressed in units of energy area depth rosewell 1986 petan et al 2010 based on its definition kemm represents the average squared velocity of the population of raindrops arriving at the soil sempere torres 1994 in most of the reported relationships ke is not linearly related to soil loss lobo and bonilla 2015 according to kinnell 1981 an exponential expression provides a better description of the relationship of kemm and r of rainfall the exponential relationship is also a continuous equation with a positive value at zero rainfall intensity that predicts acceptable estimates of kemm at low r the typical rainfall condition during the occurrence of rain events and at high intensities it asymptotically approaches a value with physical meaning brown and foster 1987 lobo and bonilla 2015 the equation has the following general form 1 k e mm k e max 1 a e b r where kemax is the maximum ke content j m 2 mm 1 and a and b are empirical constants a determines the ke content at very low rainfall intensities the minimum kinetic energy content and b determines the shape of the curve kinnell 1981 van dijk et al 2002 sanchez moreno et al 2012 according to the literature the applicability of empirical parameterizations following eq 1 is limited because of their dependence on geographical and meteorological conditions for a detailed discussion see serio et al 2019 other studies have suggested that momentum produces slightly better results with lower uncertainty than kinetic energy in estimating soil detachment rose 1960 salles and poesen 2000 lim et al 2015 furbish et al 2007 performed high speed imaging of drop impacts on sand targets under controlled laboratory conditions and their results showed that the amount of displaced grains increases in proportion to the momentum of the drop and drop size and varies with grain size even so rainfall kinetic energy is widely used in many empirical models to estimate rainfall erosivity van dijk et al 2002 morgan 2005 several studies have presented various equations relating ke with r and there seems to be a consensus about regression parameters being unique and highly dependent on the geographic locations lobo and bonilla 2015 angulo martínez et al 2016 besides it is well known that the terminal velocity of raindrops changes with altitude and there are expressions that allow terminal velocities to be adjusted for this best 1950 foote and du toit 1969 beard 1985 among others because the parameters used to estimate ke are the mass and fall speed of the raindrops it should be expected that ke and the momentum of storms change with altitude which restricts the use of relationships found in various places and computing rainfall erosivity becomes very limited for most places on the planet the objective of this work is not to identify an equation that provides the best fit to the local characteristics of rainfall ke but to address another general question using data obtained at five different sampling sites in particular this study explores the influence of the measured fall velocity of raindrops on the ke of storms as a function of the sampling site altitude the analysis of the results for ke and the regression parameters for an exponential equation like that proposed by kinnell 1981 should suggest a tendency for kemax with respect to the altitude and thus the air pressure or air density of the study sites these results could potentially be used in models for predicting the erosiveness of rainfall for soil erosion in a wide variety of locations 2 data and methods 2 1 sampling sites data were gathered at five observatories of the university network of atmospheric observatories ruoa https www ruoa unam mx which are located in different areas throughout mexico fig 1 the observatories in mexico city unam and juriquilla jqro are in urban areas on the high plateau of mexico the rest are in natural protected areas one in a national park in the high mountain region of central mexico altz and the other two in coastal biological research stations near the pacific ocean cham and the gulf of mexico ltux except for altz which is located on a hillside all the other sites are situated on plain grounds the differences of the climatic characteristics between most of the chosen sites see details in the corresponding sections below are important because environmental conditions affect the processes of rain formation a brief summary of the environmental parameters pressure and temperature is provided for each sampling site the air temperature and atmospheric pressure are decisive in the estimation of the density of the air which is a key factor for calculating terminal velocities and for evaluating the actual fall velocities of the raindrops 2 1 1 chamela observatory the chamela observatory cham is located in the estación de biología chamela in the state of jalisco near the pacific coast 19 50 n 105

rainy season is from may to october cna 2007 the rain events chosen for this study occurred between january and march 2015 and from july to august 2016 the temperature range during the events was between 8 and 22 c 2 1 4 unam observatory unam observatory is in the southwest part of mexico city at the main campus of the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico mexico city s metropolitan area is in the southwest of the mexico basin occupying an area with a radius of about 30 km that is roughly centered at downtown at approximately 19 4 n latitude and 99 1 w longitude it is surrounded by mountains except to the northeast with some of them having altitudes above 4000 m a s l the mean annual precipitation varies from about 450 mm in the northeastern part of the basin to almost 1200 mm over the southwestern area thus exhibiting a gradient with more intense and frequent precipitation along the southern and western slopes jáuregui 2000 the climate of the city is classified as cwb temperate dry winter warm summer the sampling platform is located 15 m above the ground on the roof of the main building of the centro de ciencias de la atmósfera 19 33 n 99 18 w 2280 m a s l the annual precipitation in the area is around 830 mm cna 2007 the average atmospheric pressure is 780 hpa and the mean temperature is about 17 c the main rainy season is from may to october and precipitation mainly originates from convective clouds with warm bases and cold tops montero martínez et al 2011 the sampling period in this location was from may to october 2015 temperature oscillated from 12 to 22 c 2 1 5 altzomoni observatory the altzomoni observatory altz is situated in the iztaccíhuatl popocatépetl national park 19 12 n 98 66 w 3985 m a s l approximately 60 km southeast of mexico city and between the two volcanoes that give the park its name due to its altitude the bases of the typical convective clouds in the area are at about the same altitude as the sampling platform montero martínez et al 2011 the air temperature range is 2 to 15 c throughout the year and the average atmospheric pressure is 635 hpa there were two sampling periods for this site one from october 2014 to may 2015 and one from october to november 2016 according to the collected data mixed precipitation solid and liquid particles and windy conditions are common in this area 2 2 instrumentation the instrumentation at each ruoa observatory includes diverse sensors for the measurement of common meteorological parameters temperature pressure wind direction and intensity etc for precipitation assessment each site counts with several rain gauges as well as with a pws100 optical present weather sensor manufactured by campbell scientific inc texas electronics tr 525 m tipping bucket rain gauges were chosen in all cases to simultaneously record rainfall intensity due to their resolution 0 1 mm and accuracy 1 all meteorological information gathered in the ruoa platforms is recorded with a one minute time resolution the pws100 is a laser based sensor that can distinguish between different classes of hydrometeors solid and liquid it consists of a transmitter and two detectors that receive scattered light through an angle of 20 off the vertical and horizontal planes of the beam propagation axis and it estimates precipitation intensity by accurately determining the size and velocity of individual particles ellis et al 2006 the instrument configuration defines an area of 40 cm2 by the overlap of the measurement regions of two detectors thus the pws100 is capable of classifying precipitation as rain snow hail etc and it delivers output messages about the type of particles detected it also provides visibility measurements such features are useful for various meteorological and hydrological studies and for aviation and roadside applications the particle velocity and size are estimated from the time displacement of refractive beams scattered from the hydrometeors nakatani et al 1993 lin et al 2000 the nominal detection size and velocity for individual particles range from 0 1 to 30 mm and from 0 1 to 30 m s 1 respectively the outputs are arranged in 34 by 34 bins for size and velocity campbell scientific 2015 according to the manufacturer the accuracy is 5 for both size and velocity the time resolution data for the pws100 at all sampling sites is one minute 2 3 methodology rainfall data were recorded with a resolution of one minute the pws100 device is capable of characterizing raindrops falling with different velocities into different categories the fall speeds of raindrops were compared with the theoretical raindrop terminal velocity v t which was assessed according to the parametric equations given by beard 1976 using the typical atmospheric conditions for each sampling site given the pws100 size detection range of hydrometeors v t was estimated for different size ranges based on the raindrop shape and its flow regime 1 rigid spheres moving at low and intermediate reynolds numbers re 300 and 2 raindrops with equilibrium shapes falling at moderate to large reynolds numbers 300 re 4000 a drop size of 1 1 mm was used to limit both intervals at all the sampling platforms with the exception of altz where the limit for the raindrop diameter was 1 3 mm in the latter case the analysis was done using only sampling periods with temperatures greater than 3 5 c and output messages indicating the absence of ice particles this method was particularly useful for separating events with the occurrence of solid precipitation hailstones ice pellets or snowflakes as well as for periods when there are particles with anomalous fall speeds several authors best 1950 foote and du toit 1969 atlas et al 1973 beard 1976 brandes et al 2002 among others have proposed semi empirical formulae to compare v t estimates with laboratory measurements by gunn and kinzer 1949 at sea level conditions and to adjust them according to air density i e altitude best 1950 foote and du toit 1969 beard 1977 1985 the methodology used here is in agreement with wang et al 2010 in that beard s 1976 theoretical equations provide the best estimate of v t over the full range of measurements carried out by gunn and kinzer 1949 drops with the same size but different speeds are not uncommon montero martínez et al 2009 which means that drops classified in the same size category may attain diverse values of ke the ke of a raindrop in j is estimated as 2 ke 1 2 m v 2 10 9 π 12 ρ d 3 v 2 where ρ is the density of water kg m 3 m is the mass kg v is the measured velocity m s 1 and d is the diameter mm of the drop for each sampling minute ke in each bin size is defined as 3 ke d 10 9 π 12 ρ d 3 i 1 n i v i 2 where n i is the number of detected drops falling with a velocity in the range of a given v i class finally the total ke for each one minute period is equal to the sum of the ke calculated for each diameter category kemm in j m 2 mm 1 was computed as the ke content encountered in a surface area of 1 m2 per unit depth of rainfall the calculation was done by dividing the total ke by the product of the sampling area a s 0 004 m2 and by the amount of accumulated rain water p acc in one minute 4 ke mm i 1 ke di a s p acc the uncertainty on kemm was estimated by 5 δ ke mm ke mm 6 δ d d 2 2 δ v v 2 where δ d d and δ v v are the diameter and velocity instrumental accuracies uncertainties respectively this uncertainty amounts to 14 2 4 validation criteria to examine the performance of the instruments the rainfall accumulation results from the pws100 measurements were compared with rain gauge data at each sampling site using standard descriptive statistics the pws100 data were used to define a single rain event as an episode of continuous detection of precipitation which ended when the instrument stopped recording raindrops for a 60 minute period this criterion allows for the distinction between two or more consecutive rain events the percent bias pbias was used to estimate the discrepancies between the rain gauge and the disdrometer at each sampling platform here bias refers to the difference between the disdrometer and the rain gauge measurements consequently this parameter is interpreted walther and moore 2005 as an under or overestimation with respect to the reference value i e the rain gauge by considering that the disdrometers can detect individual drops and thus provide a better resolution for determining the duration of single precipitation events as defined above 3 results 3 1 measurement validation more than 18 732 observations of one minute rainfall periods were available for this study of which only 12 173 that showed rainfall intensities greater than 0 1 mm h 1 and at least 30 drops detected in the period were used r calculations were performed considering only drops with d 6 mm for each sampling period these criteria were utilized to consider the dispersion of the data and to ensure their statistical reliability the maximum r was 184 mm h 1 the main results regarding the descriptive statistics gathered for each sampling site are shown in table 1 which shows the number of events studied ne at each site the pbias outcomes clearly suggest that the disdrometers usually detect more rain for any event than the rain gauges this is consistent with the mean values of accumulated water obtained with the pws100 which are greater than the rain gauge measurements at all the sampling sites considering the manufacturers uncertainties for water accumulation measurements of 10 and 1 for the disdrometer and the rain gauge respectively the bias results are beyond the instrumental error exception made of those for ltux and altz these observations can be explained by considering that the pws100 has the advantage over the rain gauge of measuring the duration of rain from the detection of the first to the last raindrop in the event this also suggests that the rain gauges are prone to miss light rain which is one reason why optical disdrometers usually detect larger amounts of rain and longer event durations than rain gauges in particular it should be noticed that most of the selected events at jqro occurred during the winter when the rain originates from fronts and is mainly stratiform as suggested by the fact that storms detected during the sampling period from january to march were usually light to moderate in intensity thus the large pbias value at jqro can be explained by realizing that the proportion of light events recorded is larger than in the other four locations see table 2 in the following sections the analyses of raindrop fall speeds and kinetic energy content will be presented for the cham ltux jqro and unam sites due to its particular characteristics the results for altz are discussed in a latter section section 3 4 3 2 analysis of raindrop fall speeds the mean raindrop fall speeds for representative rain periods detected at the cham ltux jqro and unam sampling sites are shown in fig 2 the vertical axis is the ratio of the measured fall speed v to the theoretical terminal velocity v t 0 v t 0 is evaluated according to beard 1976 for standard conditions i e 1013 hpa and 20 c the dotted line in each panel represents the expected behavior for raindrops falling at sea level with respect to the corresponding terminal velocity v v t 0 1 the shaded area indicates the ratio v t v t 0 at each sampling site with a 5 uncertainty according to the instrumental specifications where v t is the terminal velocity calculated with beard s 1976 equations and adjusted for the typical prevailing pressure and temperature at each platform note that this shaded area departs from the standard condition dotted line depending on the altitude of the site for the coastal sites cham and ltux it remains around the dotted line v t v t 0 1 but for the other platforms v t increases due to lower air drag and the ratio of terminal velocities becomes greater than unity v t v t 0 1 the mean values of v v t 0 for measurements during periods with low to moderate horizontal wind w 3 5 m s 1 are represented by crosses whereas the circles correspond to values of v v t 0 obtained during high wind conditions the error bars correspond to one standard deviation and should be interpreted as a measure of the width of v distributions for each size category note that each point in the graphs represents the average of at least 100 drops detected in each drop size category during the time interval shown δt the outcomes of v v t 0 during periods with light wind at coastal low altitude sites show that the fall speeds are very close to the terminal velocity i e v t at cham and ltux are close to v t 0 therefore there are no noticeable deviations between the shaded areas and the dotted lines furthermore these data are consistent with previous observations that show that small drops d 0 8 mm can fall with much greater v than the corresponding v t montero martínez et al 2009 larsen et al 2014 angulo martínez et al 2016 montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 wilken et al 2018 as indicated by the large error bars for raindrops larger than 1 mm the vertical bars are significantly reduced and similar to the pws100 s uncertainty for periods with high winds w 3 5 m s 1 the means of v v t 0 deviate from both the dotted line and the instrumental threshold especially in cham an important effect observed during these windy periods is the appearance of a significant amount of subterminal drops i e drops falling slower than v t montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 larger than 1 5 mm as suggests the broadening of the velocity distributions this is in good agreement with previous observations during natural rainfall events niu et al 2010 thurai et al 2013 montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 bringi et al 2018 thurai et al 2019 the mean fall speed data in fig 2 also show that raindrops fall faster at sites with higher altitude assuming that its mass does not change the terminal velocity of a given raindrop decreases as it falls through lower air layers see fig 2 in foote and du toit 1969 this implies that the ratio v t v t 0 should be greater than unity as the altitude increases as shown in fig 2 for jqro and unam by the displacement of the shaded area v t was estimated using the parametric equations of beard 1976 with representative atmospheric conditions for each sampling site these results were compared with calculations performed using the adjustments of foote and du toit 1969 and beard 1985 and no significant inconsistencies were observed the differences are less than the instrumental uncertainty the results for jqro and unam for moderate wind periods indicate that most drops with diameters between 0 5 and 3 mm fall with speeds similar to the v t estimated for the sampling conditions this indicates that raindrops actually fall with greater between 9 and 14 speeds at these platforms than those detected at coastal sites as expected see supplementary material for further results on the other hand as in the low altitude sites the mean values of v v t 0 for rainy lapses with w 6 m s 1 suggest that the relative number of subterminal drops with d 1 5 mm increases it is worth noticing that during high wind episodes and regardless of the altitude the presence of a substantial number of subterminal raindrops d 1 5 mm dominates fall speed distributions this fact seems to reduce the pressure effect mentioned above the terminal velocity of a raindrop is achieved when the sum of the forces gravity buoyancy and aerodynamic forces acting on the drop equals zero jones et al 2013 for a solid sphere the drag force f d can be expressed as 6 f d 1 2 ρ a v t 2 c d a c where ρ a is the air density v t is the terminal velocity and c d and a c are the drag coefficient and the cross sectional area of the precipitating particle respectively comes et al 1995 when f d is fixed a decrease in air density produces an increase in the terminal velocity of the raindrop the differences in ρ a between the continental and coastal sites in the present study are around 20 and 30 for medium jqro and unam and high altitude altz sites respectively thus the decrease in the atmospheric pressure i e the air density as the altitude increases is a key parameter to explain the measured increase in the mean fall speed of raindrops at the continental sites compared to those located near the coast fig 3 shows the drop size distributions dsd for the same periods presented in fig 2 these dsd were obtained under the same statistical considerations regarding the number of drops for each point of the spectra the number of drops detected in the size category during the period is greater than 100 all dsd in the figure correspond to the main rainy season in central and southern mexico which occurs from may to october it is also worth pointing out that cham and ltux are located in coastal plains whereas jqro and unam are in high plains along valleys the dsd agree with the r estimations in the sense that large drops d 3 mm are more common in periods of heavy rain interestingly the number of drops with d 3 5 mm is statistically significant for the rain spectra obtained at the medium altitude sites jqro and unam for r 60 mm h 1 but this is not the case for the distributions obtained at cham even though the r of the analyzed periods is greater table 2 shows the total number of one minute periods observed n t the number of analyzed periods n that corresponds to the number of those one minute periods with at least 30 drops detected and the percentage of one minute periods with r 1 mm h 1 and r 10 mm h 1 at each sampling site the outcomes indicate that more than about 80 of the one minute rainfall intensity estimates were less than 10 mm h 1 for all sampling sites and less than 30 of the estimates were less than 1 mm h 1 3 3 kinetic energy content in cham ltux jqro and unam sites kemax is a key parameter in eq 1 but its determination is not clear for example wischmeier and smith 1978 considered that kemm would remain constant for periods with r 76 mm h 1 but lim et al 2015 evaluated kemax with values using r 60 mm h 1 rainy periods with such high r values are not common in the areas here studied and represent only up to 2 of the data intervals with r values corresponding to the 95th percentile of rainfall intensity were used here to determine kemax table 3 with a representative sample thus kemax was estimated as the mean value of kemm calculated for these intervals the results in table 3 show a clear tendency of the increase of kemax with altitude an analysis of variance anova was carried out for the cham ltux jqro and unam sites which indicated significant differences between the kemax values fischer test f 2 6 with a confidence level 1 α of 95 since f does not give information on which groups are responsible for those differences post hoc tests were used to provide information about which groups within the study are different from each other for details see montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 scheffe s method is more appropriate and robust for pair wise comparisons of means when the sample sizes between groups are different but also for all complex comparisons of means without affecting the confidence level neter et al 1996 this method gives narrow confidence limits when rejecting the null hypothesis the significance of the result is very high morales vallejo 2008 and it has the larger likelihood of resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon exists greene 2000 scheffe s t value is computed from the number of groups and the fcrit value previously used for the anova analyses t 2 8 the t statistic is obtained with 7 t ke m a x i ke m a x j mse bet 1 n i 1 n j and it is used to compare the difference kemax i kemax j between the measurement platforms i and j msebet refers to the mean square error within categories from the anova and n is the number of 1 min periods collected in each sampling site morales vallejo 2008 the outcomes show significant differences between the kemax estimates obtained in these four platforms t 8 31 correct result interpretation is essential to extract the meaning of data and observations in turn effect size is an important tool for interpreting the effectiveness of a particular phenomenon effect size is a statistic that estimates the magnitude of an effect provides a relevant interpretation nakagawa and cuthill 2007 and can be expressed as the cohen effect size statistic d cohen 1988 computed as 8 d ke m a x i ke m a x j mse bet the d statistic can be taken as exactly equivalent to a z score of a standard normal distribution coe 2002 morales vallejo 2008 the effect on kemm due to the change in altitude is very substantial when considering the results of the effect size statistic d 0 9 for the comparison between the cham ltux jqro and unam sites fig 4 shows scatter plots of the kemm estimations as a function of r for the cham ltux jqro and unam sites the logarithmic scale on the abscissa exhibits in detail the behavior of kemm with r and shows that kemm increases with r a large dispersion of kemm for the whole rainfall intensity range can be observed kemm estimations obtained for calm light and moderate wind intensities w 3 5 m s 1 represented by crosses show a similar dispersion as those for high wind periods w 3 5 m s 1 represented by circles this seems to be in disagreement with the clear wind effect on the drop fall speed seen in fig 2 but it has to be noticed that velocity distributions that represent averages of sub super and terminal drops over a time period of a few minutes can produce a large range of individual one minute kemm estimates as reported by wilken et al 2018 the criterion used to classify the measurements in terms of wind intensity was based on the deviation of the mean v v t 0 value with respect to the uncertainty threshold of the pws100 see jqro panel in fig 2 fig 4 also illustrates that kemm increases with r between 0 5 mm h 1 and 20 to 30 mm h 1 depending of the site where most of the data lie table 2 furthermore fig 4 demonstrates an increase of the kemm range with the altitude of the sampling site for example the kemm estimates are usually below 20 j m 2 mm 1 in the cases of cham and ltux for rainfall intensities of 10 mm h 1 however for periods with similar r kemm values are close to 30 j m 2 mm 1 at jqro and unam where the altitudes are around 1950 and 2300 m a s l respectively this is because kemm is related to the average squared velocity of the raindrop population arriving at the ground sempere torres 1994 finally the data clearly show a similar behavior to that found by wischmeier and smith 1978 and lim et al 2015 in that kemm seems to reach an upper limit when r reaches a threshold of 60 mm h 1 the exponential expression proposed by kinnell 1981 is related to the average maximum of kemm found at high rain rates angulo martínez et al 2016 the parametric coefficients of the exponential relationship eq 1 between kemm and r at each sampling site are shown in table 4 kemax for cham ltux jqro and unam correspond to the average outcomes obtained from the kemm estimations for the one minute periods with r in the 95th percentile as mentioned before the a coefficient in eq 1 is related to the minimum kemm value for periods with very low rainfall intensities thus its value was estimated by 9 a 1 ke max ke min where kemin is the mean value of the kemm estimates for the one minute periods with r less than the 5th percentile table 3 the b coefficient was obtained with the matlab software using the levenberg marquardt algorithm and the least absolute residuals lar fitting method the coefficients of determination r2 indicate a strong correlation between kemm and r 3 4 the altz case the analysis of altz data is presented as a particular case because of its location which is a few meters below the level of the cloud base in the central area of mexico on the slope of the sierra nevada a crucial issue is the altitude of almost 4 km a s l of altz which implies that the environmental temperature during the rainfall events is very commonly around or just above 0 c thus the occurrence of mixed precipitation liquid water and ice particles is common this explains why severe liquid precipitation episodes in altz are uncommon only 2 one minute periods with rainfall rates greater than 60 mm h 1 were recorded over the sampling period nonetheless the pws100 is capable of distinguishing the phase of the precipitation which is a helpful characteristic for selecting the measurement periods without the presence of ice hydrometeors fig 5 shows the mean raindrop fall speeds expressed as v v t 0 as a function of the drop diameter for two sampling periods with different wind conditions the corresponding dsds are also presented as in fig 2 the shaded area represents the expected value for v t according to the environmental conditions at the site atmospheric pressure 635 hpa temperature between 3 5 and 10 c and the instrumental uncertainty in the case of light wind conditions top panel no significant raindrop fall speed deviations are observed however under high wind conditions w 3 5 m s 1 central panel the appearance of subterminal drops is evident as in the other sites prat and barros 2010 showed that the right hand side of dsd collected in valleys are heavier than those measured in ridges in this regards the mean raindrop diameter may be used as a proxy for the width of raindrop spectra for a given rainfall rate the larger it is the wider heavier the dsd is expected to be fig 6 displays the range of variation of the mean raindrop diameter d for 1 minute periods obtained from the disdrometer measurements for selected rainfall rates with an uncertainty of 10 similar to that of the water accumulation of the pws100 the central rectangle spans the interquartile range of d and the segment inside the rectangle corresponds to the median value obtained in each of the five sampling sites in contrast with the behavior described by prat and barros 2010 the results shown in fig 6 do not suggest any clear tendency to heavier dsd at the low altitude sites with respect to those gathered at higher altitude platforms for a given rainfall rate montero martínez et al 2011 revealed that the mass contents of solid hydrometeors are significant during the development of precipitation events over the mexico basin therefore the measurement of a significant amount of large raindrops resulting in high values of d in altz and unam and possibly in jqro would be the result of the melting of ice particles present in the mixed precipitation aloft thus the results presented in fig 6 suggest that raindrop diameter is not a major factor for the change of kemm with altitude fig 7 shows the kemm estimates for the one minute periods obtained at altz as a function of r as in fig 4 these results are presented in terms of wind conditions the dispersion in the diagram is larger than those obtained for the other sampling sites but it does not suggest any effect of wind on kemm also the results do not point out a clear tendency to estimate the kemax value in this location nevertheless the results in table 4 show a tendency toward larger values of kemax as the altitude of the sampling site increases thus based on the kemax and environmental data of the other four sampling sites the least squares regression method was used to obtain the following equations to describe the relationship between kemax and atmospheric pressure p in hpa which corresponds to the altitude 10 ke max 119 32 e 0 002 p r 2 0 88 11 ke max 295 16 39 63 ln p r 2 0 89 the r2 values for the exponential and logarithmic expressions are practically the same but the predicted values for kemax from both expressions are quite different the typical environmental pressure at altz is about 635 hpa the estimated kemax values for this pressure are 33 51 j m 2 mm 1 for the exponential expression and 39 40 j m 2 mm 1 for the logarithmic one and the estimated errors are 1 1 and 2 3 j m 2 mm 1 respectively as in the other four cases section 3 3 the a coefficients were obtained using eq 9 using the kemax values predicted by eqs 10 and 11 and the kemm mean value of the one minute periods with r less than the 5th percentile for altz the estimated a values are consistent with the results obtained for the other sites table 4 thus the equations obtained to estimate kemm for altz are 12 k e mm 33 51 1 0 803 e 0 121 r r 2 0 88 and 13 k e mm 39 40 1 0 832 e 0 076 r r 2 0 87 the evaluation for the goodness of fit for kemm using kemax from the exponential model suggests a better response than when using the logarithmic one however given the tendency of kemax for the other four sites see table 3 the value of 39 40 j m 2 mm 1 seems to be more coherent the results from eqs 12 and 13 are shown in fig 7 3 5 comparison of the results with previous studies the parameters for the exponential expression eq 1 obtained from optical and acoustic disdrometer data in previous studies by several investigators are presented in table 5 the expressions by rosewell 1986 and lim et al 2015 are the only ones based on direct drop fall speed measurements in all the other cases the resulting equation was obtained using data corrected for hydrometeor velocities the kemax values obtained by rosewell 1986 and lim et al 2015 are comparable to those found for the cham and ltux coastal low altitude sites and suggest a trend of larger kemax values as the altitude increases rosewell 1986 mentions that differences in kemax may be produced by changes in storm energy in relation to the maximum temperatures at the studied locations angulo martínez and barros 2015 and angulo martínez et al 2016 also discussed these kemax changes and attributed them to geographical meteorological and instrumental factors blanchard 1953 suggested that changes in dsd and liquid water content may be produced by evaporation when small drops falling through long distances from the cloud base may evaporate completely before reaching the ground this may in turn affect the energy of the rain event thus for events with equal r estimates of ke at lower elevations might be expected to be greater than those at higher locations although this is not easy to prove nonetheless other results suggest the opposite petan et al 2010 used drop fall speed data corrected according to gunn and kinzer 1949 and reported greater values of kemax at kozjane 595 m a s l than at koseze 405 m a s l finally morgan 2005 mentioned that rainfall energy increases with air density and altitude but did not provide any reason the definition of kinetic energy content relates the kinetic energy flux to the total drop mass flux see eq 4 then it is expected that similar amounts of water should fall during rainfall with comparable r over the same time periods the displayed data demonstrate that altitude and thus pressure and air density of a location is a key factor for the increase of raindrop fall speed with respect to sea level therefore the present results imply that the kemm anomalies observed with altitude for rain events with comparable intensities are related to the difference of the mean fall speeds of the raindrops as suggested by sempere torres 1994 furthermore in a pioneer work best 1950 proposed the following parametric form for terminal velocity 14 v t v t 0 a 0 e β z 1 e α d γ where z is the altitude and a 0 α β and γ are parameters of the fit note that eq 14 which considers the effect of altitude on v t has the same functional form as eq 1 4 summary and conclusions microphysical rain measurements were analyzed to study the differences in the kinetic energy content of rain events due to changes in the fall speed of raindrops the microphysical data were collected at five different sites across mexico using four optical disdrometers between 2014 and 2018 the sampling locations have very different environments and altitudes two of the measurement platforms are considered coastal with altitudes less than 200 m a s l whereas the other three are continental two at about 2000 m a s l and one at almost 4000 m a s l comparisons between pws100 and rain gauge measurements showed that the optical instruments usually detect a larger amount of water at all the sampling sites this is attributed to the pws100 ability to measure the duration of rain events from the first to the last raindrop which also allows this instrument to better detect light rain than the rain gauges the measurements of the fall speed of the raindrops from the disdrometers were compared to the theoretical terminal velocity adjusted for altitude at each site the outcomes showed that observations of fall speed during periods with low wind intensities w 3 5 m s 1 correspond to the theoretical estimations therefore the comparisons of the mean fall velocities indicated that hydrometeors detected at the continental sampling sites have greater speeds than those near coastal areas furthermore the results agree well with the decrease of the air drag force produced by the reduction in the air density as the altitude increases in the cases of rainy periods with high wind conditions the occurrence of subterminal drops produces a clear decrease in the mean fall speed for drops with d 1 5 mm as previously reported montero martínez and garcía garcía 2016 bringi et al 2018 thurai et al 2019 even though wind intensity affects raindrop fall speed the present results do not indicate any effects on the kinetic energy of the storms the kemm estimates obtained for rainy periods with comparable rainfall rates showed the same behavior as the raindrops fall speeds increase with altitude the kemax parameters obtained for these equations from one minute periods with r greater than the 95th percentile show the same tendency with larger values occurring as the altitude increases this behavior is consistent with the expectations based on sempere torres 1994 concerning the relationship of kemm to the mean squared velocity of the raindrop population arriving at the ground and with best s 1950 exponential parameterization of terminal speed with altitude an empirical equation was proposed to estimate the coefficient a of the exponential expression based on kemax and the mean kemm estimates for one minute intervals with r less than the 5th percentile the equation provides a values in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 for all sites with these considerations the r2 values r2 0 83 for cham jqro unam and ltux indicated good correlation between kemm and r in the derived exponential relationships it should be noticed that the parametric values presented in table 4 will be different in diverse places although the results obtained with the methodology proposed here indicate that the geographical environment latitude altitude air density etc influences the kemax and a parameter values in eq 1 other factors related to the dominant processes that cause rain also have an effect due to the lack of rain periods with r 60 mm h 1 at the altz site the values of kemax obtained for the other four sites cham ltuz jqro and unam were used to evaluate a pair of mathematical expressions to obtain kemax for the typical pressure at altz eqs 10 and 11 are proposed as an example on how to model the change of kemm with altitude and due to the number of sites used in this study circumspection when applying them for other regions should be exercised the goodness of fit results for the kemm r exponential parameterizations at altz observatory suggest a good response r2 0 87 when using kemax values of 33 5 j m 2 mm 1 or 39 4 j m 2 mm 1 these results show that the methodology may be suitable for estimating rainfall ke content at diverse altitudes finally these findings indicate that the detachment of soil particles by individual drops can be magnified at places with higher altitude respect to coastal locations although there are other factors that have to be considered such as the type of soil and terrain slope the amount of detached soil by the impact of raindrops may produce an important enhancement of interill erosion as altitude increases credit authorship contribution statement guillermo montero martínez conceptualization methodology formal
