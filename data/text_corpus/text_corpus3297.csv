16485,in this pilot scale study an innovative mainstream treatment process that couples the anaerobic membrane reactor anmbr with a one stage pn a system was proposed for advancing the concept of carbon neutrality in the municipal wastewater treatment plant this work demonstrates the start up procedure of a pilot scale one stage pn a system for mainstream treatment the 255 day start up of the one stage pn a system involved the cultivation of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob from the activated sludge suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob investigation of in situ growth kinetics of anammox bacteria anaob and the 50 day operation of the pilot scale anmbr pn a process for natural mainstream treatment it is verified in the pilot scale system for the first time that the in situ free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna exposure could effectively eliminate the nitrospira the nob genus while retaining the nitosonomas the aob genus community in the suspended sludge nob community rebounding was not detected even at the mainstream conditions with low nitrogen concentrations influent ammonium concentration 38 6 mg nh4 n l by intermittent aeration to control the system dissolved oxygen do below 0 5 mg l the results of the mainstream treatment showed that the average effluent total nitrogen tn in the coupled process was generally lower than 10 mg n l which meets the discharge limits of most prefectures in japan the investigated results of the in situ anammox bacteria anaob growth kinetics suggested that the promoted start up strategy of taking advantage of the warm months with higher mainstream temperature to achieve the rapid in situ growth of the anaob is applicable in the investigated regions from the perspective of the removal performance of the tn and organic

technology provide perspectives for the development of the energy saving and efficient nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob or anammox bacteria are autotrophs using ammonia and nitrite as the electron donor and acceptor respectively the anammox based process differs from conventional nitrification denitrification processes in that ammonium nh4 is oxidized to nitrogen n2 in the membrane bound organelle of the anaob kartal et al 2010 and no oxygen or organic carbon is required recent interest in anammox technology has turned to the mainstream treatments of municipal wastewater kartal et al 2010 li et al 2019 one of the alternatives to the conventional system is the partial nitritation anammox pn a process which involves two consecutive reactions aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob oxidize around 55 of ammonium to nitrite eq 1 and then anaob converts the remaining ammonium and the nitrite to nitrogen eq 2 the total chemical reaction of the pn a process is given in eq 3 in the pn a process it is only necessary for the ammonium to be partially oxidized to nitrite whereas it must be completely oxidized to nitrate in the oxic zone of the conventional aao process a comparison with the traditional nitrogen removal processes indicates a 60 reduction in energy costs due to the considerable decrease in aeration in the pn a process and an 80 reduction in excess sludge production cao et al 2017 1 1 3 n h 4 1 95 o 2 1 3 n o 2 2 6 h 1 3 h 2 o 2 n h 4 1 3

difficult among the current technologies in wastewater treatment the anaerobic digestion ad system is well known as an energy saving technique appels et al 2011 kong et al 2021 maktabifard et al 2018 wu et al 2019 2018 in the ad process organics in the waste streams are converted to biogas through a series of synergistic biochemical reactions by anaerobic microbial consortia the methane enriched biogas is a fuel with a high calorific value this is sufficient to offset a significant proportion of the energy demand in the wwtps maktabifard et al 2018 among the new generation of ad technologies the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr has a smaller footprint a higher biodegradation efficiency of organic matters and a more stable treatment quality zhen et al 2019 it has been shown that over 90 of the chemical oxygen demand cod in the municipal wastewater could be removed in the anmbr for the treatment of municipal wastewater kong et al 2021 inherent ammonia nitrogen is retained in the anmbr whereas the effluent ammonium concentration may rise through the hydrolysis of protein in the raw water in the attempt to apply the pn a process to the treatment of mainstream wastewater one of the challenges is that the fast growing heterotrophs like denitrifiers and methanogens may seriously encroach on slowly growing autotrophic bacteria such as aob and anaob for proliferation space gilbert et al 2014 jia et al 2020 miao et al 2018 guo et al 2020 found that the aob consortia retained positive growth in the biofilm without being over invaded by a denitrifier when the cod n ratio was lower than 0 8 in a one stage moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr type of pn a system malovanyy et al 2015a reported that the anaob was not out selected by denitrifiers at the cod n ratio of 1 8 in the pn a system based on experience the cod n ratio in municipal wastewater is usually higher than 5 0 and the anaerobic treatment may help to decrease the ratio in the mainstream treatment some configurations of using the ad pn a collaborative process treating mainstream wastewater have been proposed malovanyy et al 2015a b applied the one stage pn a system treating municipal wastewater after the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and achieved stable mainstream operations however large quantities of suspended matter with heterotrophic consortia in the anaerobic effluent from the conventional ad process flowed into the pn a system especially when granule floatation occurred in the uasb reactor wu et al 2021 2020 thus it is possible that this would result in the rapid growth of the invasive microorganisms in the pn a system in a study of the anmbr system because almost all of the sludge was retained by the membrane module the suspended solids ss could be effectively intercepted zhen et al 2019 that is one of the benefits of the anmbr combined process for mainstream nitrogen removal is that it largely avoids the detrimental effects of external pollutants on the pn a system however there are currently few reports in the literature based on the operation of this coupled pn a process concept another technical obstacle to applying the pn a system for mainstream treatment has been that the low strength of ammonium in the municipal wastewater was found to be insufficient to suppress the fast growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob reino et al 2018 chen et al 2019 duan et al 2019a b wang et al 2021 this presents an important challenge to find a way to selectively suppress nob and retain aob in the system in the mainstream pn a system it is generally considered that nob growth proceeds more slowly than that of aob since the nob directly competed with the anaob for limited nitrite and competed with the aob for limited dissolved oxygen do laureni et al 2019 wang et al 2021 one possible solution is to take advantage of the specific growth rate μ differentials of nob and aob to control the system sludge retention time srt for out selecting nob by setting the reciprocal of srt to the median of the μ nob and μ aob however guo et al 2020 reported that aob washout even occurred in a pn a system with biofilm enriched carriers since the enrichment of the aob on the biofilm was much lower than the anaob shortening the system srt for nob elimination would undoubtedly further aggravate aob washout in addition the differences in the growth rates of nob and aob were found to be minimal when the temperature dropped below 20 c hellinga et al 1998 it may be difficult to guarantee the effectiveness of controlling the system srt for selectively eliminating nob community in the pn a system several reports suggested that executing the do limitation in the system could be conducive to facilitating nitritation nh4 to no2 while limiting the further nitrification no2 to no3 since it is generally accepted that the aob has a higher oxygen affinity than nob laureni et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2001 chen et al 2021 reported that nob suppression could be achieved by controlling the do at 0 05 0 15 mg l in the lab scale pn a system treating wastewater with low strength ammonium however aob does not always have an absolute oxygen competitive advantage since the nob genus nitrospira was even shown to be capable of adapting to the continuous low do circumstance and this finally resulted in a shift in the nob community to an internal species structure that had a higher do affinity liu and wang 2013 some of the common metabolites and their derivatives in the anammox system such as free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa are biocidal agents it has been shown that a certain concentration range of the biocidal agents could selectively suppress nob cao et al 2017 however nob adaptation has also been confirmed to have occurred in sludge that had been treated with these biocidal agents for example while duan et al 2019a continuously used fna with a very high concentration of 4 2 mg n l to almost completely suppress nob in the sludge they found that the nob quickly recovered within 7 days after the fna treatment was stopped and the nob could no longer be suppressed to the previous level at the same fna condition recently wang et al 2021 employed a combination strategy using low do 0 2 0 4 mg l and high fa 350 mg n l to successfully suppress nob they indicated that the introduction of anaob into the system would facilitate its competition with the resistance nob species for nitrite and the pn a system was stably operated at the mainstream condition for over eight months however the related case studies that using combination strategy for selective suppression of the nob mainly were carried out on the lab scale the operation and management of the larger scale systems e g the pilot scale systems is much more complicated than lab scale operations this raises another question one wonders whether the prolonged doubling time of the anaob at lower temperature conditions makes it difficult to maintain a sufficient level of microorganisms in the reactor tomaszewski et al 2017 comparing with that in the lab scale pn a systems it is necessary to rely on in situ microbial proliferation and sludge return to ensure the level of microorganisms in the larger scale systems rather than the one time inoculation or occasional replenishment of the sufficient seed sludge nevertheless there are few reports available on the in situ microbial growth kinetics and sludge sedimentation characteristics in the pilot scale pn a system in this series of pilot research we propose an innovative coupling process that consists of an anmbr and a one stage pn a system anmbr pn a process for the treatment of mainstream wastewater this is the first pilot scale study of using the anmbr pn a process for the natural mainstream treatment with the primary priority on the establishment of parameters for the start up of the one stage pn a system hence a one stage integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas type of mainstream pn a system was started up at the pilot scale using the in situ fa fna exposure and do control to regulate the interspecies competition between aob and nob to achieve the selective nob elimination also in this study the evaluation was conducted of the performance of the actual mainstream treatment during the first 50 days at ambient temperature the goals of the pilot scale pn a system start up were 1 to selectively eliminate the nob community in the system 2 to achieve the in situ growth of the anaob with reasonable growth rates and 3 to finally ensure that the effluent total nitrogen tn of the mainstream anmbr pn a process meets the local nitrogen discharge standard tn 10 mg n l at a highest nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 5 g n l d besides the settleability behavior of the sludge and morphological characteristics of the bio carrier were discussed which is expected to provide information for the parameters of the sludge return and the retention strategy of the functional microorganisms in the larger scale mainstream pn a system 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the pilot scale anmbr pn a setup the pilot scale anmbr pn a process employed in this study was installed on site at the senen municipal wwtp miyagi japan which disposes of 130 474 m3 wastewater per day the sewered area covered by the wwtp is approximately 90 1 km2 and includes 3 cities 2 towns and 2 gulf basins it treats wastewater for 308 531 inhabitants the water quality of the received municipal wastewater in this treatment plant is relatively stable kong et al 2021 the water quality parameters of the raw water are introduced in section 3 4 the anmbr pn a setup was designed and constructed by mitsubishi kakoki kaisha ltd japan it consists of a raw water reservoir 2 5 m3 with a fine grille an anmbr system 5 0 m3 with a hollow fiber membrane module mitsubishi chemical corp and the ifas type of pn a system 1 67 m3 the operating performance of the submerged anmbr system for treating municipal wastewater has been reported in our recent studies kong et al 2021 the stable anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater and safe transmembrane pressure tmp was achieved at the hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 12 h for the anmbr system the detailed operation of the anmbr system will not be further discussed in this study a disk aerator was equipped at the bottom of the ifas pn a system and a stirring impeller was equipped to enhance hydraulic mixing of the system at the experimental periods with low airlift mixing aeration rate the anmbr effluent could be pumped into the pn a system through the pipework which had regulating valves to control the inflow rate a polyvinyl chloride tank with an effective volume of 500 l was employed to store the synthetic wastewater with a high concentration of ammonium during the periods of sludge acclimation the ifas pn a system was fed with synthetic wastewater and the anmbr effluent in different proportions as needed to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for the rapid growth of the autotrophic microorganisms the one stage ifas pn a system integrated with a feedback control system mitsubishi electric corp which controlled the power switch of the aeration blower according to the real time data of the dissolved oxygen do and ammonia sensors horiba ltd the effluent of the pn a system overflowed to a sedimentation basin with an effective volume of 1 92 m3 before the biofilm became completely attached to the carriers the precipitated sludge was returned to the pn a system using an impeller pump the supernatant overflowed to a regulating reservoir through the toothed weir finally merging into the municipal pipe network seasonal temperature control was adopted to maintain the process temperature at 25 c according to the local temperature in this work the thermostatic system was only activated during the cold months from november to may the external view and a structure diagram of the pilot scale anmbr pn a process are provided in fig 1 a and b 2 2 seed sludge and biofilm carrier on day0 400 l of activated sludge collected from the aerobic tank of a full scale aao process set in the same wwtp was inoculated to the ifas system this served as the aob inoculation at the same time 350 l of the cylindrical hollow carriers 10 mm φ 10 mm length made of hydrophobic polypropylene were filled the carrier fill rate was 20 on day90 40 l of the anammox granules with 2 5 wt volatile solids vs was dosed into the ifas system among them 20 l of the seed granules was sourced from a lab scale anammox expanded granular sludge blankets egsb reactor operated at nlr of 10 g n l d at 25 c the genus ca kuenenia was predominant in the anaob community of those granules details of the kind of granules are described in the literature ma et al 2020 the other half of the seed granules were obtained from a full scale anammox fluidized bed in kumamoto prefecture japan which was used to treat the wastewater with high nitrogen ca brocadia was the dominant genus of the anaob community of that reactor detailed biological information of the inoculated anammox granules can be found in the supplementary materials the recording video of the pn a system operation can be found in the video material 2 3 operational designs table 1 summarizes the operational designs for the start up of the pn a system the 256 day start up period of the pn a system was divided into 3 stages each stage was further subdivided into several operational periods in the first 90 days stage a the ifas system was intermittently fed with fully synthetic wastewater with ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 on day1 16 period a i the ifas system was fed with synthetic wastewater containing 250 mg n l of ammonium during period a i the system do was controlled at 2 4 mg l do limitation do 0 5 mg l was executed from period a ii on day17 period a ii and day63 period a iv ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 was one time dosed to the system to increase the system ammonium concentration to 600 mg n l fa and fna exposure was conducted in period a ii and a iv the proliferation of aob and anaob were executed in stage b by stepwise increasing the system nitrogen loading rate nlr during periods b i to b iii fully synthetic wastewater was fed to the system to increase the nlr from 0 05 to 0 1 g n l d the substrate ammonium concentration in the different experimental periods is provided in table 1 details of the trace element composition in the synthetic wastewater can be found in supplementary materials from period b iv the anmbr effluent the methane fermentation broth of the actual municipal wastewater mixed with synthetic wastewater was fed into the system by shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt of the anmbr effluent and increasing the ammonium concentration of the synthetic wastewater in period b v the nlr of the system was further increased to the target value of 0 5 g n l d finally the actual anmbr effluent was fed into the pn a system for long term mainstream treatment for over one year in this work in order to evaluate the start up performance of the one stage pn a system the operational performance during the first 50 days stage c of the long term mainstream treatment are discussed 2 4 sampling and analytical methods the water samples were taken on site and sent to the laboratory for water quality analysis the analysis interval for water quality of the ifas pn a system was as short as 1 day the sampling point was 50 cm below the water level of the reactor the ex situ specific anammox activity saa tests of the suspended sludge sampled from the pn a system was conducted in stage b and stage c with the analysis interval not exceeding 15 days saa tests were conducted according to the procedure outlined in an earlier study zhang et al 2016 the incubation temperature for the ex situ saa tests was 25 c sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride were added to the mixture of suspended sludge 5 ml and artificial medium 75 ml the initial nitrogen concentration of the artificial medium was set at 200 mg n l and the mole ratio of nh4 n no2 n was 1 1 32 the sampled suspended sludge was also used for the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of the anaob in stage c the analysis of the raw municipal water anmbr effluent and pn a effluent were included in the

particle size distribution meter spectris mastersizer 3000 was used to measure the diameter size distribution of the suspended sludge flocks granules 2 5 calculation methods the concentrations of free ammonia fa and free nitrite acid fna in the pn a system were calculated according to eqs 4 and 5 anthonisen et al 1976 4 fa 17 14 nh 4 n eff 10 ph e 6344 273 t 10 ph 1 5 fna 47 14 no 2 n eff e 2300

effluent nitrate mg n l the in situ growth rates of the anaob and aob were determined during day166 204 a simplified gompertz model eq 10 was used to fit the microbial growth curve to compute the growth rates of the anaob μanaob the curves of the dna copy number in the fixed length sequence and the ssa against operational time were fitted the growth rate of the aob μaob was computed by fitting the simplified gompertz curve of the ssa against operational time the microbial doubling time was calculated according to eq 11 10 w t e μ t λ 11 t d days ln 2 μ where w t is the dependent variable μ is the specific growth rate day 1 t is the operational time days λ is the lag phase time for microbial growth and td is the microbial doubling time days 2 6 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput sequencing analyses the time dependent change of the anaob quantity in the suspended sludge of the pn a system was quantified in the qpcr analysis the isoil for beads beating kit was used for extracting dna the tb green premix ex taq takara japan and the primer set of amx368f amx820 wang et al 2016 were employed to quantify anaob using the lightcycler instrument roche switzerland the standard curve was generated by diluting the standards from 2 10 2 to 2 10 7 copies tube the qpcr products were verified by melting analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis each of the analyses was conducted in triplicate high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed to analyze the microbial community information in the suspended sludge extracted dna was amplified in the pcr process by using the forward primer of 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and the reverse primer of 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 addressing the v3 and v4 regions besides the primers the

the pcr was set as follows 30 cycles at 94 c for 2 min 94 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s and 72 c for 5 min the illumina miseq pe300 platform was employed for sequencing the amplicons using qiime 2 software to assemble the obtained sequences operation taxonomic units otus were analyzed based on a greengenes database for genus level bacteria identification the similarity of the identified otus was set higher than 97 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data of 9 suspended sludge samples which are not subject to the commercial confidentiality agreements sampled during stage b and c were deposited at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi short read archive sra with the bioproject id prjna762611 3 results 3 1 activated sludge inoculation aob cultivation and the nob suppression stage a was served as the aob cultivation stage in this stage the target was the stable partial nitrification achieved in the ifas system by suppressing nob was targeted in period a 1 a high airflow rate 140 l min was adopted fig 2 a the do was controlled within the range from 1 5 to 2 5 mg l with intermittent aeration consequently as shown in fig 2 b nitrate built up in the effluent the aor and nor values in the ifas system were quite close with a clear upward trend fig 2 f indicating the fast growth of both aob and nob on day17 the ammonium concentration in the ifas system was increased to 610 mg nh4 n l by dosing with ammonium bicarbonate correspondingly the fa concentration raised to a peak of 106 mg n l which far exceeded the threshold that caused 100 nob suppression pichel et al 2019 the influent supply in this period was stopped and the airflow rate was decreased to 27 l min for slowing down the reaction progress of nitritation this series of operations are the called in situ fa exposure after that both aor and nor dropped with the decrease in the nor p 0 0001 two tailed t test significance level 0 05 more significant than that of the aor p 0 0005 see fig 2 f further intermittent aeration was taken in an attempt to make the ammonium oxidation proceed slowly in the ifas system and the system was dosed with as much sodium bicarbonate as required to maintain of system ph higher than 8 0 fig 2 c during day18 34 it was observed that nitritation was dominant in the ifas system the nitrite concentration correspondingly increased to 725 mg no2 n l while no significant increase in the nitrate concentration was observed as shown in fig 2 b on day35 tap water was used to dilute the residual nitrite in the ifas system thereafter the airflow rate was raised to 49 l min and the synthetic wastewater supply was resumed during period a iii as shown in fig 2 f the aor was as high as 0 18 g n l d on average whereas the nor dropped at one point to 0 g n l d day35 40 the transient in situ fa exposure suppressed most of the nob activity in the ifas system however because nor fluctuations were observed after day41 fig 2 f it was apparent that the nob activity had not been completely suppressed and it was decided that further measures needed to be taken to eliminate the nob community in the system on day64 the ammonium concentration in the ifas system was increased to nearly 500 mg nh4 n l by adding ammonium bicarbonate fig 2 a and the fa concentration was synchronously increased to 50 mg n l fig 2 d unlike that in period a ii the dosage of sodium bicarbonate to the system was reduced during day64 75 and the ph gradually decreased from 8 3 to 7 7 the decrease in the system ph was clearly associated with the release of hydrogen ions in ammonia oxidation peng et al 2008 the ph was able to regulate the degree of nitrogen dissociation zhou et al 2011 and the lower ph values favor the protonation of nitrite during day64 75 the nitrite concentration was increased from 120 to 340 mg no2 n l by ammonia oxidation of aob fig 2 b and the fna correspondingly increased from 3 to 46 μg n l fig 2 d which was defined as the in situ fna exposure the increase in fna was accompanied by an obvious decrease in the nor which approached 0 g n l d this coincides with the report that nob is more sensitive to fna exposure than aob piculell et al 2016 in period a v instead of the synthetic wastewater tap water was fed into the ifas system to reduce the nitrogen concentration and therefore avoid any negative effect of the inhibitors on the anaob that was to be inoculated to the system 3 2 anaob proliferation on day90 40 l anammox granules were added to the ifas system anaob proliferation was executed in stage b during period b i iii fully synthetic wastewater was fed into the system and the nlr was enhanced from 0 05 to 0 1 g n l d by increasing the influent ammonium concentration from 400 to 850 mg nh4 n l a blower failure occurred on day111 119 in period b i and the synthetic substrate supply was stopped on day115 119 during the period of the blower failure along with the nitrite remaining in the system being gradually consumed by anaob fig 3 c the fna in the system decreased to below 3 μg n l fig 3 f the system ph was adjusted to around 8 0 fig 3 a by adding hydrochloric acid to decrease the fa to an average of 15 mg n l fig 3 f after eliminating the microbial inhibitory factors of fna and fa the substrate supply and aeration were restored on day120 the nitrogen removal efficiency performed a continuous upward trend increased from 6 day97 period b i to 79 day163 period b iii with stepwise nlr enhancement at the end of period b iii as shown in fig 3 d the anr increased up to 0 08 g n l d which was close to the nlr setting of 0 10 g n l d indicating that the anaob maintained good growth at the high influent ammonium however in the event that the concentration of the ammonium influent is too high the risk that anaob will be inhibited is also high as shown in fig 3 f also it was not conducive to anaob adapting to the mainstream conditions the mixed wastewater contained with the ammonium rich synthetic wastewater and the anmbr effluent anaerobic effluent of the real municipal wastewater was fed into the ifas system during period b iv and v the actual influent ammonium concentration could be controlled at a low level of 120 150 mg nh4 n l by adjusting the mixing ratio as shown in table 1 the results show that the anr reached a peak of 0 44 g n l d when the nlr was enhanced to 0 57 g n l d day198 as shown in fig 3 d the nitrogen removal efficiency increased to around 70 at the end of period b v it was determined that the saa of the suspended sludge during stage b increased from 0 03 to 0 07 g n mlvss d see supplementary materials another significant finding was that the nor was consistently low during stage b fig 3 e even in period b iv and v of which both fa and fna concentrations in the ifas system were low enough that these could not even effectively suppress the nob fig 3 f this suggests that the nob may be eliminated from the ifas system after the fa fna exposure executed at period a iv at the end of period b v the synergistic relationships for nitrogen bioconversions between aob and anaob were well established as advocated by speth et al 2016 indicated that the ifas reactor had begun the functional characteristics of a one stage pn a system 3 3 in situ growth kinetics of anaob and aob in this study the growth kinetic parameters of anaob and aob were determined for the first time in the pilot scale system the in situ growth kinetic determination with the partial feed of the mainstream wastewater could more accurately reflect the proliferation of functional microorganisms under the site culturing conditions which provides guidance for the understanding of the growth rate of anaob biomass in situ sludge culturing the in situ growth kinetics of anaob and aob were developed on day166 206 period b iv v stage b during these periods since both the fa and fna in the system were controlled at a low level the inhibition of the anaob could be vastly reduced another positive factor during these periods was that the stepwise increase in the nlr helped to prevent anaob growth from being restricted by substrate insufficiency zhang et al 2017 an anammox specific primer set was used for quantification the ribosomal rna gene copy number rrn in the currently known anammox bacterial genomes ca brocadia and ca kuenenia is 1 as shown in fig 4 a an exponential increase in the dna copies of anaob was detected during day166 182 only the suspended sludge was investigated in terms of the growth kinetics development in this work the biofilm attached to the bio carrier was not considered since the biofilm had not been observed to be formed during the operation period so far using the simplified gompertz model to fit the duration dependent dna copies the results show that under 25 c the specific growth rate μ anaob dna and the corresponding doubling time td anaob dna of the anaob were 0 03 d 1 and 22 9 d respectively the same model was used to fit the anr daily recorded during this experimental period as shown in fig 4 b the μ anaob anr and td anaob anr of the anaob were calculated to be 0 02 d 1 and 34 1 d respectively although an attempt was made to adopt a unified sampling method throughout this work however the tiny differences in any operation may inevitably affect the fitting results of the microbial growth kinetics besides from a genetics perspective the number of whole genomes per cell may vary depending on the growth state of the bacteria in this study the higher specific growth rate was calculated according to the qpcr assays which may also be associated with it not being able to discriminate between active and inactive cells as shown in fig 4 c the specific growth rate of aob was 0 057 d 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 12 1 days besides the temperature effects the largely prolonged aob doubling time was also considered to be associated with the execution of system aeration restrictions 3 4 mainstream treatment performance during the first 50 days of the long term operation during stage c the pn a system was connected with the anmbr in series to verify the performance of the actual treatment of mainstream wastewater the pn a system was operated at two hrt conditions of 3 h on day206 215 and 4 h on day216 240 with the nlr at 0 30 and 0 20 g n l d since the anmbr effluent was fully pumped into the pn a system the hrt settings of the pn a system relied on the actual working conditions of the membrane module in the anmbr the operation results of the anmbr have been published elsewhere kong et al 2021 and are not further discussed in this study the operational results show that the stable operation of the pn a system was obtained in the mainstream treatment the average nitrogen removal efficiency was 74 3 and the peak value was 87 on day236 as shown in fig 5 d the effluent tn was detected over a range of 5 12 mg n l fig 5 b in addition the nor at the 50 day operation during stage c was observed to have approached 0 g n l d showing that the nob activity can be well inhibited even under mainstream conditions these indicated that the start up of the mainstream pn a system had been achieved table 2 shows the water quality parameters in each treatment stage of the anmbr pn a process on one hand the anmbr removed 87 8 of the cod in the raw water it should be noted that around 60 of the influent cod was converted to methane in the anmbr kong et al 2021 on the other hand the anmbr did not contribute to nitrogen removal since the anaerobic reactor provided a reducing environment that lacked the electron acceptors necessary for ammonium oxidation compared with that in the raw water around 36 increase in the ammonium concentration was detected in the anmbr effluent this was considered to be associated with the organic matters with larger molecular such as protein in the raw water hydrolyzed into small molecule nitrogen compounds the later can easily pass across the 0 45 μm pore size pes filter due to these the cod n ratio of the raw water was effectively decreased from 6 0 to around 1 1 by the anmbr p 0 00001 see fig 5 a and table 2 a cod n ratio lower than 1 0 determines the processing reliability of the pn a process by helping to avoid the condition where the fast proliferation of the heterotrophic denitrifiers outcompetes anaob in the nitrite competition guo et al 2020 ma et al 2017a the average effluent codcr and ammonium concentration of the mainstream pn a effuent were determined to be 32 mg l and 9 mg nh4 n l respectively which met the discharge standards for municipal wastewater established by most of the prefectural governments in japan 3 5 change in the relative abundance of aob and nob communities the information on the microbial community described in this section was only applied to the suspended sludge in the ifas pn a system since no biofilm formation was observed on the bio carrier during the whole operational period this will be discussed in section 3 7 the results of the high throughput sequencing of the 16 s rrna showed that the detected aob and nob sequences in the ifas pn a system were assigned to the genus nitosonomas and nitrospira respectively no other aob and nob genus was detected as shown in fig 6 genus nitosonomas and nitrospira were inoculated into the system with the seed sludge and their relative abundances in the ifas system on day0 were 0 22 and 0 52 respectively adequate aeration and high ammonium feeding were provided to the system during period a i both the aob and nob proliferated at an alarming rate during this period the relative abundances of nitosonomas and nitrospira increased to 16 4 and 22 1 respectively within only 16 days a decrease in the relative abundances of both nitosonomas and nitrospira was noticed after the sludge in the ifas system was exposed in situ at 106 mg n l of fa on day17 among them the decrease in the relative abundance of nitrospira was particularly obvious with a relative abundance of just 1 7 on day32 during period a iv the sludge was alternately exposed to the high fa and fna on day86 the relative abundance of nitosonomas was observed to be stayed relatively stable which may indirectly reflect that aob community has developed the resistance to fa and have a higher resistance to fna while the nob genus nitrospira could no longer be detected in the sludge it is notable that besides nitrospira no other nob genus was detected in the subsequent stages of operation a positive growth trend was observed for the aob genus nitosonomas from day112 which is basically consistent with the aor data determined during this period the relative abundance of genus nitosonomas peaked at 12 1 during stage b and remained stable around 8 6 10 3 at stage c 3 6 descriptions of the ex situ settleability of suspended sludge in the pn a system in this study the settleability of the suspended sludge in the ifas system in terms of volume sv and settling velocity was evaluated on day165 period b iii and day205 period b v which corresponded to the feeding with fully synthetic wastewater and the anaerobic effluent mixture the settling time series records emphasized the change in sludge settleability under different mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss the sludge with the gradient mlvss was prepared by diluting or thickening the original sludge sampled from the ifas system in different proportions as shown in fig 7 a on day165 the sludge with the lower mlvss exhibited the more superior settleability according to the sedimentation characteristics the settling behavior of the activated sludge can be divided into four types i e discrete flocculent hindered and compression ekama et al 1997 riffat 2012 the settling curves of suspended sludge in day165 showed that the sedimentation of the sludge in an mlvss range of 1000 3000 mg l experienced from discrete to hindered and finally to compression settlings as shown in fig 7 a the settling behavior was observed to be linear at 0 5 min indicating that the sludge could freely settle without the interaction force between the aggregates and that the settling velocity at this time was inversely proportional to the mlvss baalousha et al 2011 this is consistent with the results obtained in this work see fig 7 a due to the interaction force caused by the sludge flocs as they further approached each other the slope of the settling curves gradually decreased from 5 to 30 min finally the sludge settled to the compressing threshold after 30 min the mud liquid interface became clear and stabilized this has been shown to be common in activated sludge with good settling capacities riffat 2012 the thickened sludge with an mlvss of 5000 mg l was in a compression settling at the initial period of settling the mud liquid interface had hardly formed with the progress of settling in this work the mlvss mlss abbreviated from mixed liquor suspended solids ratio of the suspended sludge was constant at around 0 7 on day165 the mlvss of the original suspended sludge was around 2500 mg l the sv30 and the sludge volume index svi were 35 and 97 2 ml g respectively suggesting that the suspended sludge in the ifas system had considerable settleability during the period an apparent downward shift in the sludge concentration threshold of compression settling was observed on day205 that is the original sludge with an mlvss of 2000 mg l fig 7 b was at the compression state even at the beginning of the settling the long term records of the suspended sludge concentration during this work can be found in the fig s2 a supplementary materials the svi of the sludge was determined to be 315 8 ml g these illustrated that the settleability and compressibility of the suspended sludge became poorer when the influent was switched to the mixed wastewater with an essentially shortened system hrt the results of the analysis of the particle size distribution of the suspended sludge in the ifas system at different experimental periods day0 day135 and day205 are shown in fig 8 the particle size of the suspended sludge met the gaussian distribution the mean μ of the gaussian distribution curves represented the average size of the sludge aggregates which left shifted from 135 0 to 71 3 μm with time over the experimental period that is as the start up of the pn a system progressed the average size of the suspended sludge aggregates in the ifas system continued to decrease 3 7 microscopic morphology of the suspended sludge in the ifas system and biofilm formation the images from the photographic and sem analysis of the carriers and suspended sludge are shown in fig 9 each of the sem images shown in this work was selected from dozens of representative photos according to the 50x sem image of the new carriers cavity structures were largely observed on the inner surface these cavities may provide favorable space for the enrichment of microorganisms the inner surface of the new carriers appeared flat and smooth at 10000x magnification as mentioned above the anaob seed sludge was inoculated to the system on day60 on day165 the suspended sludge in the ifas system was reddish brown and the settleability was close to that of activated sludge under the 50x eyepiece it was clear that the suspended sludge consisted of a large number of flocs and some granules while filamentous bacterium was found in the activated sludge figures not shown none was found in the suspended sludge dispersed short rod shaped cells and cocci congeries were observed in the 10000x sem image these were close to the morphological description of the nitrosomonas a genus assigned to anaob and the anaob congeries respectively fujitani et al 2015 yang et al 2021 respectively on day230 although no visible biofilm was seen on the carrier the 50x sem image shows that the inner surface of the carriers had become rougher and had fewer and smaller cavity structures under 10000x magnification the adherent growth of cocci congeries was observed on the inner surface of the carriers these indicate that the biofilm had started to form on the carriers besides the absence of the rod shaped cells on the carriers was probably because the consortium of aob is more inclined to discretely populate in the more mobile sludge aggregates laureni et al 2016 after four months of continuous treatment of mainstream wastewater the related discussion on the treatment performance is beyond the scope of this work on day350 the thick biofilm could be observed on the inner surface of the carriers the biofilm layer was crimson with granulated microbial clusters clearly observed on it the sem image of the biofilm shows that the microorganisms initially grew in the cavity structures on the carriers and the microbial flocs gradually filled the cavities the flocs attached to the carriers tended to close with the proliferation of microorganisms and then formed the biofilm this was also consistent with the mechanism of biofilm formation described by heijnen et al 1992 4 discussion 4 1 factors in achieving selective nob suppression overall the achievement of selective inhibition of nob in this work depended on the in situ regulation of fa fna and system do the non ionized fa is known as a significant inhibitor of both aob and nob the selective nob suppression of using fa relies on the higher inhibition threshold and the faster activity recovery pace of the aob piculell et al 2016 wang et al 2020 in terms of the aob and nob communities detected in this work the aob genus nitrosomonas is more tolerant to fa than the nob genus nitrospira shao and wu 2021 this could be corroborated by the higher decline in nor than anr after the fa exposure on day17 in this study however there is still a concern that nob suppression achieved by a high level of fa alone is not always effective in long term since the nob has a strong ability to recover from fa inhibition duan et al 2019a qiu et al 2021 it has known that aob has more variable and different fna inhibitory thresholds than nob in one case reported by zhou et al 2011 50 of aob activity was reduced at the fna concentration range of 420 1720 μg n l while nob activity was completely suppressed at the fna concentration of 66 μg n l fna has been reported that could penetrate cell membranes and act on nucleic acids causing oxidative damage to microbial cells duan et al 2019a which suggests that fna treatment at the appropriate concentrations is a more effective measure for achieving selective nob suppression this is also our primary consideration for executing fna exposure after the fa exposure at period a iv however it must be noted that the tolerance to inhibitors varied between different nob species nitrospira has been reported to be more sensitive to fna than nitrobacter even at an fna concentration lower than 30 μg n l blackburne et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 also it has been reported that ca nitrotoga has a higher fa tolerance than nitrospira wang et al 2021 the existing reports indicated that among the common nob genus nitrospira would likely be more easily eliminated using fa fna combination treatment in this work nitrospira was found to be the only nob population a microbiological community analysis clearly showed that it was inoculated into the ifas system along with the seed activated sludge after receiving alternative fa fna exposure in stage a the nob community nitrospira was almost eliminated from the system and the aob community nitrosomonas was largely retained the interspecies competition advantage of nob after the fna treatment might also depend on the difference of fna inhibition thresholds of the diverse nob species for example ca nitrotoga which has a higher resistance to fna was likely to survive after fna suppression at 75 μg n l and finally triggered nob community rebounding through the nob community shifted from nitrospira to ca nitrotoga ma et al 2017b the low do control has been shown to act as the primary measure for the suppression of ca nitrotoga after alternately limiting the system do at 0 4 and 0 7 mg l zheng et al 2020 found that ca nitrotoga was affected much more than nitrospira with the ca nitrotoga in the system continuing to decrease under such do conditions and finally becoming undetectable after 2 months wang et al 2021 found that controlling do at 0 2 0 4 mg l could effectively eliminate ca nitrotoga in the sludge besides ca nitrotoga the lower do condition has also been shown to have a positive effect on suppressing the growth of nitrobacter liu and wang 2013 with the growth rate of nitrobacter two orders of magnitude lower than that of nitrospira when the do was not higher than 0 5 mg l it is worth mentioning that although nitrospira had a competitive advantage in the low do condition the in situ fa fna exposure largely eliminated the nob in the suspended sludge there is evidence that the nob was difficult to re enrich for a long period once eliminated to a minimal level duan et al 2019b which was consistent with that observed in this work nitrospira was not detected again in the system in the period b iv v and stage c with a low level of nitrogen and do moreover microorganisms enriched influent herein refer to the raw blackwater has been pointed to be another seeding source of nob which seeded with the blackwater significantly triggered the resurgence of the nob community in the pn a system duan et al 2019b jiang et al 2020 an operational strategy proposed by duan et al 2019b is to perform primary sedimentation before the pn a treatment which could largely reduce the abundance of the nob community in the influent in this pilot scale study on one hand the relative abundance of nob community in the raw water is expected to be not particularly high since the raw water was collected from the full scale processing line after the primary sedimentation on the other hand the membrane module with the 0 4 μm pore size set in the fine grid equipped anmbr is equivalent to double insurance which could effectively intercept the microbial flocs including nob community in the raw water and minimize the risk of the exogenous microorganisms secondarily seeded to the pn a system with influent feeding these measures are very positive to the stable long term operation of the subsequent mainstream pn a treatment in this study decreasing the system do to lower than 0 5 mg l after the in situ fa fna exposure was proven to be an effective combination strategy to avoid the mutual shift of nob species with competitive advantages which is probably beneficial to prolong the inhibition period of the nob community this is the first report on using the combination strategy of in situ fa fna treatment and do limitation to selectively eliminate the nob in such a large scale pn a system it is suggested that the high level ammonium required for fa fna exposure in the larger scale treatment processes may be supplied by introducing the effluent supernatant of the side stream or sludge fermentation process instead of the addition of extra chemicals based on the current knowledge due to the issues that the wastewater source and the flow rate in the side stream process is much lower the supposed nitrogen supply method may be more suitable for the wwtps with multiple treatment lines in parallel and the side stream effluent should be stored in advance as needed besides the implementation of do limitation may be conducive to further reducing the aeration costs the program of the do ammonium feedback controlling system can be found in supplementary materials however the long term effectiveness of nob suppression in the continuous low nitrogen environment is still unknown to our best knowledge there has never been any conclusive evidence that the nob community including nitrospira sp can develop adaptability in high fna environment this may raise a possibility that nob re suppression by a similar type in situ fna exposure in the case of the nob community rebounding that occurred in the continuous mainstream conditions with the low level of nitrogen the points require further investigation in subsequent studies on the long term treatment of mainstream wastewater 4 2 temperature still a challenge to anaob culturing and mainstream treatment as mentioned in section 3 3 it is estimated that the in situ μmax of anaob ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 d 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 34 1 22 9 days the detected growth rates of the anaob at 25 c were similar to those reported by lotti et al 2014a who found the μmax of anaob was 0 02 d 1 at 20 c while lower than the growth rates of any known anaob species of 0 05 0 33 d 1 at 30 38 c tsushima et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 in this work more than 110 days was required to enhance the system nlr from 0 05 to 0 5 g n l d at 25 c under the operation of the heating system and finally obtain a low enough effluent tn 10 mg n l in the mainstream treatment the investigated region of this study sendai japan lies at lat 38 16 05 n long 140 52 11 e the mainstream temperature in the wwtps could be maintained at 20 25 c for around four months from june to october due to the local temperature due to the condition constraints of this pilot project we inoculated with the seed anaob granules in late september hence a system heating device was kept running from day105 for almost six months to control the system temperature at 25 c however it is unrealistic to set up a heating system on a larger scale similar system for the start up of the larger scale pn a system anaob sludge may be inoculated and cultured in the warm months to achieve the relatively fast growth of anaob without the operation of heating devices besides another technology has been tested that makes full use of the biogas produced in the anmbr which uses the heat generated from the methane combustion system to heat the influent instead of converting heat energy into electricity to heat the pn a system this is beneficial to further increase the operational temperature in an inexpensive way the proposed start up methods may be universally applicable in most regions in japan since the major cities of japan mainly lie to the south of sendai and therefore have longer periods of warm weather nevertheless these temperatures 20 25 c are still high for mainstream treatment in most high latitude countries it has known that anaob activity or its specific activation energy decreases accordingly with the temperature decrease from the mesophilic to psychrophilic condition lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2019 the more unfavorable temperature effects on the anaob growth were particularly relevant below 20 c laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2019 this is also one of the main issues with starting a mainstream anammox process lotti et al 2014a found that lowering the temperature caused a massive reduction in the growth rate of anaob at 15 c the anaob doubling time was prolonged by as long as 70 days considering the start up time elapsed in this study this probably means that the start up period of a pn a system of the same scale would be much longer than 200 days in a cold zone in addition the lower temperature may also affect the processing stability of the mainstream pn a system the primary concern is that low temperatures have a significant adverse effect on anammox activity and this may cause a reduction in the nitrogen removal rate in their study on the treatment of low strength ammonia wastewater influent nh4 160 mg n l wastewater using an airlift pn a reactor lotti et al 2014b found that the reduction in temperature from 20 to 15 c resulted in a decrease in the tn removal efficiency from 86 to 73 which was attributed to the rate limited anammox reaction caused by the weakened anaob activity reino et al 2018 had a new perspective that short term low temperature effects on anaob may be minor since the anaob sludge in the bottom of the plug flow reactor that was allocated with more substrates could release excess metabolic capacity in the early period of temperature decrease they found that the nitrogen removal efficiency dropped by only 9 even after the temperature was decreased from 22 to 11 c for a long period of time in our work the anaob sludge had been cultured with the high strength ammonia wastewater during stage b and the maximum culturing nlr was 0 5 g n l d which was higher than the 0 2 0 3 g n l d in the mainstream treatment hence it is reasonable to assume that the anaob in this study may also have a higher metabolic capacity to adapt to the lower temperatures moreover it is well known that the predominant anaob genus at lower temperatures 20 c is ca brocadia laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a b reino et al 2018 which was also the predominant anaob genus observed in the 50 day mainstream treatment data not shown these suggest that there may still be room for further reduction in the temperature of the pilot scale pn a system in the mainstream treatment in the subsequent long term mainstream treatment the heating system of the pn a system has been completely shut down to seasonally reduce the system temperature to 15 c to focus on the mainstream treatment performance of the proposed anmbr pn a process at lower temperatures 4 3 biomass retention and settleability of the suspended sludge although the biofilm attached carrier could effectively retain the biomass in the bioreactor the formation of a stable biofilm on the bio carrier is very time consuming the results observed in this work show that no available biofilm was detected on the surface of the bio carrier till the end of the start up of the pn a system bio carriers with biofilm attachment were widely observed after around half a year of continuous mainstream treatment as shown in fig 9 in the start up periods of the pn a system the microbial reactions were mainly in the suspended sludge and the physicochemical properties and hydraulic conditions of the suspended sludge are like those of the conventional plug flow activated sludge method during this work biomass retention is attained through the sedimentation and recirculation of the solids from the following settling basin this is the reason that the type of the pn a system in this research scenario was defined as an ifas system instead of mbbr sludge settleability has been shown to be significant in the efficiency of biomass recycling ekama et al 1997 especially for such a pilot scale mainstream pn a system the specific growth rates of both aob and anaob were determined to be very low while it would be challenging to replenish the system with the necessary amount of biomass to maintain the treatment capacity in a short time once the sludge flush out occurs this factor is often overlooked in lab scale research a deterioration in the settleability of the suspended sludge was observed in the ifas system after feeding with the mixed wastewater as mentioned in section 3 6 one of the significant changes in the operational conditions during these periods was that the hrt was largely shorted from 8 35 days to 6 h see table 1 this illustrates that the turnover rate of the substrate and suspended sludge was sharply enhanced as a result of the consistent 0 5 sludge return ratio during stage b it has been reported in numerous studies that the sludge aggregates are sheared under the enhanced shear stress in the mixed flow reactor with the dense aggregates gradually becoming looser flocs as a result and that these looser flocs had smaller diameters and poorer settling properties kosgey et al 2021 laureni et al 2015 the results of the sludge aggregate size distribution described in section 3 6 were consistent with the findings in these earlier reports we speculated that the stronger shear force caused by the enhanced substrate influx and aeration disturbance to maintain the necessary system do on the sludge may well be one of the reasons for the disintegration of the larger sludge aggregates dapena mora et al 2004 kosgey et al 2021 chen et al 2019 suggested that the sludge aggregates in the one stage pn a system were a special type of granule with a double layer structure with the anaob gathered in the core layer wrapped by the outermost aob it is not difficult to imagine that the first to bear the brunt in case of the sludge aggregate disintegration was the aob which was stripped from the larger sludge aggregates then eluted into the flocs with the latter more likely to be washed out of the reactor correspondingly the adhesion of gas bubbles on the flocs in the ifas system may further contribute to poorer sludge settling properties hence besides anaob more pay attention must be paid to the amount of aob community in the mainstream system pollice et al 2002 reported that long term stable partial nitritation was achieved under the system do limitation independent of the sludge age thus in this work to retain sufficient biomass in the ifas system we attempted to completely return the suspended sludge from the settling basin to the ifas system given the deteriorating settling performance of the suspended sludge and the lack of an effective means to prevent it from occurring we increased the sludge return ratio from 0 5 to 1 0 during stage c see table 1 5 conclusions in this pilot scale study a one stage pn a system was successfully started for treating the anmbr effluent in the mainstream treatment the innovative anmbr pn a process is proven to be effective in the treatment of mainstream wastewater from the results of this work the following conclusions can be made in situ selective nob suppression using fa fna exposure was achieved in a pilot scale study for the first time nitrospira was the only nob genus detected in the suspended sludge initially present the relative abundance was determined to have decreased from 22 1 to 1 7 after in situ exposing the sludge to 106 mg n l of fa the nitrospira community was finally eliminated from the sludge by the in situ fna treatment at 46 μg n l intermittent aeration low do control was beneficial for avoiding the community transfer of dominant nob species under the low ammonium conditions in situ anaob proliferation was completed within four months at 25 c at the conditions of feeding with sufficient ammonium nitrogen the in situ doubling time of the anaob and aob was estimated to be 24 9 33 1 days and 12 1 days respectively special attention needs to be paid to maintain the biomass in the suspended sludge in the ifas pn a system during the system start up periods since biofilm attachment to the bio carriers was observed to be around half a year increased hydraulic shear force at the mainstream condition resulted in the settleability deterioration of suspended sludge biomass could be retained by increasing the sludge return ratio from 0 5 to 1 0 at the hrt 3 4 h as the results of the pn a system start up the average effluent tn was lower than 10 mg n l which meets the nitrogen discharge limits of the region was achieved in the anmbr pn a process treating mainstream wastewater

16485,in this pilot scale study an innovative mainstream treatment process that couples the anaerobic membrane reactor anmbr with a one stage pn a system was proposed for advancing the concept of carbon neutrality in the municipal wastewater treatment plant this work demonstrates the start up procedure of a pilot scale one stage pn a system for mainstream treatment the 255 day start up of the one stage pn a system involved the cultivation of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob from the activated sludge suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob investigation of in situ growth kinetics of anammox bacteria anaob and the 50 day operation of the pilot scale anmbr pn a process for natural mainstream treatment it is verified in the pilot scale system for the first time that the in situ free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna exposure could effectively eliminate the nitrospira the nob genus while retaining the nitosonomas the aob genus community in the suspended sludge nob community rebounding was not detected even at the mainstream conditions with low nitrogen concentrations influent ammonium concentration 38 6 mg nh4 n l by intermittent aeration to control the system dissolved oxygen do below 0 5 mg l the results of the mainstream treatment showed that the average effluent total nitrogen tn in the coupled process was generally lower than 10 mg n l which meets the discharge limits of most prefectures in japan the investigated results of the in situ anammox bacteria anaob growth kinetics suggested that the promoted start up strategy of taking advantage of the warm months with higher mainstream temperature to achieve the rapid in situ growth of the anaob is applicable in the investigated regions from the perspective of the removal performance of the tn and organic

technology provide perspectives for the development of the energy saving and efficient nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob or anammox bacteria are autotrophs using ammonia and nitrite as the electron donor and acceptor respectively the anammox based process differs from conventional nitrification denitrification processes in that ammonium nh4 is oxidized to nitrogen n2 in the membrane bound organelle of the anaob kartal et al 2010 and no oxygen or organic carbon is required recent interest in anammox technology has turned to the mainstream treatments of municipal wastewater kartal et al 2010 li et al 2019 one of the alternatives to the conventional system is the partial nitritation anammox pn a process which involves two consecutive reactions aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob oxidize around 55 of ammonium to nitrite eq 1 and then anaob converts the remaining ammonium and the nitrite to nitrogen eq 2 the total chemical reaction of the pn a process is given in eq 3 in the pn a process it is only necessary for the ammonium to be partially oxidized to nitrite whereas it must be completely oxidized to nitrate in the oxic zone of the conventional aao process a comparison with the traditional nitrogen removal processes indicates a 60 reduction in energy costs due to the considerable decrease in aeration in the pn a process and an 80 reduction in excess sludge production cao et al 2017 1 1 3 n h 4 1 95 o 2 1 3 n o 2 2 6 h 1 3 h 2 o 2 n h 4 1 3

difficult among the current technologies in wastewater treatment the anaerobic digestion ad system is well known as an energy saving technique appels et al 2011 kong et al 2021 maktabifard et al 2018 wu et al 2019 2018 in the ad process organics in the waste streams are converted to biogas through a series of synergistic biochemical reactions by anaerobic microbial consortia the methane enriched biogas is a fuel with a high calorific value this is sufficient to offset a significant proportion of the energy demand in the wwtps maktabifard et al 2018 among the new generation of ad technologies the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr has a smaller footprint a higher biodegradation efficiency of organic matters and a more stable treatment quality zhen et al 2019 it has been shown that over 90 of the chemical oxygen demand cod in the municipal wastewater could be removed in the anmbr for the treatment of municipal wastewater kong et al 2021 inherent ammonia nitrogen is retained in the anmbr whereas the effluent ammonium concentration may rise through the hydrolysis of protein in the raw water in the attempt to apply the pn a process to the treatment of mainstream wastewater one of the challenges is that the fast growing heterotrophs like denitrifiers and methanogens may seriously encroach on slowly growing autotrophic bacteria such as aob and anaob for proliferation space gilbert et al 2014 jia et al 2020 miao et al 2018 guo et al 2020 found that the aob consortia retained positive growth in the biofilm without being over invaded by a denitrifier when the cod n ratio was lower than 0 8 in a one stage moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr type of pn a system malovanyy et al 2015a reported that the anaob was not out selected by denitrifiers at the cod n ratio of 1 8 in the pn a system based on experience the cod n ratio in municipal wastewater is usually higher than 5 0 and the anaerobic treatment may help to decrease the ratio in the mainstream treatment some configurations of using the ad pn a collaborative process treating mainstream wastewater have been proposed malovanyy et al 2015a b applied the one stage pn a system treating municipal wastewater after the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and achieved stable mainstream operations however large quantities of suspended matter with heterotrophic consortia in the anaerobic effluent from the conventional ad process flowed into the pn a system especially when granule floatation occurred in the uasb reactor wu et al 2021 2020 thus it is possible that this would result in the rapid growth of the invasive microorganisms in the pn a system in a study of the anmbr system because almost all of the sludge was retained by the membrane module the suspended solids ss could be effectively intercepted zhen et al 2019 that is one of the benefits of the anmbr combined process for mainstream nitrogen removal is that it largely avoids the detrimental effects of external pollutants on the pn a system however there are currently few reports in the literature based on the operation of this coupled pn a process concept another technical obstacle to applying the pn a system for mainstream treatment has been that the low strength of ammonium in the municipal wastewater was found to be insufficient to suppress the fast growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob reino et al 2018 chen et al 2019 duan et al 2019a b wang et al 2021 this presents an important challenge to find a way to selectively suppress nob and retain aob in the system in the mainstream pn a system it is generally considered that nob growth proceeds more slowly than that of aob since the nob directly competed with the anaob for limited nitrite and competed with the aob for limited dissolved oxygen do laureni et al 2019 wang et al 2021 one possible solution is to take advantage of the specific growth rate μ differentials of nob and aob to control the system sludge retention time srt for out selecting nob by setting the reciprocal of srt to the median of the μ nob and μ aob however guo et al 2020 reported that aob washout even occurred in a pn a system with biofilm enriched carriers since the enrichment of the aob on the biofilm was much lower than the anaob shortening the system srt for nob elimination would undoubtedly further aggravate aob washout in addition the differences in the growth rates of nob and aob were found to be minimal when the temperature dropped below 20 c hellinga et al 1998 it may be difficult to guarantee the effectiveness of controlling the system srt for selectively eliminating nob community in the pn a system several reports suggested that executing the do limitation in the system could be conducive to facilitating nitritation nh4 to no2 while limiting the further nitrification no2 to no3 since it is generally accepted that the aob has a higher oxygen affinity than nob laureni et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2001 chen et al 2021 reported that nob suppression could be achieved by controlling the do at 0 05 0 15 mg l in the lab scale pn a system treating wastewater with low strength ammonium however aob does not always have an absolute oxygen competitive advantage since the nob genus nitrospira was even shown to be capable of adapting to the continuous low do circumstance and this finally resulted in a shift in the nob community to an internal species structure that had a higher do affinity liu and wang 2013 some of the common metabolites and their derivatives in the anammox system such as free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa are biocidal agents it has been shown that a certain concentration range of the biocidal agents could selectively suppress nob cao et al 2017 however nob adaptation has also been confirmed to have occurred in sludge that had been treated with these biocidal agents for example while duan et al 2019a continuously used fna with a very high concentration of 4 2 mg n l to almost completely suppress nob in the sludge they found that the nob quickly recovered within 7 days after the fna treatment was stopped and the nob could no longer be suppressed to the previous level at the same fna condition recently wang et al 2021 employed a combination strategy using low do 0 2 0 4 mg l and high fa 350 mg n l to successfully suppress nob they indicated that the introduction of anaob into the system would facilitate its competition with the resistance nob species for nitrite and the pn a system was stably operated at the mainstream condition for over eight months however the related case studies that using combination strategy for selective suppression of the nob mainly were carried out on the lab scale the operation and management of the larger scale systems e g the pilot scale systems is much more complicated than lab scale operations this raises another question one wonders whether the prolonged doubling time of the anaob at lower temperature conditions makes it difficult to maintain a sufficient level of microorganisms in the reactor tomaszewski et al 2017 comparing with that in the lab scale pn a systems it is necessary to rely on in situ microbial proliferation and sludge return to ensure the level of microorganisms in the larger scale systems rather than the one time inoculation or occasional replenishment of the sufficient seed sludge nevertheless there are few reports available on the in situ microbial growth kinetics and sludge sedimentation characteristics in the pilot scale pn a system in this series of pilot research we propose an innovative coupling process that consists of an anmbr and a one stage pn a system anmbr pn a process for the treatment of mainstream wastewater this is the first pilot scale study of using the anmbr pn a process for the natural mainstream treatment with the primary priority on the establishment of parameters for the start up of the one stage pn a system hence a one stage integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas type of mainstream pn a system was started up at the pilot scale using the in situ fa fna exposure and do control to regulate the interspecies competition between aob and nob to achieve the selective nob elimination also in this study the evaluation was conducted of the performance of the actual mainstream treatment during the first 50 days at ambient temperature the goals of the pilot scale pn a system start up were 1 to selectively eliminate the nob community in the system 2 to achieve the in situ growth of the anaob with reasonable growth rates and 3 to finally ensure that the effluent total nitrogen tn of the mainstream anmbr pn a process meets the local nitrogen discharge standard tn 10 mg n l at a highest nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 5 g n l d besides the settleability behavior of the sludge and morphological characteristics of the bio carrier were discussed which is expected to provide information for the parameters of the sludge return and the retention strategy of the functional microorganisms in the larger scale mainstream pn a system 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the pilot scale anmbr pn a setup the pilot scale anmbr pn a process employed in this study was installed on site at the senen municipal wwtp miyagi japan which disposes of 130 474 m3 wastewater per day the sewered area covered by the wwtp is approximately 90 1 km2 and includes 3 cities 2 towns and 2 gulf basins it treats wastewater for 308 531 inhabitants the water quality of the received municipal wastewater in this treatment plant is relatively stable kong et al 2021 the water quality parameters of the raw water are introduced in section 3 4 the anmbr pn a setup was designed and constructed by mitsubishi kakoki kaisha ltd japan it consists of a raw water reservoir 2 5 m3 with a fine grille an anmbr system 5 0 m3 with a hollow fiber membrane module mitsubishi chemical corp and the ifas type of pn a system 1 67 m3 the operating performance of the submerged anmbr system for treating municipal wastewater has been reported in our recent studies kong et al 2021 the stable anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater and safe transmembrane pressure tmp was achieved at the hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 12 h for the anmbr system the detailed operation of the anmbr system will not be further discussed in this study a disk aerator was equipped at the bottom of the ifas pn a system and a stirring impeller was equipped to enhance hydraulic mixing of the system at the experimental periods with low airlift mixing aeration rate the anmbr effluent could be pumped into the pn a system through the pipework which had regulating valves to control the inflow rate a polyvinyl chloride tank with an effective volume of 500 l was employed to store the synthetic wastewater with a high concentration of ammonium during the periods of sludge acclimation the ifas pn a system was fed with synthetic wastewater and the anmbr effluent in different proportions as needed to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for the rapid growth of the autotrophic microorganisms the one stage ifas pn a system integrated with a feedback control system mitsubishi electric corp which controlled the power switch of the aeration blower according to the real time data of the dissolved oxygen do and ammonia sensors horiba ltd the effluent of the pn a system overflowed to a sedimentation basin with an effective volume of 1 92 m3 before the biofilm became completely attached to the carriers the precipitated sludge was returned to the pn a system using an impeller pump the supernatant overflowed to a regulating reservoir through the toothed weir finally merging into the municipal pipe network seasonal temperature control was adopted to maintain the process temperature at 25 c according to the local temperature in this work the thermostatic system was only activated during the cold months from november to may the external view and a structure diagram of the pilot scale anmbr pn a process are provided in fig 1 a and b 2 2 seed sludge and biofilm carrier on day0 400 l of activated sludge collected from the aerobic tank of a full scale aao process set in the same wwtp was inoculated to the ifas system this served as the aob inoculation at the same time 350 l of the cylindrical hollow carriers 10 mm φ 10 mm length made of hydrophobic polypropylene were filled the carrier fill rate was 20 on day90 40 l of the anammox granules with 2 5 wt volatile solids vs was dosed into the ifas system among them 20 l of the seed granules was sourced from a lab scale anammox expanded granular sludge blankets egsb reactor operated at nlr of 10 g n l d at 25 c the genus ca kuenenia was predominant in the anaob community of those granules details of the kind of granules are described in the literature ma et al 2020 the other half of the seed granules were obtained from a full scale anammox fluidized bed in kumamoto prefecture japan which was used to treat the wastewater with high nitrogen ca brocadia was the dominant genus of the anaob community of that reactor detailed biological information of the inoculated anammox granules can be found in the supplementary materials the recording video of the pn a system operation can be found in the video material 2 3 operational designs table 1 summarizes the operational designs for the start up of the pn a system the 256 day start up period of the pn a system was divided into 3 stages each stage was further subdivided into several operational periods in the first 90 days stage a the ifas system was intermittently fed with fully synthetic wastewater with ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 on day1 16 period a i the ifas system was fed with synthetic wastewater containing 250 mg n l of ammonium during period a i the system do was controlled at 2 4 mg l do limitation do 0 5 mg l was executed from period a ii on day17 period a ii and day63 period a iv ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 was one time dosed to the system to increase the system ammonium concentration to 600 mg n l fa and fna exposure was conducted in period a ii and a iv the proliferation of aob and anaob were executed in stage b by stepwise increasing the system nitrogen loading rate nlr during periods b i to b iii fully synthetic wastewater was fed to the system to increase the nlr from 0 05 to 0 1 g n l d the substrate ammonium concentration in the different experimental periods is provided in table 1 details of the trace element composition in the synthetic wastewater can be found in supplementary materials from period b iv the anmbr effluent the methane fermentation broth of the actual municipal wastewater mixed with synthetic wastewater was fed into the system by shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt of the anmbr effluent and increasing the ammonium concentration of the synthetic wastewater in period b v the nlr of the system was further increased to the target value of 0 5 g n l d finally the actual anmbr effluent was fed into the pn a system for long term mainstream treatment for over one year in this work in order to evaluate the start up performance of the one stage pn a system the operational performance during the first 50 days stage c of the long term mainstream treatment are discussed 2 4 sampling and analytical methods the water samples were taken on site and sent to the laboratory for water quality analysis the analysis interval for water quality of the ifas pn a system was as short as 1 day the sampling point was 50 cm below the water level of the reactor the ex situ specific anammox activity saa tests of the suspended sludge sampled from the pn a system was conducted in stage b and stage c with the analysis interval not exceeding 15 days saa tests were conducted according to the procedure outlined in an earlier study zhang et al 2016 the incubation temperature for the ex situ saa tests was 25 c sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride were added to the mixture of suspended sludge 5 ml and artificial medium 75 ml the initial nitrogen concentration of the artificial medium was set at 200 mg n l and the mole ratio of nh4 n no2 n was 1 1 32 the sampled

particle size distribution meter spectris mastersizer 3000 was used to measure the diameter size distribution of the suspended sludge flocks granules 2 5 calculation methods the concentrations of free ammonia fa and free nitrite acid fna in the pn a system were calculated according to eqs 4 and 5 anthonisen et al 1976 4 fa 17 14 nh 4 n eff 10 ph e 6344 273 t 10 ph 1 5 fna 47 14 no 2 n eff e 2300

oxidation rates abbrevated for aor and nor as well as the anammox nitrogen removal rate anr were calculated by eqs 6 9 6 δ n mg n l n h 4 n inf n h 4 n eff n o 2 n eff n h 3 n eff 7 aor mg n l d n h 4

effluent nitrate mg n l the in situ growth rates of the anaob and aob were determined during day166 204 a simplified gompertz model eq 10 was used to fit the microbial growth curve to compute the growth rates of the anaob μanaob the curves of the dna copy number in the fixed length sequence and the ssa against operational time were fitted the growth rate of the aob μaob was computed by fitting the simplified gompertz curve of the ssa against operational time the microbial doubling time was calculated according to eq 11 10 w t e μ t λ 11 t d days ln 2 μ where w t is the dependent variable μ is the specific growth rate day 1 t is the operational time days λ is the lag phase time for microbial growth and td is the microbial doubling time days 2 6 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput sequencing analyses the time dependent change of the anaob quantity in the suspended sludge of the pn a system was quantified in the qpcr analysis the isoil for beads beating kit was used for extracting dna the tb green premix ex taq takara japan and the primer set of amx368f amx820 wang et al 2016 were employed to quantify anaob using the lightcycler instrument roche switzerland the standard curve was generated by diluting the standards from 2 10 2 to 2 10 7 copies tube the qpcr products were verified by melting analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis each of the analyses was conducted in triplicate high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed to analyze the microbial community information in the suspended sludge extracted dna was amplified in the pcr process by using the forward primer of 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and the reverse primer of 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 addressing the v3 and v4 regions besides the primers the dna mixture included 4 μl 10 ex buffer 0 1 μl extaq hs takara japan 2 0 μl template dna 0 5 ng µl 0 1 μl deoxyribonucleotides dntps and 5 1 μl double distilled water ddw the temperature programming of the pcr was set as follows 30 cycles at 94 c for 2 min 94 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s and 72 c for 5 min the illumina miseq pe300 platform was employed for sequencing the amplicons using qiime 2 software to assemble the obtained sequences operation taxonomic units otus were analyzed based on a greengenes database for genus level bacteria identification the similarity of the identified otus was set higher than 97 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data of 9 suspended sludge samples which are not subject to the commercial confidentiality agreements sampled during stage b and c were deposited at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi short read archive sra with the bioproject id prjna762611 3 results 3 1 activated sludge inoculation aob cultivation and the nob suppression stage a was served as the aob cultivation stage in this stage the target was the stable partial nitrification achieved in the ifas system by suppressing nob was targeted in period a 1 a high airflow rate 140 l min was adopted fig 2 a the do was controlled within the range from 1 5 to 2 5 mg l with intermittent aeration consequently as shown in fig 2 b nitrate built up in the effluent the aor and nor values in the ifas system were quite close with a clear upward trend fig 2 f indicating the fast growth of both aob and nob on day17 the ammonium concentration in the ifas system was increased to 610 mg nh4 n l by dosing with ammonium bicarbonate correspondingly the fa concentration raised to a peak of 106 mg n l which far exceeded the threshold that caused 100 nob suppression pichel et al 2019 the influent supply in this period was stopped and the airflow rate was decreased to 27 l min for slowing down the reaction progress of nitritation this series of operations are the called in situ fa exposure after that both aor and nor dropped with the decrease in the nor p 0 0001 two tailed t test significance level 0 05 more significant than that of the aor p 0 0005 see fig 2 f further intermittent aeration was taken in an attempt to make the ammonium oxidation proceed slowly in the ifas system and the system was dosed with as much sodium bicarbonate as required to maintain of system ph higher than 8 0 fig 2 c during day18 34 it was observed that nitritation was dominant in the ifas system the nitrite concentration correspondingly increased to 725 mg no2 n l while no significant increase in the nitrate concentration was observed as shown in fig 2 b on day35 tap water was used to dilute the residual nitrite in the ifas system thereafter the airflow rate was raised to 49 l min and the synthetic wastewater supply was resumed during period a iii as shown in fig 2 f the aor was as high as 0 18 g n l d on average whereas the nor dropped at one point to 0 g n l d day35 40 the transient in situ fa exposure suppressed most of the nob activity in the ifas system however because nor fluctuations were observed after day41 fig 2 f it was apparent that the nob activity had not been completely suppressed and it was decided that further measures needed to be taken to eliminate the nob community in the system on day64 the ammonium concentration in the ifas system was increased to nearly 500 mg nh4 n l by adding ammonium bicarbonate fig 2 a and the fa concentration was synchronously increased to 50 mg n l fig 2 d unlike that in period a ii the dosage of sodium bicarbonate to the system was reduced during day64 75 and the ph gradually decreased from 8 3 to 7 7 the decrease in the system ph was clearly associated with the release of hydrogen ions in ammonia oxidation peng et al 2008 the ph was able to regulate the degree of nitrogen dissociation zhou et al 2011 and the lower ph values favor the protonation of nitrite during day64 75 the nitrite concentration was increased from 120 to 340 mg no2 n l by ammonia oxidation of aob fig 2 b and the fna correspondingly increased from 3 to 46 μg n l fig 2 d which was defined as the in situ fna exposure the increase in fna was accompanied by an obvious decrease in the nor which approached 0 g n l d this coincides with the report that nob is more sensitive to fna exposure than aob piculell et al 2016 in period a v instead of the synthetic wastewater tap water was fed into the ifas system to reduce the nitrogen concentration and therefore avoid any negative effect of the inhibitors on the anaob that was to be inoculated to the system 3 2 anaob proliferation on day90 40 l anammox granules were added to the ifas system anaob proliferation was executed in stage b during period b i iii fully synthetic wastewater was fed into the system and the nlr was enhanced from 0 05 to 0 1 g n l d by increasing the influent ammonium concentration from 400 to 850 mg nh4 n l a blower failure occurred on day111 119 in period b i and the synthetic substrate supply was stopped on day115 119 during the period of the blower failure along with the nitrite remaining in the system being gradually consumed by anaob fig 3 c the fna in the system decreased to below 3 μg n l fig 3 f the system ph was adjusted to around 8 0 fig 3 a by adding hydrochloric acid to decrease the fa to an average of 15 mg n l fig 3 f after eliminating the microbial inhibitory factors of fna and fa the substrate supply and aeration were restored on day120 the nitrogen removal efficiency performed a continuous upward trend increased from 6 day97 period b i to 79 day163 period b iii with stepwise nlr enhancement at the end of period b iii as shown in fig 3 d the anr increased up to 0 08 g n l d which was close to the nlr setting of 0 10 g n l d indicating that the anaob maintained good growth at the high influent ammonium however in the event that the concentration of the ammonium influent is too high the risk that anaob will be inhibited is also high as shown in fig 3 f also it was not conducive to anaob adapting to the mainstream conditions the mixed wastewater contained with the ammonium rich synthetic wastewater and the anmbr effluent anaerobic effluent of the real municipal wastewater was fed into the ifas system during period b iv and v the actual influent ammonium concentration could be controlled at a low level of 120 150 mg nh4 n l by adjusting the mixing ratio as shown in table 1 the results show that the anr reached a peak of 0 44 g n l d when the nlr was enhanced to 0 57 g n l d day198 as shown in fig 3 d the nitrogen removal efficiency increased to around 70 at the end of period b v it was determined that the saa of the suspended sludge during stage b increased from 0 03 to 0 07 g n mlvss d see supplementary materials another significant finding was that the nor was consistently low during stage b fig 3 e even in period b iv and v of which both fa and fna concentrations in the ifas system were low enough that these could not even effectively suppress the nob fig 3 f this suggests that the nob may be eliminated from the ifas system after the fa fna exposure executed at period a iv at the end of period b v the synergistic relationships for nitrogen bioconversions between aob and anaob were well established as advocated by speth et al 2016 indicated that the ifas reactor had begun the functional characteristics of a one stage pn a system 3 3 in situ growth kinetics of anaob and aob in this study the growth kinetic parameters of anaob and aob were determined for the first time in the pilot scale system the in situ growth kinetic determination with the partial feed of the mainstream wastewater could more accurately reflect the proliferation of functional microorganisms under the site culturing conditions which provides guidance for the understanding of the growth rate of anaob biomass in situ sludge culturing the in situ growth kinetics of anaob and aob were developed on day166 206 period b iv v stage b during these periods since both the fa and fna in the system were controlled at a low level the inhibition of the anaob could be vastly reduced another positive factor during these periods was that the stepwise increase in the nlr helped to prevent anaob growth from being restricted by substrate insufficiency zhang et al 2017 an anammox specific primer set was used for quantification the ribosomal rna gene copy number rrn in the currently known anammox bacterial genomes ca brocadia and ca kuenenia is 1 as shown in fig 4 a an exponential increase in the dna copies of anaob was detected during day166 182 only the suspended sludge was investigated in terms of the growth kinetics development in this work the biofilm attached to the bio carrier was not considered since the biofilm had not been observed to be formed during the operation period so far using the simplified gompertz model to fit the duration dependent dna copies the results show that under 25 c the specific growth rate μ anaob dna and the corresponding doubling time td anaob dna of the anaob were 0 03 d 1 and 22 9 d respectively the same model was used to fit the anr daily recorded during this experimental period as shown in fig 4 b the μ anaob anr and td anaob anr of the anaob were calculated to be 0 02 d 1 and 34 1 d respectively although an attempt was made to adopt a unified sampling method throughout this work however the tiny differences in any operation may inevitably affect the fitting results of the microbial growth kinetics besides from a genetics perspective the number of whole genomes per cell may vary depending on the growth state of the bacteria in this study the higher specific growth rate was calculated according to the qpcr assays which may also be associated with it not being able to discriminate between active and inactive cells as shown in fig 4 c the specific growth rate of aob was 0 057 d 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 12 1 days besides the temperature effects the largely prolonged aob doubling time was also considered to be associated with the execution of system aeration restrictions 3 4 mainstream treatment performance during the first 50 days of the long term operation during stage c the pn a system was connected with the anmbr in series to verify the performance of the actual treatment of mainstream wastewater the pn a system was operated at two hrt conditions of 3 h on day206 215 and 4 h on day216 240 with the nlr at 0 30 and 0 20 g n l d since the anmbr effluent was fully pumped into the pn a system the hrt settings of the pn a system relied on the actual working conditions of the membrane module in the anmbr the operation results of the anmbr have been published elsewhere kong et al 2021 and are not further discussed in this study the operational results show that the stable operation of the pn a system was obtained in the mainstream treatment the average nitrogen removal efficiency was 74 3 and the peak value was 87 on day236 as shown in fig 5 d the effluent tn was detected over a range of 5 12 mg n l fig 5 b in addition the nor at the 50 day operation during stage c was observed to have approached 0 g n l d showing that the nob activity can be well inhibited even under mainstream conditions these indicated that the start up of the mainstream pn a system had been achieved table 2 shows the water quality parameters in each treatment stage of the anmbr pn a process on one hand the anmbr removed 87 8 of the cod in the raw water it should be noted that around 60 of the influent cod was converted to methane in the anmbr kong et al 2021 on the other hand the anmbr did not contribute to nitrogen removal since the anaerobic reactor provided a reducing environment that lacked the electron acceptors necessary for ammonium oxidation compared with that in the raw water around 36 increase in the ammonium concentration was detected in the anmbr effluent this was considered to be associated with the organic matters with larger molecular such as protein in the raw water hydrolyzed into small molecule nitrogen compounds the later can easily pass across the 0 45 μm pore size pes filter due to these the cod n ratio of the raw water was effectively decreased from 6 0 to around 1 1 by the anmbr p 0 00001 see fig 5 a and table 2 a cod n ratio lower than 1 0 determines the processing reliability of the pn a process by helping to avoid the condition where the fast proliferation of the heterotrophic denitrifiers outcompetes anaob in the nitrite competition guo et al 2020 ma et al 2017a the average effluent codcr and ammonium concentration of the mainstream pn a effuent were determined to be 32 mg l and 9 mg nh4 n l respectively which met the discharge standards for municipal wastewater established by most of the prefectural governments in japan 3 5 change in the relative abundance of aob and nob communities the information on the microbial community described in this section was only applied to the suspended sludge in the ifas pn a system since no biofilm formation was observed on the bio carrier during the whole operational period this will be discussed in section 3 7 the results of the high throughput sequencing of the 16 s rrna showed that the detected aob and nob sequences in the ifas pn a system were assigned to the genus nitosonomas and nitrospira respectively no other aob and nob genus was detected as shown in fig 6 genus nitosonomas and nitrospira were inoculated into the system with the seed sludge and their relative abundances in the ifas system on day0 were 0 22 and 0 52 respectively adequate aeration and high ammonium feeding were provided to the system during period a i both the aob and nob proliferated at an alarming rate during this period the relative abundances of nitosonomas and nitrospira increased to 16 4 and 22 1 respectively within only 16 days a decrease in the relative abundances of both nitosonomas and nitrospira was noticed after the sludge in the ifas system was exposed in situ at 106 mg n l of fa on day17 among them the decrease in the relative abundance of nitrospira was particularly obvious with a relative abundance of just 1 7 on day32 during period a iv the sludge was alternately exposed to the high fa and fna on day86 the relative abundance of nitosonomas was observed to be stayed relatively stable which may indirectly reflect that aob community has developed the resistance to fa and have a higher resistance to fna while the nob genus nitrospira could no longer be detected in the sludge it is notable that besides nitrospira no other nob genus was detected in the subsequent stages of operation a positive growth trend was observed for the aob genus nitosonomas from day112 which is basically consistent with the aor data determined during this period the relative abundance of genus nitosonomas peaked at 12 1 during stage b and remained stable around 8 6 10 3 at stage c 3 6 descriptions of the ex situ settleability of suspended sludge in the pn a system in this study the settleability of the suspended sludge in the ifas system in terms of volume sv and settling velocity was evaluated on day165 period b iii and day205 period b v which corresponded to the feeding with fully synthetic wastewater and the anaerobic effluent mixture the settling time series records emphasized the change in sludge settleability under different mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss the sludge with the gradient mlvss was prepared by diluting or thickening the original sludge sampled from the ifas system in different proportions as shown in fig 7 a on day165 the sludge with the lower mlvss exhibited the more superior settleability according to the sedimentation characteristics the settling behavior of the activated sludge can be divided into four types i e discrete flocculent hindered and compression ekama et al 1997 riffat 2012 the settling curves of suspended sludge in day165 showed that the sedimentation of the sludge in an mlvss range of 1000 3000 mg l experienced from discrete to hindered and finally to compression settlings as shown in fig 7 a the settling behavior was observed to be linear at 0 5 min indicating that the sludge could freely settle without the interaction force between the aggregates and that the settling velocity at this time was inversely proportional to the mlvss baalousha et al 2011 this is consistent with the results obtained in this work see fig 7 a due to the interaction force caused by the sludge flocs as they further approached each other the slope of the settling curves gradually decreased from 5 to 30 min finally the sludge settled to the compressing threshold after 30 min the mud liquid interface became clear and stabilized this has been shown to be common in activated sludge with good settling capacities riffat 2012 the thickened sludge with an mlvss of 5000 mg l was in a compression settling at the initial period of settling the mud liquid interface had hardly formed with the progress of settling in this work the mlvss mlss abbreviated from mixed liquor suspended solids ratio of the suspended sludge was constant at around 0 7 on day165 the mlvss of the original suspended sludge was around 2500 mg l the sv30 and the sludge volume index svi were 35 and 97 2 ml g respectively suggesting that the suspended sludge in the ifas system had considerable settleability during the period an apparent downward shift in the sludge concentration threshold of compression settling was observed on day205 that is the original sludge with an mlvss of 2000 mg l fig 7 b was at the compression state even at the beginning of the settling the long term records of the suspended sludge concentration during this work can be found in the fig s2 a supplementary materials the svi of the sludge was determined to be 315 8 ml g these illustrated that the settleability and compressibility of the suspended sludge became poorer when the influent was switched to the mixed wastewater with an essentially shortened system hrt the results of the analysis of the particle size distribution of the suspended sludge in the ifas system at different experimental periods day0 day135 and day205 are shown in fig 8 the particle size of the suspended sludge met the gaussian distribution the mean μ of the gaussian distribution curves represented the average size of the sludge aggregates which left shifted from 135 0 to 71 3 μm with time over the experimental period that is as the start up of the pn a system progressed the average size of the suspended sludge aggregates in the ifas system continued to decrease 3 7 microscopic morphology of the suspended sludge in the ifas system and biofilm formation the images from the photographic and sem analysis of the carriers and suspended sludge are shown in fig 9 each of the sem images shown in this work was selected from dozens of representative photos according to the 50x sem image of the new carriers cavity structures were largely observed on the inner surface these cavities may provide favorable space for the enrichment of microorganisms the inner surface of the new carriers appeared flat and smooth at 10000x magnification as mentioned above the anaob seed sludge was inoculated to the system on day60 on day165 the suspended sludge in the ifas system was reddish brown and the settleability was close to that of activated sludge under the 50x eyepiece it was clear that the suspended sludge consisted of a large number of flocs and some granules while filamentous bacterium was found in the activated sludge figures not shown none was found in the suspended sludge dispersed short rod shaped cells and cocci congeries were observed in the 10000x sem image these were close to the morphological description of the nitrosomonas a genus assigned to anaob and the anaob congeries respectively fujitani et al 2015 yang et al 2021 respectively on day230 although no visible biofilm was seen on the carrier the 50x sem image shows that the inner surface of the carriers had become rougher and had fewer and smaller cavity structures under 10000x magnification the adherent growth of cocci congeries was observed on the inner surface of the carriers these indicate that the biofilm had started to form on the carriers besides the absence of the rod shaped cells on the carriers was probably because the consortium of aob is more inclined to discretely populate in the more mobile sludge aggregates laureni et al 2016 after four months of continuous treatment of mainstream wastewater the related discussion on the treatment performance is beyond the scope of this work on day350 the thick biofilm could be observed on the inner surface of the carriers the biofilm layer was crimson with granulated microbial clusters clearly observed on it the sem image of the biofilm shows that the microorganisms initially grew in the cavity structures on the carriers and the microbial flocs gradually filled the cavities the flocs attached to the carriers tended to close with the proliferation of microorganisms and then formed the biofilm this was also consistent with the mechanism of biofilm formation described by heijnen et al 1992 4 discussion 4 1 factors in achieving selective nob suppression overall the achievement of selective inhibition of nob in this work depended on the in situ regulation of fa fna and system do the non ionized fa is known as a significant inhibitor of both aob and nob the selective nob suppression of using fa relies on the higher inhibition threshold and the faster activity recovery pace of the aob piculell et al 2016 wang et al 2020 in terms of the aob and nob communities detected in this work the aob genus nitrosomonas is more tolerant to fa than the nob genus nitrospira shao and wu 2021 this could be corroborated by the higher decline in nor than anr after the fa exposure on day17 in this study however there is still a concern that nob suppression achieved by a high level of fa alone is not always effective in long term since the nob has a strong ability to recover from fa inhibition duan et al 2019a qiu et al 2021 it has known that aob has more variable and different fna inhibitory thresholds than nob in one case reported by zhou et al 2011 50 of aob activity was reduced at the fna concentration range of 420 1720 μg n l while nob activity was completely suppressed at the fna concentration of 66 μg n l fna has been reported that could penetrate cell membranes and act on nucleic acids causing oxidative damage to microbial cells duan et al 2019a which suggests that fna treatment at the appropriate concentrations is a more effective measure for achieving selective nob suppression this is also our primary consideration for executing fna exposure after the fa exposure at period a iv however it must be noted that the tolerance to inhibitors varied between different nob species nitrospira has been reported to be more sensitive to fna than nitrobacter even at an fna concentration lower than 30 μg n l blackburne et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 also it has been reported that ca nitrotoga has a higher fa tolerance than nitrospira wang et al 2021 the existing reports indicated that among the common nob genus nitrospira would likely be more easily eliminated using fa fna combination treatment in this work nitrospira was found to be the only nob population a microbiological community analysis clearly showed that it was inoculated into the ifas system along with the seed activated sludge after receiving alternative fa fna exposure in stage a the nob community nitrospira was almost eliminated from the system and the aob community nitrosomonas was largely retained the interspecies competition advantage of nob after the fna treatment might also depend on the difference of fna inhibition thresholds of the diverse nob species for example ca nitrotoga which has a higher resistance to fna was likely to survive after fna suppression at 75 μg n l and finally triggered nob community rebounding through the nob community shifted from nitrospira to ca nitrotoga ma et al 2017b the low do control has been shown to act as the primary measure for the suppression of ca nitrotoga after alternately limiting the system do at 0 4 and 0 7 mg l zheng et al 2020 found that ca nitrotoga was affected much more than nitrospira with the ca nitrotoga in the system continuing to decrease under such do conditions and finally becoming undetectable after 2 months wang et al 2021 found that controlling do at 0 2 0 4 mg l could effectively eliminate ca nitrotoga in the sludge besides ca nitrotoga the lower do condition has also been shown to have a positive effect on suppressing the growth of nitrobacter liu and wang 2013 with the growth rate of nitrobacter two orders of magnitude lower than that of nitrospira when the do was not higher than 0 5 mg l it is worth mentioning that although nitrospira had a competitive advantage in the low do condition the in situ fa fna exposure largely eliminated the nob in the suspended sludge there is evidence that the nob was difficult to re enrich for a long period once eliminated to a minimal level duan et al 2019b which was consistent with that observed in this work nitrospira was not detected again in the system in the period b iv v and stage c with a low level of nitrogen and do moreover microorganisms enriched influent herein refer to the raw blackwater has been pointed to be another seeding source of nob which seeded with the blackwater significantly triggered the resurgence of the nob community in the pn a system duan et al 2019b jiang et al 2020 an operational strategy proposed by duan et al 2019b is to perform primary sedimentation before the pn a treatment which could largely reduce the abundance of the nob community in the influent in this pilot scale study on one hand the relative abundance of nob community in the raw water is expected to be not particularly high since the raw water was collected from the full scale processing line after the primary sedimentation on the other hand the membrane module with the 0 4 μm pore size set in the fine grid equipped anmbr is equivalent to double insurance which could effectively intercept the microbial flocs including nob community in the raw water and minimize the risk of the exogenous microorganisms secondarily seeded to the pn a system with influent feeding these measures are very positive to the stable long term operation of the subsequent mainstream pn a treatment in this study decreasing the system do to lower than 0 5 mg l after the in situ fa fna exposure was proven to be an effective combination strategy to avoid the mutual shift of nob species with competitive advantages which is probably beneficial to prolong the inhibition period of the nob community this is the first report on using the combination strategy of in situ fa fna treatment and do limitation to selectively eliminate the nob in such a large scale pn a system it is suggested that the high level ammonium required for fa fna exposure in the larger scale treatment processes may be supplied by introducing the effluent supernatant of the side stream or sludge fermentation process instead of the addition of extra chemicals based on the current knowledge due to the issues that the wastewater source and the flow rate in the side stream process is much lower the supposed nitrogen supply method may be more suitable for the wwtps with multiple treatment lines in parallel and the side stream effluent should be stored in advance as needed besides the implementation of do limitation may be conducive to further reducing the aeration costs the program of the do ammonium feedback controlling system can be found in supplementary materials however the long term effectiveness of nob suppression in the continuous low nitrogen environment is still unknown to our best knowledge there has never been any conclusive evidence that the nob community including nitrospira sp can develop adaptability in high fna environment this may raise a possibility that nob re suppression by a similar type in situ fna exposure in the case of the nob community rebounding that occurred in the continuous mainstream conditions with the low level of nitrogen the points require further investigation in subsequent studies on the long term treatment of mainstream wastewater 4 2 temperature still a challenge to anaob culturing and mainstream treatment as mentioned in section 3 3 it is estimated that the in situ μmax of anaob ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 d 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 34 1 22 9 days the detected growth rates of the anaob at 25 c were similar to those reported by lotti et al 2014a who found the μmax of anaob was 0 02 d 1 at 20 c while lower than the growth rates of any known anaob species of 0 05 0 33 d 1 at 30 38 c tsushima et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 in this work more than 110 days was required to enhance the system nlr from 0 05 to 0 5 g n l d at 25 c under the operation of the heating system and finally obtain a low enough effluent tn 10 mg n l in the mainstream treatment the investigated region of this study sendai japan lies at lat 38 16 05 n long 140 52 11 e the mainstream temperature in the wwtps could be maintained at 20 25 c for around four months from june to october due to the local temperature due to the condition constraints of this pilot project we inoculated with the seed anaob granules in late september hence a system heating device was kept running from day105 for almost six months to control the system temperature at 25 c however it is unrealistic to set up a heating system on a larger scale similar system for the start up of the larger scale pn a system anaob sludge may be inoculated and cultured in the warm months to achieve the relatively fast growth of anaob without the operation of heating devices besides another technology has been tested that makes full use of the biogas produced in the anmbr which uses the heat generated from the methane combustion system to heat the influent instead of converting heat energy into electricity to heat the pn a system this is beneficial to further increase the operational temperature in an inexpensive way the proposed start up methods may be universally applicable in most regions in japan since the major cities of japan mainly lie to the south of sendai and therefore have longer periods of warm weather nevertheless these temperatures 20 25 c are still high for mainstream treatment in most high latitude countries it has known that anaob activity or its specific activation energy decreases accordingly with the temperature decrease from the mesophilic to psychrophilic condition lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2019 the more unfavorable temperature effects on the anaob growth were particularly relevant below 20 c laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2019 this is also one of the main issues with starting a mainstream anammox process lotti et al 2014a found that lowering the temperature caused a massive reduction in the growth rate of anaob at 15 c the anaob doubling time was prolonged by as long as 70 days considering the start up time elapsed in this study this probably means that the start up period of a pn a system of the same scale would be much longer than 200 days in a cold zone in addition the lower temperature may also affect the processing stability of the mainstream pn a system the primary concern is that low temperatures have a significant adverse effect on anammox activity and this may cause a reduction in the nitrogen removal rate in their study on the treatment of low strength ammonia wastewater influent nh4 160 mg n l wastewater using an airlift pn a reactor lotti et al 2014b found that the reduction in temperature from 20 to 15 c resulted in a decrease in the tn removal efficiency from 86 to 73 which was attributed to the rate limited anammox reaction caused by the weakened anaob activity reino et al 2018 had a new perspective that short term low temperature effects on anaob may be minor since the anaob sludge in the bottom of the plug flow reactor that was allocated with more substrates could release excess metabolic capacity in the early period of temperature decrease they found that the nitrogen removal efficiency dropped by only 9 even after the temperature was decreased from 22 to 11 c for a long period of time in our work the anaob sludge had been cultured with the high strength ammonia wastewater during stage b and the maximum culturing nlr was 0 5 g n l d which was higher than the 0 2 0 3 g n l d in the mainstream treatment hence it is reasonable to assume that the anaob in this study may also have a higher metabolic capacity to adapt to the lower temperatures moreover it is well known that the predominant anaob genus at lower temperatures 20 c is ca brocadia laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a b reino et al 2018 which was also the predominant anaob genus observed in the 50 day mainstream treatment data not shown these suggest that there may still be room for further reduction in the temperature of the pilot scale pn a system in the mainstream treatment in the subsequent long term mainstream treatment the heating system of the pn a system has been completely shut down to seasonally reduce the system temperature to 15 c to focus on the mainstream treatment performance of the proposed anmbr pn a process at lower temperatures 4 3 biomass retention and settleability of the suspended sludge although the biofilm attached carrier could effectively retain the biomass in the bioreactor the formation of a stable biofilm on the bio carrier is very time consuming the results observed in this work show that no available biofilm was detected on the surface of the bio carrier till the end of the start up of the pn a system bio carriers with biofilm attachment were widely observed after around half a year of continuous mainstream treatment as shown in fig 9 in the start up periods of the pn a system the microbial reactions were mainly in the suspended sludge and the physicochemical properties and hydraulic conditions of the suspended sludge are like those of the conventional plug flow activated sludge method during this work biomass retention is attained through the sedimentation and recirculation of the solids from the following settling basin this is the reason that the type of the pn a system in this research scenario was defined as an ifas system instead of mbbr sludge settleability has been shown to be significant in the efficiency of biomass recycling ekama et al 1997 especially for such a pilot scale mainstream pn a system the specific growth rates of both aob and anaob were determined to be very low while it would be challenging to replenish the system with the necessary amount of biomass to maintain the treatment capacity in a short time once the sludge flush out occurs this factor is often overlooked in lab scale research a deterioration in the settleability of the suspended sludge was observed in the ifas system after feeding with the mixed wastewater as mentioned in section 3 6 one of the significant changes in the operational conditions during these periods was that the hrt was largely shorted from 8 35 days to 6 h see table 1 this illustrates that the turnover rate of the substrate and suspended sludge was sharply enhanced as a result of the consistent 0 5 sludge return ratio during stage b it has been reported in numerous studies that the sludge aggregates are sheared under the enhanced shear stress in the mixed flow reactor with the dense aggregates gradually becoming looser flocs as a result and that these looser flocs had smaller diameters and poorer settling properties kosgey et al 2021 laureni et al 2015 the results of the sludge aggregate size distribution described in section 3 6 were consistent with the findings in these earlier reports we speculated that the stronger shear force caused by the enhanced substrate influx and aeration disturbance to maintain the necessary system do on the sludge may well be one of the reasons for the disintegration of the larger sludge aggregates dapena mora et al 2004 kosgey et al 2021 chen et al 2019 suggested that the sludge aggregates in the one stage pn a system were a special type of granule with a double layer structure with the anaob gathered in the core layer wrapped by the outermost aob it is not difficult to imagine that the first to bear the brunt in case of the sludge aggregate disintegration was the aob which was stripped from the larger sludge aggregates then eluted into the flocs with the latter more likely to be washed out of the reactor correspondingly the adhesion of gas bubbles on the flocs in the ifas system may further contribute to poorer sludge settling properties hence besides anaob more pay attention must be paid to the amount of aob community in the mainstream system pollice et al 2002 reported that long term stable partial nitritation was achieved under the system do limitation independent of the sludge age thus in this work to retain sufficient biomass in the ifas system we attempted to completely return the suspended sludge from the settling basin to the ifas system given the deteriorating settling performance of the suspended sludge and the lack of an effective means to prevent it from occurring we increased the sludge return ratio from 0 5 to 1 0 during stage c see table 1 5 conclusions in this pilot scale study a one stage pn a system was successfully started for treating the anmbr effluent in the mainstream treatment the innovative anmbr pn a process is proven to be effective in the treatment of mainstream wastewater from the results of this work the following conclusions can be made in situ selective nob suppression using fa fna exposure was achieved in a pilot scale study for the first time nitrospira was the only nob genus detected in the suspended sludge initially present the relative abundance was determined to have decreased from 22 1 to 1 7 after in situ exposing the sludge to 106 mg n l of fa the nitrospira community was finally eliminated from the sludge by the in situ fna treatment at 46 μg n l intermittent aeration low do control was beneficial for avoiding the community transfer of dominant nob species under the low ammonium conditions in situ anaob proliferation was completed within four months at 25 c at the conditions of feeding with sufficient ammonium nitrogen the in situ doubling time of the anaob and aob was estimated to be 24 9 33 1 days and 12 1 days respectively special attention needs to be paid to maintain the biomass in the suspended sludge in the ifas pn a system during the system start up periods since biofilm attachment to the bio carriers was observed to be around half a year increased hydraulic shear force at the mainstream condition resulted in the settleability deterioration of suspended sludge biomass could be retained by increasing the sludge return ratio from 0 5 to 1 0 at the hrt 3 4 h as the results of the pn a system start up the average effluent tn was lower than 10 mg n l which meets the nitrogen discharge limits of the region was achieved in the anmbr pn a process treating mainstream wastewater

16486,hypobromous acid hobr a highly reactive active species can be formed and impact reaction processes with organic pollutants in source water during chlorination disinfection of the water containing bromide brˉ in this study we investigated the transformation kinetics of 10 parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and formation mechanisms of transformation products in the presence of brˉ during chlorination the results indicated that hobr can accelerate the processes of electrophilic substitution es and single electron transfer et reactions in pahs and the second order rate constants of hobr are 102 103 times higher than those of hypochlorous acid hocl with pahs hobr was more conductive to induce es reactions than hocl in water containing brˉ hobr and hocl dominate the reaction processes with pahs although other active bromine species may still affect reaction processes in terms of transformation products higher reactivity of hobr results from faster formation of oxygenated pahs opahs and halogenated pahs hpahs than hocl as an example of 3 model pahs anthracene transforms faster to its oxygenated products at a higher concentration while pyrene and fluorene transform faster to halogenated products these fundamental results were essential to understanding the transformation kinetics of pahs and the formation of toxic disinfection by products in the presence of brˉ graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products chlorination hypobromous acid transformation products electrophilic substitution electron transfer 1 introduction the formation of disinfection by products dbps caused by chlorination disinfection has attracted continuous attention richardson et al 2000 sedlak and von gunten 2011 more than 700 dbps have been identified by 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 and more emerging dbps are constantly being discovered for most countries in the world the primary objective of chlorination disinfection is to control waterborne pathogens and disease spread so it will be still the main disinfection technology of drinking water for a long time in the future shannon et al 2008 xiao et al 2019 during chlorination hypochlorous acid hocl plays an important role in the formation of dbps especially chlorinated dbps deborde and von gunten 2008 however since bromide brˉ is ubiquitous in natural water at concentrations from μg l 1 to mg l 1 recent studies have indicated that the presence of brˉ impacts the reaction process due to the formation of hypobromous acid hobr transformed by hocl criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2014 furthermore hobr has a significantly higher reaction rate than hocl and can affect the formation of products such as the occurrence of brominated products acero et al 2005 heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 thus these insights pose new challenges to ensuring the safety of drinking water parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitous in source water with the concentration ranging from 10 to 104 ng l 1 liu et al 2011 wu et al 2011 xu et al 2018 the detection rates of eight pahs were all more than 90 in source water from drinking water treatment plants of china song et al 2015 chlorination disinfection of pahs has been studied for more than four decades harrison et al 1976a b hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 mori et al 1991 nilsson and colmsjo 1990 oyler et al 1982 xu et al 2018 bench studies have implied that in the process of chlorination disinfection pahs can be attacked by hocl or hobr and then active sites of pahs are replaced by chlorine bromine and oxygen atoms which lead to the formation of pah derivatives including halogenated pahs hpahs and oxygenated pahs opahs hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 recently these pah derivatives with ng l 1 concentration levels including 14 hpahs and 3 opahs have been found in the terminal of tap water and effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps liu et al 2021a 2021b 2019 these pah derivatives can similarly induce aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activity hpahs ohura et al 2009 dna damaging effects hpahs huang et al 2018 and endocrine disrupting effects hpahs and opahs machala et al 2001 novakova et al 2020 ohura et al 2010 hpahs have stronger bioaccumulation due to their higher octanol water partition coefficients k ow sun et al 2013 and partial pah derivatives have stronger toxicity eg ahr activity and estrogenic potencies than their corresponding parents such as 1 chloropyrene 1 cl pyr and 9 10 anthraquinone 9 10 anq supporting information si table s1 machala et al 2001 ohura et al 2009 therefore their occurrence has recently attracted the increasing concern the reaction mechanisms between hocl and pahs were relatively clear but the transformation kinetics reaction types of different pahs and further identification of transformation products given the presence of brˉ remain to be studied our previous results have indicated that more halogenated and oxygenated products would be formed with increasing brˉ concentrations liu et al 2020 two main reaction types electrophilic substitution es and single electron transfer et reactions occurred between hobr and pahs which led to the formation of halogenated and oxygenated products respectively liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however several problems are yet required to be explained regarding the role of hobr in the transformation of pahs for example why can several inactive pahs that rarely react with hocl be transformed by hobr what is the basic mechanism responsible for the high reactivity of hobr these mechanisms are closely related to the reaction processes it is hypothesized that es and et reactions are the crucial reaction processes for aromatic compounds and hypohalous acids altarawneh and dlugogorski 2015 criquet et al 2015 rook 1977 thus to answer these questions further work regarding the mechanisms that allow hobr to affect these two reaction processes and the difference in the amounts of products created compared to those related to hocl needs to be done a previous study reported that the occurrence of es and et reactions is mainly related to the characteristics of the chemicals for both hocl and hobr criquet et al 2015 liu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 for example acenaphthene ace pyrene pyr and benzo a pyrene bap mainly undergo an es process in contrast acenaphthylene acy anthracene ant and benzo a anthracene baa mainly undergo an et process liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however unlike hocl hobr with its higher reactivity certainly will affect these two processes previous studies focused more on the apparent high reactivity of hobr but deep mechanisms on the specific impacts of hobr have not been revealed hu et al 2006 nakamura et al 2007 in addition chlorination experiments were more carried out under the condition of the coexistence of hocl and hobr some active species including brocl brcl etc were proven to be involved in the reaction processes related to hocl and hobr sivey et al 2013 2015 but their studies more focused on the compounds with one ring here another question needs to be explored whether compounds with more rings will be affected thus the reactions of hobr and hocl needed to be compared to reveal the role of hobr the objective of this study is therefore to reveal the reaction mechanisms of hobr and elucidate the kinetics of pahs as well as the formation mechanism of transformation products in the presence of brˉ during chlorination we selected 10 pahs that frequently found in source water as target compounds we first acquired the kinetic parameters of pahs with hobr three conditions including the solo presence of hocl hoclo the coexistence of hocl and hobr hocl hobr and the solo presence of hobr hobro were compared to elucidate how hobr affected the reaction types and to distinguish the species involved in the reaction of water containing brˉ by means of the electrophilic index ω fitted pseudo one order rate constants were verified to ensure the accuracy of the data furthermore we described the transformation trends of products as a function of time and predicted the transformation pathways of ant and fluorene flu using their total mass balances 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemical reagents ten pahs naphthalene nap acy ace flu phenanthrene phe ant

experiments these experiments were carried out in 1 l amber glass bottles and each bottle was loaded with 450 ml of ultrapure water and 50 ml of a buffer solution at ph6 three batches of experimental samples were set according to hoclo hocl hobr and hobro specifically for samples of hoclo sodium hypochlorite naclo solutions free chlorine 59 2 μm were added for samples of hocl hobr hocl hobr 5

more significant transformation in the condition of ratio hocl hobr 5 and 1 heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 then ten types of 5 nm pah mixtures were added into the reaction systems the reaction was terminated according to different reaction time by adding excess na2s2o3 the time settings are shown in si table s3 the experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 2 c and conducted in a minimum of duplicates for all samples phe d10 a surrogate standard was added into the system after termination all compounds in each bottle were finally enriched eluted and concentrated into a 2 ml brown bottle for chemical analysis the detailed reaction sample preparation is shown in si text s1 the ph and free chlorine values were monitored during the reactions by a portable multiparameter water quality analyzer and chlorine colorimeter hach loveland co usa respectively 2 3 chemical analysis quantification of pahs and transformation products was performed by gc ms gc ms

tables s4 and s5 2 4 calculation of kinetic parameters according to the time effect curves of pah transformation pseudo first order constants were acquired by the slope of the curve second order rate

hocl and pahs and hobr and pahs respectively 2 5 computational method the global energy minimum geometries of the tested pahs were first optimized using spartan 10 with the merck molecular force field a commonly used molecular mechanics method then with the resulting geometries optimization and frequency calculations were performed at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p level of theory with the gaussian 09 package for more optimized geometries luo et al 2021 within the frame of density functional theory dft m06 2x is considered to provide satisfactory results for several relevant structural and thermodynamic properties for example with the m06 2x method yang et al obtained satisfactory results for the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of radical induced reactions of ibuprofen yang et al 2017 in addition the dft result is basis set dependent and the 6 311 g d p basis set is reckoned to be accurate enough for the calculation of molecular properties the geometries of all stationary points were confirmed by vibrational calculations for no imaginary frequencies for single point energies the calculations were performed at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p level of theory the ionization potential ip and electron affinity ea can be vertically and adiabatically calculated compared to the vertical process the adiabatic process accounted for the effect of electric charge in the processes of geometry optimization thus we used adiabatic ip and ea in this study these values were calculated from the absolute energies with eqs 6 and 7 respectively in which e pah e pah and e pah represent the energies for neutral cationic and anionic forms of the pah molecules respectively 6 ip e pah e pah 7 ea e pah e pah the ω is calculated according to eqs 8 to 10 which is referred to by altarawneh

0470 0 0218 and 0 0284 min 1 respectively similarly according to eq 5 and a nearly complete distribution of hobr at ph5 9 si table s6 their second order rate constants k br were 1253 8 497 0 167 1 1288 1 407 1 785 8 1 1 13 2 6 1 and 8 0 m 1 s 1 respectively for hocl hobr 10 pahs acy ant baa ace pyr bap nap phe flu and flt were all transformed and their pseudo first order rate constants k brcl were 1 4010 0 0964 0 0204 1 1080 0 0418 0 0363 0 0010 0 0007 0 0028 and 0 0015 min 1 respectively in our previous study nap phe flu and flt were defined as inactive pahs because of their almost zero transformation rate in the hoclo condition in contrast acy ant baa ace pyr and bap were defined as active pahs since it is obviously observed that transformation for these pahs can occur in the hoclo condition similarly this result showed the low transformation rate of nap phe flu and flt which indicated that inactive pahs were difficult to transform as a function of hoclo for active pahs we acquired similar results to previous studies under the hoclo conditions for example xu et al 2018 reported the respective k cl values of acy ace ant and pyr as 1 19 0 126 0 682 and 0 101 m 1 s 1 and hu et al 2006 reported the k cl value of pyr 0 28 m 1 s 1 in addition we calculated the k cl values of baa and bap which have never been reported these results all showed that active pahs have high reactivities during chlorination for hobro the k br values of 9 pahs were first acquired six active pahs presented high reaction rates which were still lower than the k values 108 m 1 s 1 or higher of so4 and oh wei et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 in addition previous studies have reported that the second order rate constant of pyr 10 75 m 1 s 1 and another heterocyclic compound benzotriazole 8 50 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2013 hu et al 2006 were lower than the values found in this study for pyr this is mainly due to the different starting points of two studies in the study of hu et al 2006 hobr was considered to have significantly higher reactivity than hocl then they neglected the effect of hocl in the establishment of model and calculation of second order rate constants in the later studies some scholars found several active species such as brocl brcl br2o cl2o etc can form and affect the reaction processes in the system of the coexistence of hocl and hobr sivey et al 2013 2015 they considered that the effect of hocl should not be neglected and our experiments were based on the later consideration thus there may be some differences on the rate constants for benzotriazole previous study have identified that it have almost zero transformation rate in the condition of hoclo lee et al 2019 thus it indicated that the inactive property of benzotriazole in chlorination disinfection processes is similar to inactive pahs and its second rate constant 8 50 m 1 s 1 is close to that of inactive pahs 1 1 13 2 6 1 and 8 0 m 1 s 1 in addition inactive pahs also show a transition to active pahs this result was in agreement with the work done in our previous study which showed that nap phe flu and flt were transformed in water containing brˉ during chlorination liu et al 2020 for hocl hobr we only showed the k brcl of 10 pahs as the species involved in the reaction were still unclear and needed to be explored additionally 4 inactive pahs had a certain transformation although their transformation rates were lower than that of hobro which indicated that hobr indeed affected the reactivity of inactive pahs to verify the k between pahs and hocl or hobr we calculated the molecular descriptors table 2 and acquired the correlation between k and ω value by linear fitting si fig s1 the results showed that the r 2 values were 0 5782 0 3213 and 0 5745 p 0 05 for hoclo hocl hobr and hobro respectively a relatively higher r 2 occurred for the k of hocl and hobr ace was not included because of its high reaction rate with a low ω value a previous study reported that ω was used as an indicator of the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals wei et al 2019 in this study although the relationship was not significantly strong it verified the accuracy of these kinetic parameters to an extent in addition we also fitted an exponential curve for hobro si fig s1 a better fitting results were presented r 2 0 6368 p 0 05 it indicated that linear fitting was suitable for active pahs but the exponential curve may be more suitable for all pahs meanwhile as inactive pahs did not have rate constants due to the almost zero transformation rates in the condition of hoclo it cannot be verified whether the exponential curve is also suitable for all pahs in the condition of hoclo but for the condition of hobro hobr accelerates the reaction processes for both active and inactive pahs it makes all pahs have rate constants and the fitting curves more completely thus the ω and k br are more likely to show an exponential relationship in this condition ƞ is a combined property of both energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo related to the nucleophilicity of a molecule and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo related to the electrophilicity of a molecule he et al 2021 xu et al 2018 it can be also defined as the resistance towards the deformation or polarization of the electron cloud of atoms ions or molecules islam and ghosh 2011 kaya and kaya 2015 previous study revealed that ƞ was identified as having a positive correlation with k between pahs and hocl xu et al 2018 thus ƞ can be used as a reference for the reactivity in our results we also found that the ƞ values of inactive pahs were higher than those of active pahs it reflects that inactive pahs can be more difficult to reaction with hocl and hobr than active pahs due to their relatively stable structures 3 1 2 kinetics mechanisms the k br k cl k brcl model and k brcl k brcl model are also shown in table 1 the k br k cl values are the ratios of second order rate constants of hobr and hocl with pahs which reflect that how much faster hobr react with same pahs than hocl the ratio of six pahs was calculated for acy ant baa ace pyr and bap and their k br k cl values were 389 280 227 2127 840 and 1884 respectively these values indicated that hobr has a higher reactivity than hocl which is in accordance with the results of previous studies criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard et al 2004 heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2006 for example hu et al 2006 reported that the k br k cl value of pyr was approximately 39 the k br k cl value of hobr with phenolate and halophenolates was approximately 3000 heeb et al 2014 and the k br k cl values of hobr with bisphenol a was approximately 105 criquet et al 2015 gallard et al 2004 furthermore our previous study revealed that acy ant and baa mainly occurred in the et process and ace pyr and bap mainly occurred in the es process liu et al 2020 in this study it was observed that the k br k cl values of ace pyr and bap were higher than those of acy ant and baa which means that the promoting effects of hobr on es reactions was higher than those on et reaction thus hobr was more conductive to induce es reactions than hocl in addition the reaction species produced under hocl and hobr conditions remain unclear thus we used eq 6 to calculate the k brcl model according to the hypothesis that hobr and hocl were involved in independent reactions 11 d pahs dt k brcl model pahs k cl hocl t pahs k br hobr t pahs the k brcl k brcl model values were calculated to compare the difference between the model value and the experimental value and further identify the existence of other reaction species table 1 the results showed that k brcl k brcl model values ranged from 0 1 to 1 9 due to floating around the value of 1 it can be said that hobr and hocl still dominate the reaction processes with pahs and kinetic parameters can be calculated based on the model of hobr and hocl participating in the reaction independently actually in the condition of hocl hobr several active species may be formed in the system including brocl brcl br2o cl2o etc sivey et al 2013 2015 although these active species have lower concentration than hocl or hobr they may have higher reactivity than hocl or hobr previous study reported that brcl may be the predominant agent at ph 7 1 and will accelerate the reaction processes even so compounds with one ring such as dimethenamid p xylene and cinnamic acid were more studied li et al 2020 sivey et al 2013 but our results showed that the k brcl k brcl model values would decrease with the increase of ring number of compounds which indicated that the difference in k brcl k brcl model values was more dependent on the structure of pahs it also may imply the promoting function of these active species may be weakened for pahs in addition we also found k brcl k brcl model values have a negative correlation with increasing average dipole polarizabilities si table s7 indeed k brcl k brcl model values of ace and acy as compounds with three rings was higher than 1 0 which indicated that these active species can still promote the reaction processes additionally it may also be attributed to the bridge bond in the middle of the ring which accelerates the transformation of ace and acy in the desirable directions riva et al 2017 xu et al 2018 acy and ace presented high reactivities in the apparent observations but the promoting effect of these active species for ace and acy may have been lower than that of compounds with one ring and for other pahs with more than 2 rings the ratio was lower than 1 0 it indicated that the reaction processes of these pahs may be inhibited but hocl and hobr still dominated the reaction processes because even if the reaction processes are inhibited hocl and hobr were still main thrust for the reaction processes 3 2 transformation mechanisms the time dependent transformation products for acy ant baa ace pyr bap nap phe flu and flt during chlorination condition of hocl hobr were shown in fig 2 only the condition of hocl hobr was discussed here due to their proximities to actual water environments it worth noting that the reaction types of these pahs would not change with the different ratio of hobr and hocl because the reaction types of these pahs are determined by the structure of the compounds and are the inherent property of the compounds acero et al 2005 found that the reaction rates of hocl and hobr are governed by the electron density of the aromatic rings criquet et al 2015 considered that et reactions depend strongly on the electronic properties of the substituents and electron withdrawing substituents can inhibit this reaction completely these results indicated that the reaction types indeed depend on the chemical structure for pahs br pahs and opahs dominated the reaction products which elucidated the kinetics mechanisms of hobr with higher reactivity specifically of the active pahs acy ant and baa mainly underwent et reactions due to the formation of opahs ace pyr and bap mainly underwent es reactions due to the formation of hpahs of the inactive pahs flu mainly underwent es reactions due to the formation of hpahs partial nap and flt underwent es reactions and trace phe underwent es reactions from the aspects of the structure table 2 pahs having a five membered ring with a c c bond like acy or a parallel arrangement of three benzene rings like ant and baa were more prone to induce et reaction and other pahs were more prone to induce es reaction 3 2 1 acy ant and baa ant and baa were supposed to mainly undergo et reactions the corresponding oxygenated products with high concentrations were observed in the results for ant we observed a 3 40 0 39 nm mass balance during chlorination disinfection the results showed that anthrone ane and 9 10 anq were formed with the transformation of ant and the initial concentration of ane was slightly higher than that of 9 10 anq the concentrations of the two products remained unchanged until 720 min then the concentration of 9 10 anq began to rise as the concentration of ane decreased in addition slightly halogenated products including 9 chloroanthracene 9 cl ant 9 10 dichloroanthracene 9 10 dicl ant 9 bromoanthracene 9 br ant and 9 10 dibromoanthracene 9 10 dibr ant were observed throughout the reaction process the concentrations of halogenated products were one to two magnitudes lower than those of oxygenated products based on the above results we first revealed the transformation pathway of ant closer to the actual hocl hobr condition fig 3 three reaction processes were considered sites 9 and 10 were the main reaction sites of ant the main reaction process was the et reaction first ant was oxidized to ane and then ane was further oxidized to 9 10 anq during this reaction process ane and 9 10 anq at higher concentrations were observed which finally led to the formation of abundant 9 10 anq the other two pathways originated from the function of hocl or hobr which indicated that ant similarly underwent the weak es reactions due to formation of trace halogenated products for ant and hocl ant was first attacked by hocl which led to the formation of 9 cl ant then 9 cl ant was attacked twice by hocl which led to the formation of 9 10 dicl ant 9 br ant and 9 10 dibr ant were formed via similar reaction steps by hobr chlorinated and brominated ant were similar concentrations and their concentrations were significantly lower than oxygenated products therefore for the first time the transformation pathway of ant was revealed in water containing brˉ during chlorination disinfection previous studies including our previous results reported the transformation pathway of ant in hoclo merkel et al 1998 oyler et al 1982 xu et al 2018 different from previous results this pathway in water containing brˉ is closer to the actual aquatic environment in this pathway of the condition of hocl hobr a novel transformation route that ant was constantly substituted by bromine was identified and ane and 9 10 anq were still the main transformation products although hobr have high reactivity it means that es and et reactions of ant simultaneously occurs in the condition of hocl and hobr but et reactions are still the main reaction types of ant besides in the process of forming ane and 9 10 anq this pathway also experiences the formation of 9 hydroxyanthracene 9 oh ant and 9 10 dihydroxyanthracene 9 10 dioh ant and then 9 oh ant and 9 10 dioh ant were further oxidized to ane and 9 10 anq xu et al 2018 moreover 9 10 anq was the final transformation product which may explain the occurrence of 9 10 anq at a high concentration 72 5 ng l 1 in tap water liu et al 2021b for baa we observed a 6 06 0 96 nm mass balance although only one transformation product namely benz a anthracene 7 12 dione baaq was observed a stable mass balance indicated that baaq was the main transformation product thus baa mainly occurs via the et reaction from the aspect of chemical structure baa have four rings but three rings are arranged in parallel which is similar to the structure of ant table 2 and there are two sites sites 7 and 12 corresponding to sites 9 and 10 of ant that can be easily attacked in the middle ring it may imply that this kind of structure more easily undergoes et reaction leading to the formation of oxygenated products mori et al 1993 similarly reported that baaq was the main product which agrees with our research for acy only 1 acenaphthenone acn was observed with a maximum concentration 0 58 nm at 2 min in this study therefore the mass balance of acy decrease as a function of time thus the formation of acn may only present one transformation pathway for acy it indicates that acy may transform to the more polar and or noncyclic small products that are not detected by the analytical method of gc schummer et al 2009 xu et al 2018 additionally the maximum concentration of acn was 0 32 nm at 5 min under hoclo conditions in our previous study xu et al 2018 compared to this result the formation concentration of acn in hobr and hocl was nearly two times than that in hoclo it implied that the introduction of hobr in the reaction system accelerated the reaction process of this pathway from acy to acn this can also help explain the high reaction rate constant of acy which is in agreement with the kinetics results 3 2 2 ace pyr and bap ace pyr and bap were supposed to mainly undergo es reactions because plenty of halogenated products were observed in the reaction processes for ace the main electrophilic position was at sites 3 5 6 and 8 at 2 min 5 bromoacenaphthene 5 br ace reached a maximum concentration of 2 80 nm before decreasing as a function of time then trace 5 6 dibromoacenaphthene 5 6 dibr ace and 3 5 6 tribromoacenaphthene 3 5 6 dibr ace formed at maximum concentrations of 0 23 nm and 0 14 nm respectively comparing brominated products only trace amounts of 3 chlorinated products including 3 chloroacenaphthene 3 cl ace 5 chloroacenaphthene 5 cl ace and 5 6 dichloroacenaphthene 5 6 dicl ace were detected during the whole chlorination process which implied that hobr dominated the reaction processes of ace at this brˉ concentration it worth noting that we synthesized 11 standards of halogenated ace including almost all 8 possible chlorinated products of ace and 3 brominated products among that the choice of 3 brominated aces was mainly because chlorinated aces with same substitution position in the condition of hoclo have higher concentrations compared to the other isomers xu et al 2018 the relevant nmr spectra were obtained according to our previous studies liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 in previous research we revealed that ace was first transformed to 3 cl ace and 5 cl ace and then 3 6 dichloroacenaphthene 3 6 dicl ace 3 5 dichloroacenaphthene 3 5 dicl ace and 5 6 dicl ace followed by 3 5 6 trichloroacenaphthene 3 5 6 tricl ace and 3 5 8 trichloroacenaphthene 3 5 8 tricl ace and finally to the formation of 3 5 6 8 tetrachloroacenaphthene 3 5 6 8 tetracl ace under the condition of hoclo in this study we carried out this experiment in the condition of hoclo and the same results were identified si fig s2 however for brominated products although 3 kinds of standards were synthesized a similar transformation pathway predicted that ace was transformed to 3 bromoacenaphthene 3 br ace and 5 br ace and then 3 6 dibromoacenaphthene 3 6 dibr ace 3 5 dibromoacenaphthene 3 5 dibr ace and 5 6 dibr ace followed by 3 5 6 tribr ace and 3 5 8 tribromoacenaphthene 3 5 8 tribr ace and finally to the formation of 3 5 6 8 tetrabromoacenaphthene 3 5 6 8 tetrabr ace actually in the previous study 5 cl ace 5 6 dicl ace and 3 5 6 tricl ace have the highest concentration in their corresponding isomers under the condition of hoclo xu et al 2018 in this study the maximum concentration of monohalogenated ace 5 br ace 2 80 nm in the condition of hobr and hocl were significantly higher than that of 5 cl ace 1 99 nm in the condition of hoclo the maximum concentration of 3 5 6 tribr ace 0 14 nm of hocl hobr was slightly higher than that of 3 5 6 tricl ace 0 06 nm hoclo this result indicated that hobr presented stronger es reaction than hocl in the process of monohalogenation which explained why hobr can improve the es reaction rate to an extent but the maximum concentrations of 5 6 dibr ace 0 23 nm of hocl hobr were slightly lower than those of 5 6 dicl ace 0 39 nm of hoclo meanwhile the decrease of the total mass balance of ace was observed which indicated hobr can also lead to the occurrence of more reaction types after monohalogenation reaction such as the cleavage of rings and further oxidation reactions acero et al 2005 arnold et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 for pyr the mass balance was maintained 4 65 0 50 nm for 30 min then the mass balance began to decrease with time meanwhile 1 bromopyrene 1 br pyr increased as pyr decreased then 1 6 dibromopyrene 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibromopyrene 1 8 dibr pyr increased reached the peak value and decreased the maximum concentrations of 1 br pyr 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibr pyr were 2 76 nm at 30 min 0 84 nm at 360 min and 0 87 nm at 360 min respectively during the chlorination process trace chlorinated products including 1 cl pyr 1 6 dichloropyrene 1 6 dicl pyr and 1 8 dichloropyrene 1 8 dicl pyr were observed 1 cl pyr was the dominant product of chlorinated pyr and its maximum concentration reached 0 14 nm at 30 min actually the symmetrical type of pyr belong to d2h wen and soos 1998 thus in the process of monohalogenation site 1 3 6 and 8 are the same es sites and site 4 5 9 and 10 are the same es sites but no 4 br pyr was observed in the whole reaction processes according to the target analysis which indicated that site 1 was the main transformation pathway for pyr during chlorination disinfection a previous study reported that pyr was first transformed to 1 br pyr and the 1 3 dibromopyrene 1 3 dibr pyr 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibr pyr followed by a transformation to 1 3 6 tribromopyrene 1 3 6 tribr pyr and finally a transformation to 1 3 6 8 tetrabromopyrene 1 3 6 8 tetrabr pyr hu et al 2006 these results are in accordance with our study but a decrease in mass balance after occurrence of monohalogenation reaction can be observed like ace it can mean that the same condition as ace such as the cleavage of rings and further oxidation reactions occurred in the reaction process in addition 1 cl pyr 1 br pyr 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibr pyr have been found in tap water liu et al 2021b and this study provides an evidence that chlorination disinfection is one source of these halogenated pyr existing in tap water for bap a 3 95 0 81 nm mass balance was observed 6 bromobenzo a pyrene 6 br bap was the main transformation product with a maximum concentration of 3 18 nm 6 chlorobenzo a pyrene 6 cl bap was similarly observed with a maximum concentration of 0 77 nm compared to ace and pyr bap can transform to more halogenated products and these products were mainly monohalogenated bap in terms of the reaction process 6 br bap was the dominant product compared to 6 cl bap which indicated that this result can account for the possible occurrence of this product in tap water 3 2 3 nap flu phe and flt under hocl hobr condition 3 inactive pahs nap flu and flt presented halogenated products specifically brominated products it also elucidated that inactive pahs including nap flu and flt can be transformed by hobr meanwhile flu with the highest reaction rate among inactive pahs presented the largest amount of brominated products details are shown below for nap 1 bromonaphthalene 1 br nap began to increase slowly as nap decreased the concentration of 1 br nap reached a peak 1 22 nm at 4320 min and then decreased as a function of time trace 1 4 dichloronaphthalene 1 4 cl nap was observed during the whole chlorination process a previous study reported the occurrence of monobrominated nap during electrochemical treatment of saline aqueous solutions muff and sogaard 2011 and in this study we further identified that 1 br nap was main brominated product and observed its formation trend 2 bromonaphthalene 2 br nap was not observed which indicated that site 2 was not the dominant substitution position for nap in addition the formation trend of 1 br nap also explained why nap can be transformed in the condition of hocl hobr for flu a 3 77 0 64 nm mass balance was observed 2 bromofluorene 2 br flu and 2 7 dibromofluorene 2 7 dibr flu were the main halogenated products which increased as flu decreased 2 br flu reached a maximum concentration of 3 6 nm at 4320 min and then decreased trace 2 chlorofluorene 2 cl flu was observed during the whole chlorination process therefore the formation pathway of flu is shown in fig 4 flu was first transformed to the major 2 br flu and minor 2 cl flu then 2 br flu was further halogenated to 2 7 dibr flu this is the first study to acquire the mass balance of flu the formation trend of 2 br flu and 2 7 dibr flu identifies the transformation of inactive flu for flt we found one transformation product namely 3 bromofluoranthene 3 br flt the concentration increased as the decrease of flt the maximum concentration was 1 28 nm at 720 min which accounted for 26 transformation of the parent to our knowledge this was the first time that the formation trend of 3 br flt was observed site 3 of flt was the first transformation step of flt which determine its further transformation direction thus although only 3 br flt was found in this study its formation trend was essential to understand the transformation of flt and its occurrence in tap water for phe the difference between phe and other inactive compounds is the amounts of halogenated products trace amounts of 9 chlorophenanthrene 9 cl phe and 9 10 dichlorophenanthrene 9 10 dicl phe were observed during the chlorination process the concentration of 9 bromophenanthrene 9 br phe was one order of magnitude higher than that of the chlorinated product but the maximum concentration was only 0 17 nm but it can be identified that phe did not mainly undergo an es reaction because only trace halogenated products were observed previous studies reported that 9 monohydroxyphenanthrene 9 oh phe and oxygenated phe accounted for 50 of the products at ph 3 but only 4 at ph8 oyler et al 1982 epoxy phe also accounted for 88 of the products at ph8 thus it indicated that the main products of phe could be other polar or and oxygenated products via an et reaction meanwhile it also implied not all inactive pahs will undergo an es reaction in the function of hobr 3 2 4 reaction comparison of hoclo hocl hobr and hobro to present the reaction mechanism between hocl or hobr and pahs we compared the time dependent transformation products of ant flu and pyr during hoclo hocl hobr and hobro fig 5 ant flu and pyr represent the et reaction of active pahs es reaction of active pahs and es reaction of inactive pahs respectively in general the first step transformation products determine the transformation rate of the parent during the et reaction of ant ane reached the maximum concentration at 720 min 1 32 nm 360 min 1 60 nm and 2 min 2 43 nm under the three conditions hoclo hocl hobr and hobro repectively it was obvious that the formation rate of ane during hobro was significantly faster than that under the other conditions and the concentration was relatively higher this implies the reason that the reaction rate between hobr and ant was higher than that of hocl ant transformed faster to its oxygenated products at a higher product concentration for pyr monohalogenated pyr reached maximum concentrations at 720 min 2 61 nm 30 min 2 76 nm and 2 min 2 71 nm under the three conditions of hoclo hocl hobr and hobro respectively in contrast to ant the maximum concentration of monohalogenated pyr was closer therefore the reaction rate between hobr and pyr was higher than that of hocl and pyr transformed to halogenated products faster flu has a complete formation trend of transformation products monohalogenated flu reached maximum concentrations at 10 080 min 0 13 nm 4320 min 3 58 nm and 60 min 2 96 nm under the three conditions of hoclo hocl hobr and hobro respectively notably trace 2 cl flu was observed at hoclo which indicated the low reaction rate between hocl and flu the formation rate of 2 br flu of hobro was significantly higher than that of hocl hobr thus the formation of brominated flu at high concentrations can explain why hobr can react with inactive flu more strongly than hocl in a word higher reactivity of hobr results from faster formation of hpahs and opahs from the observed results in terms of 3 typical compounds ant transformed to its oxygenated products faster at a higher concentration while pyr and flu transformed faster to their halogenated products and similar results occurred for the compound of ace and bap si fig s2 it is a consensus that hocl has higher oxidation and acidity than hobr but why does hobr has significantly higher reactivity further explanation is that it can be related to the electron cloud distribution of halogen atoms in hocl or hobr previous studies indicated that the mulliken and chelpg charges for both hocl and hobr follow the same tendency of negative charges for the oxygen and positive ones for the hydrogen and halogen atoms ximenes et al 2015 but the values of mulliken and chelpg charges of hobr 0 2910 0 0576 were higher than those of hocl 0 1829 0 0084 it indicated that higher positive charge is on bromine and bromonium ion br as an intermediate may be formed which make hobr higher susceptibility to electron rich center namely more electrophilic ximenes et al 2015 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the kinetics of 10 pahs and the formation mechanism of transformation products in the presence of brˉ during chlorination we for the first time acquired the kinetic parameters of 9 pahs with hobr the results indicated that hobr can accelerate the processes of both es and et reaction in pahs and the second order rate constant of hobr is 102 103 times higher than that of hocl with the reaction of pahs pahs having a five membered ring with a c c bond like acy or a parallel arrangement of three benzene rings like ant and baa were more prone to induce et reaction and other pahs were more prone to induce es reaction in addition the k br k cl values of ace pyr and bap were higher than those of acy ant and baa which means that hobr was more conductive to induce es reactions than hocl it was also the reason that inactive pahs including nap flu and flt can be transformed by hobr in terms of products it is the increased formation of brominated products for inactive pahs in the water containing brˉ hobr and hocl dominate the reaction processes with pahs although other species may still affect the reaction processes from the aspects of transformation products higher reactivity of hobr results from faster formation of hpahs and opahs than hocl as an example of 3 typical compounds ant transforms to its oxygenated products faster at a higher concentration while pyr and flu transform faster to their halogenated products further mechanisms can be because higher positive charge is on bromine and br as an intermediate may be formed which make hobr it more electrophilic it was essential to understanding the formation of toxic dbps in water containing brˉ generally ant and baa mainly lead to the formation of less toxic oxygenated pahs the formation of more toxic halogenated products for ace pyr bap nap flu and flt was observed during chlorination in addition we predicted their transformation pathways using the total mass balances of ant and flu in summary our results indicated that pahs will transform to many emerging toxic products in water containing brˉ during chlorination disinfection this was also the reason that hpahs and opahs occurred in tap water and effluents of wwtps for disinfection process water containing brˉ could be closer to the real water environment than that only containing hocl the existence of hobr with high reactivity poses a new challenge in terms of the transformation of organic pollutants in source water and the identification of emerging dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16486,hypobromous acid hobr a highly reactive active species can be formed and impact reaction processes with organic pollutants in source water during chlorination disinfection of the water containing bromide brˉ in this study we investigated the transformation kinetics of 10 parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and formation mechanisms of transformation products in the presence of brˉ during chlorination the results indicated that hobr can accelerate the processes of electrophilic substitution es and single electron transfer et reactions in pahs and the second order rate constants of hobr are 102 103 times higher than those of hypochlorous acid hocl with pahs hobr was more conductive to induce es reactions than hocl in water containing brˉ hobr and hocl dominate the reaction processes with pahs although other active bromine species may still affect reaction processes in terms of transformation products higher reactivity of hobr results from faster formation of oxygenated pahs opahs and halogenated pahs hpahs than hocl as an example of 3 model pahs anthracene transforms faster to its oxygenated products at a higher concentration while pyrene and fluorene transform faster to halogenated products these fundamental results were essential to understanding the transformation kinetics of pahs and the formation of toxic disinfection by products in the presence of brˉ graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products chlorination hypobromous acid transformation products electrophilic substitution electron transfer 1 introduction the formation of disinfection by products dbps caused by chlorination disinfection has attracted continuous attention richardson et al 2000 sedlak and von gunten 2011 more than 700 dbps have been identified by 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 and more emerging dbps are constantly being discovered for most countries in the world the primary objective of chlorination disinfection is to control waterborne pathogens and disease spread so it will be still the main disinfection technology of drinking water for a long time in the future shannon et al 2008 xiao et al 2019 during chlorination hypochlorous acid hocl plays an important role in the formation of dbps especially chlorinated dbps deborde and von gunten 2008 however since bromide brˉ is ubiquitous in natural water at concentrations from μg l 1 to mg l 1 recent studies have indicated that the presence of brˉ impacts the reaction process due to the formation of hypobromous acid hobr transformed by hocl criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2014 furthermore hobr has a significantly higher reaction rate than hocl and can affect the formation of products such as the occurrence of brominated products acero et al 2005 heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 thus these insights pose new challenges to ensuring the safety of drinking water parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitous in source water with the concentration ranging from 10 to 104 ng l 1 liu et al 2011 wu et al 2011 xu et al 2018 the detection rates of eight pahs were all more than 90 in source water from drinking water treatment plants of china song et al 2015 chlorination disinfection of pahs has been studied for more than four decades harrison et al 1976a b hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 mori et al 1991 nilsson and colmsjo 1990 oyler et al 1982 xu et al 2018 bench studies have implied that in the process of chlorination disinfection pahs can be attacked by hocl or hobr and then active sites of pahs are replaced by chlorine bromine and oxygen atoms which lead to the formation of pah derivatives including halogenated pahs hpahs and oxygenated pahs opahs hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 recently these pah derivatives with ng l 1 concentration levels including 14 hpahs and 3 opahs have been found in the terminal of tap water and effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps liu et al 2021a 2021b 2019 these pah derivatives can similarly induce aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activity hpahs ohura et al 2009 dna damaging effects hpahs huang et al 2018 and endocrine disrupting effects hpahs and opahs machala et al 2001 novakova et al 2020 ohura et al 2010 hpahs have stronger bioaccumulation due to their higher octanol water partition coefficients k ow sun et al 2013 and partial pah derivatives have stronger toxicity eg ahr activity and estrogenic potencies than their corresponding parents such as 1 chloropyrene 1 cl pyr and 9 10 anthraquinone 9 10 anq supporting information si table s1 machala et al 2001 ohura et al 2009 therefore their occurrence has recently attracted the increasing concern the reaction mechanisms between hocl and pahs were relatively clear but the transformation kinetics reaction types of different pahs and further identification of transformation products given the presence of brˉ remain to be studied our previous results have indicated that more halogenated and oxygenated products would be formed with increasing brˉ concentrations liu et al 2020 two main reaction types electrophilic substitution es and single electron transfer et reactions occurred between hobr and pahs which led to the formation of halogenated and oxygenated products respectively liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however several problems are yet required to be explained regarding the role of hobr in the transformation of pahs for example why can several inactive pahs that rarely react with hocl be transformed by hobr what is the basic mechanism responsible for the high reactivity of hobr these mechanisms are closely related to the reaction processes it is hypothesized that es and et reactions are the crucial reaction processes for aromatic compounds and hypohalous acids altarawneh and dlugogorski 2015 criquet et al 2015 rook 1977 thus to answer these questions further work regarding the mechanisms that allow hobr to affect these two reaction processes and the difference in the amounts of products created compared to those related to hocl needs to be done a previous study reported that the occurrence of es and et reactions is mainly related to the characteristics of the chemicals for both hocl and hobr criquet et al 2015 liu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 for example acenaphthene ace pyrene pyr and benzo a pyrene bap mainly undergo an es process in contrast acenaphthylene acy anthracene ant and benzo a anthracene baa mainly undergo an et process liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however unlike hocl hobr with its higher reactivity certainly will affect these two processes previous studies focused more on the apparent high reactivity of hobr but deep mechanisms on the specific impacts of hobr have not been revealed hu et al 2006 nakamura et al 2007 in addition chlorination experiments were more carried out under the condition of the coexistence of hocl and hobr some active species including brocl brcl etc were proven to be involved in the reaction processes related to hocl and hobr sivey et al 2013 2015 but their studies more focused on the compounds with one ring here another question needs to be explored whether compounds with more rings will be affected thus the reactions of hobr and hocl needed to be compared to reveal the role of hobr the objective of this study is therefore to reveal the reaction mechanisms of hobr and elucidate the kinetics of pahs as well as the formation mechanism of transformation products in the presence of brˉ during chlorination we selected 10 pahs that frequently found in source water as target compounds we first acquired the kinetic parameters of pahs with hobr three conditions including the solo presence of hocl hoclo the coexistence of hocl and hobr hocl hobr and the solo presence of hobr hobro were compared to elucidate how hobr affected the reaction types and to distinguish the species involved in the reaction of water containing brˉ by means of the electrophilic index ω fitted pseudo one order rate constants were verified to ensure the accuracy of the data furthermore we described the transformation trends of products as a function of time and predicted the transformation pathways of ant and fluorene flu using their total mass balances 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemical reagents ten pahs naphthalene nap acy ace flu phenanthrene phe ant fluoranthene flt pyr baa and bap were purchased from accustandard new haven ct usa forty one products including 21 chlorinated pahs cl pahs 16 brominated pahs br pahs and 4 opahs were purchased from

purchased from yuanye shanghai china ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was generated by a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma usa and used in the chlorination experiments 2 2 chlorination experiments these experiments were carried out in 1 l amber glass bottles and each bottle was loaded with 450 ml of ultrapure water and 50 ml of a buffer solution at ph6 three batches of experimental samples were set according to hoclo hocl hobr and hobro specifically for samples of hoclo sodium hypochlorite naclo solutions free chlorine 59 2 μm were added for samples of hocl hobr hocl hobr 5 after adding a naclo solutions free chlorine 59 2 μm potassium bromide kbr solutions brˉ 9 86 μm were added for samples of hobro hocl was all transformed to hobr after adding a naclo solutions free chlorine 59 2 μm excessive kbr solutions were added it should be noted that the set of experimental condition was based on the actual ratio of hocl and hobr in natural water and all chemicals have a more significant transformation in the condition of ratio hocl hobr 5 and 1 heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2006 liu et al 2020 then ten types of 5 nm pah mixtures were added into the reaction systems the reaction was terminated according to different reaction time by adding excess na2s2o3 the time settings are shown in si table s3 the experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 2 c and conducted in a minimum of duplicates for all samples phe d10 a surrogate standard was added into the system after termination all compounds in each bottle were finally enriched eluted and concentrated into a 2 ml brown bottle for chemical analysis the detailed reaction sample preparation is shown in si text s1 the ph and free chlorine values were monitored during the reactions by a portable multiparameter water quality analyzer and chlorine colorimeter hach loveland co usa respectively 2 3 chemical analysis quantification of pahs and transformation products was performed by gc ms gc ms methods was referred to our previous study liu et al 2021a the oven temperature was programmed as follows the initial temperature was 60 c held for 2 min then the temperature was increased at a rate of 10 c min 1 to the final temperature of 300 c held for 10 min the instrumental parameters and conditions are detailed in si text s2 quality assurance and quality control are shown in si text s3 si tables s4 and s5 2 4 calculation of kinetic parameters according to the time effect curves of pah transformation pseudo first order constants were acquired by the slope of the curve second order rate constants of two reaction conditions for hoclo and hobro were calculated according to eqs 1 to 5 1 hocl b r hobr c l 2 hocl pahs products k cl 3 hobr pahs products k br 4 d pahs dt k cl pahs k cl hocl t pahs 5 d pahs dt k br pahs k br hobr t pahs where k cl and k br are pseudo first order constants for hocl and pahs and hobr and pahs respectively k cl and k br are second order kinetic constants for hocl and pahs and hobr and pahs respectively 2 5 computational method the global energy minimum geometries of the tested pahs were first optimized using spartan 10 with the merck molecular force field a commonly used molecular mechanics method then with the resulting geometries optimization and frequency calculations were performed at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p level of theory with the gaussian 09 package for more optimized geometries luo et al 2021 within the frame of density functional theory dft m06 2x is considered to provide satisfactory results for several relevant structural and thermodynamic properties for example with the m06 2x method yang et al obtained satisfactory results for the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of radical induced reactions of ibuprofen yang et al 2017 in addition the dft result is basis set dependent and the 6 311 g d p basis set is reckoned to be accurate enough for the calculation of molecular properties the geometries of all stationary points were confirmed by vibrational calculations for no imaginary frequencies for single point energies the calculations were performed at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p level of theory the ionization potential ip and electron affinity ea can be vertically and adiabatically calculated compared to the vertical process the adiabatic process accounted for the effect of electric charge in the processes of geometry optimization thus we used adiabatic ip and ea in this study these values were calculated from the absolute energies with eqs 6 and 7 respectively in which e pah e pah and e pah represent the energies for neutral cationic and anionic forms of the pah molecules respectively 6 ip e pah e pah 7 ea e pah e pah the ω is calculated according to eqs 8 to 10 which is referred to by altarawneh

discussion 3 1 transformation kinetics 3 1 1 kinetics characteristics time dependent transformations of acy ant baa ace pyr bap nap phe flu and flt under three chlorination conditions hoclo hocl hobr and hobro are shown in fig 1 the kinetic parameters of 10 pahs with hocl hocl and hobr and hobr are shown in table 1 under hoclo conditions six pahs acy ant baa ace pyr and bap were transformed and their pseudo first order rate constants k cl were 0 01144 0 00629 0 00261 0 00215 0 00172 and 0 00148 min 1 respectively correspondingly the according to eq 4 and a nearly complete distribution of hocl at ph5 9 actual ph ph dependent distribution of hocl and hobr were shown in si table s6 we calculated the second order rate constants k cl namely 3 22 1 77 0 74 0 61 0 48 and 0 42 m 1 s 1 respectively for hobro 10 pahs acy ant baa ace pyr bap nap phe flu and flt were all transformed and their pseudo first order rate constants k br were 4 4500 1 7640 0 5931 4 5720 1 4450 2 7890 0 0038 0 0470 0 0218 and 0 0284 min 1 respectively similarly according to eq 5 and a nearly complete distribution of hobr at ph5 9 si table s6 their second order rate constants k br were 1253 8 497 0 167 1 1288 1 407 1 785 8 1 1 13 2 6 1 and 8 0 m 1 s 1 respectively for hocl hobr 10 pahs acy ant baa ace pyr bap nap phe flu and flt were all transformed and their pseudo first order rate constants k brcl were 1 4010 0 0964 0 0204 1 1080 0 0418 0 0363 0 0010 0 0007 0 0028 and 0 0015 min 1 respectively in our previous study nap phe flu and flt were defined as inactive pahs because of their almost zero transformation rate in the hoclo condition in contrast acy ant baa ace pyr and bap were defined as active pahs since it is obviously observed that transformation for these pahs can occur in the hoclo condition similarly this result showed the low transformation rate of nap phe flu and flt which indicated that inactive pahs were difficult to transform as a function of hoclo for active pahs we acquired similar results to previous studies under the hoclo conditions for example xu et al 2018 reported the respective k cl values of acy ace ant and pyr as 1 19 0 126 0 682 and 0 101 m 1 s 1 and hu et al 2006 reported the k cl value of pyr 0 28 m 1 s 1 in addition we calculated the k cl values of baa and bap which have never been reported these results all showed that active pahs have high reactivities during chlorination for hobro the k br values of 9 pahs were first acquired six active pahs presented high reaction rates which were still lower than the k values 108 m 1 s 1 or higher of so4 and oh wei et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 in addition previous studies have reported that the second order rate constant of pyr 10 75 m 1 s 1 and another heterocyclic compound benzotriazole 8 50 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2013 hu et al 2006 were lower than the values found in this study for pyr this is mainly due to the different starting points of two studies in the study of hu et al 2006 hobr was considered to have significantly higher reactivity than hocl then they neglected the effect of hocl in the establishment of model and calculation of second order rate constants in the later studies some scholars found several active species such as brocl brcl br2o cl2o etc can form and affect the reaction processes in the system of the coexistence of hocl and hobr sivey et al 2013 2015 they considered that the effect of hocl should not be neglected and our experiments were based on the later consideration thus there may be some differences on the rate constants for benzotriazole previous study have identified that it have almost zero transformation rate in the condition of hoclo lee et al 2019 thus it indicated that the inactive property of benzotriazole in chlorination disinfection processes is similar to inactive pahs and its second rate constant 8 50 m 1 s 1 is close to that of inactive pahs 1 1 13 2 6 1 and 8 0 m 1 s 1 in addition inactive pahs also show a transition to active pahs this result was in agreement with the work done in our previous study which showed that nap phe flu and flt were transformed in water containing brˉ during chlorination liu et al 2020 for hocl hobr we only showed the k brcl of 10 pahs as the species involved in the reaction were still unclear and needed to be explored additionally 4 inactive pahs had a certain transformation although their transformation rates were lower than that of hobro which indicated that hobr indeed affected the reactivity of inactive pahs to verify the k between pahs and hocl or hobr we calculated the molecular descriptors table 2 and acquired the correlation between k and ω value by linear fitting si fig s1 the results showed that the r 2 values were 0 5782 0 3213 and 0 5745 p 0 05 for hoclo hocl hobr and hobro respectively a relatively higher r 2 occurred for the k of hocl and hobr ace was not included because of its high reaction rate with a low ω value a previous study reported that ω was used as an indicator of the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals wei et al 2019 in this study although the relationship was not significantly strong it verified the accuracy of these kinetic parameters to an extent in addition we also fitted an exponential curve for hobro si fig s1 a better fitting results were presented r 2 0 6368 p 0 05 it indicated that linear fitting was suitable for active pahs but the exponential curve may be more suitable for all pahs meanwhile as inactive pahs did not have rate constants due to the almost zero transformation rates in the condition of hoclo it cannot be verified whether the exponential curve is also suitable for all pahs in the condition of hoclo but for the condition of hobro hobr accelerates the reaction processes for both active and inactive pahs it makes all pahs have rate constants and the fitting curves more completely thus the ω and k br are more likely to show an exponential relationship in this condition ƞ is a combined property of both energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo related to the nucleophilicity of a molecule and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo related to the electrophilicity of a molecule he et al 2021 xu et al 2018 it can be also defined as the resistance towards the deformation or polarization of the electron cloud of atoms ions or molecules islam and ghosh 2011 kaya and kaya 2015 previous study revealed that ƞ was identified as having a positive correlation with k between pahs and hocl xu et al 2018 thus ƞ can be used as a reference for the reactivity in our results we also found that the ƞ values of inactive pahs were higher than those of active pahs it reflects that inactive pahs can be more difficult to reaction with hocl and hobr than active pahs due to their relatively stable structures 3 1 2 kinetics mechanisms the k br k cl k brcl model and k brcl k brcl model are also shown in table 1 the k br k cl values are the ratios of second order rate constants of hobr and hocl with pahs which reflect that how much faster hobr react with same pahs than hocl the ratio of six pahs was calculated for acy ant baa ace pyr and bap and their k br k cl values were 389 280 227 2127 840 and 1884 respectively these values indicated that hobr has a higher reactivity than hocl which is in accordance with the results of previous studies criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard et al 2004 heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2006 for example hu et al 2006 reported that the k br k cl value of pyr was approximately 39 the k br k cl value of hobr with phenolate and halophenolates was approximately 3000 heeb et al 2014 and the k br k cl values of hobr with bisphenol a was approximately 105 criquet et al 2015 gallard et al 2004 furthermore our previous study revealed that acy ant and baa mainly occurred in the et process and ace pyr and bap mainly occurred in the es process liu et al 2020 in this study it was observed that the k br k cl values of ace pyr and bap were higher than those of acy ant and baa which means that the promoting effects of hobr on es reactions was higher than those on et reaction thus hobr was more conductive to induce es reactions than hocl in addition the reaction species produced under hocl and hobr conditions remain unclear thus we used eq 6 to calculate the k brcl model according to the hypothesis that hobr and hocl were involved in independent reactions 11 d pahs dt k brcl model pahs k cl hocl t pahs k br hobr t pahs the k brcl k brcl model values were calculated to compare the difference between the model value and the experimental value and further identify the existence of other reaction species table 1 the results showed that k brcl k brcl model values ranged from 0 1 to 1 9 due to floating around the value of 1 it can be said that hobr and hocl still dominate the reaction processes with pahs and kinetic parameters can be calculated based on the model of hobr and hocl participating in the reaction independently actually in the condition of hocl hobr several active species may be formed in the system including brocl brcl br2o cl2o etc sivey et al 2013 2015 although these active species have lower concentration than hocl or hobr they may have higher reactivity than hocl or hobr previous study reported that brcl may be the predominant agent at ph 7 1 and will accelerate the reaction processes even so compounds with one ring such as dimethenamid p xylene and cinnamic acid were more studied li et al 2020 sivey et al 2013 but our results showed that the k brcl k brcl model values would decrease with the increase of ring number of compounds which indicated that the difference in k brcl k brcl model values was more dependent on the structure of pahs it also may imply the promoting function of these active species may be weakened for pahs in addition we also found k brcl k brcl model values have a negative correlation with increasing average dipole polarizabilities si table s7 indeed k brcl k brcl model values of ace and acy as compounds with three rings was higher than 1 0 which indicated that these active species can still promote the reaction processes additionally it may also be attributed to the bridge bond in the middle of the ring which accelerates the transformation of ace and acy in the desirable directions riva et al 2017 xu et al 2018 acy and ace presented high reactivities in the apparent observations but the promoting effect of these active species for ace and acy may have been lower than that of compounds with one ring and for other pahs with more than 2 rings the ratio was lower than 1 0 it indicated that the reaction processes of these pahs may be inhibited but hocl and hobr still dominated the reaction processes because even if the reaction processes are inhibited hocl and hobr were still main thrust for the reaction processes 3 2 transformation mechanisms the time dependent transformation products for acy ant baa ace pyr bap nap phe flu and flt during chlorination condition of hocl hobr were shown in fig 2 only the condition of hocl hobr was discussed here due to their proximities to actual water environments it worth noting that the reaction types of these pahs would not change with the different ratio of hobr and hocl because the reaction types of these pahs are determined by the structure of the compounds and are the inherent property of the compounds acero et al 2005 found that the reaction rates of hocl and hobr are governed by the electron density of the aromatic rings criquet et al 2015 considered that et reactions depend strongly on the electronic properties of the substituents and electron withdrawing substituents can inhibit this reaction completely these results indicated that the reaction types indeed depend on the chemical structure for pahs br pahs and opahs dominated the reaction products which elucidated the kinetics mechanisms of hobr with higher reactivity specifically of the active pahs acy ant and baa mainly underwent et reactions due to the formation of opahs ace pyr and bap mainly underwent es reactions due to the formation of hpahs of the inactive pahs flu mainly underwent es reactions due to the formation of hpahs partial nap and flt underwent es reactions and trace phe underwent es reactions from the aspects of the structure table 2 pahs having a five membered ring with a c c bond like acy or a parallel arrangement of three benzene rings like ant and baa were more prone to induce et reaction and other pahs were more prone to induce es reaction 3 2 1 acy ant and baa ant and baa were supposed to mainly undergo et reactions the corresponding oxygenated products with high concentrations were observed in the results for ant we observed a 3 40 0 39 nm mass balance during chlorination disinfection the results showed that anthrone ane and 9 10 anq were formed with the transformation of ant and the initial concentration of ane was slightly higher than that of 9 10 anq the concentrations of the two products remained unchanged until 720 min then the concentration of 9 10 anq began to rise as the concentration of ane decreased in addition slightly halogenated products including 9 chloroanthracene 9 cl ant 9 10 dichloroanthracene 9 10 dicl ant 9 bromoanthracene 9 br ant and 9 10 dibromoanthracene 9 10 dibr ant were observed throughout the reaction process the concentrations of halogenated products were one to two magnitudes lower than those of oxygenated products based on the above results we first revealed the transformation pathway of ant closer to the actual hocl hobr condition fig 3 three reaction processes were considered sites 9 and 10 were the main reaction sites of ant the main reaction process was the et reaction first ant was oxidized to ane and then ane was further oxidized to 9 10 anq during this reaction process ane and 9 10 anq at higher concentrations were observed which finally led to the formation of abundant 9 10 anq the other two pathways originated from the function of hocl or hobr which indicated that ant similarly underwent the weak es reactions due to formation of trace halogenated products for ant and hocl ant was first attacked by hocl which led to the formation of 9 cl ant then 9 cl ant was attacked twice by hocl which led to the formation of 9 10 dicl ant 9 br ant and 9 10 dibr ant were formed via similar reaction steps by hobr chlorinated and brominated ant were similar concentrations and their concentrations were significantly lower than oxygenated products therefore for the first time the transformation pathway of ant was revealed in water containing brˉ during chlorination disinfection previous studies including our previous results reported the transformation pathway of ant in hoclo merkel et al 1998 oyler et al 1982 xu et al 2018 different from previous results this pathway in water containing brˉ is closer to the actual aquatic environment in this pathway of the condition of hocl hobr a novel transformation route that ant was constantly substituted by bromine was identified and ane and 9 10 anq were still the main transformation products although hobr have high reactivity it means that es and et reactions of ant simultaneously occurs in the condition of hocl and hobr but et reactions are still the main reaction types of ant besides in the process of forming ane and 9 10 anq this pathway also experiences the formation of 9 hydroxyanthracene 9 oh ant and 9 10 dihydroxyanthracene 9 10 dioh ant and then 9 oh ant and 9 10 dioh ant were further oxidized to ane and 9 10 anq xu et al 2018 moreover 9 10 anq was the final transformation product which may explain the occurrence of 9 10 anq at a high concentration 72 5 ng l 1 in tap water liu et al 2021b for baa we observed a 6 06 0 96 nm mass balance although only one transformation product namely benz a anthracene 7 12 dione baaq was observed a stable mass balance indicated that baaq was the main transformation product thus baa mainly occurs via the et reaction from the aspect of chemical structure baa have four rings but three rings are arranged in parallel which is similar to the structure of ant table 2 and there are two sites sites 7 and 12 corresponding to sites 9 and 10 of ant that can be easily attacked in the middle ring it may imply that this kind of structure more easily undergoes et reaction leading to the formation of oxygenated products mori et al 1993 similarly reported that baaq was the main product which agrees with our research for acy only 1 acenaphthenone acn was observed with a maximum concentration 0 58 nm at 2 min in this study therefore the mass balance of acy decrease as a function of time thus the formation of acn may only present one transformation pathway for acy it indicates that acy may transform to the more polar and or noncyclic small products that are not detected by the analytical method of gc schummer et al 2009 xu et al 2018 additionally the maximum concentration of acn was 0 32 nm at 5 min under hoclo conditions in our previous study xu et al 2018 compared to this result the formation concentration of acn in hobr and hocl was nearly two times than that in hoclo it implied that the introduction of hobr in the reaction system accelerated the reaction process of this pathway from acy to acn this can also help explain the high reaction rate constant of acy which is in agreement with the kinetics results 3 2 2 ace pyr and bap ace pyr and bap were supposed to mainly undergo es reactions because plenty of halogenated products were observed in the reaction processes for ace the main electrophilic position was at sites 3 5 6 and 8 at 2 min 5 bromoacenaphthene 5 br ace reached a maximum concentration of 2 80 nm before decreasing as a function of time then trace 5 6 dibromoacenaphthene 5 6 dibr ace and 3 5 6 tribromoacenaphthene 3 5 6 dibr ace formed at maximum concentrations of 0 23 nm and 0 14 nm respectively comparing brominated products only trace amounts of 3 chlorinated products including 3 chloroacenaphthene 3 cl ace 5 chloroacenaphthene 5 cl ace and 5 6 dichloroacenaphthene 5 6 dicl ace were detected during the whole chlorination process which implied that hobr dominated the reaction processes of ace at this brˉ concentration it worth noting that we synthesized 11 standards of halogenated ace including almost all 8 possible chlorinated products of ace and 3 brominated products among that the choice of 3 brominated aces was mainly because chlorinated aces with same substitution position in the condition of hoclo have higher concentrations compared to the other isomers xu et al 2018 the relevant nmr spectra were obtained according to our previous studies liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 in previous research we revealed that ace was first transformed to 3 cl ace and 5 cl ace and then 3 6 dichloroacenaphthene 3 6 dicl ace 3 5 dichloroacenaphthene 3 5 dicl ace and 5 6 dicl ace followed by 3 5 6 trichloroacenaphthene 3 5 6 tricl ace and 3 5 8 trichloroacenaphthene 3 5 8 tricl ace and finally to the formation of 3 5 6 8 tetrachloroacenaphthene 3 5 6 8 tetracl ace under the condition of hoclo in this study we carried out this experiment in the condition of hoclo and the same results were identified si fig s2 however for brominated products although 3 kinds of standards were synthesized a similar transformation pathway predicted that ace was transformed to 3 bromoacenaphthene 3 br ace and 5 br ace and then 3 6 dibromoacenaphthene 3 6 dibr ace 3 5 dibromoacenaphthene 3 5 dibr ace and 5 6 dibr ace followed by 3 5 6 tribr ace and 3 5 8 tribromoacenaphthene 3 5 8 tribr ace and finally to the formation of 3 5 6 8 tetrabromoacenaphthene 3 5 6 8 tetrabr ace actually in the previous study 5 cl ace 5 6 dicl ace and 3 5 6 tricl ace have the highest concentration in their corresponding isomers under the condition of hoclo xu et al 2018 in this study the maximum concentration of monohalogenated ace 5 br ace 2 80 nm in the condition of hobr and hocl were significantly higher than that of 5 cl ace 1 99 nm in the condition of hoclo the maximum concentration of 3 5 6 tribr ace 0 14 nm of hocl hobr was slightly higher than that of 3 5 6 tricl ace 0 06 nm hoclo this result indicated that hobr presented stronger es reaction than hocl in the process of monohalogenation which explained why hobr can improve the es reaction rate to an extent but the maximum concentrations of 5 6 dibr ace 0 23 nm of hocl hobr were slightly lower than those of 5 6 dicl ace 0 39 nm of hoclo meanwhile the decrease of the total mass balance of ace was observed which indicated hobr can also lead to the occurrence of more reaction types after monohalogenation reaction such as the cleavage of rings and further oxidation reactions acero et al 2005 arnold et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 for pyr the mass balance was maintained 4 65 0 50 nm for 30 min then the mass balance began to decrease with time meanwhile 1 bromopyrene 1 br pyr increased as pyr decreased then 1 6 dibromopyrene 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibromopyrene 1 8 dibr pyr increased reached the peak value and decreased the maximum concentrations of 1 br pyr 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibr pyr were 2 76 nm at 30 min 0 84 nm at 360 min and 0 87 nm at 360 min respectively during the chlorination process trace chlorinated products including 1 cl pyr 1 6 dichloropyrene 1 6 dicl pyr and 1 8 dichloropyrene 1 8 dicl pyr were observed 1 cl pyr was the dominant product of chlorinated pyr and its maximum concentration reached 0 14 nm at 30 min actually the symmetrical type of pyr belong to d2h wen and soos 1998 thus in the process of monohalogenation site 1 3 6 and 8 are the same es sites and site 4 5 9 and 10 are the same es sites but no 4 br pyr was observed in the whole reaction processes according to the target analysis which indicated that site 1 was the main transformation pathway for pyr during chlorination disinfection a previous study reported that pyr was first transformed to 1 br pyr and the 1 3 dibromopyrene 1 3 dibr pyr 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibr pyr followed by a transformation to 1 3 6 tribromopyrene 1 3 6 tribr pyr and finally a transformation to 1 3 6 8 tetrabromopyrene 1 3 6 8 tetrabr pyr hu et al 2006 these results are in accordance with our study but a decrease in mass balance after occurrence of monohalogenation reaction can be observed like ace it can mean that the same condition as ace such as the cleavage of rings and further oxidation reactions occurred in the reaction process in addition 1 cl pyr 1 br pyr 1 6 dibr pyr and 1 8 dibr pyr have been found in tap water liu et al 2021b and this study provides an evidence that chlorination disinfection is one source of these halogenated pyr existing in tap water for bap a 3 95 0 81 nm mass balance was observed 6 bromobenzo a pyrene 6 br bap was the main transformation product with a maximum concentration of 3 18 nm 6 chlorobenzo a pyrene 6 cl bap was similarly observed with a maximum concentration of 0 77 nm compared to ace and pyr bap can transform to more halogenated products and these products were mainly monohalogenated bap in terms of the reaction process 6 br bap was the dominant product compared to 6 cl bap which indicated that this result can account for the possible occurrence of this product in tap water 3 2 3 nap flu phe and flt under hocl hobr condition 3 inactive pahs nap flu and flt presented halogenated products specifically brominated products it also elucidated that inactive pahs including nap flu and flt can be transformed by hobr meanwhile flu with the highest reaction rate among inactive pahs presented the largest amount of brominated products details are shown below for nap 1 bromonaphthalene 1 br nap began to increase slowly as nap decreased the concentration of 1 br nap reached a peak 1 22 nm at 4320 min and then decreased as a function of time trace 1 4 dichloronaphthalene 1 4 cl nap was observed during the whole chlorination process a previous study reported the occurrence of monobrominated nap during electrochemical treatment of saline aqueous solutions muff and sogaard 2011 and in this study we further identified that 1 br nap was main brominated product and observed its formation trend 2 bromonaphthalene 2 br nap was not observed which indicated that site 2 was not the dominant substitution position for nap in addition the formation trend of 1 br nap also explained why nap can be transformed in the condition of hocl hobr for flu a 3 77 0 64 nm mass balance was observed 2 bromofluorene 2 br flu and 2 7 dibromofluorene 2 7 dibr flu were the main halogenated products which increased as flu decreased 2 br flu reached a maximum concentration of 3 6 nm at 4320 min and then decreased trace 2 chlorofluorene 2 cl flu was observed during the whole chlorination process therefore the formation pathway of flu is shown in fig 4 flu was first transformed to the major 2 br flu and minor 2 cl flu then 2 br flu was further halogenated to 2 7 dibr flu this is the first study to acquire the mass balance of flu the formation trend of 2 br flu and 2 7 dibr flu identifies the transformation of inactive flu for flt we found one transformation product namely 3 bromofluoranthene 3 br flt the concentration increased as the decrease of flt the maximum concentration was 1 28 nm at 720 min which accounted for 26 transformation of the parent to our knowledge this was the first time that the formation trend of 3 br flt was observed site 3 of flt was the first transformation step of flt which determine its further transformation direction thus although only 3 br flt was found in this study its formation trend was essential to understand the transformation of flt and its occurrence in tap water for phe the difference between phe and other inactive compounds is the amounts of halogenated products trace amounts of 9 chlorophenanthrene 9 cl phe and 9 10 dichlorophenanthrene 9 10 dicl phe were observed during the chlorination process the concentration of 9 bromophenanthrene 9 br phe was one order of magnitude higher than that of the chlorinated product but the maximum concentration was only 0 17 nm but it can be identified that phe did not mainly undergo an es reaction because only trace halogenated products were observed previous studies reported that 9 monohydroxyphenanthrene 9 oh phe and oxygenated phe accounted for 50 of the products at ph 3 but only 4 at ph8 oyler et al 1982 epoxy phe also accounted for 88 of the products at ph8 thus it indicated that the main products of phe could be other polar or and oxygenated products via an et reaction meanwhile it also implied not all inactive pahs will undergo an es reaction in the function of hobr 3 2 4 reaction comparison of hoclo hocl hobr and hobro to present the reaction mechanism between hocl or hobr and pahs we compared the time dependent transformation products of ant flu and pyr during hoclo hocl hobr and hobro fig 5 ant flu and pyr represent the et reaction of active pahs es reaction of active pahs and es reaction of inactive pahs respectively in general the first step transformation products determine the transformation rate of the parent during the et reaction of ant ane reached the maximum concentration at 720 min 1 32 nm 360 min 1 60 nm and 2 min 2 43 nm under the three conditions hoclo hocl hobr and hobro repectively it was obvious that the formation rate of ane during hobro was significantly faster than that under the other conditions and the concentration was relatively higher this implies the reason that the reaction rate between hobr and ant was higher than that of hocl ant transformed faster to its oxygenated products at a higher product concentration for pyr monohalogenated pyr reached maximum concentrations at 720 min 2 61 nm 30 min 2 76 nm and 2 min 2 71 nm under the three conditions of hoclo hocl hobr and hobro respectively in contrast to ant the maximum concentration of monohalogenated pyr was closer therefore the reaction rate between hobr and pyr was higher than that of hocl and pyr transformed to halogenated products faster flu has a complete formation trend of transformation products monohalogenated flu reached maximum concentrations at 10 080 min 0 13 nm 4320 min 3 58 nm and 60 min 2 96 nm under the three conditions of hoclo hocl hobr and hobro respectively notably trace 2 cl flu was observed at hoclo which indicated the low reaction rate between hocl and flu the formation rate of 2 br flu of hobro was significantly higher than that of hocl hobr thus the formation of brominated flu at high concentrations can explain why hobr can react with inactive flu more strongly than hocl in a word higher reactivity of hobr results from faster formation of hpahs and opahs from the observed results in terms of 3 typical compounds ant transformed to its oxygenated products faster at a higher concentration while pyr and flu transformed faster to their halogenated products and similar results occurred for the compound of ace and bap si fig s2 it is a consensus that hocl has higher oxidation and acidity than hobr but why does hobr has significantly higher reactivity further explanation is that it can be related to the electron cloud distribution of halogen atoms in hocl or hobr previous studies indicated that the mulliken and chelpg charges for both hocl and hobr follow the same tendency of negative charges for the oxygen and positive ones for the hydrogen and halogen atoms ximenes et al 2015 but the values of mulliken and chelpg charges of hobr 0 2910 0 0576 were higher than those of hocl 0 1829 0 0084 it indicated that higher positive charge is on bromine and bromonium ion br as an intermediate may be formed which make hobr higher susceptibility to electron rich center namely more electrophilic ximenes et al 2015 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the kinetics of 10 pahs and the formation mechanism of transformation products in the presence of brˉ during chlorination we for the first time acquired the kinetic parameters of 9 pahs with hobr the results indicated that hobr can accelerate the processes of both es and et reaction in pahs and the second order rate constant of hobr is 102 103 times higher than that of hocl with the reaction of pahs pahs having a five membered ring with a c c bond like acy or a parallel arrangement of three benzene rings like ant and baa were more prone to induce et reaction and other pahs were more prone to induce es reaction in addition the k br k cl values of ace pyr and bap were higher than those of acy ant and baa which means that hobr was more conductive to induce es reactions than hocl it was also the reason that inactive pahs including nap flu and flt can be transformed by hobr in terms of products it is the increased formation of brominated products for inactive pahs in the water containing brˉ hobr and hocl dominate the reaction processes with pahs although other species may still affect the reaction processes from the aspects of transformation products higher reactivity of hobr results from faster formation of hpahs and opahs than hocl as an example of 3 typical compounds ant transforms to its oxygenated products faster at a higher concentration while pyr and flu transform faster to their halogenated products further mechanisms can be because higher positive charge is on bromine and br as an intermediate may be formed which make hobr it more electrophilic it was essential to understanding the formation of toxic dbps in water containing brˉ generally ant and baa mainly lead to the formation of less toxic oxygenated pahs the formation of more toxic halogenated products for ace pyr bap nap flu and flt was observed during chlorination in addition we predicted their transformation pathways using the total mass balances of ant and flu in summary our results indicated that pahs will transform to many emerging toxic products in water containing brˉ during chlorination disinfection this was also the reason that hpahs and opahs occurred in tap water and effluents of wwtps for disinfection process water containing brˉ could be closer to the real water environment than that only containing hocl the existence of hobr with high reactivity poses a new challenge in terms of the transformation of organic pollutants in source water and the identification of emerging dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16487,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas present in the soil pose a long term threat to groundwater robust characterization and modeling of pfas retention and transport in unsaturated systems requires an accurate determination of the magnitude of air water interfacial area awia multiple methods are available for measuring or estimating air water interfacial area including x ray microtomography xmt various aqueous and gas phase interfacial tracer test itt methods and thermodynamic based estimation methods awias determined with the different methods can vary significantly therefore it is critical to determine which measurement methods are relevant for application to pfas retention and transport this is achieved by employing awias determined with different methods to simulate the results of miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature for the transport of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in an unsaturated quartz sand measured pfoa breakthrough curves were successfully predicted using awia values measured by aqueous itt methods conversely awias measured with the xmt method and estimated with the thermodynamic method under predicted the magnitude of retardation and could not successfully simulate the measured transport data these results indicate that the itt method appears to provide the most appropriate awia values for robust characterization and modeling of pfas transport in unsaturated systems the long term impact of employing different awia values on pfoa leaching in the vadose zone was simulated for a representative afff application scenario the predicted timeframes for pfoa migration to groundwater varied from 3 to 6 to 20 years depending on which awia was used in the simulation these relatively large differences would result in significantly different risk assessment outcomes these results illustrate that it is critical to employ the awia that is most representative of pfas retention for accurate predictions of pfas leaching in the vadose zone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas adsorption retention variably saturated leaching 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are contaminants of critical concern given their widespread occurrence environmental persistence and deleterious impacts to human and ecosystem health soil has been identified as a primary long term source of pfas for many sites e g xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 washington et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a as such there is great interest in the transport behavior of pfas in soil and the vadose zone and their potential for leaching to groundwater adsorption at the air water interface has been demonstrated to be a critical retention process for the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media as illustrated by the results of miscible displacement experiments and mathematical model simulations lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 guo et al 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2020 silva et al 2020 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 li et al 2021 an accurate determination of the magnitude of air water interfacial area present in the system is therefore required for robust characterization and modeling of pfas retention and transport in unsaturated systems multiple methods are available for measuring or estimating air water interfacial area awia for unsaturated porous media these include advanced imaging measurement methods such as x ray microtomography xmt various aqueous and gas phase interfacial tracer test itt methods and thermodynamic based estimation methods e g bradford and leij 1997 brusseau et al 1997 kim et al 1997 anwar and matsubayashi 2000 anwar et al 2000 schaefer et al 2000 anwar 2001 culligan et al 2004 brusseau et al 2006 2007 because the different methods characterize different air water interfacial domains they typically produce differing measurements of awia for the same porous medium for example awias ranging from 18 to 100 cm 1 depending upon the method have been measured for a quartz sand with a water saturation sw of 0 65 araujo and brusseau 2020 brusseau 2021 the use of inaccurate awias may cause significant errors in the development of conceptual site models and in the outcomes of risk assessments hence it is critical to determine which measurements are most representative for characterizing pfas retention and transport the objective of this work is to examine the relevancy of different air water interfacial area measurement methods for application to pfas retention and transport in unsaturated porous media this is achieved by employing awias determined with different methods to simulate the results of miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature for the transport of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in a quartz sand the long term impact of employing different awias on pfoa leaching and mass discharge to groundwater is then investigated through a series of modeling simulations conducted for a representative aqueous film forming foam afff application at a model fire training area site 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfoa transport data the transport of pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and genx in unsaturated quartz sand has been successfully simulated in our prior studies using measured awias brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 however the impact of employing different sources of measured awia was not examined for the present study the primary pfoa transport data sets to be simulated were reported recently by a separate research group lyu et al 2020 li et al 2021 the use of separate literature data increases the degree of difficulty of the evaluation the experiments were conducted with quartz sands purchased from unimin corp including one with a diameter of 0 35 0 45 mm the two studies in combination include two sets of replicate experiments conducted with an electrolyte solution comprised of 1 5 mm nacl one with a water saturation of 0 45 lyu et al 2020 and the other 0 64 li et al 2021 these measured pfoa breakthrough curve data were not simulated with a transport model in the original studies the experiments were conducted under steady unsaturated flow conditions the measured effluent recoveries were close to 100 for the experiments complementary experiments were conducted for saturated conditions to characterize the impact of solid phase sorption on pfoa transport a relatively low input concentration of 7 µg l was used for the experiments this concentration is much lower than pfoa s critical reference concentration which is 10 mg l brusseau and van glubt 2021 prior research has demonstrated that pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions is ideal for this case brusseau et al 2021 this includes effectively linear air water interfacial adsorption and the absence of surfactant induced flow phenomena 2 2 mathematical modeling two one dimensional transport models are used for the study the first model accounts for nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption brusseau 2020 flow is assumed to be steady and surfactant induced flow is not incorporated the second model includes nonsteady flow and the potential for surfactant induced flow as well as nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption guo et al 2020 full descriptions of the governing equations simulation conditions and solution methods are provided in the cited references these two models have been demonstrated to produce accurate independently predicted simulations of pfas transport measured in unsaturated flow miscible displacement experiments brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 the first model is used to simulate the miscible displacement transport experiment data whereas the second model is used to conduct simulations of long term pfas leaching under field conditions the first model was employed in a predictive mode for simulating the experiment data with values for all input parameters determined independently hence no model calibration or fitting to the measured pfoa breakthrough curves is used for the study the retardation factor r for aqueous phase transport of solute undergoing retention by adsorption to solid water and air water interfaces is given as e g lyu et al 2018 1 r 1 k d ρ b θ w k i a a w i a θ w where k d is the solid phase adsorption coefficient cm3 g kia is the air water adsorption coefficient

content and n is porosity by phase balance θw θa n water saturation is defined as sw θw n the air water interfacial adsorption coefficient was determined from surface tension data reported by li et al 2021 recent results have demonstrated that kia values determined from surface tension data are representative of pfas retention during transport in unsaturated media lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 2021 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 the k d for pfoa was obtained from analysis of the reported saturated flow transport experiments values for bulk density porosity and water content are reported in the source papers a reported dispersivity of 0 5 cm obtained from analysis of the nonreactive tracer transport data presented in lyu et al 2020 was used which represents the mean and upper uncertainty range for the 0 45 and 0 64 experiments respectively robust measurements of air water interfacial area have been reported for accusand quartz sand in our prior studies these data are discussed in the forthcoming section the second model was used to conduct long term leaching simulations for a representative afff application scenario the simulations were designed to match the original simulations presented in guo et al 2020 with the current set focused on investigating the impact of employing different awia values it is assumed that pfoa is released to the vadose zone due to periodic fire training activities that occur every 10 days for a period of 20 years an initial concentration of 0 9 mg l is used for pfoa in the diluted afff solution høisæter et al 2019 the afff application rate is based on standard practices as discussed in guo et al 2020 the impact of precipitation and evaporation on pfoa migration is accounted for in the simulations in addition to infiltration associated with afff applications a 10 year long 30 min resolution rainfall dataset measured at a site in arizona representing a semiarid climate is repeated to generate longer term rainfall datasets used for the simulations the szyszkowski equation was fit to surface tension data measured for pfoa in synthetic groundwater to parameterize air water interfacial adsorption measured data for sorption of pfoa by the sand is used to parameterize solid phase sorption the simulation domain 4 m in depth is assumed to be homogeneous with properties representative of the sand additional details about the numerical methods model setup and input parameter values are provided in guo et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured and estimated air water interfacial areas measurements of air water interfacial area reported in our prior studies for the 0 35 mm diameter accusand quartz sand are aggregated in fig 1 these data include measurements obtained with a modified version of the standard aqueous itt method brusseau et al 2015 2020b el ouni et al 2021 a dual surfactant itt method brusseau et al 2015 a mass balance itt method araujo et al 2015 and xmt araujo and brusseau 2020 air water interfacial area is comprised of both capillary interfaces terminal menisci pendular rings wedges and interfaces associated with wetting fluid films solvating solid surfaces the xmt method allows quantitative delineation between capillary and film associated interfacial area conversely itt methods produce measures of total capillary film awia in addition they characterize the contributions of solid surface roughness to film associated awia whereas xmt typically does not brusseau et al 2007 inspection of fig 1 reveals significant differences in the measured awias obtained with the itt versus xmt methods the capillary awia measured with xmt is a non monotonic nonlinear function of water saturation with a maximum value 20 cm 1 conversely the total awia measured with xmt is a linear function of water saturation with a maximum awia of close to 100 cm 1 the awias measured by the itt methods are observed to be a monotonic exponential function of water saturation with a maximum awia 600 cm 1 as a result of these differences in the awia sw functions the awia measured for a given water saturation varies quite significantly among the different methods in particular the differences increase greatly at lower water saturations the data presented in fig 1 will be used to obtain awia input values for the model simulations in addition to different measurement methods various approaches have been developed to estimate or predict awias one means by which to estimate awia is to employ the so called thermodynamic approach leverett 1941 bradford and leij 1997 anwar and matsubayashi 2000 dobson et al 2006 this method is based on using measured soil water characteristic swc data the method was applied to a triplicate set of swc data measured for the accusand fig 2 the estimated awias are similar to the total awias measured with xmt fig 1 3 2 simulated pfoa transport with awia measured by itt methods the measured breakthrough curve for pfoa transport in the unsaturated sand at the lower water saturation is presented in fig 3 the measured retardation factor is approximately 4 this value is much larger than the retardation factor measured for saturated flow conditions 1 1 the disparity illustrates the significant impact of air water interfacial adsorption on pfoa retention for this system the pfoa breakthrough curve measured for the higher water saturation is shown in fig 4 a the magnitude of retardation r 2 is smaller than that measured for the lower saturation experiment illustrating the impact of a higher water saturation and smaller awia on retention while this behavior was not discussed in the source papers these results are consistent with our prior results lyu et al 2018 the breakthrough curves do not exhibit any significant self sharpening of the arrival front or extended tailing of the elution front manifestations of which are typical for transport impacted by nonlinear interfacial adsorption e g brusseau et al 2021 this is an indication that pfoa adsorption is effectively linear for the conditions of the experiments the impact of employing different awias for predicting the breakthrough curve measured for the lower water saturation experiment will now be tested with the aqueous phase itt measured awia examined first the breakthrough curve simulated with the model using the measured mean values for kia 0 00193 cm 1 and awia 213 cm under predicted the magnitude of retardation and therefore did not match the measured breakthrough curve data not shown it is important to consider measurement uncertainty when using independently determined input parameters for simulations of the several retention related input parameters required see eq 1 kia and awia typically have the greatest measurement uncertainties these uncertainties were discussed in detail by brusseau 2021 for example 10 separate measurements of pfoa surface tensions were compiled and analyzed to determine the measurement uncertainty for kia which was 25 measurement uncertainties for itt measured fluid fluid interfacial areas range from 10 to 30 dobson et al 2006 brusseau et al 2008 2015 brusseau 2021 a value of 15 will be used herein the upper 95 confidence interval values for kia 0 0024 cm 1 and awia 245 cm were used for a second simulation the simulated curve provides a good match to the measured data fig 3 it is important to recall that this simulation represents an independent prediction with values for all input parameters obtained independently of the measured breakthrough curve the ability of the model to accurately predict the measured transport is further tested by attempting to predict two pfoa breakthrough curves obtained for the higher water saturation experiments the first data set originates from the experiments conducted with the same 1 5 mm nacl electrolyte solution as used for the experiment that generated the data presented in fig 3 the only parameter changed for this simulation is the awia due to the change in water saturation inspection of fig 4a shows that the predicted simulation provides an excellent match to the measured data the second data set represents the experiments conducted with 30 mm cacl2 electrolyte solution for this prediction the relevant kia value measured for that solution is used two simulations are presented one employing the measured mean value and the other the estimated upper 95 value it is observed that the two simulations bracket the measured data fig 4b the two data sets simulated in fig 4 represent the two extremes of solution ionic strengths used for the transport experiments presented in li et al 2021 which span a broad range in pfoa surface activities the good predictions of transport presented in figs 3 and 4 indicate that the experiment data are predictable and robust and that the mathematical model accurately represents the processes influencing pfoa retention and transport in this system notably pfoa transport was simulated with air water interfacial adsorption treated as linear constant kia this absence of nonlinear adsorption is consistent with the observed transport behavior and with the results of prior transport experiments brusseau et al 2021 as noted above the input concentration used for the experiments is much lower than the critical reference concentration of pfoa and as such linear adsorption is anticipated the simulations were also conducted with air water interfacial adsorption treated as effectively instantaneous this is also consistent with prior results brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 2021 3 3 simulated pfoa transport with awia measured or estimated by other methods the robust predictions presented in figs 3 and 4 also indicate that the values used for the input parameters are representative and accurate this includes the values used for awia which were measured by the aqueous itt methods the impact of using awias measured with the xmt methods is shown in figs 3 and 4 all input parameter values are identical to the prior simulations except for the use of different measured awias the measurement uncertainty for the xmt method is typically smaller than for the itt methods araujo and brusseau 2020 however the upper 95 confidence interval values were used for the simulations for consistency the predicted curve employing the xmt capillary awia 18 cm 1 with a retardation factor of 1 5 greatly under predicts the retardation exhibited by the measured breakthrough curve fig 3 the magnitude of retardation r 2 determined using the xmt total awia 55 cm 1 is also lower than the measured data similar results are obtained for the higher water saturation experiments fig 4 brusseau and colleagues have successfully predicted the transport of pfoa pfos and genx in unsaturated sand by using itt measured awia values but did not evaluate the impact of using different measured awia values brusseau et al 2019 2021 brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 employing the xmt measured values produces under predictions of retardation for all of their several data sets this is illustrated in fig 5 for pfoa transport with a saturation of 0 66 these results in combination with those in the preceding paragraph demonstrate that the awias measured with the aqueous itt methods provide a more robust and relevant representation of pfoa retention during transport in the unsaturated medium compared to the xmt methods the representativeness of the thermodynamic estimation method was also tested with an estimated awia of 42 cm 1 for the lower water saturation experiment the simulated breakthrough curve under predicts the measured data fig 3 prior work has indicated that awias estimated with this approach can be significantly lower than awias measured with itt methods jiang et al 2020 based on these results the thermodynamic estimation method appears to be limited in its ability to produce awia values relevant for pfas transport particularly for lower water saturations a multitude of theoretical models based on different approaches have also been developed to predict awia jiang et al 2020 and citations therein however a great majority of them focus solely on capillary awia and therefore are unlikely to be applicable for pfas transport given the preceding results 3 4 long term leaching of pfoa the long term impact of employing different awia values on pfoa leaching in the vadose zone was simulated for a representative afff fire training application scenario using the comprehensive model of guo et al 2020 the predicted timeframes for pfoa migration to groundwater vary from 3 to 6 to 20 years depending on which awia is used in the simulations fig 6 as expected the overall pfoa retention is the greatest for the case of the itt determined awia and the weakest for the case of the capillary xmt awia the relatively large differences in timeframes determined for pfas to reach groundwater would result in significantly different risk assessment outcomes field data sets for which initial and boundary conditions are sufficiently well defined for constraining and testing pfas transport models under field conditions have yet to become available however regarding the relevance of the air water interfacial areas measured by the different methods the simulations presented here and those in our prior work guo et al 2020 are qualitatively consistent with measured vadose zone pfas concentration profiles at many contamination sites namely the majority of long chain pfas remain in the shallow vadose zone even decades after the fire training activities have ceased brusseau et al 2020a the simulations discussed above were conducted employing a domain comprised of a homogeneous porous medium it is anticipated that porous medium heterogeneities may under certain conditions impact the transport of pfas in the vadose zones of some sites as discussed in prior studies brusseau 2018 guo et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 zeng and guo 2021 for example the impact of physical heterogeneity on transport was recently investigated with a series of numerical simulations of long term pfas leaching in 2d and 3d heterogeneous vadose zones zeng and guo 2021 the simulations illustrate that when significant heterogeneity and associated preferential flow pathways are present the effective air water interfacial area contributing to pfas retention may be smaller than the actual inherent air water interfacial area other phenomena may also impact the effective air water interfacial area available for pfas retention the transport of pfoa and pfos in miscible displacement experiments was shown to be nonideal for conditions wherein the input concentration was similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration brusseau et al 2021 this was hypothesized to result from a degree of constrained access to some portion of the air water interfacial area notably this behavior was observed for transport in columns packed homogenously with a sand the nonideal transport behavior reported in these two studies may be one potential reason for the observations of relatively deep leaching of pfas in vadose zones at some sites e g dauchy et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a it is anticipated that the most accurate predictions of pfas leaching in the vadose zone will be obtained by using the most representative measures of awia this is especially true for cases with nonideal transport present wherein the use of inaccurate interfacial areas is likely to obfuscate the determination of actual retention mechanisms and the impact of system conditions and potential nonideality factors on transport 4 conclusion measured miscible displacement data for pfoa transport in unsaturated sand was successfully predicted using awia values measured by aqueous itt methods conversely awias measured with the xmt method and estimated with the thermodynamic method under predicted the magnitude of retardation and could not successfully simulate the measured transport data these results indicate that the aqueous itt methods appear to provide the most appropriate awia values for robust characterization and modeling of pfas transport in unsaturated media the long term impact of employing different awia values on pfoa leaching in the vadose zone was investigated by conducting simulations for a representative afff fire training application scenario the results highlight the importance of employing awia values that are most representative of pfas air water interfacial adsorption for accurate predictions of pfas leaching in the vadose zone the analyses presented herein focused on pfoa transport however the results are anticipated to be representative for a great majority of pfas given the consistency and similarity of surface activity behavior exhibited by pfas of greatly varying molecular structures as evidenced by the ability to accurately predict fluid fluid interfacial adsorption coefficients using simple single parameter quantitative structure property relationship models brusseau 2019 brusseau and van glubt 2021 finally it is important to note that nonideal transport may occur under certain conditions wherein full access to the air water interface is constrained in some manner thereby resulting in an effective interfacial area that may vary with conditions and thus impact retention and

16487,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas present in the soil pose a long term threat to groundwater robust characterization and modeling of pfas retention and transport in unsaturated systems requires an accurate determination of the magnitude of air water interfacial area awia multiple methods are available for measuring or estimating air water interfacial area including x ray microtomography xmt various aqueous and gas phase interfacial tracer test itt methods and thermodynamic based estimation methods awias determined with the different methods can vary significantly therefore it is critical to determine which measurement methods are relevant for application to pfas retention and transport this is achieved by employing awias determined with different methods to simulate the results of miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature for the transport of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in an unsaturated quartz sand measured pfoa breakthrough curves were successfully predicted using awia values measured by aqueous itt methods conversely awias measured with the xmt method and estimated with the thermodynamic method under predicted the magnitude of retardation and could not successfully simulate the measured transport data these results indicate that the itt method appears to provide the most appropriate awia values for robust characterization and modeling of pfas transport in unsaturated systems the long term impact of employing different awia values on pfoa leaching in the vadose zone was simulated for a representative afff application scenario the predicted timeframes for pfoa migration to groundwater varied from 3 to 6 to 20 years depending on which awia was used in the simulation these relatively large differences would result in significantly different risk assessment outcomes these results illustrate that it is critical to employ the awia that is most representative of pfas retention for accurate predictions of pfas leaching in the vadose zone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas adsorption retention variably saturated leaching 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are contaminants of critical concern given their widespread occurrence environmental persistence and deleterious impacts to human and ecosystem health soil has been identified as a primary long term source of pfas for many sites e g xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 washington et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a as such there is great interest in the transport behavior of pfas in soil and the vadose zone and their potential for leaching to groundwater adsorption at the air water interface has been demonstrated to be a critical retention process for the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media as illustrated by the results of miscible displacement experiments and mathematical model simulations lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 guo et al 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2020 silva et al 2020 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 li et al 2021 an accurate determination of the magnitude of air water interfacial area present in the system is therefore required for robust characterization and modeling of pfas retention and transport in unsaturated systems multiple methods are available for measuring or estimating air water interfacial area awia for unsaturated porous media these include advanced imaging measurement methods such as x ray microtomography xmt various aqueous and gas phase interfacial tracer test itt methods and thermodynamic based estimation methods e g bradford and leij 1997 brusseau et al 1997 kim et al 1997 anwar and matsubayashi 2000 anwar et al 2000 schaefer et al 2000 anwar 2001 culligan et al 2004 brusseau et al 2006 2007 because the different methods characterize different air water interfacial domains they typically produce differing measurements of awia for the same porous medium for example awias ranging from 18 to 100 cm 1 depending upon the method have been measured for a quartz sand with a water saturation sw of 0 65 araujo and brusseau 2020 brusseau 2021 the use of inaccurate awias may cause significant errors in the development of conceptual site models and in the outcomes of risk assessments hence it is critical to determine which measurements are most representative for characterizing pfas retention and transport the objective of this work is to examine the relevancy of different air water interfacial area measurement methods for application to pfas retention and transport in unsaturated porous media this is achieved by employing awias determined with different methods to simulate the results of miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature for the transport of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in a quartz sand the long term impact of employing different awias on pfoa leaching and mass discharge to groundwater is then investigated through a series of modeling simulations conducted for a representative aqueous film forming foam afff application at a model fire training area site 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfoa transport data the transport of pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and genx in unsaturated quartz sand has been successfully simulated in our prior studies using measured awias brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 however the impact of employing different sources of measured awia was not examined for the present study the primary pfoa transport data sets to be simulated were reported recently by a separate research group lyu et al 2020 li et al 2021 the use of separate literature data increases the degree of difficulty of the evaluation the experiments were conducted with quartz sands purchased from unimin corp including one with a diameter of 0 35 0 45 mm the two studies in combination include two sets of replicate experiments conducted with an electrolyte solution comprised of 1 5 mm nacl one with a water saturation of 0 45 lyu et al 2020 and the other 0 64 li et al 2021 these measured pfoa breakthrough curve data were not simulated with a transport model in the original studies the experiments were conducted under steady unsaturated flow conditions the measured effluent recoveries were close to 100 for the experiments complementary experiments were conducted for saturated conditions to characterize the impact of solid phase sorption on pfoa transport a relatively low input concentration of 7 µg l was used for the experiments this concentration is much lower than pfoa s critical reference concentration which is 10 mg l brusseau and van glubt 2021 prior research has demonstrated that pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions is ideal for this case brusseau et al 2021 this includes effectively linear air water interfacial adsorption and the absence of surfactant induced flow phenomena 2 2 mathematical modeling two one dimensional transport models are used for the study the first model accounts for nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption brusseau 2020 flow is assumed to be steady and surfactant induced flow is not incorporated the second model includes nonsteady flow and the potential for surfactant induced flow as well as nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption guo et al 2020 full descriptions of the governing equations simulation conditions and solution methods are provided in the cited references these two models have been demonstrated to produce accurate independently predicted simulations of pfas transport measured in unsaturated flow miscible displacement experiments brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 the first model is used to simulate the miscible displacement transport experiment data whereas the second model is used to conduct simulations of long term pfas leaching under field conditions the first model was employed in a predictive mode for simulating the experiment data with values for all input parameters determined independently hence no model calibration or fitting to the measured pfoa breakthrough curves is used for the study the retardation factor r for aqueous phase transport of solute undergoing retention by adsorption to solid water and air water interfaces is given as e g lyu et al 2018 1 r 1 k d ρ b θ w k i a a w i a θ w where k d is the solid phase adsorption coefficient cm3 g kia is the air water adsorption coefficient

content and n is porosity by phase balance θw θa n water saturation is defined as sw θw n the air water interfacial adsorption coefficient was determined from surface tension data reported by li et al 2021 recent results have demonstrated that kia values determined from surface tension data are representative of pfas retention during transport in unsaturated media lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 2021 yan et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 the k d for pfoa was obtained from analysis of the reported saturated flow transport experiments values for bulk density porosity and water content are reported in the source papers a reported dispersivity of 0 5 cm obtained from analysis of the nonreactive tracer transport data presented in lyu et al 2020 was used which represents the mean and upper uncertainty range for the 0 45 and 0 64 experiments respectively robust measurements of air water interfacial area have been reported for accusand quartz sand in our prior studies these data are discussed in the forthcoming section the second model was used to conduct long term leaching simulations for a representative afff application scenario the simulations were designed to match the original simulations presented in guo et al 2020 with the current set focused on investigating the impact of employing different awia values it is assumed that pfoa is released to the vadose zone due to periodic fire training activities that occur every 10 days for a period of 20 years an initial concentration of 0 9 mg l is used for pfoa in the diluted afff solution høisæter et al 2019 the afff application rate is based on standard practices as discussed in guo et al 2020 the impact of precipitation and evaporation on pfoa migration is accounted for in the simulations in addition to infiltration associated with afff applications a 10 year long 30 min resolution rainfall dataset measured at a site in arizona representing a semiarid climate is repeated to generate longer term rainfall datasets used for the simulations the szyszkowski equation was fit to surface tension data measured for pfoa in synthetic groundwater to parameterize air water interfacial adsorption measured data for sorption of pfoa by the sand is used to parameterize solid phase sorption the simulation domain 4 m in depth is assumed to be homogeneous with properties representative of the sand additional details about the numerical methods model setup and input parameter values are provided in guo et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured and estimated air water interfacial areas measurements of air water interfacial area reported in our prior studies for the 0 35 mm diameter accusand quartz sand are aggregated in fig 1 these data include measurements obtained with a modified version of the standard aqueous itt method brusseau et al 2015 2020b el ouni et al 2021 a dual surfactant itt method brusseau et al 2015 a mass balance itt method araujo et al 2015 and xmt araujo and brusseau 2020 air water interfacial area is comprised of both capillary interfaces terminal menisci pendular rings wedges and interfaces associated with wetting fluid films solvating solid surfaces the xmt method allows quantitative delineation between capillary and film associated interfacial area conversely itt methods produce measures of total capillary film awia in addition they characterize the contributions of solid surface roughness to film associated awia whereas xmt typically does not brusseau et al 2007 inspection of fig 1 reveals significant differences in the measured awias obtained with the itt versus xmt methods the capillary awia measured with xmt is a non monotonic nonlinear function of water saturation with a maximum value 20 cm 1 conversely the total awia measured with xmt is a linear function of water saturation with a maximum awia of close to 100 cm 1 the awias measured by the itt methods are observed to be a monotonic exponential function of water saturation with a maximum awia 600 cm 1 as a result of these differences in the awia sw functions the awia measured for a given water saturation varies quite significantly among the different methods in particular the differences increase greatly at lower water saturations the data presented in fig 1 will be used to obtain awia input values for the model simulations in addition to different measurement methods various approaches have been developed to estimate or predict awias one means by which to estimate awia is to employ the so called thermodynamic approach leverett 1941 bradford and leij 1997 anwar and matsubayashi 2000 dobson et al 2006 this method is based on using measured soil water characteristic swc data the method was applied to a triplicate set of swc data measured for the accusand fig 2 the estimated awias are similar to the total awias measured with xmt fig 1 3 2 simulated pfoa transport with awia measured by itt methods the measured breakthrough curve for pfoa transport in the unsaturated sand at the lower water saturation is presented in fig 3 the measured retardation factor is approximately 4 this value is much larger than the retardation factor measured for saturated flow conditions 1 1 the disparity illustrates the significant impact of air water interfacial adsorption on pfoa retention for this system the pfoa breakthrough curve measured for the higher water saturation is shown in fig 4 a the magnitude of retardation r 2 is smaller than that measured for the lower saturation experiment illustrating the impact of a higher water saturation and smaller awia on retention while this behavior was not discussed in the source papers these results are consistent with our prior results lyu et al 2018 the breakthrough curves do not exhibit any significant self sharpening of the arrival front or extended tailing of the elution front manifestations of which are typical for transport impacted by nonlinear interfacial adsorption e g brusseau et al 2021 this is an indication that pfoa adsorption is effectively linear for the conditions of the experiments the impact of employing different awias for predicting the breakthrough curve measured for the lower water saturation experiment will now be tested with the aqueous phase itt measured awia examined first the breakthrough curve simulated with the model using the measured mean values for kia 0 00193 cm 1 and awia 213 cm under predicted the magnitude of retardation and therefore did not match the measured breakthrough curve data not shown it is important to consider measurement uncertainty when using independently determined input parameters for simulations of the several retention related input parameters required see eq 1 kia and awia typically have the greatest measurement uncertainties these uncertainties were discussed in detail by brusseau 2021 for example 10 separate measurements of pfoa surface tensions were compiled and analyzed to determine the measurement uncertainty for kia which was 25 measurement uncertainties for itt measured fluid fluid interfacial areas range from 10 to 30 dobson et al 2006 brusseau et al 2008 2015 brusseau 2021 a value of 15 will be used herein the upper 95 confidence interval values for kia 0 0024 cm 1 and awia 245 cm were used for a second simulation the simulated curve provides a good match to the measured data fig 3 it is important to recall that this simulation represents an independent prediction with values for all input parameters obtained independently of the measured breakthrough curve the ability of the model to accurately predict the measured transport is further tested by attempting to predict two pfoa breakthrough curves obtained for the higher water saturation experiments the first data set originates from the experiments conducted with the same 1 5 mm nacl electrolyte solution as used for the experiment that generated the data presented in fig 3 the only parameter changed for this simulation is the awia due to the change in water saturation inspection of fig 4a shows that the predicted simulation provides an excellent match to the measured data the second data set represents the experiments conducted with 30 mm cacl2 electrolyte solution for this prediction the relevant kia value measured for that solution is used two simulations are presented one employing the measured mean value and the other the estimated upper 95 value it is observed that the two simulations bracket the measured data fig 4b the two data sets simulated in fig 4 represent the two extremes of solution ionic strengths used for the transport experiments presented in li et al 2021 which span a broad range in pfoa surface activities the good predictions of transport presented in figs 3 and 4 indicate that the experiment data are predictable and robust and that the mathematical model accurately represents the processes influencing pfoa retention and transport in this system notably pfoa transport was simulated with air water interfacial adsorption treated as linear constant kia this absence of nonlinear adsorption is consistent with the observed transport behavior and with the results of prior transport experiments brusseau et al 2021 as noted above the input concentration used for the experiments is much lower than the critical reference concentration of pfoa and as such linear adsorption is anticipated the simulations were also conducted with air water interfacial adsorption treated as effectively instantaneous this is also consistent with prior results brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 2021 3 3 simulated pfoa transport with awia measured or estimated by other methods the robust predictions presented in figs 3 and 4 also indicate that the values used for the input parameters are representative and accurate this includes the values used for awia which were measured by the aqueous itt methods the impact of using awias measured with the xmt methods is shown in figs 3 and 4 all input parameter values are identical to the prior simulations except for the use of different measured awias the measurement uncertainty for the xmt method is typically smaller than for the itt methods araujo and brusseau 2020 however the upper 95 confidence interval values were used for the simulations for consistency the predicted curve employing the xmt capillary awia 18 cm 1 with a retardation factor of 1 5 greatly under predicts the retardation exhibited by the measured breakthrough curve fig 3 the magnitude of retardation r 2 determined using the xmt total awia 55 cm 1 is also lower than the measured data similar results are obtained for the higher water saturation experiments fig 4 brusseau and colleagues have successfully predicted the transport of pfoa pfos and genx in unsaturated sand by using itt measured awia values but did not evaluate the impact of using different measured awia values brusseau et al 2019 2021 brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 employing the xmt measured values produces under predictions of retardation for all of their several data sets this is illustrated in fig 5 for pfoa transport with a saturation of 0 66 these results in combination with those in the preceding paragraph demonstrate that the awias measured with the aqueous itt methods provide a more robust and relevant representation of pfoa retention during transport in the unsaturated medium compared to the xmt methods the representativeness of the thermodynamic estimation method was also tested with an estimated awia of 42 cm 1 for the lower water saturation experiment the simulated breakthrough curve under predicts the measured data fig 3 prior work has indicated that awias estimated with this approach can be significantly lower than awias measured with itt methods jiang et al 2020 based on these results the thermodynamic estimation method appears to be limited in its ability to produce awia values relevant for pfas transport particularly for lower water saturations a multitude of theoretical models based on different approaches have also been developed to predict awia jiang et al 2020 and citations therein however a great majority of them focus solely on capillary awia and therefore are unlikely to be applicable for pfas transport given the preceding results 3 4 long term leaching of pfoa the long term impact of employing different awia values on pfoa leaching in the vadose zone was simulated for a representative afff fire training application scenario using the comprehensive model of guo et al 2020 the predicted timeframes for pfoa migration to groundwater vary from 3 to 6 to 20 years depending on which awia is used in the simulations fig 6 as expected the overall pfoa retention is the greatest for the case of the itt determined awia and the weakest for the case of the capillary xmt awia the relatively large differences in timeframes determined for pfas to reach groundwater would result in significantly different risk assessment outcomes field data sets for which initial and boundary conditions are sufficiently well defined for constraining and testing pfas transport models under field conditions have yet to become available however regarding the relevance of the air water interfacial areas measured by the different methods the simulations presented here and those in our prior work guo et al 2020 are qualitatively consistent with measured vadose zone pfas concentration profiles at many contamination sites namely the majority of long chain pfas remain in the shallow vadose zone even decades after the fire training activities have ceased brusseau et al 2020a the simulations discussed above were conducted employing a domain comprised of a homogeneous porous medium it is anticipated that porous medium heterogeneities may under certain conditions impact the transport of pfas in the vadose zones of some sites as discussed in prior studies brusseau 2018 guo et al 2020 brusseau et al 2021 zeng and guo 2021 for example the impact of physical heterogeneity on transport was recently investigated with a series of numerical simulations of long term pfas leaching in 2d and 3d heterogeneous vadose zones zeng and guo 2021 the simulations illustrate that when significant heterogeneity and associated preferential flow pathways are present the effective air water interfacial area contributing to pfas retention may be smaller than the actual inherent air water interfacial area other phenomena may also impact the effective air water interfacial area available for pfas retention the transport of pfoa and pfos in miscible displacement experiments was shown to be nonideal for conditions wherein the input concentration was similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration brusseau et al 2021 this was hypothesized to result from a degree of constrained access to some portion of the air water interfacial area notably this behavior was observed for transport in columns packed

awia this is especially true for cases with nonideal transport present wherein the use of inaccurate interfacial areas is likely to obfuscate the determination of actual retention mechanisms and the impact of system conditions and potential nonideality factors on transport 4 conclusion measured miscible displacement data for pfoa transport in unsaturated sand was successfully predicted using awia values measured by aqueous itt methods conversely awias measured with the xmt method and estimated with the thermodynamic method under predicted the magnitude of retardation and could not successfully simulate the measured transport data these results indicate that the aqueous itt methods appear to provide the most appropriate awia values for robust characterization and modeling of pfas transport

2016 zhang et al 2020a they may be adsorbed on particles of suspended matter in the water column or deposited on the surface of sediment once introduced into aquatic environment further except remaining in adsorbed form pcbs may solubilize again by desorption or bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and likely biomagnify within the progressive food chain gdaniec pietryka et al 2007 lin et al 2020 thus constituting a potential threat to ecosystems and humans passive sampling technique is generally accepted as the valuable method for identifying the contaminated aquatic environment and assessing potential health risks lydy et al 2014 parkerton and maruya 2014 which further reflects practical exposure results of hocs jonker et al 2018 the sampling phase could be composed of such polymers as low density polyethylene ldpe pintado herrera et al 2020 polydimethylsiloxane pdms niu et al 2020 polyacrylate pa rico rico et al 2010 and polyoxymethylene pom endo et al 2011 among them ldpe passive sampling devices psds have been extensively used because of their more inexpensive construction easier preparation and deployment as well as closer and more sensitive analysis for many

toxicological effects can be measured herve et al 1994 oomen et al 2000 normally if a psd is exposed in aquatic environment for sufficient time and the concentration of a substance reaching thermodynamic equilibrium in receiving and bulk phases c w can be described as follows 1 c w c p e k p e w where c pe is the concentrations of analyte in ldpe and k pe w is ldpe water partition coefficients additionally during kinetic sampling c w is computed from sampling rates which is based on the release for performance reference compounds prcs huckins et al 2006 for both cases k pe w is a key parameter in determining environmental transport and or fate of hocs using ldpe psds traditionally k pe w values are determined by allowing chemicals to reach their equilibrium concentrations in polymer and water phases in contact with each other then analyzing two phases fernandez et al 2009 however for highly hydrophobic chemicals logarithm of octanol water partition coefficients log k ow 5

analyte sorbs to the walls of the container and or the existing dissolved organic chemical zhu et al 2015 to address above points smedes et al 2009 proposed a co solvent method for measuring k pe w since the addition of a water miscible organic solvent e g methanol will contribute to the increase of equilibration rate the stabilization of solutions and the increase of solubility in the aqueous phase booij et al 2002 however it should be cautious in using methanol as a co solvent for impregnating prcs with strong hydrophobicity into ldpe films in passive sampling of hocs although ldpe swells within relatively tight bounds in methanol booij et al 2002 jafvert and kulkarni 2008 on one hand the obtained k pe w from co solvent method are extrapolated values and not always in accordance with expected values because a nonlinear relationship may exist between the chemical activities and co solvent concentrations jafvert and kulkarni 2008 on the other hand this method is very laborious and only can be applied to a limited number of polymer types smedes 2019 to date the experimental k pe w values only for about half of pcbs have been reported experimentally determining k pe w may not be generalized to all pcbs on account of cost and time instead the development of quantitative structure property relationships qsprs models may be a good option for k pe w prediction according to the

several qspr models have been developed for predicting the k pe w values for pcbs choi et al 2013 lohmann 2012 smedes et al 2009 however most of models concentrated on some representative chemicals of different compound groups and did not consider the special molecular structure of pcbs which lack of specific guidance for pcbs several models covered a limited number of pcbs and employ only one specific parameter which could bring more uncertainties meanwhile the presented models were not validated by the experiment measurements thereby it is impossible to judge the quality of produced numbers in the present work the total of 10 in silico models were established and further appraised according to a quick determination in laboratory by addition of a surfactant to form micelles into ldpe water system a three phase system ldpe micelle water was investigated to obtain reliable k pe w values rapidly compared to the conventional two phase method the three phase system presents an obvious advantage which is embodied in a sharp decrease in equilibration time as the target compound can be dissolved in micellar phase rapidly from which it can diffuse fatemi and karimian 2007 k pe

predictive performance of qspr models could be verified the objectives of the current paper are to 1 develop a reliable predictive approach for k pe w values of 209 pcbs combining qspr models with experimental validation 2 elucidate impact mechanisms of pcbs molecular structural features on k pe w to provide valuable information for guiding the low cost prediction of the k pe w values of hydrophobic chemicals e g polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes towards these aims experimental k pe w values for 115 pcbs were collected as a model dataset through an extensive literature search the descriptors were captured from two sources basic molecular properties and alvadesc molecular descriptors mauri 2020 then the linear and nonlinear qspr models were built with five algorithms including multiple linear regressions mlr artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn and random forest rf further the models were verified with experimental k pe w values measured by the three phase system lastly the underlying mechanisms were analyzed and discussed which paved a new way for predicting k pe w containing halogen substituents 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and preprocessing generally k pe w is logarithmically transformed log k pe w to reduce the range and symmetrize the response the experimental log k pe w values of 115 pcbs were originated from various literature sources adams et al 2007 booij et al 2003 choi et al 2013 fernandez et al 2009 smedes 2019 zhu et al 2015 under similar experimental conditions in freshwater at 20 30 to ensure the validity of the prediction models in the case of multiple log k pe w values for the same substance the mean value of them is taken before any analysis for 115 data cleaning outliers containing gross errors should be detected and removed wang et al 2019 the result of the 115 data cleaning process is represented in fig 1 a that log k pe w is characterized by normal distribution that all values fall within three times the standard deviation of the average accordingly the average values of 115 data points are retained as the ultimate dataset for k pe w modeling a complete list of data together with corresponding cas registry number is tabulated in the supporting information si table s1 2 2 descriptors sources and extraction the reliable result and descriptive guidance for the built qspr models are highly dependent on how the descriptors are defined and computed dehmer et al 2012 golmohammadi et al 2012 therefore the philosophy of selection of descriptors is to capture basic chemical features as possible according to the primary influencing factor of physico chemical property for pcbs i e the number of chlorine atoms ncl pcbs are divided into 10 subclasses from monochloro biphenyls to decachloro biphenyls based on the degree of chlorination and substitution pattern pcbs are composed of 209 congeners d archivio et al 2011 gdaniec pietryka et al 2007 it is of general approval that the log k pe w values generally increase along with the increase of ncl is evident conversely the increase of the number of ortho substituted chlorines ncl ortho usually leads to a decrease in the hydrophobicity of a substance since the ortho substituted chlorines are conducive to the restriction of rotation of two benzene rings relative to each other which in turn causes lower adsorption and or absorption with the surrounding media choi et al 2013 han et al 2006 van noort et al 2010 fig 1b shows the addition of a chlorine atom to a pcb molecule brings about an average of 0 5 log unit increase in partition coefficients furthermore the k pe w values for pcbs with the same number of the chlorine atom occur a fluctuation at most one order of magnitude taking into account above effect the descriptors based on the numbers of characteristic types of atom or bond ncl and ncl ortho are selected to predict k pe w values further more broad and active descriptors could help to discover the hidden important information to capture as much chemical features as possible this study also applies alvadesc software version 1 0 8 to compute the extractive descriptors 5290 prior to the descriptors generation molecular structures are optimized in chembio3d ultra 14 0 inter correlation and redundancy however exist in many of these descriptors representing greatly similar molecule structural information therefore a pre filtering is utilized for the dataset to remove descriptors with missing values semi constant descriptors and one of any two descriptors with high pair wise correlation where correlation is greater than 0 95 borhani et al 2016 then 1475 descriptors remain for further variable selection stepwise mlr analysis is used in spss version 20 0 lastly 10 parameters are considered to predict k pe w including ratio of multiple path count over path count pcr centred broto moreau autocorrelation of lag 1 weighted by polarizability atsc1p and so on fig 1c displays the interrelatedness among 10 descriptors by correlation matrix 2 3 qspr model development the dataset is grouped into a training set and a test set in the proportion 4 1 the former is for screening descriptors training models and internal audit of models and the latter is for external validation of models for their individual ability to fit the data and diversity of type five different machine learning methods mlr ann svm knn and rf are used for qspr modeling among numerous linear algorithms the mlr analysis selected herein is a simple transparent and repeatable qspr model building method zhu et al 2020a the mlr 1 model is built under log k pe w values as dependent variable ncl and ncl ortho as predictive variables for 10 alvadesc descriptors pcr and atsc1p are eventually chosen to develop the optimum mlr model mlr 2 by considering the number of descriptors the adjusted determination coefficient r 2 adj and the external explained variance q 2 ext fig 1d further following the oecd guidelines applicability domain ad is characterized by two approaches the first one is euclidean distance based approach which is carried out via ambit discovery v0 04 software the second one is williams plot demonstrating standardized residuals δ versus leverage values h which is a recommended leverage approach for ad investigation it provides a graphical detection of both the response outliers i e chemicals with δ 3 and the structurally influential outliers i e chemicals with h warning leverage value h in a predictive model details of the analytical methods is described in si however the mlr model may be limited in practical application once the useful structural information cannot be extracted from data it is necessary to introduce nonlinear modeling since the factors influencing the partition process of compounds are complex and not all of them are linearly correlated with log k pe w garland and bradley 2013 therefore the models based on ann svm knn and rf algorithms are constructed to analyze the same dataset the nonlinear models also describe two types of descriptors and they are i ann 1 svm 1 knn 1 rf 1 ncl and ncl ortho ii ann 2 svm 2 knn 2 rf 2 pcr and atsc1p all the details of the modeling methods are described in si 2 4 three phase system experiments the test materials are purchased from different providers validation compounds are purchased from accustandard all received chemicals are at least 99 purity the surfactant polyoxyethylene 4 lauryl ether brij 30 is purchased from sigma aldrich ldpe with 76 μm thickness is purchased from apple ltd east rutherford nj usa the experimental approach herein is to add surfactants to form micelles into ldpe water system surfactants possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical functional groups hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head and thus the adsorption and micellization occur due to this characteristic asymmetric structure of their molecules sun et al 2003 zdziennicka et al 2018 surfactant micelles acting as colloids can enhance solubility of pcbs dramatically since the concentrations in the organic phase are relatively large k pe mic can be determined directly at a high surfactant concentration along with little error zhu et al 2015 while for this moment the water dissolved chemical concentration is insignificant against the concentration in the polymer and in the micelles moreover k mic w is determined under little error in line with jafvert et al 1994 all the measured partition coefficients are well above analytical detention limit as a result k pe w is able to be obtained by combining measured k pe mic as well as k mic w values given in volume mass units equals 2 k p e w k p e m i c k m i c w as described in si figure s1 the equilibration time is determined by performing trial experiments via measuring the mass of pcb 79 pcb 140 and pcb 204 partitioning in the polymer phase at various time points the pre experimental results indicate that a constant k pe w value obtained is the equilibration time of 15 days the experimental theory and procedure in detail are also presented in the si 3 results and discussion the qspr models for k pe w of pcbs are developed and evaluated with 115 literature k pe w values in which ncl and ncl ortho pcr and atsc1p are used as descriptors respectively for further validation and evaluation an additional experimental k pe w of 16 pcbs based on the three phase system method are provided 3 1 linear qspr models the qspr models employing the mlr method are established by the training set consisting of 92 data points and validated by 23 data points ncl and ncl ortho include the fundamental information on molecular structure properties of pcbs more versatile descriptors derive from alvadesc software containing more constitutional topological and pharmacophore information consequently the selected descriptors result in the following models mlr 1 and mlr 2 for k pe w mlr 1 ncl and ncl ortho 3 l o g

rmseext 0 155 where n tra and n ext represent the number of compounds in the training set and test set respectively r 2 adj and r 2 ext are the adjusted and external determination coefficients respectively q 2 loo and q 2 boot are the cross validated q 2 using leave one out and bootstrap methods respectively luo et al 2019 rmsetra and rmseext are root mean square errors for the training set and test set respectively table 1 lists more statistical parameters of linear models according to threshold criteria proposed by chirico and gramatica 2011 2012 table 1 both mlr models mlr 1 mlr 2 have gratifying statistical results r 2 adj 0 919 0 955 q 2 loo 0 913 0 953 and q 2 boot 0 917 0 955 in training set and r 2 ext 0 922 0 969 and q 2 ext 0 918 0 965 in the test set imply the outstanding goodness of fit and robustness for models the y scrambling method r 2 ys 0 3 q 2 ys 0 05 is applied to investigate the possibilities of chance correlation between descriptors and dependent variables by 300 scrambling iterations eriksson et al 2003 ou et al 2018 the results r 2 ys 0 018 q 2 ys 0 044 r 2 ys 0 026 q 2 ys 0 044 indicate models are well founded and not influenced by chance correlation moreover the rmse ext values of both models for external compounds are close to the rmse tra for training compounds the similar accuracy both in fitting and in prediction confirms an excellent degree of generalization galimberti et al 2020 table 1 also introduces the additional measure of the accuracy e g mean absolute error mae and quik rules kxx kxy indicating stability and reasonably prediction table s2 reports the descriptors involved in models and presents general description of them the section of mechanism interpretation provides a more in depth comment of the selected descriptors the p levels are all less than 0 001 for the t test demonstrating a statistically significant the criteria point of 10 for variance inflation factors vif is an indicator of significant multicollinearity pourbasheer et al 2010 all vif values are less than 10 showing no serious multicollinearity exists among descriptors indeed the vif value for ncl and ncl ortho is only 1 797 that was much less than the criterion despite the relatively high vif for pcr and atsc1p mlr 2 model predicts k pe w values reasonably well the mean effect mf represents general information on the effect of descriptors in qspr models revealing their individual strength and direction in affecting the activity of analyte by combining the sign and the magnitude of descriptors arthur et al 2016 riahi et al 2009 zhu et al 2020b fig 2 a and b and figure s2 show the liner fitting effect of the predicted versus observed log k pe w values for the chemicals from the investigated set the solid line is 1 1 line meaning good agreement with the observed log k pe w values the mlr 1 model suggests that both descriptors are characteristically linked with the experimental log k pe w the coefficient of ncl is more than double the coefficient of ncl ortho which indicates that the increasing chlorine atom at the benzene ring structure may result in the addition of the log k pe w values for pcbs by a greater extent than changing ncl ortho this can be ascribed to the relatively larger contribution of the chlorine atom on the structure of a pcb molecule than the effect of the position of chlorine substituents fig 2b illustrates the quality of the prediction for mlr 2 model from which the agreement between the observed and predicted log k pe w is better than mlr 1 model for the majority of chemicals the difference between experimental and calculated k pe w values is 0 5 log unit only two of the studied 115 chemicals pcb 172 and pcb 204 have differences greater than 0 5 log unit but smaller than 1 log unit after the assessment of the robustness and prediction for the developed models it is a crucial problem to characterize the respective ads gramatica 2007 the results for the euclidean distance fig 2 show an excellent coverage of the dataset indicating the reliable predictions generated by the linear models fig 2c and e show all the chemicals in both the training set and test set are located in the color region as shown in fig 2d and f h of all the compounds are lower than the warning leverage value h 0 098 demonstrating no compound is particularly influential in model space and thus the training set has agreeable representativeness for mlr 1 model pcb 207 is the only response outlier reported in the corresponding williams plots fig 2d the model overestimates the log k pe w value for pcb 207 though still within a difference of 1 log unit similarly two compounds pcb 172 and pcb 204 are response outliers for mlr 2 model fig 2f with errors approximately 0 55 and 0 65 log unit respectively to seek the reason for available peculiarity a comparison of their predicted log k pe w values is made with all observed values table s1 shows the observed values for pcb 172 and pcb 207 are from a single literature thus the outliers may occur for the limited number of data points and variability in the measurement resulting a slight but significant deviations galimberti et al 2020 the observed log k pe w values for pcb 204 are originated from two literatures and both values are consistently higher than the mlr 2 predicted values 3 2 nonlinear qspr models to avoid the possible issues in linear modeling nonlinear models are also introduced these models are trained with the same training set as the linear models eight in silico models are established in combinations of two types of descriptors and four methods fig 3 a sheds light on the structural depictions of two ann models for predicting log k pe w firstly the selected descriptors are connected to the nodes of hidden layer and then link to the predicted values with different weights and bias values as shown in fig 3b and c the optimal combinations are cost 104 and gamma 10 3 with error 0 050 for the svm 1 model and cost 105 and gamma 10 4 with error 0 034 for the svm 2 model figure s3 suggests a k value of 3 and 5 are suitable for knn 1 model and knn 2 model respectively for the rf models the optimum ntree in the forest is set to 500 and mtry is considered as 1 among the nonlinear models based on ncl and ncl ortho figure s2a c e and g all the compounds for the ann 1 model are distinctly closer to the 1 1 lines whereas those for the rf 1 model scatter further away the svm 1 model substantially overestimates log k pe w for the three high molecular weight pcbs pcb 172 pcb 199 and pcb 207 for which log k pe w vary 0 57 0 51 and 0 73 respectively conversely the knn 1 model occurs greater errors for low molecular weight pcbs additionally the ann 1 model produces a more statistically robust model and provides a reasonably good estimation of log k pe w for pcbs for nonlinear models based on pcr and atsc1p figure s2b d f and h the calculated r 2 adj r 2 ext and ccc values are all larger than 0 9 table 1 and the rmseext values vary between 0 140 and 0 155 exhibiting a more powerful prediction than the aforementioned nonlinear models e g the svm 1 model and the rf 1 model of these the rf 2 model has a high stability and predictability with predictions completely within 0 5 log unit of the experimental log k pe w values 3 3 model comparison the statistical robustness of models is demonstrated by a variety of tests such as q 2 loo q 2 boot q 2 ext ccc etc to comprehensively illustrate the models predictability the predicted k pe w values for 10 models are compared with the observed data using cumulative distributions of residuals fig 3d as shown in figure s4 the predicted log k pe w value is in excellent agreement with the observed value if a point is located on the horizontal axis in the residual plot the height of the box reflects the fluctuation of the residual to a certain extent the comparison for two linear models indicates that the mlr 2 model significantly outruns the mlr 1 model for nonlinear models based on ncl and ncl ortho the residuals for the rf 1 model are the most scattered and those for the knn 1 model come second the ann 1 and svm 1 models present the significant superiority although they rely upon the mlr algorithm to select descriptors 95 of the residual for the svm 2 knn 2 and rf 2 models falls within 0 3 log unit indicating the models have comparable predictability overall the models could be effective in predicting log k pe w within 0 5 log unit from the observed value for pcbs in some cases where the observed value is not available for a specific pcb log k pe w can be predicted with a high degree of confidence by the models among them the rf 2 model can provide good representation for all data points and thus is recommended as the assessment tool of k pe w for pcbs besides despite not with the highest r 2 the mlr 2 model employing error free descriptors pcr and atsc1p are purely transparent and the mlr 1 model whose descriptors are easily accessible from molecular structure providing convenience for use this would help understand partition behavior of compounds more visually 3 4 experimental verification in this study 10 qspr models are developed based on 115 log k pe w values of pcbs in the analysis of the ads particular attention has been payed to the outliers and the reason for their peculiarity three response outliers pcb 172 pcb 204 and pcb 207 are identified as influential and or problematic compounds although the models are robust enough under the check of cross validation the existing disagreement suggests that it is well worth providing an additional experimental verification here a rapid as well as accurate three phase system method is advocated for further research to obtain the experimental k pe w database of pcbs 16 pcbs containing 3 outliers and 13 pcbs with unknown log k pe w values are selected as validation compounds all the k mic w and k pe mic values are converted to logarithms and listed in table s3 an inspection of figure s5 indicates that the generated models perform well for 16 pcbs the predicted log k pe w values herein are within or close to 0 3 log unit of the measured values obtained by the three phase system method further underscoring the prediction performances of the generated models 3 5 mechanism interpretation firstly the mechanisms for the impact of two basic descriptors ncl and ncl ortho on partition behavior of chemicals are elucidated the descriptor ncl has the strong contribution in influencing the ability to absorption polymer for compounds mf 0 855 with a positive coefficient a pcb molecule with more chlorine atoms is more hardly to enter or exit the micro pores of polymer film because of its relatively larger molecular weight resulting in a longer equilibrium time and the higher log k pe w value it is therefore conceivable why the compound with higher partition coefficient in both modeling and experimental validation datasets is characterized by a larger value of the ncl term the ncl ortho term as a descriptor performing the position of substituents in the biphenyl moieties demonstrates the steric nature of pcbs han et al 2006 it is correlated negatively with log k pe w this is probably due to the relatively great effect for the number and or the position of chlorine substituents on the molecular structure of pcbs the larger values of ncl ortho the angle of the two phenyl rings are more close to 90 han et al 2006 safe et al 1982 since the ortho substituted chlorines will help to restrict the rotation of the two benzene rings relative to each other which in turn leads to lower adsorption and or absorption with the surrounding phase arp et al 2009 choi et al 2013 han et al 2006 van noort et al 2010 when the two benzene rings are nearly perpendicular to each other the steric inhibition of coplanarity between the two phenyl rings reaches the maximum which leads to the decreased hydrophobicity of pcbs choi et al 2013 within the same homologue group the k pe w value of pcbs with coplanar molecular structure ncl ortho 0 was generally highest such as pcb 17 ncl 3 ncl ortho 2 log k pe w 4 86 pcb 33 ncl 3 ncl ortho 1 log k pe w 5 13 and pcb 35 ncl 3 ncl ortho 0 log k pe w 5 31 table s4 then the implication of two alvadesc descriptors pcr and atsc1p on k pe w is analyzed the pcr term belongs to walk count descriptors which is the most relevant descriptor mf 0 993 among the selected descriptors this variable represents the ratio of multiple path count over path count which is related to the complexity of the molecular graph i e size branching cyclicity and edge and vertex weights razinger 1986 rucker and rucker 2000 pcr exhibits high discriminating power among isomers and among structural situations of atoms and is relatively sensitive to the substituent position in the dataset nowaczyk and kulig 2012 ruecker and ruecker 1993 in the dataset pcr is correlating negatively with log k pe w which concurs with the ncl ortho descriptor it demonstrates that compounds with higher pcr values are more inclined to higher aqueous solubility leading to the decreased hydrophobicity of pcbs the atsc1p term is a descriptor for the autocorrelation of a topological structure ats it is calculated by atomic property values centered on the molecule hollas 2003 and weighted by atom polarizability in fact the specific interaction mechanisms e g polarizability interactions are significantly influential in the two phase partitioning of chemicals qi et al 2020 vitale and di guardo 2019 in the proposed mlr 2 model atsc1p is negatively correlated with the response suggesting a negative influence in partition therefore the chemicals with lager polarizability are easier to partition into the water phase 4 conclusion the log k pe w values of 115 pcbs gathered from the previous literatures are collected into a dataset further based on the combination of qspr predictions and five machine learning algorithms mlr ann svm knn and rf 10 in silico models are generated for predicting log k pe w of pcbs in which ncl and ncl ortho pcr and atsc1p are employed as descriptors respectively the proposed models show good statistical performances and satisfactory applicability domains undergoing the adequate internal and external validations with their reliable and or transparent features the rf 2 ann 1 mlr 2 and mlr 1 models are recommended as a rapid prediction method to fulfill the gap for the absent experimental information particularly the log k pe w values of 16 pcbs are measured by a three phase system aqueous phase surfactant micelles and ldpe method to perform an additional experimental verification for outliers of models the advantages of this experiment method are high accuracy and rapid determination and many experiments can be simultaneously carried out the results of the experiments show that the modeling data agree well with experimental data i e within or close to 0 3 log unit of the residuals which exhibits the excellent stability and predictability of models thus based on the obtained models the current study extends the completeness of the log k pe w database for 209 pcbs table s4 according to mechanism analysis the main factors for k pe w are the number of chlorine atoms and the spatial position of chlorine substituents which may open up a new way to predict the k pe w for chemicals containing halogen substituents e g bromines for pbdes a comprehensive understanding of the partitioning mechanism of hocs in the membrane micelle water system is significantly decisive of transport kinetics and fate of species in aquatic environmental systems it will be even further

approaching the residuals of 0 3 log unit mechanism interpretations imply that the number of chlorine atoms and ortho substituted chlorines are the great effect parameters for k pe w this result also heightens interest in measuring and predicting the k pe w values of chemicals containing halogen atoms in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words polyethylene water partition coefficients polychlorinated biphenyls qspr surfactant micelles passive sampling 1 introduction polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are largely explored hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs which still persist in the environment and represent a serious environmental problem the high chlorinated pcbs are more resistant to metabolism with half lives of many decades cvancarova et al 2012 venier et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a they may be adsorbed on particles of suspended matter in the water column or deposited on the surface of sediment once introduced into aquatic environment further except remaining in adsorbed form pcbs may solubilize again by desorption or bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and likely biomagnify within the progressive food chain gdaniec pietryka et al 2007 lin et al 2020 thus constituting a potential threat to ecosystems and humans passive sampling technique is generally accepted as the valuable method for identifying the contaminated aquatic environment and assessing potential health risks lydy et al 2014 parkerton and maruya 2014 which further reflects practical exposure results of hocs jonker et al 2018 the sampling phase could be composed of such polymers as low density polyethylene ldpe pintado herrera et al 2020 polydimethylsiloxane pdms niu et al 2020 polyacrylate pa rico rico et al 2010 and polyoxymethylene pom endo et al 2011 among them ldpe passive sampling devices psds have been extensively used because of their more inexpensive construction easier preparation and deployment as well as closer and more sensitive analysis for many targets lohmann 2012 mcdonough et al 2008 with the intelligent use of ldpe psds the freely dissolved concentrations of analyte in water c w charactering the driving force behind accumulation and toxicological effects can be measured herve et al 1994 oomen et al 2000 normally if a psd is exposed in aquatic environment for sufficient time and the concentration of a substance reaching thermodynamic equilibrium in receiving and bulk phases c w can be described as follows 1 c w c p e k p e w where c pe is the concentrations of analyte in ldpe and k pe w is ldpe water partition coefficients additionally during kinetic sampling c w is computed from sampling rates which is based on the release for performance reference compounds prcs huckins et al 2006 for both cases k pe w is a key parameter in determining environmental transport and or fate of hocs using ldpe psds traditionally k pe w values are determined by allowing chemicals to reach their equilibrium concentrations in polymer and water phases in contact with each other then analyzing two phases fernandez et al 2009 however for highly hydrophobic chemicals logarithm of octanol water partition coefficients log k ow 5 5 with low aqueous solubility equilibrium cannot reach even for hundreds of days of deployment times lao et al 2019 meanwhile the additional error will be introduced to the measurement once the analyte sorbs to the walls of the container and or the existing dissolved organic chemical zhu et al 2015 to address above points smedes et al 2009 proposed a co solvent method for measuring k pe w since the addition of a water miscible organic solvent e g methanol will contribute to the increase of equilibration rate the stabilization of solutions and the increase of solubility in the aqueous phase booij et al 2002 however it should be cautious in using methanol as a co solvent for impregnating prcs with strong hydrophobicity into ldpe films in passive sampling of hocs although ldpe swells within relatively tight bounds in methanol booij et al 2002 jafvert and kulkarni 2008 on one hand the obtained k pe w from co solvent method are extrapolated values and not always in accordance with expected values because a nonlinear relationship may exist between the chemical activities and co solvent concentrations jafvert and kulkarni 2008 on the other hand this method is very laborious and only can be applied to a limited number of polymer types smedes 2019 to date the experimental k pe w values only for about half of pcbs have been reported experimentally determining k pe w may not be generalized to all pcbs on account of cost and time instead the development of quantitative structure property relationships qsprs models may be a good option for k pe w prediction according to the guidelines issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd oecd 2007 zhang et al 2020b over the years using qspr studies to build bridges between structural characteristics and properties of a chemical a speedy feasibility was provided to fulfill data holes for limited or absent experimental information john 2016 krmar et al 2020 tropsha and golbraikh 2007 currently several qspr models have been developed for predicting the k pe w values for pcbs choi et al 2013 lohmann 2012 smedes et al 2009 however most of models concentrated on some representative chemicals of different compound groups and did not consider the special molecular structure of pcbs which lack of specific guidance for pcbs several models covered a limited number of pcbs and employ only one specific parameter which could bring more uncertainties meanwhile the presented models were not validated by the experiment measurements thereby it is impossible to judge the quality of produced numbers in the present work the total of 10 in silico models were established and further appraised according to a quick determination in laboratory by addition of a surfactant to form micelles into ldpe water system a three phase system ldpe micelle water was investigated to obtain reliable k pe w values rapidly compared to the conventional two phase method the three phase system presents an obvious advantage which is embodied in a sharp decrease in equilibration time as the target compound can be dissolved in micellar phase rapidly from which it can diffuse fatemi and karimian 2007 k pe w is calculated from the product of the ldpe micellar pseudo phase partition coefficients k pe mic and the micelle water partition coefficients k mic w based on the experimental k pe w data the predictive performance of qspr models could be verified the objectives of the current paper are to 1 develop a reliable predictive approach for k pe w values of 209 pcbs combining qspr models with experimental validation 2 elucidate impact mechanisms of pcbs molecular structural features on k pe w to provide valuable information for guiding the low cost prediction of the k pe w values of hydrophobic chemicals e g polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes towards these aims experimental k pe w values for 115 pcbs were collected as a model dataset through an extensive literature search the descriptors were captured from two sources basic molecular properties and alvadesc molecular descriptors mauri 2020 then the linear and nonlinear qspr models were built with five algorithms including multiple linear regressions mlr artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn and random forest rf further the models were verified with experimental k pe w values measured by the three phase system lastly the underlying mechanisms were analyzed and discussed which paved a new way for predicting k pe w containing halogen substituents 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and preprocessing generally k pe w is logarithmically transformed log k pe w to reduce the range and symmetrize the response the experimental log k pe w values of 115 pcbs were originated from various literature sources adams et al 2007 booij et al 2003 choi et al 2013 fernandez et al 2009 smedes 2019 zhu et al 2015 under similar experimental conditions in freshwater at 20 30 to ensure the validity of the prediction models in the case of multiple log k pe w values for the same substance the mean value of them is taken before any analysis for 115 data cleaning outliers containing gross errors should be detected and removed wang et al 2019 the result of the 115 data cleaning process is represented in fig 1 a that log k pe w is characterized by normal distribution that all values fall within three times the standard deviation of the average accordingly the average values of 115 data points are retained as the ultimate dataset for k pe w modeling a complete list of data together with corresponding cas registry number is tabulated in the supporting information si table s1 2 2 descriptors sources and extraction the reliable result and descriptive guidance for the built qspr models are highly dependent on how the descriptors are defined and computed dehmer et al 2012 golmohammadi et al 2012 therefore the philosophy of selection of descriptors is to capture basic chemical features as possible according to the primary influencing factor of physico chemical property for pcbs i e the number of chlorine atoms ncl pcbs are divided into 10 subclasses from monochloro biphenyls to decachloro biphenyls based on the degree of chlorination and substitution pattern pcbs are composed of 209 congeners d archivio et al 2011 gdaniec pietryka et al 2007 it is of general approval that the log k pe w values generally increase along with the increase of ncl is evident conversely the increase of the number of ortho substituted chlorines ncl ortho usually leads to a decrease in the hydrophobicity of a substance since the ortho substituted chlorines are conducive to the restriction of rotation of two benzene rings relative to each other which in turn causes lower adsorption and or absorption with the surrounding media choi et al 2013 han et al 2006 van noort et al 2010 fig 1b shows the addition of a chlorine atom to a pcb molecule brings about an average of 0 5 log unit increase in partition coefficients furthermore the k pe w values for pcbs with the same number of the chlorine atom occur a fluctuation at most one order of magnitude taking into account above effect the descriptors based on the numbers of characteristic types of atom or bond ncl and ncl ortho are selected to predict k pe w values further more broad and active descriptors could help to discover the hidden important information to capture as much chemical features as possible this study also applies alvadesc software version 1 0 8 to compute the extractive descriptors 5290 prior to the descriptors generation molecular structures are optimized in chembio3d ultra 14 0 inter correlation and redundancy however exist in many of these descriptors representing greatly similar molecule structural information therefore a pre filtering is utilized for the dataset to remove descriptors with missing values semi constant descriptors and one of any two descriptors with high pair wise correlation where correlation is greater than 0 95 borhani et al 2016 then 1475 descriptors remain for further variable selection stepwise mlr analysis is used in spss version 20 0 lastly 10 parameters are considered to predict k pe w including ratio of multiple path count over path count pcr centred broto moreau autocorrelation of lag 1 weighted by polarizability atsc1p and so on fig 1c displays the interrelatedness among 10 descriptors by correlation matrix 2 3 qspr model development the dataset is grouped into a training set and a test set in the proportion 4 1 the former is for screening descriptors training models and internal audit of models and the latter is for external validation of models for their individual ability to fit the data and diversity of type five different machine learning methods mlr ann svm knn and rf are used for qspr modeling among numerous linear algorithms the mlr analysis selected herein is a simple transparent and repeatable qspr model building method zhu et al 2020a the mlr 1 model is built under log k pe w values as dependent variable ncl and ncl ortho as predictive variables for 10 alvadesc descriptors pcr and atsc1p are eventually chosen to develop the optimum mlr model mlr 2 by considering the number of descriptors the adjusted determination coefficient r 2 adj and the external explained variance q 2 ext fig 1d further following the oecd guidelines applicability domain ad is characterized by two approaches the first one is euclidean distance based approach which is carried out via ambit discovery v0 04 software the second one is williams plot demonstrating standardized residuals δ versus leverage values h which is a recommended leverage approach for ad investigation it provides a graphical detection of both the response outliers i e chemicals with δ 3 and the structurally influential outliers i e chemicals with h warning leverage value h in a predictive model details of the analytical methods is described in si however the mlr model may be limited in practical application once the useful structural information cannot be extracted from data it is necessary to introduce nonlinear modeling since the factors influencing the partition process of compounds are complex and not all of them are linearly correlated with log k pe w garland and bradley 2013 therefore the models based on ann svm knn and rf algorithms are constructed to analyze the same dataset the nonlinear models also describe two types of descriptors and they are i ann 1 svm 1 knn 1 rf 1 ncl and ncl ortho ii ann 2 svm 2 knn 2 rf 2 pcr and atsc1p all the details of the modeling methods are described in si 2 4 three phase system experiments the test materials are purchased from different providers validation compounds are purchased from accustandard all received chemicals are at least 99 purity the surfactant polyoxyethylene 4 lauryl ether brij 30 is purchased from sigma aldrich ldpe with 76 μm thickness is purchased from apple ltd east rutherford nj usa the experimental approach herein is to add surfactants to form micelles into ldpe water system surfactants possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical functional groups hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head and thus the adsorption and micellization occur due to this characteristic asymmetric structure of their molecules sun et al 2003 zdziennicka et al 2018 surfactant micelles acting as colloids can enhance solubility of pcbs dramatically since the concentrations in the organic phase are relatively large k pe mic can be determined directly at a high surfactant concentration along with little error zhu et al 2015 while for this moment the water dissolved chemical concentration is insignificant against the concentration in the polymer and in the micelles moreover k mic w is determined under little error in line with jafvert et al 1994 all the measured partition coefficients are well above analytical detention limit as a result k pe w is able to be obtained by combining measured k pe mic as well as k mic w values given in volume mass units equals 2 k p e w k p e m i c k m i c w as described in si figure s1 the equilibration time is determined by performing trial experiments via measuring the mass of pcb 79 pcb 140 and pcb 204 partitioning in the polymer phase at various time points the pre experimental results indicate that a constant k pe w value obtained is the equilibration time of 15 days the experimental theory and procedure in detail are also presented in the si 3 results and discussion the qspr models for k pe w of pcbs are developed and evaluated with 115 literature k pe w values in which ncl and ncl ortho pcr and atsc1p are used as descriptors respectively for further validation and evaluation an additional experimental k pe w of 16 pcbs based on the three phase system method are provided 3 1 linear qspr models the qspr models employing the mlr method are established by the training set consisting of 92 data points and validated by 23 data points ncl and ncl ortho include the fundamental information on molecular structure properties of pcbs more versatile descriptors derive from alvadesc software containing more constitutional topological and pharmacophore information consequently the selected descriptors result in the following models mlr 1 and mlr 2 for k pe w mlr 1 ncl and ncl ortho 3 l o g

rmseext 0 155 where n tra and n ext represent the number of compounds in the training set and test set respectively r 2 adj and r 2 ext are the adjusted and external determination coefficients respectively q 2 loo and q 2 boot are the cross validated q 2 using leave one out and bootstrap methods respectively luo et al 2019 rmsetra and rmseext are root mean square errors for the training set and test set respectively table 1 lists more statistical parameters of linear models according to threshold criteria proposed by chirico and gramatica 2011 2012 table 1 both mlr models mlr 1 mlr 2

outstanding goodness of fit and robustness for models the y scrambling method r 2 ys 0 3 q 2 ys 0 05 is applied to investigate the possibilities of chance correlation between descriptors and dependent variables by 300 scrambling iterations eriksson et al 2003 ou et al 2018 the results r 2 ys 0 018 q 2 ys 0 044 r 2 ys 0 026 q 2 ys 0 044 indicate models are well founded and not influenced by chance correlation moreover the rmse ext values of both models for external compounds are close to the rmse tra for training compounds the similar accuracy both in fitting and in prediction confirms an excellent degree of generalization galimberti et al 2020 table 1 also introduces the additional measure of the accuracy e g mean absolute error mae and quik rules kxx kxy indicating stability and reasonably prediction table s2 reports the descriptors involved in models and presents general description of them the section of mechanism interpretation provides a more in depth comment of the selected descriptors the p levels are all less than 0 001 for the t test demonstrating a statistically significant the criteria point of 10 for variance inflation factors vif is an indicator of significant multicollinearity pourbasheer et al 2010 all vif values are less than 10 showing no serious multicollinearity exists among descriptors indeed the vif value for ncl and ncl ortho is only 1 797 that was much less than the criterion despite the relatively high vif for pcr and atsc1p mlr 2 model predicts k pe w values reasonably well the mean effect mf represents general information on the effect of descriptors in qspr models revealing their individual strength and direction in affecting the activity of analyte by combining the sign and the magnitude of descriptors arthur et al 2016 riahi et al 2009 zhu et al 2020b fig 2 a and b and figure s2 show the liner fitting effect of the predicted versus observed log k pe w values for the chemicals from the investigated set the solid line is 1 1 line meaning good agreement with the observed log k pe w values the mlr 1 model suggests that both descriptors are characteristically linked with the experimental log k pe w the coefficient of ncl is more than double the coefficient of ncl ortho which indicates that the increasing chlorine atom at the benzene ring structure may result in the addition of the log k pe w values for pcbs by a greater extent than changing ncl ortho this can be ascribed to the relatively larger contribution of the chlorine atom on the structure of a pcb molecule than the effect of the position of chlorine substituents fig 2b illustrates the quality of the prediction for mlr 2 model from which the agreement between the observed and predicted log k pe w is better than mlr 1 model for the majority of chemicals the difference between experimental and calculated k pe w values is 0 5 log unit only two of the studied 115 chemicals pcb 172 and pcb 204 have differences greater than 0 5 log unit but smaller than 1 log unit after the assessment of the robustness and prediction for the developed models it is a crucial problem to characterize the respective ads gramatica 2007 the results for the euclidean distance fig 2 show an excellent coverage of the dataset indicating the reliable predictions generated by the linear models fig 2c and e show all the chemicals in both the training set and test set are located in the color region as shown in fig 2d and f h of all the compounds are lower than the warning leverage value h 0 098 demonstrating no compound is particularly influential in model space and thus the training set has agreeable representativeness for mlr 1 model pcb 207 is the only response outlier reported in the corresponding williams plots fig 2d the model overestimates the log k pe w value for pcb 207 though still within a difference of 1 log unit similarly two compounds pcb 172 and pcb 204 are response outliers for mlr 2 model fig 2f with errors approximately 0 55 and 0 65 log unit respectively to seek the reason for available peculiarity a comparison of their predicted log k pe w values is made with all observed values table s1 shows the observed values for pcb 172 and pcb 207 are from a single literature thus the outliers may occur for the limited number of data points and variability in the measurement resulting a slight but significant deviations galimberti et al 2020 the observed log k pe w values for pcb 204 are originated from two literatures and both values are consistently higher than the mlr 2 predicted values 3 2 nonlinear qspr models to avoid the possible issues in linear modeling nonlinear models are also introduced these models are trained with the same training set as the linear models eight in silico models are established in combinations of two types of descriptors and four methods fig 3 a sheds light on the structural depictions of two ann models for predicting log k pe w firstly the selected descriptors are connected to the nodes of hidden layer and then link to the predicted values with different weights and bias values as shown in fig 3b and c the optimal combinations are cost 104 and gamma 10 3 with error 0 050 for the svm 1 model and cost 105 and gamma 10 4 with error 0 034 for the svm 2 model figure s3 suggests a k value of 3 and 5 are suitable for knn 1 model and knn 2 model respectively for the rf models the optimum ntree in the forest is set to 500 and mtry is considered as 1 among the nonlinear models based on ncl and ncl ortho figure s2a c e and g all the compounds for the ann 1 model are distinctly closer to the 1 1 lines whereas those for the rf 1 model scatter further away the svm 1 model substantially overestimates log k pe w for the three high molecular weight pcbs pcb 172 pcb 199 and pcb 207 for which log k pe w vary 0 57 0 51 and 0 73 respectively conversely the knn 1 model occurs greater errors for low molecular weight pcbs additionally the ann 1 model produces a more statistically robust model and provides a reasonably good estimation of log k pe w for pcbs for nonlinear models based on pcr and atsc1p figure s2b d f and h the calculated r 2 adj r 2 ext and ccc values are all larger than 0 9 table 1 and the rmseext values vary between 0 140 and 0 155 exhibiting a more powerful prediction than the aforementioned nonlinear models e g the svm 1 model and the rf 1 model of these the rf 2 model has a high stability and predictability with predictions completely within 0 5 log unit of the experimental log k pe w values 3 3 model comparison the statistical robustness of models is demonstrated by a variety of tests such as q 2 loo q 2 boot q 2 ext ccc etc to comprehensively illustrate the models predictability the predicted k pe w values for 10 models are compared with the observed data using cumulative distributions of residuals fig 3d as shown in figure s4 the predicted log k pe w value is in excellent agreement with the observed value if a point is located on the horizontal axis in the residual plot the height of the box reflects the fluctuation of the residual to a certain extent the comparison for two linear models indicates that the mlr 2 model significantly outruns the mlr 1 model for nonlinear models based on ncl and ncl ortho the residuals for the rf 1 model are the most scattered and those for the knn 1 model come second the ann 1 and svm 1 models present the significant superiority although they rely upon the mlr algorithm to select descriptors 95 of the residual for the svm 2 knn 2 and rf 2 models falls within 0 3 log unit indicating the models have comparable predictability overall the models could be effective in predicting log k pe w within 0 5 log unit from the observed value for pcbs in some cases where the observed value is not available for a specific pcb log k pe w can be predicted with a high degree of confidence by the models among them the rf 2 model can provide good representation for all data points and thus is recommended as the assessment tool of k pe w for pcbs besides despite not with the highest r 2 the mlr 2 model employing error free descriptors pcr and atsc1p are purely transparent and the mlr 1 model whose descriptors are easily accessible from molecular structure providing convenience for use this would help understand partition behavior of compounds more visually 3 4 experimental verification in this study 10 qspr models are developed based on 115 log k pe w values of pcbs in the analysis of the ads particular attention has been payed to the outliers and the reason for their peculiarity three response outliers pcb 172 pcb 204 and pcb 207 are identified as influential and or problematic compounds although the models are robust enough under the check of cross validation the existing disagreement suggests that it is well worth providing an additional experimental verification here a rapid as well as accurate three phase system method is advocated for further research to obtain the experimental k pe w database of pcbs 16 pcbs containing 3 outliers and 13 pcbs with unknown log k pe w values are selected as validation compounds all the k mic w and k pe mic values are converted to logarithms and listed in table s3 an inspection of figure s5 indicates that the generated models perform well for 16 pcbs the predicted log k pe w values herein are within or close to 0 3 log unit of the measured values obtained by the three phase system method further underscoring the prediction performances of the generated models 3 5 mechanism interpretation firstly the mechanisms for the impact of two basic descriptors ncl and ncl ortho on partition behavior of chemicals are elucidated the descriptor ncl has the strong contribution in influencing the ability to absorption polymer for compounds mf 0 855 with a positive coefficient a pcb molecule with more chlorine atoms is more hardly to enter or exit the micro pores of polymer film because of its relatively larger molecular weight resulting in a longer equilibrium time and the higher log k pe w value it is therefore conceivable why the compound with higher partition coefficient in both modeling and experimental validation datasets is characterized by a larger value of the ncl term the ncl ortho term as a descriptor performing the position of substituents in the biphenyl moieties demonstrates the steric nature of pcbs han et al 2006 it is correlated negatively with log k pe w this is probably due to the relatively great effect for the number and or the position of chlorine substituents on the molecular structure of pcbs the larger values of ncl ortho the angle of the two phenyl rings are more close to 90 han et al 2006 safe et al 1982 since the ortho substituted chlorines will help to restrict the rotation of the two benzene rings relative to each other which in turn leads to lower adsorption and or absorption with the surrounding phase arp et al 2009 choi et al 2013 han et al 2006 van noort et al 2010 when the two benzene rings are nearly perpendicular to each other the steric inhibition of coplanarity between the two phenyl rings reaches the maximum which leads to the decreased hydrophobicity of pcbs choi et al 2013 within the same homologue group the k pe w value of pcbs with coplanar molecular structure ncl ortho 0 was generally highest such as pcb 17 ncl 3 ncl ortho 2 log k pe w 4 86 pcb 33 ncl 3 ncl ortho 1 log k pe w 5 13 and pcb 35 ncl 3 ncl ortho 0 log k pe w 5 31 table s4 then the implication of two alvadesc descriptors pcr and atsc1p on k pe w is analyzed the pcr term belongs to walk count descriptors which is the most relevant descriptor mf 0 993 among the selected descriptors this variable represents the ratio of multiple path count over path count which is related to the complexity of the molecular graph i e size branching cyclicity and edge and vertex weights razinger 1986 rucker and rucker 2000 pcr exhibits high discriminating power among isomers and among structural situations of atoms and is relatively sensitive to the substituent position in the dataset nowaczyk and kulig 2012 ruecker and ruecker 1993 in the dataset pcr is correlating negatively with log k pe w which concurs with the ncl ortho descriptor it demonstrates that compounds with higher pcr values are more inclined to higher aqueous solubility leading to the decreased hydrophobicity of pcbs the atsc1p term is a descriptor for the autocorrelation of a topological structure ats it is calculated by atomic property values centered on the molecule hollas 2003 and weighted by atom polarizability in fact the specific interaction mechanisms e g polarizability interactions are significantly influential in the two phase partitioning of chemicals qi et al 2020 vitale and di guardo 2019 in the proposed mlr 2 model atsc1p is negatively correlated with the response suggesting a negative influence in partition therefore the chemicals with lager polarizability are easier to partition into the water phase 4 conclusion the log k pe w values of 115 pcbs gathered from the previous literatures are collected into a dataset further based on the combination of qspr predictions and five machine learning algorithms mlr ann svm knn and rf 10 in silico models are generated for predicting log k pe w of pcbs in which ncl and ncl ortho pcr and atsc1p are employed as descriptors respectively the proposed models show good statistical performances and satisfactory applicability domains undergoing the adequate internal and external validations with their reliable and or transparent features the rf 2 ann 1 mlr 2 and mlr 1 models are recommended as a rapid prediction method to fulfill the gap for the absent experimental information particularly the log k pe w values of 16 pcbs are measured by a three phase system aqueous phase surfactant micelles and ldpe method to perform an additional experimental verification for outliers of models the advantages of this experiment method are high accuracy and rapid determination and many experiments can be simultaneously carried out the results of the experiments show that the modeling data agree well with experimental data i e within or close to 0 3 log unit of the residuals which exhibits the excellent stability and predictability of models thus based on the obtained models the current study extends the completeness of the log k pe w database for 209 pcbs table s4 according to mechanism analysis the main factors for k pe w are the number of chlorine atoms and the spatial position of chlorine substituents which may open up a new way to predict the k pe w for chemicals containing halogen substituents e g bromines for pbdes a comprehensive understanding of the partitioning mechanism of hocs in the membrane micelle water system is significantly decisive of transport kinetics and fate of species in aquatic environmental systems it will be even further

16489,microcystis aeruginosa an important cyanobloom forming cyanobacterium is sensitive to the high light intensity and consequent oxidative stress based on our genomic and transcriptomic analyses of h2o2 treated cells many genes involved in photosynthesis calvin cycle and microcystin synthesis were downregulated whereas several toxin antitoxin genes dna repair genes and h2o2 defense systems such as peroxiredoxins and glutathione synthesis were upregulated axenic m aeruginosa was then co cultured with synthetic bacterial communities collected from 15 different freshwater samples with exhibiting different degrees of h2o2 production and catalase activities our analyses indicated that h2o2 resistant bacterial communities favored the growth and photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa cells under either h2o2 treatment or high light conditions nanopore based bacterial community analyses indicated that these growth promoting effects were likely attributable to a high proportion of alphaproteobacteria e g brevundimonas and ochrobactrum species which protected m aeruginosa cells from h2o2 toxicity further these bacterial communities exhibited higher catalase activity levels and faster o2 production rates upon h2o2 detoxification taken together our findings newly suggest that the occurrence of catalase less m aeruginosa blooms is largely influenced by the surrounding microbiota during high light and organic rich conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidative stress catalase photosynthesis microcystin nanopore sequencing rna sequencing 1 introduction all living beings produce reactive oxygen species ros including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 via the autooxidation of flavoproteins in the presence of oxygen gas imlay 2013 specifically oxygen diffused into the cell is reduced to o2 and h2o2 via the oxidation of flavoproteins such as nadh dehydrogenase resulting in free radical production and cell damage giorgio et al 2007 therefore non charged h2o2 can be released into the environment unless it is not detoxified via chemical mechanisms and enzymes within the cell the release of harmful ros into aquatic environments increases when photosynthetic organisms such as aquatic cyanobacteria and algae use photosystem ii psii as the electron leakage associated with this process leads to ros production latifi et al 2008 a rise in photosynthetic activity and microbial metabolism during a cyanobacterial bloom would thus also increase the production of h2o2 however this is generally counteracted by the biological decay of h2o2 via the enzymatic and chemical activities of the surrounding microbial communities marsico et al 2015 in this way the aquatic biota preserves the balance between the production and elimination of h2o2 via respiration and metabolic processes nevertheless abiotic h2o2 production often occurs in freshwater ecosystems via the uv induced photocatalytic excitation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom which further contributes to ros induced stress bond et al 2020 cory et al 2016 to protect themselves against ros damage microorganisms use several ros defense enzymes such as catalase superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin as well as non enzymatic ros scavengers such as glutathione vitamins a c e and carotenoids imlay 2003 catalases a group of enzymes responsible for decomposing h2o2 into water and oxygen are divided into monofunctional catalases bifunctional catalase peroxidases and manganese containing catalases chelikani et al 2004 interestingly cyanobloom causing microcystis aeruginosa cells lacking catalase encoding genes possess several peroxiredoxins to detoxify h2o2 in addition to peroxiredoxin reductases for the re reduction of oxidized peroxiredoxins kim and park 2014 kim et al 2019 nonetheless large amounts of h2o2 cannot be efficiently removed via peroxiredoxin alone during aerobic respiration and photosynthesis because this process requires nadh nadph as a reducing equivalent therefore catalase is considered the main h2o2 scavenging enzyme at high h2o2 conditions hishinuma et al 2006 seaver and imlay 2001 m aeruginosa the major cyanobloom forming cyanobacteria in many freshwater environments is a colonial species that forms aggregates and is predominantly present in surface waters where it produces a dense cell layer during the warm summer season kim et al 2020 by being closer to the surface m aeruginosa cells may be more heavily exposed to sunlight however microcystis aggregates often coexist with other cyanobacterial species and interact with many associated phototrophic or heterotrophic bacteria which might promote its photosynthetic activity and growth by providing secreted metabolites or removing toxic wastes kim et al 2019 wang et al 2016 axenic m aeruginosa cells lacking catalases could be more susceptible to excess h2o2 produced during continuous photosynthesis in addition to the photocatalytic excitation of cdom in freshwater environments latifi et al 2008 sharpless and blough 2014 common bloom forming cyanobacterial genera include dolichospermum planktothrix cylindrospermopsis nodularia and trichodesmium species huisman et al 2018 among these the number of the genera planktothrix cylindrospermopsis and nodularia lack genes for catalase biosynthesis kim et al 2019 our recent experiments involving rhizobium sp mk23 demonstrated the reduced sensitivity of axenic m aeruginosa cells to high h2o2 concentrations which was possibly due to currently uncharacterized catalase mediated mechanisms kim et al 2019 the findings of the present study demonstrated that high light intensity and cdoms in freshwater environments could increase the abiotic production of h2o2 which adversely affects the survival of m aeruginosa cells unless they are protected by symbiotic bacteria our findings also demonstrated that among 15 randomly chosen environmental bacterial communities collected from different freshwater environments only catalase rich bacterial communities favored the growth of axenic m aeruginosa cells and protected them from h2o2 toxicity which is of great significance in the development of cyanoblooms caused by a variety of cyanobacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 m aeruginosa pcc7806 growth under various conditions the axenic m aeruginosa pcc7806 cells used in this study were

h2o2 was added and incubated at a light intensity of 80 µmol m 2 s 1 followed by dna extraction after 2 days of further incubation 11 days in total the total dna of pcc7806 co cultured with lcc for 35 days was also extracted following which bacterial community analyses were performed as described above alpha diversity and pca analyses were also performed with the clc genomics workbench software raw sequences for each sample were deposited in the genbank sra database under the accession numbers srr14934781 srr14934785 srr13839205 srr13839210 and srr14026557 2 4 catalase activity in bacterial samples catalase activity was assessed via gel staining as previously reported woodbury et al 1971 cell lysates were prepared from 10 ml of cells treated with 5 mm or 150 mm h2o2 half of the h2o2 mic in each sample bacterial cells treated with h2o2 for 50 min were centrifuged at 4 c for 10 min afterward the cells were washed twice with cold pbs and resuspended with cold 0 05 m tris hcl ph 8 5 the cells were then lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 4 c for 30 min after adjusting the protein concentrations in the supernatants using the bradford assay the samples were loaded into a 10 native acrylamide gel ryu et al 2021 the protein loaded gels were then washed three times with distilled water for 15 min and immersed in 0 003 h2o2 for 10 min in the dark to assess catalase activity the gel was briefly washed with distilled water and stained using a solution containing 2 w v ferric chloride and 2 w v potassium ferricyanide the dissolved oxygen levels in the bacterial community culture treated with 5 mm h2o2 were measured using a unisense o2 sensor aarhus denmark for 20 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 h2o2 and microcystin production in freshwater under high light conditions m aeruginosa aggregates present on water surfaces are often exposed to intense sunlight 2 400 µmol m 2 s 1 de bashan et al 2008 many previous studies have also demonstrated that high light intensity can inhibit the growth of m aeruginosa walsh et al 1997 zilliges et al 2011 zheng et al 2020 axenic pcc7806 cells incubated at a light intensity of 80 µmol m 2 s 1 hereinafter referred to as hl in bg11 media could not grow after 5 days of incubation and this lack of growth continued until the end of our monitoring period 18 days hl mediated ros toxicity during the photoinhibition process and inactivation of photosystem ii could lead to ros mediated cell damage ohnishi et al 2005 however a proper light intensity 25 µmol m 2 s 1 enhanced their photosynthetic activity thus stimulating their growth fig 1 a a lower light intensity 10 µmol m 2 s 1 could also support the growth of axenic pcc7806 cells albeit to a lesser extent catalase less prochlorococcus cells the dominant cyanobacterium in the oceans also appeared to be sensitive to low h2o2 10 µm exposure at low light intensity 40 µmol m 2 s 1 morris et al 2011 similarly the hl conditions evaluated herein also killed catalase less axenic pcc7806 cells however natural environments often exhibit sunlight intensities of up to 2 400 µmol m 2 s 1 in addition to much higher cdom concentrations song et al 2019 to demonstrate the involvement of h2o2 toxicity in the death of axenic cells under hl conditions extracellular h2o2 and microcystin concentrations were measured under both high and low light intensity conditions fig 1b higher levels of extracellular h2o2 and microcystin lr production were observed within 5 days of incubation under hl conditions hl intensities rendered extracellular h2o2 0 8 µm concentrations that were attributed to the remnants of a large cell mortality event furthermore different levels of h2o2 production were observed under different conditions due to variations in the respiration and photosynthetic activities of axenic m aeruginosa cells under the different conditions tested herein fig 1b hl could lead to increased total h2o2 levels in m aeruginosa cells indicating that h2o2 production might be higher in the environment zheng et al 2020 a dramatic increase in extracellular microcystin concentration 14 fold higher was observed in the hl condition which was due to hl induced cell lysis in the m aeruginosa genome the microcystin synthetase gene cluster is present as two operons mcyabc and mcydefghij fig s2a these two operons are transcribed bi directionally from a central promoter region between the mcya and mcyd genes rhee et al 2012 in hl conditions microcystin concentrations increased both intracellularly and extracellularly over time fig s2b the expression levels of microcystin synthetase genes mcya mcyb mcyd and mcye increased in hl conditions in comparison with dark conditions fig s2c the intracellular and extracellular microcystin concentrations in the pcc7806 strain increased in proportion to the light intensity until the maximum growth rate was reached wiedner et al 2003 the growth of axenic cultures under hl conditions resumed upon serial catalase addition fig 1c 1 mg ml 1 catalases added extracellularly re enabled the sustained growth of axenic cells by detoxifying extracellular h2o2 levels thus demonstrating that hl induced h2o2 production was responsible for the mortalities of the catalase less axenic cells it is worth noting that very stable water molecules in micron size water droplets can be also oxidized at the water air interface thereby potentially generating h2o2 in the environments lee et al 2019 intracellular and extracellular h2o2 production is inevitable in all oxygenic photosynthesis organisms and high h2o2 concentration might also be present in surface waters due to the hl mediated photocatalytic excitation of cdom such as humic acid benzoquinone and naphthoquinone in freshwater ecosystems clark et al 2014 latifi et al 2008 furthermore excessive h2o2 levels may persist if there is less catalase activity and more cdom present in freshwater ecosystems sharpless and blough 2014 to demonstrate the synergistic effect of hl mediated toxicity and extracellular h2o2 on cell mortalities survival assays with different h2o2 concentrations were performed in both the presence and absence of light fig s3 interestingly high h2o2 concentrations were only fatal to axenic pcc7806 cells under 25 µmol m 2 s 1 conditions fig s3a in contrast no h2o2 concentration dependent cell death was detectable under dark conditions fig s3 these data demonstrate that hl conditions substantially increased the h2o2 induced mortality rates of axenic cells the growth of pcc7806 cells co cultured with rhizobium sp mk23 was also preserved under hl conditions fig 2 a moreover cellular extracts from dead rhizobium cells with active h2o2 detoxifying chemicals and enzymes preserved the number of live pcc7806 cells under hl and h2o2 conditions however this approach did not support the growth of m aeruginosa cells which was likely due to the insufficient enzyme activities of the dead cell extracts as well as potential toxic effects derived from the extracts themselves fig 2b addition of live rhizobium sp mk23 cells increased photosynthetic activity thereby improving m aeruginosa cell growth this could be also seen in thioglycolate supplemented bg11 media where only co cultured cells but not axenic cells displaying high chlorophyll a amounts were largely located near the surface of the media most axenic cultures with lower cell densities were located 5 cm from the top layer in the 20 ml test tubes containing thioglycolate for o2 removal this was likely because axenic cells lacking catalase sought low o2 level positions to avoid oxidative stress which could not be observed when the cells were co cultured with rhizobium fig 2c taken together our data suggested that the growth of catalase deficient axenic pcc7806 cells could be protected by the presence of either extracellular catalases or symbiotic rhizobium cells 3 2 h2o2 induced stress responses in m aeruginosa pcc7806 similar to the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus spcies the most dominant primary producer in the marine ecosystem the genome of m aeruginosa pcc7806 does not feature any catalase encoding genes but contains several genes encoding peroxiredoxins and superoxide dismutases bernrotiner et al 2009 kim et al 2019 when different h2o2 concentrations were used to determine the ½ h2o2 mic for rna seq analysis cell density gradually decreased as h2o2 concentration increased resulting in 100 mortalities when the cells were treated with 200 μm h2o2 fig s4a a highly conserved 2 cys prx gene encoding a peroxiredoxin is present in all cyanobacteria including m aeruginosa cui et al 2012 the highest level of 2 cys prx gene expression occurred at 60 min when the cells were treated with 140 μm h2o2 as demonstrated by our rna seq analyses fig s4b further our rna seq analyses elucidated a total of 431 upregulated 2 fold and 396 downregulated 0 5 fold genes fig s4c furthermore we elucidated seven peroxiredoxins in the pcc7806 cells including type ii prx prxii 2 cys prx 1 cys prx and four prxqs using ncbi genome blast analysis table s2 kobayasho et al 2004 hosoya matsuda et al 2005 cui et al 2012 the expression of type ii prx was the highest 7 36 fold according to transcriptome analyses followed by prx q 2 5 fold and 2 cys prx 1 9 fold suggesting that the expression of several prx genes can be modulated by the h2o2 concentrations tested herein however other genes may also be differentially regulated table 1 type ii prx which possesses five cysteines is a hybrid of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin and appears to be an effective antioxidant among other prx systems brehelin et al 2003 rouhier et al 2001 there was no difference in the expression of two genes encoding superoxide dismutases fesod and mnsod in the pcc7806 cells under h2o2 exposure interestingly the doc gene which encodes a toxin that inhibits translation by binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit was upregulated 30 fold along with other three antitoxin toxin ta pairs among a total of nine ta systems which might decelerate cellular metabolism thus resulting in growth retardation table 2 fig 3 thirty three additional genes annotated as orphan toxin or orphan antitoxin genes were scattered throughout the genome and their expression varied upon exposure to h2o2 see our rna seq data for more details gsm5006377 gsm5006378 antitoxins are very unstable and can be degraded by atp dependent proteases such as lon and clpp donegan et al 2010 among the six proteases annotated in the genome of pcc7806 cells one lon gene and five clpp genes all protease genes were constitutively expressed i e with expression values exceeding 200 rpkm in both conditions except the clpp1 gene 1 79 fold suggesting that h2o2 induced ta systems might further inhibit growth and even result in cell lysis synechococcus sp cb0101 cells exposed to zinc 50 μm for 12 h exhibited the highest expression of the rele toxin gene which encodes a ribosome dependent endoribonuclease however complete cellular death occurred in 3 days suggesting a potential delay in ta systems mediated cellular death marsan et al 2017 therefore although complete death of axenic pcc7806 cells was observed 3 days after h2o2 exposure ta systems might be expressed earlier the gshb gene involved in glutathione synthesis was up regulated 2 2 fold fig 3 moreover other genes responsible for dna repair and chaperone function e g reco and hspa were also upregulated 52 fold and 46 fold respectively indicating that the cells experienced oxidative stress upon exposure to h2o2 figs s4d and 3 fifty five genes among a total of 240 including the uma4 gene were annotated as transposases 4 9 of the pcc7806 genome were upregulated more than 2 fold bh695 4770 maximum 3500 fold suggesting potential h2o2 mediated transposon events resulting in genome rearrangement vigil stenman et al 2015 the up regulated cyaa gene 11 3 fold encodes an adenylate cyclase which is involved in catalyzing the formation of cyclic amp camp from atp fig 3 the camp is an important signaling molecule that regulates several genes involved in antibiotic production and phototrophic growth botsford and harman 1992 several genes linked to amino acid metabolism including apeh and dapc were highly upregulated apeh 21 fold dapc 18 fold table s3 a peptidase database http merops sanger ac uk suggested that the apeh gene in pcc7806 shared a 33 5 homology with the dapb3 gene in pseudoxanthomas mexicana amx 26b however unlike many apeh bacterial genes its gene product has not been characterized yet the apeh gene functions as a defense system against oxidative stress by hydrolyzing oxidized proteins and acting as an exopeptidase activity for acylated peptides in eukaryotes and some archaea gogliettino et al 2012 along with the dapc gene several other genes known to be involved in lysine biosynthesis such as asd dapa dapb and dapf were upregulated asd 3 8 fold dapa 2 1 fold dapb 2 1 fold dapf 2 1 fold table s3 hartmann et al 2003 moreover although the link between lysine biosynthesis and oxidative stress defense is not clear it is worth noting that meso diaminopimelic acid meso dap i e and intermediate is required for peptidoglycan biosynthesis for cell wall damage repair bland et al 2011 further many genes involved in the calvin cycle and photosynthesis were downregulated including rpe 0 15 fold apca 0 13 fold and cpca 0 08 fold which reduces energy generation and growth retardation fig 3 all genes encoding microcystin synthase were downregulated in pcc7806 cells exposed to h2o2 suggesting that microcystin production decreases under strong sunlight table 3 fig 3 the expression of four genes mcya mcyb mcyd and mcye involved in microcystin production decreased in the 2 000 µmol m 2 s 1 condition compared with the 25 µmol m 2 s 1 condition indicating that intracellular microcystin concentration also decreased in strong sunlight fig s5 the expression of iron transport genes feoa 45 fold feob 32 fold was the highest among the inorganic ion transport genes which might be linked to oxidative stress defense systems as they involve several iron containing enzymes fig 3 cornelis et al 2011 lau et al 2016 two copb genes annotated as cu 2 exporting atpases were also upregulated bh695 3617 10 fold bh695 3618 13 fold which may protect cells from copper mediated oxidative stress by lowering the intracellular copper ion concentrations fig 3 karlin 1993 yang et al 2017 our data indicated that h2o2 inhibits primary metabolism such as photosynthesis and co2 fixation and may kill pcc7806 cells through dna damage and toxin expression 3 3 h2o2 concentration in freshwater under different environmental conditions aggregates of cyanobacteria and various associated bacteria often occur in surface waters and are therefore exposed to intense sunlight kim et al 2020 bacterial communities in the cyanobacterial bloom samples s1 s5 were analyzed using nanopore sequencing tools at the species level m aeruginosa was predominant within the phylum cyanobacteria in all the samples fig s6 the bacterial communities of the s2 and s5 samples have a high portion of alphaproteobacteria except for cyanobacteria except for microcystis species the dominant bacterial species differented in each sample in the case of s3 sample pseudomonas species gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant 86 followed by microcystis species 1 7 with other phyla less than 1 the bacterial communities in s4 also have many pseudomonas species which indicated that the samples s3 and s4 were higly contamined with organic pollutants pseudomonas species were mainly found in cyanobacterial blooms which might affect the microcystis colony size and aggregate formation akins et al 2020 kim et al 2020 microscopic observations indicated that the daecheong lake sample s3 was dominated by m aeruginosa like cell aggregates and other bacteria were associated with the cyanobacterial aggregates fig 4 a bacteria that were stained green with syto 9 were present with a large number of microcystis aggregates and were associated with what appeared to be pseudomonas species based on the results of bacterial community analysis environmental parameters including in situ h2o2 concentrations were measured in all 15 sampling sites including five cyanobacterial bloom areas fig s1a the dissolved oxygen and measured ph values in cyanobacterial bloom areas were higher than those in the freshwater environments due to the photosynthetic activities of cyanobacterial blooms table s4 the chemical oxygen demand cod in the bloom area was as high as previously reported values in similar environments table s5 6 5 mg l 1 to 19 1 mg l 1 and sample s10 had the highest cod values 17 9 mg l 1 table s5 although the cod value of s10 was very high its bacterial 16s rrna gene copy number was the lowest among all the samples cod measurement includes highly recalcitrant compounds which might not be metabolized by bacterial cells thereby resulting in a low number of bacterial cells and their community ghosh et al 2004 woodard and curran lnc 2006 substantial in situ h2o2 concentrations were measured only at the sampling sites that received strong sunlight with the exception of cyanobacterial bloom areas however despite having a low cod value 0 808 mg l 1 and strong sunlight exposure the s14 region exhibited low in situ h2o2 concentration ex situ h2o2 tests after filtering out all bacterial cells and transferring the samples to the laboratory exhibited a dramatic reduction in h2o2 concentrations in all samples due to rapid chemical and enzymatic h2o2 decomposition to assess the effects of high light intensity on in situ h2o2 production cell free samples generated by filtration 0 45 μm filter paper were exposed to different light intensities in the laboratory fig 4b after which light intensity dependent h2o2 production was monitored interestingly the samples harboring high cod concentrations such as the cell free filtered s10 sample generated more h2o2 after 4 h of incubation under the 2 000 μmol m 2 s 1 condition fig 4b generally a high concentration of cdom increases the production of h2o2 under strong sunlight conditions which could be seen in our tested samples s7 s10 and s15 abiotic h2o2 production is likely to increase with more photocatalytic excitation by cdom at strong light intensity than at low light intensity cory et al 2016 the cod value indicates the amount of dissolved oxygen required to oxidation all organic substances such as dom cdom and recalcitrant organic compounds however measuring precise cdom concentrations is difficult sawyer et al 1998 in the environment biological h2o2 production by bacterial metabolism of dom could also contribute to the total h2o2 concentrations therefore we concluded that environmental h2o2 production results from a combination of both biological and chemical dom degradation thus our environmental data could not be easily interpreted consistent with our observations the h2o2 concentrations measured in other freshwater samples reached up to 1 3 μm in the presence of light but were undetectable under dark conditions richard et al 2007 other studies have reported different h2o2 levels 15 nm 491 nm in freshwater samples collected in the leith area new zealand at different sampling times freshwater lakes appear to have a high concentration of n acetyl glucosamine nag which is known to support the growth of freshwater bacteria as a carbon and nitrogen source cloud hansen et al 2006 wurzbacher and grossart 2012 after filtering out the cyanobacterial cells the remaining non cyanobacterial cells were fully grown overnight after which their sensitivities to h2o2 and total catalase activities in nag amended bg11 media were measured fig 4c d our data indicated that different bacterial communities from 10 non cyanobacterial bloom samples had different levels of community h2o2 mic and total catalase activities sample s7 referred to as lcc arrow marked in fig 4c d which was the most sensitive to h2o2 exhibited the lowest level of total catalase activity several samples including sample s13 referred to as hcc arrow marked in fig 4c d had high catalytic activities and thus exhibited a high community h2o2 mic taken together our findings indicated that strong sunlight irradiation enhances abiotic h2o2 production in cdom rich freshwater 3 4 protective role of freshwater bacterial communities toward m aeruginosa cells under h2o2 stress axenic pcc7806 cells were co cultured with either lcc or hcc samples to monitor their protective roles under h2o2 500 µm stress conditions at an hl intensity 80 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 5 a both the pcc7806 cells alone or co cultured cells with hcc could grow in the presence of h2o2 without growth inhibition however the growth of lcc inoculated cultures with h2o2 was severely reduced these results were highly consistent with our chlorophyll a analyses fig 5b changes in the bacterial community structure at the genus level were monitored during the co culture experiments with either lcc or hcc using nanopore sequencing tools fig 5c the associated bacterial community may change depending on the specific microcystis genotypes and the bloom stage in the environment chun et al 2020 different bacterial communities were predominant prior to the introduction of m aeruginosa enterobacter species in lcc acinetobacter species in hcc however bacterial composition and richness were significantly altered after co culture incubation for 9 days followed by h2o2 500 µm exposure for an additional 3 days enterobacter species are used as indicators of fecal contamination which is commonly noted in streams and rivers patel et al 2016 the prevalence of acinetobacter species is also high in polluted environments sewage dump sites and hydrocarbon contaminated areas suggesting that the freshwater samples in which lcc and hcc were present were contaminated by pollutants such as petrochemicals and hydrocarbons atrouni et al 2016 doughari et al 2011 in the lcc cultures gammaproteobacteria accounted for 96 9 of the total population whereas gammaproteobacteria 56 4 bacteroidetes 24 5 and alphaproteobacteria 17 dominated the initial hcc samples fig s7 the alphaproteobacteria class became dominant after h2o2 treatment in both samples moreover the abundance of several bacterial species decreased after nine days of incubation with m aeruginosa cells including enterobacter acinetobacter and cedeaea in lcc cultures and acinetobacter sphingobacterium and xanthobacter in hcc cultures resulting in a reduction in gammaproteobacteria proportions however acinetobacter species were still dominant in the hcc culture due to its high initial abundance whereas brevundimonas species accounted for 12 6 and 4 9 after 9 and 11 days of co culture interestingly the same brevundimonas species became predominant after 11 days of co culture in the lcc samples fig 5c brevundimonas was the predominant genus in long term cultured m aeruginosa indicating that brevundimonas species establish a highly specialized symbiotic relationship with m aeruginosa kim et al 2020 long term 35 days incubation of lcc inoculated cultures increased the abundance of the alphaproteobacteria phylum albeit with different bacterial species including species belonging to the azospirillum and sphingopyxis genera suggesting that different bacterial groups could perform the same ecosystem functions when co living with m aeruginosa cells fig s8a most bacteria isolated from cyanobacterial blooms belong to the class alphaproteobacteria berg et al 2009 kim et al 2019 2020 adapted lcc co cultured communities were more resistant to h2o2 treatment and promoted the growth of m aeruginosa cells fig s8b longer incubations decreased the alpha diversity of each sample and m aeruginosa co cultured samples had similar bacterial community structures which became more apparent when lcc inoculated m aeruginosa cells were co cultured for 35 days fig s8c pca analysis revealed that pcc7806 cultures protected by both hcc and lcc 35 days shared similar cluster structures fig s8d the alphaproteobacteria phylum including brevundimonas species remained highly abundant in hcc inoculated samples throughout all monitored periods and became dominant in lcc co cultured samples suggesting their important role in the survival of m aeruginosa cells under the tested conditions fig s7 the proportion of pelomorphomonas bradyrhizobium and phreatobacter species belonging to nitrogen fixing were significantly predominant in phycosphere of m aeruginosa yang et al 2017b interestingly culture dependent analyses showed that all genera 40 isolates cultured from hcc belonged to the alphaproteobacteria phylum fig s9 devosia kaistia bosea and reyranella species were isolated in both lcc and hcc in the lcc cultures sphingopyxis species belonging to the alphaproteobacteria phylum were most often identified 5 40 and the ochrobactrum genus belonging to the alphaproteobacteria phylum was also the most highly represented in the hcc samples under our tested conditions fig s9 these data suggested that the bacterial species belonging to alphaproteobacteria could have important interactions with m aeruginosa pcc7806 under oxidative stress conditions 3 5 h2o2 decomposition in freshwater bacterial communities the hcc cultures had higher catalase activities than those of the lcc samples when treated with 5 mm h2o2 fig 6 a to assess catalytic activities and measure h2o2 decay rates zymogram profiling using enzyme electrophoresis was performed with total proteins extracted from both lcc and hcc after short term h2o2 exposure see the materials and methods section 2 7 for more details many bacterial cells produce more than three catalases families e g mn catalase heme containing bifunctional catalase peroxidase and heme containing monofunctional catalase under different conditions chelikani et al 2004 johnson and hug 2019 total proteins collected from hcc appeared to have higher catalase activities and a wider variety of catalases with different protein sizes resulting in thicker and multiple bands in both h2o2 pretreated cells 5 and 150 mm the top bands lanes 2 and 4 were found only in hcc catalase activity staining and band thickness and locations varied between lcc and hcc samples indicating the presence of novel catalases in the hcc cultures high h2o2 concentrations inside cells leads to ros stresses e g protein carbonylation dna breakage and lipid peroxidation which are toxic to cells and affect stabilities of catalase proteins dwyer et al 2015 several bands were not identified in samples of both cultures pretreated with high h2o2 concentrations indicating that these toxicities resulted in fewer and thinner bands in our gel zymogram profiles fig 6a h2o2 can be degraded by dom and reducing substances e g fe and s in freshwater however a high catalase bacterial community provides more protection to m aeruginosa under oxidative stress in freshwater environments h2o2 is decomposed into o2 and h2o and therefore the o2 production rate is largely dependent on the h2o2 degradation rate the dissolved o2 production via catalase activity was measured under the same conditions implemented in the above described experiments fig 6b the hcc samples treated with the same concentrations of h2o2 5 mm exhibited rapid and higher o2 production within 8 min however lower o2 production rates and outputs were detected in the lcc samples suggesting that the hcc cells possessed more active and efficient catalases decomposition of h2o2 is strongly linked to biological processes because aquatic bacteria and small algae are responsible for the majority of h2o2 removal in freshwater bond et al 2020 these tendencies were assessed in h2o2 decay rate tests fig 6c h2o2 concentrations decreased rapidly and were no longer detectable within 10 min in the hcc samples in contrast 4 mm of h2o2 were still detected after 20 min in the lcc samples and complete h2o2 decomposition occurred after 40 min it is also worth noting that although 5 mm h2o2 was added to each culture the initial h2o2 concentration was slightly higher likely due to the preexisting h2o2 present in both initial cultures 4 conclusions our study demonstrated that strong sunlight irradiation might increase h2o2 production in cdom rich freshwater ecosystems this ros mediated m aeruginosa mortality could be alleviated with associated bacteria particularly those belonging to the alphaproteobacteria class with strong catalase activities therefore our novel finding demonstrates the protective role of some symbiotic bacteria toward hl sensitive m aeruginosa thus providing important considerations for the future development of cyanobloom prevention strategies

16489,microcystis aeruginosa an important cyanobloom forming cyanobacterium is sensitive to the high light intensity and consequent oxidative stress based on our genomic and transcriptomic analyses of h2o2 treated cells many genes involved in photosynthesis calvin cycle and microcystin synthesis were downregulated whereas several toxin antitoxin genes dna repair genes and h2o2 defense systems such as peroxiredoxins and glutathione synthesis were upregulated axenic m aeruginosa was then co cultured with synthetic bacterial communities collected from 15 different freshwater samples with exhibiting different degrees of h2o2 production and catalase activities our analyses indicated that h2o2 resistant bacterial communities favored the growth and photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa cells under either h2o2 treatment or high light conditions nanopore based bacterial community analyses indicated that these growth promoting effects were likely attributable to a high proportion of alphaproteobacteria e g brevundimonas and ochrobactrum species which protected m aeruginosa cells from h2o2 toxicity further these bacterial communities exhibited higher catalase activity levels and faster o2 production rates upon h2o2 detoxification taken together our findings newly suggest that the occurrence of catalase less m aeruginosa blooms is largely influenced by the surrounding microbiota during high light and organic rich conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidative stress catalase photosynthesis microcystin nanopore sequencing rna sequencing 1 introduction all living beings produce reactive oxygen species ros including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 via the autooxidation of flavoproteins in the presence of oxygen gas imlay 2013 specifically oxygen diffused into the cell is reduced to o2 and h2o2 via the oxidation of flavoproteins such as nadh dehydrogenase resulting in free radical production and cell damage giorgio et al 2007 therefore non charged h2o2 can be released into the environment unless it is not detoxified via chemical mechanisms and enzymes within the cell the release of harmful ros into aquatic environments increases when photosynthetic organisms such as aquatic cyanobacteria and algae use photosystem ii psii as the electron leakage associated with this process leads to ros production latifi et al 2008 a rise in photosynthetic activity and microbial metabolism during a cyanobacterial bloom would thus also increase the production of h2o2 however this is generally counteracted by the biological decay of h2o2 via the enzymatic and chemical activities of the surrounding microbial communities marsico et al 2015 in this way the aquatic biota preserves the balance between the production and elimination of h2o2 via respiration and metabolic processes nevertheless abiotic h2o2 production often occurs in freshwater ecosystems via the uv induced photocatalytic excitation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom which further contributes to ros induced stress bond et al 2020 cory et al 2016 to protect themselves against ros damage microorganisms use several ros defense enzymes such as catalase superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin as well as non enzymatic ros scavengers such as glutathione vitamins a c e and carotenoids imlay 2003 catalases a group of enzymes responsible for decomposing h2o2 into water and oxygen are divided into monofunctional catalases bifunctional catalase peroxidases and manganese containing catalases chelikani et al 2004 interestingly cyanobloom causing microcystis aeruginosa cells lacking catalase encoding genes possess several peroxiredoxins to detoxify h2o2 in addition to peroxiredoxin reductases for the re reduction of oxidized peroxiredoxins kim and park 2014 kim et al 2019 nonetheless large amounts of h2o2 cannot be efficiently removed via peroxiredoxin alone during aerobic respiration and photosynthesis because this process requires nadh nadph as a reducing equivalent therefore catalase is considered the main h2o2 scavenging enzyme at high h2o2 conditions hishinuma et al 2006 seaver and imlay 2001 m aeruginosa the major cyanobloom forming cyanobacteria in many freshwater environments is a colonial species that forms aggregates and is predominantly present in surface waters where it produces a dense cell layer during the warm summer season kim et al 2020 by being closer to the surface m aeruginosa cells may be more heavily exposed to sunlight however microcystis aggregates often coexist with other cyanobacterial species and interact with many associated phototrophic or heterotrophic bacteria which might promote its photosynthetic activity and growth by providing secreted metabolites or removing toxic wastes kim et al 2019 wang et al 2016 axenic m aeruginosa cells lacking catalases could be more susceptible to excess h2o2 produced during continuous photosynthesis in addition to the photocatalytic excitation of cdom in freshwater environments latifi et al 2008 sharpless and blough 2014 common bloom forming cyanobacterial genera include dolichospermum planktothrix cylindrospermopsis nodularia and trichodesmium species huisman et al 2018 among these the number of the genera planktothrix cylindrospermopsis and nodularia lack genes for catalase biosynthesis kim et al 2019 our recent experiments involving rhizobium sp mk23 demonstrated the reduced sensitivity of axenic m aeruginosa cells to high h2o2 concentrations which was possibly due to currently uncharacterized catalase mediated mechanisms kim et al 2019 the findings of the present study demonstrated that high light intensity and cdoms in freshwater environments could increase the abiotic production of h2o2 which adversely affects the survival of m aeruginosa cells unless they are protected by symbiotic bacteria our findings also demonstrated that among 15 randomly chosen environmental bacterial communities collected from different freshwater environments only catalase rich bacterial communities favored the growth of axenic m aeruginosa cells and protected them from h2o2 toxicity which is of great significance in the development of cyanoblooms caused by a variety of cyanobacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 m aeruginosa pcc7806 growth under various conditions the axenic m aeruginosa pcc7806 cells used in this study were purchased from the pasteur culture collection of cyanobacteria pcc france possible bacterial contamination was frequently assessed using pcr and microscopic analyses before all the experiments the axenic cells were cultured in bg11 medium under different light intensities 80 25 and 10 µmol m 2 s 1 at a 12h 12 h light dark photoperiod during 18 days to assess light intensity dependent growth inhibition cell growth was monitored via cell counts using a hemocytometer after harvesting 1 ml of 5 days grown pcc7806 cells under various light intensity conditions the culture supernatants were used to measure extracellular h2o2 and microcystin lr concentrations using the amplex red hydrogen peroxide peroxidase assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa and elisa kit abnova taiwan respectively to measure the intracellular microcystin concentration in pcc7806 cells axenic pcc7806 cells 1 ml were harvested by centrifugation following which the harvested cells were lysed by intermittent sonication on for 1 s off for 1 s 65 intensity for 1 min 2 2 abiotic h2o2 production and catalase activity in freshwater bacterial communities freshwater samples were collected from five cyanobacterial bloom sites daecheong lake and nonsan reservoir fig s1a and 10 non cyanobacterial bloom sites han river namhan river and nonsan stream fig s1a in the republic of korea in august and september 2020 the samples were collected from surface water using a water dispenser samjee tech republic of korea and in situ water environmental parameters temperature ph dissolved oxygen do content and salinity were assessed at 1 m depth using multiparameter water quality meter ysi 556 yellow springs instruments usa a cyanobacterial bloom sample was also collected from daecheong lake 3 at 2 m depth fig s1a abiotic h2o2 production in the water samples bacteria free was achieved using a photobiobox system heo et al 2015 at light intensities of 20 and 2 000 µmol m 2 s 1 after removing the bacterial cells 15 pre filtered samples were incubated in 96 well plates with a 200 µl working volume after incubation for 4 h abiotic h2o2 generation in the filtered samples was measured using the amplex red hydrogen peroxide peroxidase assay kit to measure whole community catalase activities the ten freshwater bacterial samples were incubated overnight in n acetyl glucosamine nag amended bg11 media with cycloheximide 100 µg ml 1 upon adjusting the cell density of the samples od680 0 37 h2o2 minimum inhibitory concentrations mic determination and catalase activity measurements were determined for each sample catalase activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay as previously described hadwan 2018 the samples with low s7 sample no 7 referred to as an lcc low catalase bacterial community and high s13 sample no 13 referred to as an hcc high catalase bacterial community catalase activities were chosen for further analyses chlorophyll a in co cultured and axenic samples were extracted overnight with 90 acetone 2 3 bacterial community analysis using nanopore sequencing tools culture independent analyze of cyanobacterial bloom samples were performed using oxford nanopore sequencing oxford nanopore technologies uk pcr reactions were performed using 10 ng of dna from each sample in addition to 25 µl of long amp hot start taq 2x master mix and a 16s specific barcoded primer pair 27f aga gtt tga tcc tgg ctc ag 1492r ggt tac ctt gtt acg act t the resultant dna samples were then purified using a 16s barcoding kit sqk 16s024 in total 100 ng of dna was obtained by pooling equal concentrations of dna for each sample following which sequencing was performed the sequencing procedures rendered read counts of approximately 1 03 gb using a single flow cell on a minion portable sequencer table s1 oxford nanopore technologies uk adapter trimming and assembly of raw sequences were performed using the clc genomic workbench software qiagen germany to establish stable bacterial communities with axenic cells the bacteria from lcc and hcc samples were co cultured with pcc7806 in nag amended bg11 media for 11 days total dnas were extracted using the wizard dna extraction kit promega corporation usa according to the manufacturer s instructions day 0 represents the bacterial community of the inoculum after 9 days of co culture incubation 500 μm of h2o2 was added and incubated at a light intensity of 80 µmol m 2 s 1 followed by dna extraction after 2 days of further incubation 11 days in total the total dna of pcc7806 co cultured with lcc for 35 days was also extracted following which bacterial community analyses were performed as described above alpha diversity and pca analyses were also performed with the clc genomics workbench software raw sequences for each sample were deposited in the genbank sra database under the accession numbers srr14934781 srr14934785 srr13839205 srr13839210 and srr14026557 2 4 catalase activity in bacterial samples catalase activity was assessed via gel staining as previously reported woodbury et al 1971 cell lysates were prepared from 10 ml of cells treated with 5 mm or 150 mm h2o2 half of the h2o2 mic in each sample bacterial cells treated with h2o2 for 50 min were centrifuged at 4 c for 10 min afterward the cells were washed twice with cold pbs and resuspended with cold 0 05 m tris hcl ph 8 5 the cells were then lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 4 c for 30 min after adjusting the protein concentrations in the supernatants using the bradford assay the samples were loaded into a 10 native acrylamide gel ryu et al 2021 the protein loaded gels were then washed three times with distilled water for 15 min and immersed in 0 003 h2o2 for 10 min in the dark to assess catalase activity the gel was briefly washed with distilled water and stained using a solution containing 2 w v ferric chloride and 2 w v potassium ferricyanide the dissolved oxygen levels in the bacterial community culture treated with 5 mm h2o2 were measured using a unisense o2 sensor aarhus denmark for 20 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 h2o2 and microcystin production in freshwater under high light conditions m aeruginosa aggregates present on water surfaces are often exposed to intense sunlight 2 400 µmol m 2 s 1 de bashan et al 2008 many previous studies have also demonstrated that high light intensity can inhibit the growth of m aeruginosa walsh et al 1997 zilliges et al 2011 zheng et al 2020 axenic pcc7806 cells incubated at a light intensity of 80 µmol m 2 s 1 hereinafter referred to as hl in bg11 media could not grow after 5 days of incubation and this lack of growth continued until the end of our monitoring period 18 days hl mediated ros toxicity during the photoinhibition process and inactivation of photosystem ii could lead to ros mediated cell damage ohnishi et al 2005 however a proper light intensity 25 µmol m 2 s 1 enhanced their photosynthetic activity thus stimulating their growth fig 1 a a lower light intensity 10 µmol m 2 s 1 could also support the growth of axenic pcc7806 cells albeit to a lesser extent catalase less prochlorococcus cells the dominant cyanobacterium in the oceans also appeared to be sensitive to low h2o2 10 µm exposure at low light intensity 40 µmol m 2 s 1 morris et al 2011 similarly the hl conditions evaluated herein also killed catalase less axenic pcc7806 cells however natural environments often exhibit sunlight intensities of up to 2 400 µmol m 2 s 1 in addition to much higher cdom concentrations song et al 2019 to demonstrate the involvement of h2o2 toxicity in the death of axenic cells under hl conditions extracellular h2o2 and microcystin concentrations were measured under both high and low light intensity conditions fig 1b higher levels of extracellular h2o2 and microcystin lr production were observed within 5 days of incubation under hl conditions hl intensities rendered extracellular h2o2 0 8 µm concentrations that were attributed to the remnants of a large cell mortality event furthermore different levels of h2o2 production were observed under different conditions due to variations in the respiration and photosynthetic activities of axenic m aeruginosa cells under the different conditions tested herein fig 1b hl could lead to increased total h2o2 levels in m aeruginosa cells indicating that h2o2 production might be higher in the environment zheng et al 2020 a dramatic increase in extracellular microcystin concentration 14 fold higher was observed in the hl condition which was due to hl induced cell lysis in the m aeruginosa genome the microcystin synthetase gene cluster is present as two operons mcyabc and mcydefghij fig s2a these two operons are transcribed bi directionally from a central promoter region between the mcya and mcyd genes rhee et al 2012 in hl conditions microcystin concentrations increased both intracellularly and extracellularly over time fig s2b the expression levels of microcystin synthetase genes mcya mcyb mcyd and mcye increased in hl conditions in comparison with dark conditions fig s2c the intracellular and extracellular microcystin concentrations in the pcc7806 strain increased in proportion to the light intensity until the maximum growth rate was reached wiedner et al 2003 the growth of axenic cultures under hl conditions resumed upon serial catalase addition fig 1c 1 mg ml 1 catalases added extracellularly re enabled the sustained growth of axenic cells by detoxifying extracellular h2o2 levels thus demonstrating that hl induced h2o2 production was responsible for the mortalities of the catalase less axenic cells it is worth noting that very stable water molecules in micron size water droplets can be also oxidized at the water air interface thereby potentially generating h2o2 in the environments lee et al 2019 intracellular and extracellular h2o2 production is inevitable in all oxygenic photosynthesis organisms and high h2o2 concentration might also be present in surface waters due to the hl mediated photocatalytic excitation of cdom such as humic acid benzoquinone and naphthoquinone in freshwater ecosystems clark et al 2014 latifi et al 2008 furthermore excessive h2o2 levels may persist if there is less catalase activity and more cdom present in freshwater ecosystems sharpless and blough 2014 to demonstrate the synergistic effect of hl mediated toxicity and extracellular h2o2 on cell mortalities survival assays with different h2o2 concentrations were performed in both the presence and absence of light fig s3 interestingly high h2o2 concentrations were only fatal to axenic pcc7806 cells under 25 µmol m 2 s 1 conditions fig s3a in contrast no h2o2 concentration dependent cell death was detectable under dark conditions fig s3 these data demonstrate that hl conditions substantially increased the h2o2 induced mortality rates of axenic cells the growth of pcc7806 cells co cultured with rhizobium sp mk23 was also preserved under hl conditions fig 2 a moreover cellular extracts from dead rhizobium cells with active h2o2 detoxifying chemicals and enzymes preserved the number of live pcc7806 cells under hl and h2o2 conditions however this approach did not support the growth of m aeruginosa cells which was likely due to the insufficient enzyme activities of the dead cell extracts as well as potential toxic effects derived from the extracts themselves fig 2b addition of live rhizobium sp mk23 cells increased photosynthetic activity thereby improving m aeruginosa cell growth this could be also seen in thioglycolate supplemented bg11 media where only co cultured cells but not axenic cells displaying high chlorophyll a amounts were largely located near the surface of the media most axenic cultures with lower cell densities were located 5 cm from the top layer in the 20 ml test tubes containing thioglycolate for o2 removal this was likely because axenic cells lacking catalase sought low o2 level positions to avoid oxidative stress which could not be observed when the cells were co cultured with rhizobium fig 2c taken together our data suggested that the growth of catalase deficient axenic pcc7806 cells could be protected by the presence of either extracellular catalases or symbiotic rhizobium cells 3 2 h2o2 induced stress responses in m aeruginosa pcc7806 similar to the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus spcies the most dominant primary producer in the marine ecosystem the genome of m aeruginosa pcc7806 does not feature any catalase encoding genes but contains several genes encoding peroxiredoxins and superoxide dismutases bernrotiner et al 2009 kim et al 2019 when different h2o2 concentrations were used to determine the ½ h2o2 mic for rna seq analysis cell density gradually decreased as h2o2 concentration increased resulting in 100 mortalities when the cells were treated with 200 μm h2o2 fig s4a a highly conserved 2 cys prx gene encoding a peroxiredoxin is present in all cyanobacteria including m aeruginosa cui et al 2012 the highest level of 2 cys prx gene expression occurred at 60 min when the cells were treated with 140 μm h2o2 as demonstrated by our rna seq analyses fig s4b further our rna seq analyses elucidated a total of 431 upregulated 2 fold and 396 downregulated 0 5 fold genes fig s4c furthermore we elucidated seven peroxiredoxins in the pcc7806 cells including type ii prx prxii 2 cys prx 1 cys prx and four prxqs using ncbi genome blast analysis table s2 kobayasho et al 2004 hosoya matsuda et al 2005 cui et al 2012 the expression of type ii prx was the highest 7 36 fold according to transcriptome analyses followed by prx q 2 5 fold and 2 cys prx 1 9 fold suggesting that the expression of several prx genes can be modulated by the h2o2 concentrations tested herein however other genes may also be differentially regulated table 1 type ii prx which possesses five cysteines is a hybrid of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin and appears to be an effective antioxidant among other prx systems brehelin et al 2003 rouhier et al 2001 there was no difference in the expression of two genes encoding superoxide dismutases fesod and mnsod in the pcc7806 cells under h2o2 exposure interestingly the doc gene which encodes a toxin that inhibits translation by binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit was upregulated 30 fold along with other three antitoxin toxin ta pairs among a total of nine ta systems which might decelerate cellular metabolism thus resulting in growth retardation table 2 fig 3 thirty three additional genes annotated as orphan toxin or orphan antitoxin genes were scattered throughout the genome and their expression varied upon exposure to h2o2 see our rna seq data for more details gsm5006377 gsm5006378 antitoxins are very unstable and can be degraded by atp dependent proteases such as lon and clpp donegan et al 2010 among the six proteases annotated in the genome of pcc7806 cells one lon gene and five clpp genes all protease genes were constitutively expressed i e with expression values exceeding 200 rpkm in both conditions except the clpp1 gene 1 79 fold suggesting that h2o2 induced ta systems might further inhibit growth and even result in cell lysis synechococcus sp cb0101 cells exposed to zinc 50 μm for 12 h exhibited the highest expression of the rele toxin gene which encodes a ribosome dependent endoribonuclease however complete cellular death occurred in 3 days suggesting a potential delay in ta systems mediated cellular death marsan et al 2017 therefore although complete death of axenic pcc7806 cells was observed 3 days after h2o2 exposure ta systems might be expressed earlier the gshb gene involved in glutathione synthesis was up regulated 2 2 fold fig 3 moreover other genes responsible for dna repair and chaperone function e g reco and hspa were also upregulated 52 fold and 46 fold respectively indicating that the cells experienced oxidative stress upon exposure to h2o2 figs s4d and 3 fifty five genes among a total of 240 including the uma4 gene were annotated as transposases 4 9 of the pcc7806 genome were upregulated more than 2 fold bh695 4770 maximum 3500 fold suggesting potential h2o2 mediated transposon events resulting in genome rearrangement vigil stenman et al 2015 the up regulated cyaa gene 11 3 fold encodes an adenylate cyclase which is involved in catalyzing the formation of cyclic amp camp from atp fig 3 the camp is an important signaling molecule that regulates several genes involved in antibiotic production and phototrophic growth botsford and harman 1992 several genes linked to amino acid metabolism including apeh and dapc were highly upregulated apeh 21 fold dapc 18 fold table s3 a peptidase database http merops sanger ac uk suggested that the apeh gene in pcc7806 shared a 33 5 homology with the dapb3 gene in pseudoxanthomas mexicana amx 26b however unlike many apeh bacterial genes its gene product has not been characterized yet the apeh gene functions as a defense system against oxidative stress by hydrolyzing oxidized proteins and acting as an exopeptidase activity for acylated peptides in eukaryotes and some archaea gogliettino et al 2012 along with the dapc gene several other genes known to be involved in lysine biosynthesis such as asd dapa dapb and dapf were upregulated asd 3 8 fold dapa 2 1 fold dapb 2 1 fold dapf 2 1 fold table s3 hartmann et al 2003 moreover although the link between lysine biosynthesis and oxidative stress defense is not clear it is worth noting that meso diaminopimelic acid meso dap i e and intermediate is required for peptidoglycan biosynthesis for cell wall damage repair bland et al 2011 further many genes involved in the calvin cycle and photosynthesis were downregulated including rpe 0 15 fold apca 0 13 fold and cpca 0 08 fold which reduces energy generation and growth retardation fig 3 all genes encoding microcystin synthase were downregulated in pcc7806 cells exposed to h2o2 suggesting that microcystin production decreases under strong sunlight table 3 fig 3 the expression of four genes mcya mcyb mcyd and mcye involved in microcystin production decreased in the 2 000 µmol m 2 s 1 condition compared with the 25 µmol m 2 s 1 condition indicating that intracellular microcystin concentration also decreased in strong sunlight fig s5 the expression of iron transport genes feoa 45 fold feob 32 fold was the highest among the inorganic ion transport genes which might be linked to oxidative stress defense systems as they involve several iron containing enzymes fig 3 cornelis et al 2011 lau et al 2016 two copb genes annotated as cu 2 exporting atpases were also upregulated bh695 3617 10 fold bh695 3618 13 fold which may protect cells from copper mediated oxidative stress by lowering the intracellular copper ion concentrations fig 3 karlin 1993 yang et al 2017 our data indicated that h2o2 inhibits primary metabolism such as photosynthesis and co2 fixation and may kill pcc7806 cells through dna damage and toxin expression 3 3 h2o2 concentration in freshwater under different environmental conditions aggregates of cyanobacteria and various associated bacteria often occur in surface waters and are therefore exposed to intense sunlight kim et al 2020 bacterial communities in the cyanobacterial bloom samples s1 s5 were analyzed using nanopore sequencing tools at the species level m aeruginosa was predominant within the phylum cyanobacteria in all the samples fig s6 the bacterial communities of the s2 and s5 samples have a high portion of alphaproteobacteria except for cyanobacteria except for microcystis species the dominant bacterial species differented in each sample in the case of s3 sample pseudomonas species gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant 86 followed by microcystis species 1 7 with other phyla less than 1 the bacterial communities in s4 also have many pseudomonas species which indicated that the samples s3 and s4 were higly contamined with organic pollutants pseudomonas species were mainly found in cyanobacterial blooms which might affect the microcystis colony size and aggregate formation akins et al 2020 kim et al 2020 microscopic observations indicated that the daecheong lake sample s3 was dominated by m aeruginosa like cell aggregates and other bacteria were associated with the cyanobacterial aggregates fig 4 a bacteria that were stained green with syto 9 were present with a large number of microcystis aggregates and were associated with what appeared to be pseudomonas species based on the results of bacterial community analysis environmental parameters including in situ h2o2 concentrations were measured in all 15 sampling sites including five cyanobacterial bloom areas fig s1a the dissolved oxygen and measured ph values in cyanobacterial bloom areas were higher than those in the freshwater environments due to the photosynthetic activities of cyanobacterial blooms table s4 the chemical oxygen demand cod in the bloom area was as high as previously reported values in similar environments table s5 6 5 mg l 1 to 19 1 mg l 1 and sample s10 had the highest cod values 17 9 mg l 1 table s5 although the cod value of s10 was very high its bacterial 16s rrna gene copy number was the lowest among all the samples cod measurement includes highly recalcitrant compounds which might not be metabolized by bacterial cells thereby resulting in a low number of bacterial cells and their community ghosh et al 2004 woodard and curran lnc 2006 substantial in situ h2o2 concentrations were measured only at the sampling sites that received strong sunlight with the exception of cyanobacterial bloom areas however despite having a low cod value 0 808 mg l 1 and strong sunlight exposure the s14 region exhibited low in situ h2o2 concentration ex situ h2o2 tests after filtering out all bacterial cells and transferring the samples to the laboratory exhibited a dramatic reduction in h2o2 concentrations in all samples due to rapid chemical and enzymatic h2o2 decomposition to assess the effects of high light intensity on in situ h2o2 production cell free samples generated by filtration 0 45 μm filter paper were exposed to different light intensities in the laboratory fig 4b after which light intensity dependent h2o2 production was monitored interestingly the samples harboring high cod concentrations such as the cell free filtered s10 sample generated more h2o2 after 4 h of incubation under the 2 000 μmol m 2 s 1 condition fig 4b generally a high concentration of cdom increases the production of h2o2 under strong sunlight conditions which could be seen in our tested samples s7 s10 and s15 abiotic h2o2 production is likely to increase with more photocatalytic excitation by cdom at strong light intensity than at low light intensity cory et al 2016 the cod value indicates the amount of dissolved oxygen required to oxidation all organic substances such as dom cdom and recalcitrant organic compounds however measuring precise cdom concentrations is difficult sawyer et al 1998 in the environment biological h2o2 production by bacterial metabolism of dom could also contribute to the total h2o2 concentrations therefore we concluded that environmental h2o2 production results from a combination of both biological and chemical dom degradation thus our environmental data could not be easily interpreted consistent with our observations the h2o2 concentrations measured in other freshwater samples reached up to 1 3 μm in the presence of light but were undetectable under dark conditions richard et al 2007 other studies have reported different h2o2 levels 15 nm 491 nm in freshwater samples collected in the leith area new zealand at different sampling times freshwater lakes appear to have a high concentration of n acetyl glucosamine nag which is known to support the growth of freshwater bacteria as a carbon and nitrogen source cloud hansen et al 2006 wurzbacher and grossart 2012 after filtering out the cyanobacterial cells the remaining non cyanobacterial cells were fully grown overnight after which their sensitivities to h2o2 and total catalase activities in nag amended bg11 media were measured fig 4c d our data indicated that different bacterial communities from 10 non cyanobacterial bloom samples had different levels of community h2o2 mic and total catalase activities sample s7 referred to as lcc arrow marked in fig 4c d which was the most sensitive to h2o2 exhibited the lowest level of total catalase activity several samples including sample s13 referred to as hcc arrow marked in fig 4c d had high catalytic activities and thus exhibited a high community h2o2 mic taken together our findings indicated that strong sunlight irradiation enhances abiotic h2o2 production in cdom rich freshwater 3 4 protective role of freshwater bacterial communities toward m aeruginosa cells under h2o2 stress axenic pcc7806 cells were co cultured with either lcc or hcc samples to monitor their protective roles under h2o2 500 µm stress conditions at an hl intensity 80 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 5 a both the pcc7806 cells alone or co cultured cells with hcc could grow in the presence of h2o2 without growth inhibition however the growth of lcc inoculated cultures with h2o2 was severely reduced these results were highly consistent with our chlorophyll a analyses fig 5b changes in the bacterial community structure at the genus level were monitored during the co culture experiments with either lcc or hcc using nanopore sequencing tools fig 5c the associated bacterial community may change depending on the specific microcystis genotypes and the bloom stage in the environment chun et al 2020 different bacterial communities were predominant prior to the introduction of m aeruginosa enterobacter species in lcc acinetobacter species in hcc however bacterial composition and richness were significantly altered after co culture incubation for 9 days followed by h2o2 500 µm exposure for an additional 3 days enterobacter species are used as indicators of fecal contamination which is commonly noted in streams and rivers patel et al 2016 the prevalence of acinetobacter species is also high in polluted environments sewage dump sites and hydrocarbon contaminated areas suggesting that the freshwater samples in which lcc and hcc were present were contaminated by pollutants such as petrochemicals and hydrocarbons atrouni et al 2016 doughari et al 2011 in the lcc cultures gammaproteobacteria accounted for 96 9 of the total population whereas gammaproteobacteria 56 4 bacteroidetes 24 5 and alphaproteobacteria 17 dominated the initial hcc samples fig s7 the alphaproteobacteria class became dominant after h2o2 treatment in both samples moreover the abundance of several bacterial species decreased after nine days of incubation with m aeruginosa cells including enterobacter acinetobacter and cedeaea in lcc cultures and acinetobacter sphingobacterium and xanthobacter in hcc cultures resulting in a reduction in gammaproteobacteria proportions however acinetobacter species were still dominant in the hcc culture due to its high initial abundance whereas brevundimonas species accounted for 12 6 and 4 9 after 9 and 11 days of co culture interestingly the same brevundimonas species became predominant after 11 days of co culture in the lcc samples fig 5c brevundimonas was the predominant genus in long term cultured m aeruginosa indicating that brevundimonas species establish a highly specialized symbiotic relationship with m aeruginosa kim et al 2020 long term 35 days incubation of lcc inoculated cultures increased the abundance of the alphaproteobacteria phylum albeit with different bacterial species including species belonging to the azospirillum and sphingopyxis genera suggesting that different bacterial groups could perform the same ecosystem functions when co living with m aeruginosa cells fig s8a most bacteria isolated from cyanobacterial blooms belong to the class alphaproteobacteria berg et al 2009 kim et al 2019 2020 adapted lcc co cultured communities were more resistant to h2o2 treatment and promoted the growth of m aeruginosa cells fig s8b longer incubations decreased the alpha diversity of each sample and m aeruginosa co cultured samples had similar bacterial community structures which became more apparent when lcc inoculated m aeruginosa cells were co cultured for 35 days fig s8c pca analysis revealed that pcc7806 cultures protected by both hcc and lcc 35 days shared similar cluster structures fig s8d the alphaproteobacteria phylum including brevundimonas species remained highly abundant in hcc inoculated samples throughout all monitored periods and became dominant in lcc co cultured samples suggesting their important role in the survival of m aeruginosa cells under the tested conditions fig s7 the proportion of pelomorphomonas bradyrhizobium and phreatobacter species belonging to nitrogen fixing were significantly predominant in phycosphere of m aeruginosa yang et al 2017b interestingly culture dependent analyses showed that all genera 40 isolates cultured from hcc belonged to the alphaproteobacteria phylum fig s9 devosia kaistia bosea and reyranella species were isolated in both lcc and hcc in the lcc cultures sphingopyxis species belonging to the alphaproteobacteria phylum were most often identified 5 40 and the ochrobactrum genus belonging to the alphaproteobacteria phylum was also the most highly represented in the hcc samples under our tested conditions fig s9 these data suggested that the bacterial species belonging to alphaproteobacteria could have important interactions with m aeruginosa pcc7806 under oxidative stress conditions 3 5 h2o2 decomposition in freshwater bacterial communities the hcc cultures had higher catalase activities than those of the lcc samples when treated with 5 mm h2o2 fig 6 a to assess catalytic activities and measure h2o2 decay rates zymogram profiling using enzyme electrophoresis was performed with total proteins extracted from both lcc and hcc after short term h2o2 exposure see the materials and methods section 2 7 for more details many bacterial cells produce more than three catalases families e g mn catalase heme containing bifunctional catalase peroxidase and heme containing monofunctional catalase under different conditions chelikani et al 2004 johnson and hug 2019 total proteins collected from hcc appeared to have higher catalase activities and a wider variety of catalases with different protein sizes resulting in thicker and multiple bands in both h2o2 pretreated cells 5 and 150 mm the top bands lanes 2 and 4 were found only in hcc catalase activity staining and band thickness and locations varied between lcc and hcc samples indicating the presence of novel catalases in the hcc cultures high h2o2 concentrations inside cells leads to ros stresses e g protein carbonylation dna breakage and lipid peroxidation which are toxic to cells and affect stabilities of catalase proteins dwyer et al 2015 several bands were not identified in samples of both cultures pretreated with high h2o2 concentrations indicating that these toxicities resulted in fewer and thinner bands in our gel zymogram profiles fig 6a h2o2 can be degraded by dom and reducing substances e g fe and s in freshwater however a high catalase bacterial community provides more protection to m aeruginosa under oxidative stress in freshwater environments h2o2 is decomposed into o2 and h2o and therefore the o2 production rate is largely dependent on the h2o2 degradation rate the dissolved o2 production via catalase activity was measured under the same conditions implemented in the above described experiments fig 6b the hcc samples treated with the same concentrations of h2o2 5 mm exhibited rapid and higher o2 production within 8 min however lower o2 production rates and outputs were detected in the lcc samples suggesting that the hcc cells possessed more active and efficient catalases decomposition of h2o2 is strongly linked to biological processes because aquatic bacteria and small algae are responsible for the majority of h2o2 removal in freshwater bond et al 2020 these tendencies were assessed in h2o2 decay rate tests fig 6c h2o2 concentrations decreased rapidly and were no longer detectable within 10 min in the hcc samples in contrast 4 mm of h2o2 were still detected after 20 min in the lcc samples and complete h2o2 decomposition occurred after 40 min it is also worth noting that although 5 mm h2o2 was added to each culture the initial h2o2 concentration was slightly higher likely due to the preexisting h2o2 present in both initial cultures 4 conclusions our study demonstrated that strong sunlight irradiation might increase h2o2 production in cdom rich freshwater ecosystems this ros mediated m aeruginosa mortality could be alleviated with associated bacteria particularly those belonging to the alphaproteobacteria class with strong catalase activities therefore our novel finding demonstrates the protective role of some symbiotic bacteria toward hl sensitive m aeruginosa thus providing important considerations for the future development of cyanobloom prevention strategies
