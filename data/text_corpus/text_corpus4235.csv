21175,vessel and wave hydrodynamics are fundamental for vessel motion prediction improving hydrodynamic model accuracy without compromising computational efficiency has always been of high interest for safe and cost effective marine operations with continuous development of sensor technology and computational capacity an improved digital twin concept for vessel motion prediction can be realized based on an onboard online adaptive hydrodynamic model this article proposes and demonstrates a practical approach for tuning of important vessel hydrodynamic model parameters based on simulated onboard sensor data of vessel motion response the algorithm relies fundamentally on spectral analysis probabilistic modelling and the discrete bayesian updating formula all case studies show promising and reasonable tuning results sensitivities of the approach with respect to its key parameters were also studied sensor noise has been considered the algorithm is found to be computationally efficient robust and stable when tuning the values of hydrodynamic parameters and updating their uncertainties within reasonable sensor noise levels keywords tuning of seakeeping model wave induced vessel responses sensor signal processing discrete bayesian updating inverse distance weighting sensitivity studies validation analysis 1 introduction the energy sector is experiencing rapid change with a fast growth in offshore wind and solar farms an increased number of subsea installations to provide tie backs to existing oil and gas facilities as well as a continuous drive towards exploration of natural resources in deeper and colder ocean areas these trends lead to more challenging marine operations facing heavier offshore lifts more complex operation systems and severe operational environments hence the economic incentives for obtaining broader operational weather windows by reducing the inherent uncertainties of marine operations increase as of today engineering practice considers uncertainties conservatively and marine operations are designed and simulated according to rules e g dnvgl st n001 2016 before they are executed uncertainty reduction in vessel seakeeping analysis has been focused on by both industry and research institutions for decades knowledge on modelling of wave and vessel hydrodynamics has been rather well developed with respect to engineering practice faltinsen 1990 dnvgl rp c205 2017 in principle one can design the marine operation by application of the most computational demanding and accurate hydrodynamic models e g by including nonlinear wave kinematics yue et al 2008 nouguier et al 2014 and vessel hydrodynamics cao et al 2010 larsen et al 2019 himeno 1981 faltinsen 2015 and even by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd kim 2011 however the on site uncertainties related to wave and vessel condition may reduce the value of engineering efforts during the design phase instead of applying very high fidelity models in the operation design phase to increase the accuracy e g by using nonlinear or cfd programs a lot of efforts have been made on increasing the knowledge of the on site wave forecast and real time vessel operational condition with the development in sensor technology and computational process capacity during the last two decades many research oriented onboard decision support systems odss for marine and offshore activities have been developed aiming at improving vessel motion predictions examples are 1 seasense system nielsen et al 2006 2 cash system clauss et al 2012 3 owme project onboard wave

connell et al 2015 kusters et al 2016 alford et al 2015 on site full scale tests have been performed for validation of the different proposed methods naaijen et al 2016 2018 connell et al 2015 alford et al 2015 challenges on roll motion prediction based on the vessel being modelled as a linear transfer function known as response amplitude operator rao have been reported in all the relevant tests a successful wave induced vessel motion prediction requires two sources i e a sufficiently accurate wave forecast and a numerical vessel model which describes the relationship between wave and vessel motion for the current operational condition most developed odss s focus on improving wave prediction either by wave radar systems or by the ship as a wave buoy analogy those approaches are all influenced by the vessel motion the wave radar approaches could possibly predict the encounter waves a few minutes ahead based on a linear wave propagation model and hence a vessel response envelope can be well estimated however the predicted time series of the encounter waves at the vessel position will not be accurate enough on the other hand nonlinear wave propagation models could better forecast the encounter waves at the vessel position but the computational time is a challenge for real time application alford et al 2015 grilli et al 2011 the ship as a wave buoy analogy estimating waves in the form of wave spectrum requires good prior knowledge on vessel conditions nielsen 2006 brodtkorb et al 2018a nielsen et al 2019 ren et al 2021 nielsen 2007 and tannuri et al 2003 demonstrated the influence of vessel condition uncertainty on the sea state estimation most sea state estimation approaches presume stationary environmental and vessel conditions iseki 2009 and brodtkorb et al 2018b investigated the influence of using non stationary ship motion data on sea state estimation in addition with developed information technology numerical weather prediction nwp can be improved with increased spatial and temporal resolution instead of only reporting the wave forecast in terms of significant wave height h s peak period t p and direction β w a full 2d wave spectral description now can be provided by several weather forecasters e g galvin 2014 this may also help reducing uncertainties of vessel motion prediction simplifications in vessel seakeeping models have to be made in order to design the odss s for real time purposes most odss s use linear transfer functions i e raos between wave and vessel response application of vessel motion raos has proven to be reliable computationally cheap and practically accurate for moderate seas some advanced programs use retardation functions based on the hydrodynamic coefficient database to predict real time motion in the time domain e g milewski et al 2015 the interest of using machine learning for vessel motion analysis has increased in recent years e g cheng et al 2019 de masi et al 2011 nielsen et al 2018 pure data driven and so called physical based data driven machine learning methods are hot research topics within several disciplines related to digitalization the artificial intelligence ai models trained by available data are however very sensitive to the provided historical data for nonlinear systems the ai models may therefore fail if the training data set is insufficient with respect to describing the nonlinearity for vessels with frequently changing loading conditions it may be challenging to obtain sufficient training data and to generalize ai approaches have also faced difficulties of being accepted by energy and maritime industries due to lack of physics reasoning and documented reliability traditionally hydrodynamic coefficients are calibrated to scale experiments van daalen et al 2014 for predefined vessel loading conditions where the uncertainties from vessel inertia distribution and viscous roll damping could be significant the situation onboard may be different from the designed or simulated conditions e g due to the vessel having a different load condition than that originally assumed consequently the presumed raos may not be appropriate to apply for onboard vessel motion prediction however improving the accuracy of raos based on vessel motion and wave information e g h s t p β w and directional spreading is practically very challenging normally vessel motion e g heave motion η 33 can be estimated faltinsen 1990 by 1 η 33 ω β w ζ ω β w h 33 ω β w where η 33 ω is the heave motion at frequency ω ζ ω β w is the wave elevation at frequency ω along the direction β w and h 33 ω β w is the corresponding heave motion rao calculating the rao h 33 ω β w represents the inverted problem of vessel motion estimation there is typically no unique solution for such inversion problems because h 33 ω β w is direction dependent while η 33 ω carries no such information alford et al 2014 tried to solve the inversion problem using singular value decomposition svd technique to solve the ill conditioned equation h y x ω s y x ω s x x ω as a consequence the directional dependency characteristics of the true transfer function will be sacrificed making it questionable whether the calculated transfer function can be applied to a new sea state instead this paper tries to improve the rao accuracy by modifying the important parameters in vessel seakeeping model based on wave information and vessel motion measurements based upon an updated hydrodynamic model the rao can be recalculated and possibly applied to other sea states potentially increasing the accuracy of seakeeping prediction and the safety of marine operations however there are some challenges 1 it is a multi dimensional problem there could be hundreds of parameters subject to uncertainty 2 it is a multi modal problem many combinations of parameters can possibly fit perfectly with the measurement data e g in terms of response power spectrum but those combinations may be far away from each other 3 it is a nonlinear problem with respect to the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters and the resulting vessel motion rao in this paper a probabilistic approach of vessel hydrodynamic parameter tuning based on onboard motion measurements is proposed where the adaptive model will both update the parameter values and their confidence quantitatively this is an important step towards reliability based marine operations and reducing inherent conservatism the adaptive model can be continuously applied throughout the whole lifetime of the vessel assisting in monitoring inspection management life extension etc in accordance with the digital twin concept the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the proposed model tuning algorithm then the algorithm is demonstrated by case studies of a selected vessel model the inputs and basis of the case studies are described in section 3 results of two studied cases are described in section 4 results of sensitivity analyses for key parameters in the proposed method are reported in section 5 the proposed tuning methodology is validated by extensively simulated tuning analyses in section 6 conclusions and future work are then summarized in section 7 2 model tuning procedure assume that there are m uncertain vessel parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ m and there are j sensors measuring interesting vessel motions e g displacement velocity and acceleration of heave and roll at different locations onboard based on the prior knowledge on the uncertain vessel parameters and available vessel sensors j 1 2 j a rao database covering all possible vessel conditions for all sensors should be available for the tuning process the procedure for tuning of vessel parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ m based on measurements from onboard sensors at a specific sea state can be divided into the following steps as illustrated in fig 1 1 initialize the discrete joint probability distribution p 0 φ 1 φ 2 φ m based on prior knowledge on the vessel condition 2 process the sensor measurements e g signal x j t from sensor j including signal filtering and calculation of the filtered signal standard deviation σ ˆ j 3 calculate the standard deviations of the possible responses σ r j based on the candidate raos from the rao database r 1 2 r represents the r t h combination of variables in the rao database i e φ i 1 φ i 2 φ i m φ i m where φ i m the i m t h discrete value for the vessel parameter φ m and m 1 2 m r is the total number of possible combinations of uncertain vessel parameters 4 screen out less significant sensors 5 calculate the weight matrix w j for the considered whole range of uncertain vessel parameters if sensor j passes the above screening phase 6 normalize w j and interpolate the weight matrix w j from the size i 1 i 2 i m variable resolution in the rao database to the size k 1 k 2 k m variable resolution in the discrete probability distribution model 7 update the joint probability distribution p 1 φ 1 φ 2 φ m 8 repeat the previous steps and continuously update the variable distribution p 2 φ 1 φ m p n φ 1 φ m all steps are explained in the following subsections the detailed parameter explanations can be found in nomenclature 2 1 initialization of joint probability distribution the probabilistic model of the m uncertain vessel parameters can be initialized as independent gaussian distributions with presumed mean μ m and variance σ m 2 for each variable based on prior knowledge on the vessel 2 φ m g a u s s i a n μ m σ m 2 the variance of each variable depends on vessel geometry loading condition engineering judgement and etc it is further assumed that the possible values of the variable φ m are within the range of μ m 3 σ m in the joint probability distribution model each variable was discretized into k m number of values a multivariate probabilistic model with m uncertain variables can be expressed by a discrete joint probability distribution p φ 1 φ 2 φ m the probability density function of one possible combination of φ 1 φ 2 φ m is expressed by p d f φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m which is established by 3 p d f φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m m 1 m p d f φ k m the probability for this combination can then be calculated by 4 p φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m p d f φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m m 1 m δ φ m where δ φ m means the interval of values for the variable φ m unrealistic values such as negative values for damping were removed in the initialization step for probabilistic modelling in addition normalization of the probability distribution was done through every tuning step this was to ensure that the cumulative probability sums to 1 0 2 2 signal processing sensitivity analysis with respect to signal lowpass filtering demonstrated that it is essential to filter out noise before the probability updating process the fast fourier transform fft lowpass filtering approach was applied with 1 0 hz as the cutoff frequency f l p for the base case in the case studies the filtered signal for sensor j is denoted as x ˆ j t after filtering the signal standard deviation can be calculated by means of the unbiased sample standard deviation 5a σ ˆ j t 1 n t x ˆ j t x j 2 n t 1 5b x j t 1 n t x ˆ j t n t where x ˆ j t is the filtered vessel response time series from sensor j for the time step t and n t is the number of time steps the original noisy sensor signal x j t in time domain or x j ω in frequency domain can be measurement of the vessel displacement velocity or acceleration for any degree of freedom dof 2 3 calculation of possible response spectra based on candidate raos for a certain sensor numbered as j within the known ranges of the uncertain vessel hydrodynamic parameters the corresponding possible response spectra can be calculated by 6 s r x j x j ω h r x j ζ ω β w 2 s ζ ζ ω β w where s means single sided power spectrum h r x j ζ ω β w represents the linear transfer function i e rao between the interesting vessel response x j ω at the sensor j and wave elevation ζ ω β w for the r t h combination of variables in the rao database r 1 2 r and 7 r m m 1 i m where i m is the number of discrete values for variable φ m in the rao database then the possible response standard deviation for the r t h combination can be calculated by 8 σ r j n 1 n ω s r x j x j ω n δ ω where n ω is the total number of discretized frequencies for the response spectrum 2 4 screening of sensors if the variation of the considered parameters influences the sensor j measurements very little all calculated σ r j values will be very close then this sensor should be considered as valueless based on the following arguments 1 the other uncertainties from e g simplification of vessel hydrodynamics measurement noise discretization of signals and power spectra and wave hindcast will be much more significant than the present parameter variations under such condition updating parameters becomes unreasonable 2 for the weight calculation to be described in section 2 5 if σ r j σ ˆ j 0 the weight w r j could be very large a small amount of noise or other uncertainties may result in a significantly biased weight matrix therefore it is important to identify and ignore valueless sensors for each sea state before updating the joint probability distribution of the uncertain vessel parameters consequently a new parameter α j is introduced named ssr sensor screening ratio which is defined by 9a α j σ σ r j σ ˆ j 9b σ σ r j r 1 r σ r j σ j 2 r 1 9c σ j r 1 r σ r j r where σ σ r j is the standard deviation of σ r j r 1 2 r the base case studies used a screening criterion of α j 0 05 for a certain sensor j if α j 0 05 then the sensor j will be excluded when updating the parameters selection of the α j value may depend on the quantity and location of the sensor the sea state and the selected vessel parameters to be modified 2 5 weight calculation the distance between σ r j and σ ˆ j represents how much the r t h combination of the parameters can be believed in based on the received measurements at sensor j the weight factor can be calculated by inverse distance weighting introduced by shepard 1968 normalization is applied to the weight matrix before updating the joint probability distribution of parameters 10 w r j 1 σ r j σ ˆ j p where p 0 is called the power parameter and is a normalization operator 2 6 discrete bayesian updating classical discrete bayes theorem may be simply expressed as 11 p u v p u p v u p v where u and v are events p u v is the likelihood of event u occurring given that v is true while p v u is the likelihood of event v occurring given that u is true for the tuning of vessel hydrodynamic parameters u can be considered as those uncertain parameters while v corresponds to the received sensor signals however the bayesian inference may not seem so simple as shown in equation 11 due to the practical difficulties of estimating p v u and p v inspired by labbe 2018 the bayesian updating applied for model tuning could also be understood as 12 p o s t e r i o r p r i o r l i k e l i h o o d n o r m a l i z a t i o n where l i k e l i h o o d means the possibility of getting such measurement e g sensor j result for the particular combination e g r of uncertain vessel parameters which can be reasonably represented by the weight factor w r j this is the key to updating our belief to the prior knowledge after receiving the sensor data with equation 10 w r j is calculated based on the discrete vessel parameter values used in the rao database for one sensor j the size of the calculated weight matrix w j for m variables by equation 10 is i 1 i 2 i m however the joint probability distribution of variables uses much more discrete values than was used to build rao database in order to update the joint distribution of variables the weight matrix needs to be interpolated to the size of k 1 k 2 k m multi dimensional linear interpolation was performed by means of the python xarray package hoyer and hamman 2017 discrete bayesian updating could easily apply to nonlinear systems such as the described hydrodynamic parameter tuning challenge due to the nonlinearity the updated probability distribution will have no closed form mathematical description after the first update and the updated probability distribution will no longer be gaussian the n t h updating for the r t h combination of uncertain vessel parameters based on the valuable sensor j data can then be formulated as 13 p d f n φ k 1 φ k m p d f n 1 φ k 1 φ k m w r j 3 case study basis 3 1 numerical vessel model the case study was based on an offshore supply vessel osv hydrodynamic seakeeping model the primary vessel dimensions are summarized in table 1 the coordinates refer to the reference coordinate system moving steadily at the vessel forward speed as illustrated in fig 2 the positive x axis points from stern to bow x 0 aft the z axis is pointing vertically upward from keel z 0 at keel and the y axis is normal to the x z plane where y 0 is at the longitudinal symmetric plane the wave direction β w follows the same coordinate system i e waves at 0 heading propagates along the positive x axis table 2 summarizes the location and id of the virtual sensors considered in the paper the sensor locations are illustrated in fig 2 practically the vessel heave response could dominate the operation limit and hence it is usually of interest to monitor the heave response earlier parametric sensitivity study han et al 2020 suggests that measuring different quantities of vessel response i e displacement velocity and acceleration at different locations onboard can help identifying the right uncertain parameter to tune therefore the rao database contains the heave response displacement velocity and acceleration at three different locations see fig 2 rigid body motion transformation was assumed in the study 3 2 rao database a rao database was established based on the ballast condition as the base case wasim dnv gl 2018 was used for hydrodynamic analysis to create the rao database being a computer program in the dnv gl sesam family wasim is a 3d time domain hydrodynamic analysis software based on the rankine panel method kring 1994 wasim analyses were run through all wave periods for each combination of the studied parameters in the time domain the outputs were transferred to the frequency domain so as to build the frequency dependent database of hydrodynamic coefficients and thereafter calculate the vessel raos by 14 r a o ω u β w f ω u β w ω e 2 a ω e m 0 i ω e β ω e c where ω is the wave frequency u is the vessel advancing speed and β w is the wave heading as illustrated in fig 2 f ω u β w is the complex valued wave induced excitation force and ω e is the encounter frequency a m 0 β and c are the added mass matrix inertia matrix damping matrix and restoring stiffness matrix of the vessel respectively only heave raos corresponding to the sensors described in table 2 were included in the rao database as summarized in table 3 variation of 5 parameters were considered for the rao database with the described number of discrete values for each parameter selection of parameters was based on sensitivity studies of hydrodynamic parameters that influence the vessel motions of interest some key findings on the parametric sensitivity study han et al 2020 are 1 gmt and additional roll damping β 44 both have a strong influence on the roll motion response 2 parameters related to the inertia distribution such as xcg ycg zcg mass and r 55 have a strong influence on the vessel heave motion at different locations onboard among which xcg and r 55 are the most important parameters 3 ycg only has significant influence on the vessel roll motion and its coupled motions the ranges represent prior knowledge and the corresponding uncertainties for the parameters zero vessel speed was considered in order to avoid dealing with the 3 to 1 mapping problem between wave frequency and encounter frequency for following waves nielsen 2017 in total 13 wave headings between 0 and 180 with 15 interval were included therefore each sensor in table 2 has hundreds of thousands heave raos prepared 3 3 wave spectrum ocean waves are usually short crested in reality in addition a sea state may contain both wind sea and swells coming from totally different main directions with significantly distinct peak periods precise knowledge on the wave condition was assumed for the studied cases i e uncertainties from wave hindcast forecast were not considered for simplicity the long crested pierson moskowitz pm spectrum s p m ω was used dnvgl rp c205 2017 15 s p m ω 5 16 h s 2 ω p 2 ω 5 e x p 5 4 ω ω p 4 where h s is the significant wave height and ω p is the sea state peak frequency 3 4 sensor signal simulation virtual sensor signals were numerically simulated for the case studies for each of the 9 virtual sensors described in table 2 the signals were generated according to the procedure illustrated in fig 3 firstly with known wave spectrum s ζ ζ ω β w and the true rao values for sensor j the response spectrum can be calculated by 16 s x j x j ω h x j ζ ω β w 2 s ζ ζ ω β w where h x j ζ ω β w represents the true rao for vessel response x j ω then the signal of 3 hour response time series with time step of 0 1s was generated by 17a x j t n 1 n ω c n ω n cos ω n t ϕ n 17b c n ω n 2 s x j x j ω n δ ω where ϕ n 0 2 π is a random phase angle which is continuous and uniformly distributed δ ω is the width of the radial frequency interval of ω n and n ω is the total number of the discrete frequencies for the response spectrum deterministic amplitudes were applied according to equation 17b this means that theoretically all possible realizations will return exactly the same response power spectrum when δ ω 0 sensor signal noises were included gaussian distributed white noise was assumed with mean value μ n 0 and a specified covariance σ n 2 the noise was added to each time step of the time series independently according to the specified signal to noise ratio snr defined by 18 s n r σ x 2 σ n 2 where σ x 2 is the variance of the true response time series however note that in reality the sensor noise may be biased and non gaussian distributed labbe 2018 practically the velocity can be calculated by integration of acceleration time series while the displacement can be calculated by another integration over the velocity time series the noise associated with displacement velocity and acceleration signals are therefore correlated however this correlation is currently not considered the noises of acceleration velocity and displacement time series were added independently 4 case study results case studies were conducted to test the proposed methodology for illustration purposes each case only includes two parameters to tune the sea states in table 4 were applied the key parameters used in the tuning process are summarized in table 5 4 1 gmt and β 44 the first case study considered gmt and β 44 as the uncertain vessel hydrodynamic parameters the other three parameters i e xcg mass and r 55 were set as deterministic the prior knowledge and the true values of gmt and β 44 are summarized in table 6 the calculated weight matrix illustrated in fig 4 indicates that the considered parameters gmt and β 44 are sensitive to the disp b sensor for the ss1 sea state it is obvious that gmt and β 44 influence the roll motion very much and ss1 is a beam sea condition with the peak period approximately near the heave rao peak amplitude period for the location b on the other hand fig 5 illustrates a confusing weight matrix the weight factor is spreading over a large variable range because the sea state ss4 is with t z 4 0 s t p 5 6 s there was barely no significant vessel response around that small response period due to the lowpass filtering nature of the vessel this means that gmt and β 44 do not have significant influence on the raos and vessel motion for the given sea state ss4 the variance of gmt and β 44 were increased after tuning based on ss4 as shown in table 7 meaning that the tuning system got confused by the sensor data for ss4 both parameters do not influence the heave motion at the cog and therefore the measurements at the location a near the cog were screened out for all tuning steps fig 6 illustrates the tuning results based on response measurements from each sea state ss1 and ss5 played important roles with respect to the successful tuning while ss4 attempted to degrade the tuning results it is noted that sensor data from ss1 over tuned the probability distribution of gmt due to signal noises this problem is discussed in detail in section 5 4 and section 5 5 4 2 xcg and mass the same sea states defined in table 4 were applied for tuning the xcg and the mass however with a different vessel condition the prior knowledge and the true values of xcg and mass are summarized in table 8 the results in fig 7 and table 10 show that ss3 and ss4 significantly contributed to the tuning of xcg in the correct direction both sea states are oblique waves with small wave periods where the hydrodynamic parametric sensitivity studies han et al 2020 showed that the vessel heave motion are sensitive to xcg as illustrated in fig 7 the joint probability distribution was not updated from ss5 meaning that all sensor measurements from ss5 were screened out in other words xcg and mass have negligible effects to the considered vessel response at ss5 the weight matrix examples shown in fig 8 indicate the system confusion all the 4 sensor measurements successfully gave high weight to the correct xcg value but failed with respect to tuning vessel mass the measurements from sensor acc b gave approximately the same weight factor through the whole range of mass values measurements from disp c and vel b sensors gave almost the opposite weighting distribution along mass values the parametric sensitivity study han et al 2020 showed that vessel mass influences the heave velocity mostly at small response periods for head and following sea conditions at the given uncertainty ranges the mass variation is less important with respect to the vessel response compared with xcg therefore it is not very surprising that the measurements from the selected sea states failed to tune the vessel mass due to 1 its less sensitivity for the considered sea states 2 the nonlinear nature of the vessel response to the hydrodynamic parameters 3 the measurement noise and uncertainties by e g seed variation therefore measurements from one more sea state ss6 in table 9 were provided ss6 was expected to be relatively sensitive with respect to the mass coefficient fig 9 shows a dramatic shift of the peak of the joint distribution to a lower mass value 5 parametric sensitivity study the case study of tuning gmt and β 44 presented in section 4 1 was chosen as the base case for the sensitivity study of some key parameters in the tuning algorithm 5 1 power parameter p p 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 were chosen as the sensitivity study cases the tuning results are summarized in table 11 as shown in fig 10 large p leads to very large weight factor which could be risky especially when σ r j σ ˆ j 0 therefore large p may lead to quick and abrupt change of the joint probability distribution of parameters as illustrated in fig 11 larger p value leads to less memory of the tuning results from the previous sea states this may not be practically reasonable especially for a stationary vessel situation due to the existing uncertainties the vessel loading condition could be considered as stationary for a relatively long time e g in terms of days if the focus is only to tune the sea state dependent parameters e g β 44 larger p value might be preferable but cautions are required to use large p for tuning multiple parameters at the same time 5 2 snr it is interesting to test the performance of the proposed tuning approach with respect to the signal noise level the sensitivity analysis on snr therefore also serves a purpose of validating the methodology the lowpass filter method does not require to know the noise level explicitly results in table 12 show that the methodology is quite stable with respect to dealing with signal noises the tuning results in terms of mean and variance of the parameters are close for all snr values varying from 10 to 10 000 5 3 seed variation the seeds for generating vessel response sensor signals had been selected for all previous studies ensuring exactly the same signals for tuning result comparison the importance of seed variation with respect to the tuned results was investigated seeds were randomly generated for the same 5 sea states in total 10 sets of randomly generated seeds were used for the 5 sea states corresponding to 10 tuning results named as from case1 to case10 as shown in fig 12 the tuning results of β 44 were very stable in terms of its expected value and variance this is due to very sensitive and monotonic influences from β 44 to vessel response i e rao the additional roll damping only influences the rao amplitude but not the rao peak period fig 12 shows that seed variation could significantly influence the tuning results for the parameters which are not very sensitive to the vessel response at those sea states e g gmt as variation in tuned gmt was observed this is because 1 vessel response rao is less sensitive to gmt 2 the correlation between gmt and vessel rao is complex gmt shifts the rao amplitude peak period and changes the amplitude magnitude as gmt determines the restoring stiffness for roll response it is also noted that the variance of gmt did not reduce significantly through tuning based on measurements from the selected sea states 5 4 lowpass filtering cutoff frequency considering noise the signal variance is equal to 19 σ s i g n a l 2 σ x 2 σ n 2 where σ x 2 and σ n 2 are the variance of the true response time series and the signal noise respectively theoretically without processing signal noise the variance of the signal will always be larger than the true response variance potentially leading to biased tuning results therefore the noise should be removed as much as possible the noise power cannot be known exactly by nature section 5 2 demonstrated the robustness of applying a lowpass filter to deal with noise a sensitivity study with respect to the cutoff frequency was carried out the results are summarized in table 13 for tuning gmt and β 44 and table 14 for tuning xcg and mass both tables 13 and 14 show that f l p 0 2 hz almost always gave the best tuned results in terms of being closer to the true values and with less variance exceptions were observed for the variance of the tuned vessel mass in table 14 the mass variance σ m a s s 2 after tuning was larger than the initiated variance for all seed variations indicating the system confusion mentioned in section 4 2 due to the less sensitivity of mass on the vessel response for the considered sea states deep investigation of intermediate results indicated that the noise variance filtered out was actually always less than the true noise variance for the base case i e f l p 1 0 hz consequently the variances of the filtered signal time series were all biased to a higher value than the true response this led to biased tuning results 5 5 sensor screening ratio α the selection of α depends on the uncertainty ranges of the considered parameters and the uncertainties from input such as waves and response measurements for a given uncertainty range of parameters larger α leads to model tuning with less valuable sensor data which may slow down the convergence speed smaller α helps to tune the model with more sensor data but on the other hand may lead to wrong results because the noise cannot be always perfectly treated table 15 shows how the tuned results vary with α it is clear that when α is reduced more sensors which are less influenced by the considered uncertain vessel hydrodynamic parameters are included due to noise the filtered signal variance deviates from the true response variance if the noise was not appropriately filtered those less important sensors generally would accelerate the tuning to a deviated value therefore it is important to ensure a good selection of f l p value or acquire some additional knowledge on the noise and uncertainties based on section 5 4 f l p 0 2 hz suits better for the case study therefore a sensitivity of α with respect to the lowpass filter cutoff frequency of 0 2 hz was also studied as shown in table 16 with better handling of noise more sensors were used with smaller α generally leading to better model tuning results therefore a trade off between α and f l p should be considered for practical purposes due to the existence of uncertainties and limitations of noise filtering 6 validation and robustness so far only two 2 dimensional model tuning cases have been studied for 5 sea states in order to validate the proposed tuning approach more extensive hydrodynamic model tuning analyses were carried out for one selected true vessel condition sensor signals were simulated for 6 sea states the duration for each sea state was 1 hour parameters defining the sea states i e h s t z β w and seed were randomly selected within the range described in table 17 gmt r 55 xcg and β 44 were selected for model tuning the reason to exclude mass coefficient was because the results from section 4 2 indicate that the vessel mass does not have a significant influence within its considered uncertainty range the validation analyses included 120 tuning results all 4 parameters were tuned simultaneously tuning 4 parameters at the same time became slower compared with the previous cases of tuning 2 parameters therefore the power parameter p was increased to 0 4 the joint probability distribution of the parameters was initiated as shown in table 18 the key parameters needed for sensor signal generation and the tuning methodology are summarized in table 17 due to limited computational processing capacity of the available laptop cpu intel r tm i7 8650u 1 90 ghz 32 gb memory a limited number of discretized values had to be applied for each parameter to tune 4 parameters the acceptable total number of discrete combinations was below 1 3e 07 this might be due to the large memory demands from python numpy operations during 4 dimensional interpolation of the calculated weight matrices described in section 2 6 the computational capacity can be increased by optimizing the codes changing the data structure or simply increase the computer memory capacity table 18 describes the applied number of discrete parameter values for the joint probability distribution the resolution for the uncertain parameters is considered sufficient with respect to the studied parameter ranges for tuning a 4 dimensional model with the considered uncertain range and resolution the computational time for each sea state was about 90 s for the 2 dimensional tuning model with 100 100 resolution for the probability distribution the computational time for each sea state was about 10 s from figs 13 and 14 it is clear that the proposed tuning procedure succeeds to tune β 44 and xcg in most cases however a large variation of tuning results for gmt and r 55 were also experienced this is consistent with the findings from the earlier hydrodynamic parametric sensitivity studies han et al 2020 showing that the vessel rao is much less sensitive to gmt and r 55 compared to β 44 and xcg for illustration purposes each figure only contains information on 2 parameters similar to all other experiment or test calibration methodologies e g machine learning algorithms hydrodynamic coefficients fitted based on laboratory tests relevant and valuable cases sea states are required in order to tune the parameters but different from the complex ai algorithms like neural networks the physics based model tuning is better at extrapolation from the available data and does not require a huge amount of data samples this is particularly important for nonlinear problems extrapolation here means good vessel response predictions for outlier sea states the process for tuning hydrodynamic parameters still requires that the available rao database covers the entire range of hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties the validation analyses were limited to only 6 sea states for each tuning therefore failure of model tuning is by nature possible for example one out of the 120 tuning simulations failed to report good enough additional roll damping highlighted in fig 13 a deep investigation showed that all the generated sensor signals were basically from head and following sea states where β 44 played a negligible role and none of the sea states were near the roll resonance period figs 15 and 16 illustrate how the variance changes after tuning analyses show that the variable variance significantly reduces after tuning especially for the important parameters i e β 44 and xcg as expected note that the y axis of fig 15 is log scaled the expected mean and variance of the parameters are summarized in table 19 the tuning methodology succeeds to modify the parameters such that they approach the true values with significantly increased confidence therefore the validation analyses demonstrated the robustness and stability of the proposed tuning methodology 7 conclusions and future work a procedure with great potential for practical implementation with respect to tuning of vessel hydrodynamic seakeeping model parameters based on onboard vessel motion measurements has been proposed similar to model calibration based on laboratory tests hydrodynamic coefficients can be modified based on available data by the tuning approach therefore the improved vessel motion prediction is supported by physics and common engineering practice but different from model calibration by laboratory tests more uncertainties are in reality observed onboard therefore it is more natural to present the important hydrodynamic parameters and raos in a probabilistic way the proposed tuning approach combines engineering practice with the random nature quantitatively improving the knowledge on the vessel conditions and response hence the reliability of the vessel motion rao and motion prediction can be documented quantitatively as well therefore some of the safety factors in engineering practice related to marine operation design e g dnvgl st n001 2016 may be reduced and reliability based marine operations may be possible consequently the approach could potentially help to reduce the operational cost and increase safety the tuning process is fast and suitable for onboard application which could improve the quality of digital twins and assist within the context of onboard decision support analyses demonstrate that the tuning approach is robust and stable to deal with noise better tuning results were observed for the parameters which have stronger influence on the measured vessel response the tuning algorithm also showed reasonable behaviour when updating the hydrodynamic parameters for cases where the sea states or the measurements were not very relevant for those uncertain parameters key parameters of the tuning methodology were also studied by sensitivity analyses relatively large values of the power parameter p led to higher belief in sensor data and hence less memory to the prior knowledge it was found important to select the cutoff frequency f l p of the lowpass filter in a proper way for an unbiased tuning result practically a trade off between α and f l p should be considered to optimally use the available measurement data inspired by godhaven 1998 the lowpass filter cutoff frequency f l p could be preferably modelled as sea state dependent automatically selected based on measurements and environment information the tuning methodology was also validated by using virtual sensor signals from randomly selected sea states by tuning 4 parameters simultaneously even though a considerable amount of analyses were carried out for validation more work is still required for methodology verification only one vessel condition was studied in section 6 more vessel conditions and broader ranges of hydrodynamic parameters should be studied more importantly scaled experimental data and on site full scale data should be used to verify the tuning methodology the presented case studies of tuning vessel parameters fig 1 and virtual sensor signal simulation fig 3 apply the raos from the same rao database which are generated based on seakeeping analyses by wasim software however the real on site vessel motion measurements will fully reflect the reality while the established rao database to be used for vessel model tuning will be potentially subject to bias introduced by the simplifications made in the applied seakeeping software and the vessel numerical model this software introduced bias should also be investigated in the future research work practically if the rao database can be extended to various vessel advancing speeds with sufficient speed resolution much more on site measurements can be used to tune the important vessel parameters consequently the cutoff frequency will therefore depend on vessel speed so far the additional roll damping β 44 was considered only operational condition dependent which assumes a constant value throughout all sea states for the current vessel loading condition some parameters are sea state dependent e g roll damping some other parameters are operational condition dependent such as inertia distribution while others could be permanent e g vessel geometry each parameter should be categorized accordingly and different model tuning strategy might be considered for each category so far only uncertainties from sensor noise were considered in reality the uncertainties from wave information are significant such as directional spreading wave spectral shape and uncertainties from wave forecast and hindcast modelling other environmental loads have not been considered such as wind and current leaving the procedure with a considerable gap towards on site practice practically these challenges can be solved by modifying the signal filter and by also including a highpass filter in addition rigid body motion was assumed when calculating heave rao functions at different locations in reality for large slender vessels more advanced models might therefore be required due to the increasing importance of hydroelastic effects credit authorship

21175,vessel and wave hydrodynamics are fundamental for vessel motion prediction improving hydrodynamic model accuracy without compromising computational efficiency has always been of high interest for safe and cost effective marine operations with continuous development of sensor technology and computational capacity an improved digital twin concept for vessel motion prediction can be realized based on an onboard online adaptive hydrodynamic model this article proposes and demonstrates a practical approach for tuning of important vessel hydrodynamic model parameters based on simulated onboard sensor data of vessel motion response the algorithm relies fundamentally on spectral analysis probabilistic modelling and the discrete bayesian updating formula all case studies show promising and reasonable tuning results sensitivities of the approach with respect to its key parameters were also studied sensor noise has been considered the algorithm is found to be computationally efficient robust and stable when tuning the values of hydrodynamic parameters and updating their uncertainties within reasonable sensor noise levels keywords tuning of seakeeping model wave induced vessel responses sensor signal processing discrete bayesian updating inverse distance weighting sensitivity studies validation analysis 1 introduction the energy sector is experiencing rapid change with a fast growth in offshore wind and solar farms an increased number of subsea installations to provide tie backs to existing oil and gas facilities as well as a continuous drive towards exploration of natural resources in deeper and colder ocean areas these trends lead to more challenging marine operations facing heavier offshore lifts more complex operation systems and severe operational environments hence the economic incentives for obtaining broader operational weather windows by reducing the inherent uncertainties of marine operations increase as of today engineering practice considers uncertainties conservatively and marine operations are designed and simulated according to rules e g dnvgl st n001 2016 before they are executed uncertainty reduction in vessel seakeeping analysis has been focused on by both industry and research institutions for decades knowledge on modelling of wave and vessel hydrodynamics has been rather well developed with respect to engineering practice faltinsen 1990 dnvgl rp c205 2017 in principle one can design the marine operation by application of the most computational demanding and accurate hydrodynamic models e g by including nonlinear wave kinematics yue et al 2008 nouguier et al 2014 and vessel hydrodynamics cao et al 2010 larsen et al 2019 himeno 1981 faltinsen 2015 and even by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd kim 2011 however the on site uncertainties related to wave and vessel condition may reduce the value of engineering efforts during the design phase instead of applying very high fidelity models in the operation design phase to increase the accuracy e g by using nonlinear or cfd programs a lot of efforts have been made on increasing the knowledge of the on site wave forecast and real time vessel operational condition with the development in sensor technology and computational process capacity during the last two decades many research oriented onboard decision support systems odss for marine and offshore activities have been developed aiming at improving vessel motion predictions examples are 1 seasense system nielsen et al 2006 2 cash system clauss et al 2012 3 owme project onboard wave

connell et al 2015 kusters et al 2016 alford et al 2015 on site full scale tests have been performed for validation of the different proposed methods naaijen et al 2016 2018 connell et al 2015 alford et al 2015 challenges on roll motion prediction based on the vessel being modelled as a linear transfer function known as response amplitude operator rao have been reported in all the relevant tests a successful wave induced vessel motion prediction requires two sources i e a sufficiently accurate wave forecast and a numerical vessel model which describes the relationship between wave and vessel motion for the current operational condition most developed odss s focus on improving wave prediction either by wave radar systems or by the ship as a wave buoy analogy those approaches are all influenced by the vessel motion the wave radar approaches could possibly predict the encounter waves a few minutes ahead based on a linear wave propagation model and hence a vessel response envelope can be well estimated however the predicted time series of the encounter waves at the vessel position will not be accurate enough on the other hand nonlinear wave propagation models could better forecast the encounter waves at the vessel position but the computational time is a challenge for real time application alford et al 2015 grilli et al 2011 the ship as a wave buoy analogy estimating waves in the form of wave spectrum requires good prior knowledge on vessel conditions nielsen 2006 brodtkorb et al 2018a nielsen et al 2019 ren et al 2021 nielsen 2007 and tannuri et al 2003 demonstrated the influence of vessel condition uncertainty on the sea state estimation most sea state estimation approaches presume stationary environmental and vessel conditions iseki 2009 and brodtkorb et al 2018b investigated the influence of using non stationary ship motion data on sea state estimation in addition with developed information technology numerical weather prediction nwp can be improved with increased spatial and temporal resolution instead of only reporting the wave forecast in terms of significant wave height h s peak period t p and direction β w a full 2d wave spectral description now can be provided by several weather forecasters e g galvin 2014 this may also help reducing uncertainties of vessel motion prediction simplifications in vessel seakeeping models have to be made in order to design the odss s for real time purposes most odss s use linear transfer functions i e raos between wave and vessel response application of vessel motion raos has proven to be reliable computationally cheap and practically accurate for moderate seas some advanced programs use retardation functions based on the hydrodynamic coefficient database to predict real time motion in the time domain e g milewski et al 2015 the interest of using machine learning for vessel motion analysis has increased in recent years e g cheng et al 2019 de masi et al 2011 nielsen et al 2018 pure data driven and so called physical based data driven machine learning methods are hot research topics within several disciplines related to digitalization the artificial intelligence ai models trained by available data are however very sensitive to the provided historical data for nonlinear systems the ai models may therefore fail if the training data set is insufficient with respect to describing the nonlinearity for vessels with frequently changing loading conditions it may be challenging to obtain sufficient training data and to generalize ai approaches have also faced difficulties of being accepted by energy and maritime industries due to lack of physics reasoning and documented reliability traditionally hydrodynamic coefficients are calibrated to scale experiments van daalen et al 2014 for predefined vessel loading conditions where the uncertainties from vessel inertia distribution and viscous roll damping could be significant the situation onboard may be different from the designed or simulated conditions e g due to the vessel having a different load condition than that originally assumed consequently the presumed raos may not be appropriate to apply for onboard vessel motion prediction however improving the accuracy of raos based on vessel motion and wave information e g h s t p β w and directional spreading is practically very challenging normally vessel motion e g heave motion η 33 can be estimated faltinsen 1990 by 1 η 33 ω β w ζ ω β w h 33 ω β w where η 33 ω is the heave motion at frequency ω ζ ω β w is the wave elevation at frequency ω along the direction β w and h 33 ω β w is the corresponding heave motion rao calculating the rao h 33 ω β w represents the inverted problem of vessel motion estimation there is typically no unique solution for such inversion problems because h 33 ω β w is direction dependent while η 33 ω carries no such information alford et al 2014 tried to solve the inversion problem using singular value decomposition svd technique to solve the ill conditioned equation h y x ω s y x ω s x x ω as a consequence the directional dependency characteristics of the true transfer function will be sacrificed making it questionable whether the calculated transfer function can be applied to a new sea state instead this paper tries to improve the rao accuracy by modifying the important parameters in vessel seakeeping model based on wave information and vessel motion measurements based upon an updated hydrodynamic model the rao can be recalculated and possibly applied to other sea states potentially increasing the accuracy of seakeeping prediction and the safety of marine operations however there are some challenges 1 it is a multi dimensional problem there could be hundreds of parameters subject to uncertainty 2 it is a multi modal problem many combinations of parameters can possibly fit perfectly with the measurement data e g in terms of response power spectrum but those combinations may be far away from each other 3 it is a nonlinear problem with respect to the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters and the resulting vessel motion rao in this paper a probabilistic approach of vessel hydrodynamic parameter tuning based on onboard motion measurements is proposed where the adaptive model will both update the parameter values and their confidence quantitatively this is an important step towards reliability based marine operations and reducing inherent conservatism the adaptive model can be continuously applied throughout the whole lifetime of the vessel assisting in monitoring inspection management life extension etc in accordance with the digital twin concept the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the proposed model tuning algorithm then the algorithm is demonstrated by case studies of a selected vessel model the inputs and basis of the case studies are described in section 3 results of two studied cases are described in section 4 results of sensitivity analyses for key parameters in the proposed method are reported in section 5 the proposed tuning methodology is validated by extensively simulated tuning analyses in section 6 conclusions and future work are then summarized in section 7 2 model tuning procedure assume that there are m uncertain vessel parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ m and there are j sensors measuring interesting vessel motions e g displacement velocity and acceleration of heave and roll at different locations onboard based on the prior knowledge on the uncertain vessel parameters and available vessel sensors j 1 2 j a rao database covering all possible vessel conditions for all sensors should be available for the tuning process the procedure for tuning of vessel parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ m based on measurements from onboard sensors at a specific sea state can be divided into the following steps as illustrated in fig 1 1 initialize the discrete joint probability distribution p 0 φ 1 φ 2 φ m based on prior knowledge on the vessel condition 2 process the sensor measurements e g signal x j t from sensor j including signal filtering and calculation of the filtered signal standard deviation σ ˆ j 3 calculate the standard deviations of the possible responses σ r j based on the candidate raos from the rao database r 1 2 r represents the r t h combination of variables in the rao database i e φ i 1 φ i 2 φ i m φ i m where φ i m the i m t h discrete value for the vessel parameter φ m and m 1 2 m r is the total number of possible combinations of uncertain vessel parameters 4 screen out less significant sensors 5 calculate the weight matrix w j for the considered whole range of uncertain vessel parameters if sensor j passes the above screening phase 6 normalize w j and interpolate the weight matrix w j from the size i 1 i 2 i m variable resolution in the rao database to the size k 1 k 2 k m variable resolution in the discrete probability distribution model 7 update the joint probability distribution p 1 φ 1 φ 2 φ m 8 repeat the previous steps and continuously update the variable distribution p 2 φ 1 φ m p n φ 1 φ m all steps are explained in the following subsections the detailed parameter explanations can be found in nomenclature 2 1 initialization of joint probability distribution the probabilistic model of the m uncertain vessel parameters can be initialized as independent gaussian distributions with presumed mean μ m and variance σ m 2 for each variable based on prior knowledge on the vessel 2 φ m g a u s s i a n μ m σ m 2 the variance of each variable depends on vessel geometry loading condition engineering judgement and etc it is further assumed that the possible values of the variable φ m are within the range of μ m 3 σ m in the joint probability distribution model each variable was discretized into k m number of values a multivariate probabilistic model with m uncertain variables can be expressed by a discrete joint probability distribution p φ 1 φ 2 φ m the probability density function of one possible combination of φ 1 φ 2 φ m is expressed by p d f φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m which is established by 3 p d f φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m m 1 m p d f φ k m the probability for this combination can then be calculated by 4 p φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m p d f φ k 1 φ k 2 φ k m m 1 m δ φ m where δ φ m means the interval of values for the variable φ m unrealistic values such as negative values for damping were removed in the initialization step for probabilistic modelling in addition normalization of the probability distribution was done through every tuning step this was to ensure that the cumulative probability sums to 1 0 2 2 signal processing sensitivity analysis with respect to signal lowpass filtering demonstrated that it is essential to filter out noise before the probability updating process the fast fourier transform fft lowpass filtering approach was applied with 1 0 hz as the cutoff frequency f l p for the base case in the case studies the filtered signal for sensor j is denoted as x ˆ j t after filtering the signal standard deviation can be calculated by means of the unbiased sample standard deviation 5a σ ˆ j t 1 n t x ˆ j t x j 2 n t 1 5b x j t 1 n t x ˆ j t n t where x ˆ j t is the filtered vessel response time series from sensor j for the time step t and n t is the number of time steps the original noisy sensor signal x j t in time domain or x j ω in frequency domain can be measurement of the vessel displacement velocity or acceleration for any degree of freedom dof 2 3 calculation of possible response spectra based on candidate raos for a certain sensor numbered as j within the known ranges of the uncertain vessel hydrodynamic parameters the corresponding possible response spectra can be calculated by 6 s r x j x j ω h r x j ζ ω β w 2 s ζ ζ ω β w where s means single sided power spectrum h r x j ζ ω β w represents the linear transfer function i e rao between the interesting vessel response x j ω at the sensor j and wave elevation ζ ω β w for the r t h combination of variables in the rao database r 1 2 r and 7 r m m 1 i m where i m is the number of discrete values for variable φ m in the rao database then the possible response standard deviation for the r t h combination can be calculated by 8 σ r j n 1 n ω s r x j x j ω n δ ω where n ω is the total number of discretized frequencies for the response spectrum 2 4 screening of sensors if the variation of the considered parameters influences the sensor j measurements very little all calculated σ r j values will be very close then this sensor should be considered as valueless based on the following arguments 1 the other uncertainties from e g simplification of vessel hydrodynamics measurement noise discretization of signals and power spectra and wave hindcast will be much more significant than the present parameter variations under such condition updating parameters becomes unreasonable 2 for the weight calculation to be described in section 2 5 if σ r j σ ˆ j 0 the weight w r j could be very large a small amount of noise or other uncertainties may result in a significantly biased weight matrix therefore it is important to identify and ignore valueless sensors for each sea state before updating the joint probability distribution of the uncertain vessel parameters consequently a new parameter α j is introduced named ssr sensor screening ratio which is defined by 9a α j σ σ r j σ ˆ j 9b σ σ r j r 1 r σ r j σ j 2 r 1 9c σ j r 1 r σ r j r where σ σ r j is the standard deviation of σ r j r 1 2 r the base case studies used a screening criterion of α j 0 05 for a certain sensor j if α j 0 05 then the sensor j will be excluded when updating the parameters selection of the α j value may depend on the quantity and location of the sensor the sea state and the selected vessel parameters to be modified 2 5 weight calculation the distance between σ r j and σ ˆ j represents how much the r t h combination of the parameters can be believed in based on the received measurements at sensor j the weight factor can be calculated by inverse distance weighting introduced by shepard 1968 normalization is applied to the weight matrix before updating the joint probability distribution of parameters 10 w r j 1 σ r j σ ˆ j p where p 0 is called the power parameter and is a normalization operator 2 6 discrete bayesian updating classical discrete bayes theorem may be simply expressed as 11 p u v p u p v u p v where u and v are events p u v is the likelihood of event u occurring given that v is true while p v u is the likelihood of event v occurring given that u is true for the tuning of vessel hydrodynamic parameters u can be considered as those uncertain parameters while v corresponds to the received sensor signals however the bayesian inference may not seem so simple as shown in equation 11 due to the practical difficulties of estimating p v u and p v inspired by labbe 2018 the bayesian updating applied for model tuning could also be understood as 12 p o s t e r i o r p r i o r l i k e l i h o o d n o r m a l i z a t i o n where l i k e l i h o o d means the possibility of getting such measurement e g sensor j result for the particular combination e g r of uncertain vessel parameters which can be reasonably represented by the weight factor w r j this is the key to updating our belief to the prior knowledge after receiving the sensor data with equation 10 w r j is calculated based on the discrete vessel parameter values used in the rao database for one sensor j the size of the calculated weight matrix w j for m variables by equation 10 is i 1 i 2 i m however the joint probability distribution of variables uses much more discrete values than was used to build rao database in order to update the joint distribution of variables the weight matrix needs to be interpolated to the size of k 1 k 2 k m multi dimensional linear interpolation was performed by means of the python xarray package hoyer and hamman 2017 discrete bayesian updating could easily apply to nonlinear systems such as the described hydrodynamic parameter tuning challenge due to the nonlinearity the updated probability distribution will have no closed form mathematical description after the first update and the updated probability distribution will no longer be gaussian the n t h updating for the r t h combination of uncertain vessel parameters based on the valuable sensor j data can then be formulated as 13 p d f n φ k 1 φ k m p d f n 1 φ k 1 φ k m w r j 3 case study basis 3 1 numerical vessel model the case study was based on an offshore supply vessel osv hydrodynamic seakeeping model the primary vessel dimensions are summarized in table 1 the coordinates refer to the reference coordinate system moving steadily at the vessel forward speed as illustrated in fig 2 the positive x axis points from stern to bow x 0 aft the z axis is pointing vertically upward from keel z 0 at keel and the y axis is normal to the x z plane where y 0 is at the longitudinal symmetric plane the wave direction β w follows the same coordinate system i e waves at 0 heading propagates along the positive x axis table 2 summarizes the location and id of the virtual sensors considered in the paper the sensor locations are illustrated in fig 2 practically the vessel heave response could dominate the operation limit and hence it is usually of interest to monitor the heave response earlier parametric sensitivity study han et al 2020 suggests that measuring different quantities of vessel response i e displacement velocity and acceleration at different locations onboard can help identifying the right uncertain parameter to tune therefore the rao database contains the heave response displacement velocity and acceleration at three different locations see fig 2 rigid body motion transformation was assumed in the study 3 2 rao database a rao database was established based on the ballast condition as the base case wasim dnv gl 2018 was used for hydrodynamic analysis to create the rao database being a computer program in the dnv gl sesam family wasim is a 3d time domain hydrodynamic analysis software based on the rankine panel method kring 1994 wasim analyses were run through all wave periods for each combination of the studied parameters in the time domain the outputs were transferred to the frequency domain so as to build the frequency dependent database of hydrodynamic coefficients and thereafter calculate the vessel raos by 14 r a o ω u β w f ω u β w ω e 2 a ω e m 0 i ω e β ω e c where ω is the wave frequency u is the vessel advancing speed and β w is the wave heading as illustrated in fig 2 f ω u β w is the complex valued wave induced excitation force and ω e is the encounter frequency a m 0 β and c are the added mass matrix inertia matrix damping matrix and restoring stiffness matrix of the vessel respectively only heave raos corresponding to the sensors described in table 2 were included in the rao database as summarized in table 3 variation of 5 parameters were considered for the rao database with the described number of discrete values for each parameter selection of parameters was based on sensitivity studies of hydrodynamic parameters that influence the vessel motions of interest some key findings on the parametric sensitivity study han et al 2020 are 1 gmt and additional roll damping β 44 both have a strong influence on the roll motion response 2 parameters related to the inertia distribution such as xcg ycg zcg mass and r 55 have a strong influence on the vessel heave motion at different locations onboard among which xcg and r 55 are the most important parameters 3 ycg only has significant influence on the vessel roll motion and its coupled motions the ranges represent prior knowledge and the corresponding uncertainties for the parameters zero vessel speed was considered in order to avoid dealing with the 3 to 1 mapping problem between wave frequency and encounter frequency for following waves nielsen 2017 in total 13 wave headings between 0 and 180 with 15 interval were included therefore each sensor in table 2 has hundreds of thousands heave raos prepared 3 3 wave spectrum ocean waves are usually short crested in reality in addition a sea state may contain both wind sea and swells coming from totally different main directions with significantly distinct peak periods precise knowledge on the wave condition was assumed for the studied cases i e uncertainties from wave hindcast forecast were not considered for simplicity the long crested pierson moskowitz pm spectrum s p m ω was used dnvgl rp c205 2017 15 s p m ω 5 16 h s 2 ω p 2 ω 5 e x p 5 4 ω ω p 4 where h s is the significant wave height and ω p is the sea state peak frequency 3 4 sensor signal simulation virtual sensor signals were numerically simulated for the case studies for each of the 9 virtual sensors described in table 2 the signals were generated according to the procedure illustrated in fig 3 firstly with known wave spectrum s ζ ζ ω β w and the true rao values for sensor j the response spectrum can be calculated by 16 s x j x j ω h x j ζ ω β w 2 s ζ ζ ω β w where h x j ζ ω β w represents the true rao for vessel response x j ω then the signal of 3 hour response time series with time step of 0 1s was generated by 17a x j t n 1 n ω c n ω n cos ω n t ϕ n 17b c n ω n 2 s x j x j ω n δ ω where ϕ n 0 2 π is a random phase angle which is continuous and uniformly distributed δ ω is the width of the radial frequency interval of ω n and n ω is the total number of the discrete frequencies for the response spectrum deterministic amplitudes were applied according to equation 17b this means that theoretically all possible realizations will return exactly the same response power spectrum when δ ω 0 sensor signal noises were included gaussian distributed white noise was assumed with mean value μ n 0 and a specified covariance σ n 2 the noise was added to each time step of the time series independently according to the specified signal to noise ratio snr defined by 18 s n r σ x 2 σ n 2 where σ x 2 is the variance of the true response time series however note that in reality the sensor noise may be biased and non gaussian distributed labbe 2018 practically the velocity can be calculated by integration of acceleration time series while the displacement can be calculated by another integration over the velocity time series the noise associated with displacement velocity and acceleration signals are therefore correlated however this correlation is currently not considered the noises of acceleration velocity and displacement time series were added independently 4 case study results case studies were conducted to test the proposed methodology for illustration purposes each case only includes two parameters to tune the sea states in table 4 were applied the key parameters used in the tuning process are summarized in table 5 4 1 gmt and β 44 the first case study considered gmt and β 44 as the uncertain vessel hydrodynamic parameters the other three parameters i e xcg mass and r 55 were set as deterministic the prior knowledge and the true values of gmt and β 44 are summarized in table 6 the calculated weight matrix illustrated in fig 4 indicates that the considered parameters gmt and β 44 are sensitive to the disp b sensor for the ss1 sea state it is obvious that gmt and β 44 influence the roll motion very much and ss1 is a beam sea condition with the peak period approximately near the heave rao peak amplitude period for the location b on the other hand fig 5 illustrates a confusing weight matrix the weight factor is spreading over a large variable range because the sea state ss4 is with t z 4 0 s t p 5 6 s there was barely no significant vessel response around that small response period due to the lowpass filtering nature of the vessel this means that gmt and β 44 do not have significant influence on the raos and vessel motion for the given sea state ss4 the variance of gmt and β 44 were increased after tuning based on ss4 as shown in table 7 meaning that the tuning system got confused by the sensor data for ss4 both parameters do not influence the heave motion at the cog and therefore the measurements at the location a near the cog were screened out for all tuning steps fig 6 illustrates the tuning results based on response measurements from each sea state ss1 and ss5 played important roles with respect to the successful tuning while ss4 attempted to degrade the tuning results it is noted that sensor data from ss1 over tuned the probability distribution of gmt due to signal noises this problem is discussed in detail in section 5 4 and section 5 5 4 2 xcg and mass the same sea states defined in table 4 were applied for tuning the xcg and the mass however with a different vessel condition the prior knowledge and the true values of xcg and mass are summarized in table 8 the results in fig 7 and table 10 show that ss3 and ss4 significantly contributed to the tuning of xcg in the correct direction both sea states are oblique waves with small wave periods where the hydrodynamic parametric sensitivity studies han et al 2020 showed that the vessel heave motion are sensitive to xcg as illustrated in fig 7 the joint probability distribution was not updated from ss5 meaning that all sensor measurements from ss5 were screened out in other words xcg and mass have negligible effects to the considered vessel response at ss5 the weight matrix examples shown in fig 8 indicate the system confusion all the 4 sensor measurements successfully gave high weight to the correct xcg value but failed with respect to tuning vessel mass the measurements from sensor acc b gave approximately the same weight factor through the whole range of mass values measurements from disp c and vel b sensors gave almost the opposite weighting distribution along mass values the parametric sensitivity study han et al 2020 showed that vessel mass influences the heave velocity mostly at small response periods for head and following sea conditions at the given uncertainty ranges the mass variation is less important with respect to the vessel response compared with xcg therefore it is not very surprising that the measurements from the selected sea states failed to tune the vessel mass due to 1 its less sensitivity for the considered sea states 2 the nonlinear nature of the vessel response to the hydrodynamic parameters 3 the measurement noise and uncertainties by e g seed variation therefore measurements from one more sea state ss6 in table 9 were provided ss6 was expected to be relatively sensitive with respect to the mass coefficient fig 9 shows a dramatic shift of the peak of the joint distribution to a lower mass value 5 parametric sensitivity study the case study of tuning gmt and β 44 presented in section 4 1 was chosen as the base case for the sensitivity study of some key parameters in the tuning algorithm 5 1 power parameter p p 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 were chosen as the sensitivity study cases the tuning results are summarized in table 11 as shown in fig 10 large p leads to very large weight factor which could be risky especially when σ r j σ ˆ j 0 therefore large p may lead to quick and abrupt change of the joint probability distribution of parameters as illustrated in fig 11 larger p value leads to less memory of the tuning results from the previous sea states this may not be practically reasonable especially for a stationary vessel situation due to the existing uncertainties the vessel loading condition could be considered as stationary for a relatively long time e g in terms of days if the focus is only to tune the sea state dependent parameters e g β 44 larger p value might be preferable but cautions are required to use large p for tuning multiple parameters at the same time 5 2 snr it is interesting to test the performance of the proposed tuning approach with respect to the signal noise level the sensitivity analysis on snr therefore also serves a purpose of validating the methodology the lowpass filter method does not require to know the noise level explicitly results in table 12 show that the methodology is quite stable with respect to dealing with signal noises the tuning results in terms of mean and variance of the parameters are close for all snr values varying from 10 to 10 000 5 3 seed variation the seeds for generating vessel response sensor signals had been selected for all previous studies ensuring exactly the same signals for tuning result comparison the importance of seed variation with respect to the tuned results was investigated seeds were randomly generated for the same 5 sea states in total 10 sets of randomly generated seeds were used for the 5 sea states corresponding to 10 tuning results named as from case1 to case10 as shown in fig 12 the tuning results of β 44 were very stable in terms of its expected value and variance this is due to very sensitive and monotonic influences from β 44 to vessel response i e rao the additional roll damping only influences the rao amplitude but not the rao peak period fig 12 shows that seed variation could significantly influence the tuning results for the parameters which are not very sensitive to the vessel response at those sea states e g gmt as variation in tuned gmt was observed this is because 1 vessel response rao is less sensitive to gmt 2 the correlation between gmt and vessel rao is complex gmt shifts the rao amplitude peak period and changes the amplitude magnitude as gmt determines the restoring stiffness for roll response it is also noted that the variance of gmt did not reduce significantly through tuning based on measurements from the selected sea states 5 4 lowpass filtering cutoff frequency considering noise the signal variance is equal to 19 σ s i g n a l 2 σ x 2 σ n 2 where σ x 2 and σ n 2 are the variance of the true response time series and the signal noise respectively theoretically without processing signal noise the variance of the signal will always be larger than the true response variance potentially leading to biased tuning results therefore the noise should be removed as much as possible the noise power cannot be known exactly by nature section 5 2 demonstrated the robustness of applying a lowpass filter to deal with noise a sensitivity study with respect to the cutoff frequency was carried out the results are summarized in table 13 for tuning gmt and β 44 and table 14 for tuning xcg and mass both tables 13 and 14 show that f l p 0 2 hz almost always gave the best tuned results in terms of being closer to the true values and with less variance exceptions were observed for the variance of the tuned vessel mass in table 14 the mass variance σ m a s s 2 after tuning was larger than the initiated variance for all seed variations indicating the system confusion mentioned in section 4 2 due to the less sensitivity of mass on the vessel response for the considered sea states deep investigation of intermediate results indicated that the noise variance filtered out was actually always less than the true noise variance for the base case i e f l p 1 0 hz consequently the variances of the filtered signal time series were all biased to a higher value than the true response this led to biased tuning results 5 5 sensor screening ratio α the selection of α depends on the uncertainty ranges of the considered parameters and the uncertainties from input such as waves and response measurements for a given uncertainty range of parameters larger α leads to model tuning with less valuable sensor data which may slow down the convergence speed smaller α helps to tune the model with more sensor data but on the other hand may lead to wrong results because the noise cannot be always perfectly treated table 15 shows how the tuned results vary with α it is clear that when α is reduced more sensors which are less influenced by the considered uncertain vessel hydrodynamic parameters are included due to noise the filtered signal variance deviates from the true response variance if the noise was not appropriately filtered those less important sensors generally would accelerate the tuning to a deviated value therefore it is important to ensure a good selection of f l p value or acquire some additional knowledge on the noise and uncertainties based on section 5 4 f l p 0 2 hz suits better for the case study therefore a sensitivity of α with respect to the lowpass filter cutoff frequency of 0 2 hz was also studied as shown in table 16 with better handling of noise more sensors were used with smaller α generally leading to better model tuning results therefore a trade off between α and f l p should be considered for practical purposes due to the existence of uncertainties and limitations of noise filtering 6 validation and robustness so far only two 2 dimensional model tuning cases have been studied for 5 sea states in order to validate the proposed tuning approach more extensive hydrodynamic model tuning analyses were carried out for one selected true vessel condition sensor signals were simulated for 6 sea states the duration for each sea state was 1 hour parameters defining the sea states i e h s t z β w and seed were randomly selected within the range described in table 17 gmt r 55 xcg and β 44 were selected for model tuning the reason to exclude mass coefficient was because the results from section 4 2 indicate that the vessel mass does not have a significant influence within its considered uncertainty range the validation analyses included 120 tuning results all 4 parameters were tuned simultaneously tuning 4 parameters at the same time became slower compared with the previous cases of tuning 2 parameters therefore the power parameter p was increased to 0 4 the joint probability distribution of the parameters was initiated as shown in table 18 the key parameters needed for sensor signal generation and the tuning methodology are summarized in table 17 due to limited computational processing capacity of the available laptop cpu intel r tm i7 8650u 1 90 ghz 32 gb memory a limited number of discretized values had to be applied for each parameter to tune 4 parameters the acceptable total number of discrete combinations was below 1 3e 07 this might be due to the large memory demands from python numpy operations during 4 dimensional interpolation of the calculated weight matrices described in section 2 6 the computational capacity can be increased by optimizing the codes changing the data structure or simply increase the computer memory capacity table 18 describes the applied number of discrete parameter values for the joint probability distribution the resolution for the uncertain parameters is considered sufficient with respect to the studied parameter ranges for tuning a 4 dimensional model with the considered uncertain range and resolution the computational time for each sea state was about 90 s for the 2 dimensional tuning model with 100 100 resolution for the probability distribution the computational time for each sea state was about 10 s from figs 13 and 14 it is clear that the proposed tuning procedure succeeds to tune β 44 and xcg in most cases however a large variation of tuning results for gmt and r 55 were also experienced this is consistent with the findings from the earlier hydrodynamic parametric sensitivity studies han et al 2020 showing that the vessel rao is much less sensitive to gmt and r 55 compared to β 44 and xcg for illustration purposes each figure only contains information on 2 parameters similar to all other experiment or test calibration methodologies e g machine learning algorithms hydrodynamic coefficients fitted based on laboratory tests relevant and valuable cases sea states are required in order to tune the parameters but different from the complex ai algorithms like neural networks the physics based model tuning is better at extrapolation from the available data and does not require a huge amount of data samples this is particularly important for nonlinear problems extrapolation here means good vessel response predictions for outlier sea states the process for tuning hydrodynamic parameters still requires that the available rao database covers the entire range of hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties the validation analyses were limited to only 6 sea states for each tuning therefore failure of model tuning is by nature possible for example one out of the 120 tuning simulations failed to report good enough additional roll damping highlighted in fig 13 a deep investigation showed that all the generated sensor signals were basically from head and following sea states where β 44 played a negligible role and none of the sea states were near the roll resonance period figs 15 and 16 illustrate how the variance changes after tuning analyses show that the variable variance significantly reduces after tuning especially for the important parameters i e β 44 and xcg as expected note that the y axis of fig 15 is log scaled the expected mean and variance of the parameters are summarized in table 19 the tuning methodology succeeds to modify the parameters such that they approach the true values with significantly increased confidence therefore the validation analyses demonstrated the robustness and stability of the proposed tuning methodology 7 conclusions and future work a procedure with great potential for practical implementation with respect to tuning of vessel hydrodynamic seakeeping model parameters based on onboard vessel motion measurements has been proposed similar to model calibration based on laboratory tests hydrodynamic coefficients can be modified based on available data by the tuning approach therefore the improved vessel motion prediction is supported by physics and common engineering practice but different from model calibration by laboratory tests more uncertainties are in reality observed onboard therefore it is more natural to present the important hydrodynamic parameters and raos in a probabilistic way the proposed tuning approach combines engineering practice with the random nature quantitatively improving the knowledge on the vessel conditions and response hence the reliability of the vessel motion rao and motion prediction can be documented quantitatively as well therefore some of the safety factors in engineering practice related to marine operation design e g dnvgl st n001 2016 may be reduced and reliability based marine operations may be possible consequently the approach could potentially help to reduce the operational cost and increase safety the tuning process is fast and suitable for onboard application which could improve the quality of digital twins and assist within the context of onboard decision support analyses demonstrate that the tuning approach is robust and stable to deal with noise better tuning results were observed for the parameters which have stronger influence on the measured vessel response the tuning algorithm also showed reasonable behaviour when updating the hydrodynamic parameters for cases where the sea states or the measurements were not very relevant for those uncertain parameters key parameters of the tuning methodology were also studied by sensitivity analyses relatively large values of the power parameter p led to higher belief in sensor data and hence less memory to the prior knowledge it was found important to select the cutoff frequency f l p of the lowpass filter in a proper way for an unbiased tuning result practically a trade off between α and f l p should be considered to optimally use the available measurement data inspired by godhaven 1998 the lowpass filter cutoff frequency f l p could be preferably modelled as sea state dependent automatically selected based on measurements and environment information the tuning methodology was also validated by using virtual sensor signals from randomly selected sea states by tuning 4 parameters simultaneously even though a considerable amount of analyses were carried out for validation more work is still required for methodology verification only one vessel condition was studied in section 6 more vessel conditions and broader ranges of hydrodynamic parameters should be studied more importantly scaled experimental data and on site full scale data should be used to verify the tuning methodology the presented case studies of tuning vessel parameters fig 1 and virtual sensor signal simulation fig 3 apply the raos from the same rao database which are generated based on seakeeping analyses by wasim software however the real on site vessel motion measurements will fully reflect the reality while the established rao database to be used for vessel model tuning will be potentially subject to bias introduced by the simplifications made in the applied seakeeping software and the vessel numerical model this software introduced bias should also be investigated in the future research work practically if the rao database can be extended to various vessel advancing speeds with sufficient speed resolution much more on site measurements can be used to tune the important vessel parameters consequently the cutoff frequency will therefore depend on vessel speed so far the additional roll damping β 44 was considered only operational condition dependent which assumes a constant value throughout all sea states for the current vessel loading condition some parameters are sea state dependent e g roll damping some other parameters are operational condition dependent such as inertia distribution while others could be permanent e g vessel geometry each parameter should be categorized accordingly and different model tuning strategy might be considered for each category so far only uncertainties from sensor noise were considered in reality the uncertainties from wave information are significant such as directional spreading wave spectral shape and uncertainties from wave forecast and hindcast modelling other environmental loads have not been considered such as wind and current leaving the procedure with a considerable gap towards on site practice practically these challenges can be solved by modifying the signal filter and by also including a highpass filter in addition rigid body motion was assumed when calculating heave rao functions at different locations in reality for large slender vessels more advanced models might therefore be required due to the increasing importance of hydroelastic effects credit authorship

21176,due to the nonlinear effects such as strong impact and complex movement of gas water interface in the process of water jet in underwater explosion there is no suitable method to calculate the load of water this work presents a novel and efficient method for modeling underwater explosion induced bubble jet near the wall in this method compressible multiphase five equation model with interface compression and density correction is solved by a finite volume method while a fifth order accuracy weighted essentially non oscillation weno reconstruction and hllc approximate riemann solver are employed to discretize the convective terms and 3rd order tvd runge kutta scheme is used to discretize the temporal term this method is validated by conducting one dimensional benchmarking problems and two dimensional cases it is found that the results predicted by our method agree well with those from different sources finally the proposed method is applied to simulate underwater explosion bubble jet near the wall it shows that the generation development and collapse of the water jet can be well captured confirming that the five equation model is effective for modeling bubble jet load near the wall keywords underwater explosion bubble jet five equation model interface compression weno reconstruction hllc solver 1 introduction as a complex phenomenon underwater explosion undex has been applied to many fields such as underwater obstacle suppression seafloor mining and so on undex can be divided into three important stages charge detonation shock wave propagation and bubble pulsation cole 1948 liu 2002 the same amount of explosive can cause greater damage underwater than it would have caused in air because water is much less compressible than air lundgren 1991 just after the detonation a shock wave and an expanding high pressure gas bubble will appear in water this shock wave moves at a very high speed and will generate a very high pressure the explosive products form a high pressure gas bubble to over expand and the pressure inside the bubble becomes lower than the surrounding reference pressure it then stops expanding the surrounding flow pressure is now higher than the pressure inside the bubble and a collapse phase will follow when there are boundary conditions such as structure and free surface near the explosion bubble the influence of gravity and different boundary conditions will cause a high speed water jet to develop due to the directivity of the water jet impingement process the pressure peak value is higher and lasts for a long time the local damage effect on the structure may exceed the failure effect of the early shock wave load therefore it is necessary to study the phenomenon of underwater explosion bubble jet it can be seen from the above that the motion process of bubbles in underwater explosion is very complex which involves the coupling motion of many kinds of fluids and brings difficulties to the research unfortunately at present the research progress on the water jet load caused by the collapse of explosive bubbles is very limited and the characteristics and specific forms of the water jet load are still unclear for the research of bubble motion rayleigh 1917 firstly established the motion model of ideal spherical bubble in incompressible flow field since then plesset 1971 noltinglc 1950 gilmore 1952 and others have made a series of amendments and improvements on the model which improve the calculation accuracy of bubble model geers and hunter 1987 had established a geers hunter model based on the doubly asymptotic approximation daa to calculate the shock load of underwater explosion shock wave stage and bubble pulsation stage which has been applied to a larger number of engineering analysis in addition to theoretical analysis arons 1949 and keil 1961 have provided empirical formulas for calculating the maximum radius and bubble pulsation period on the base of a large number of experiments and theoretical researches respectively some of the results show that the existence of boundary conditions such as seafloor and water surface have a certain influence on the bubble maximum radius and period tomita 1983 shima 1989 boyce 2003 and klaseboer 2005 have carried out several experimental researches on spark generated cavitation bubble laser generated bubble and small charge explosion bubbles near different wall condition with different stand off configurations to observe the bubble movement and the formation process of water jet because the theoretical analysis is limited to simple cases and the repeatability and variability of experimental researches are poor numerical simulations of the explosion bubble become more and more popular with the development of computer technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd the numerical simulation of bubbles interacting with different boundary condition has been paid more attention in the last few decades the boundary element method bem has been widely applied to simulate bubble movement phenomenon bubbles of all sizes have been simulated from large explosion bubbles to small cavitation bubbles the employment of the bem in bubble dynamics has two obvious advantages one is that the bem reduces the dimension of the problem by one since only the boundaries of the problem need to be meshed with the fluid domain remaining mesh free and the other is that the grid can move with the bubbles interface because of the decrease of computational dimension and high calculation efficiency the application of the bem in bubble dynamics simulation can be seen in blake and gibson 1981 who studied the growth and collapse of a vapour cavitation near a free surface their numerical results of the bubble shape as it evolved matched well with the experiments lundgren and mansour 1991 used the bem to study initial spherical and toroidal bubbles rising in a gravity field the three dimensional motion of a bubble close to a fixed rigid structure was simulated by harris 1992 wang et al 1996 studied the nonlinear interaction between the bubble and free surface which employed a so called surgical cut to convert the originally simply connected bubble to a toroidal shape after the jet impact zhang et al 2001 extended the surgical cut and vortex ring technique to simulate three dimensional toroidal bubble problems bem method has good accuracy in bubble pulsation period and bubble maximum radius calculation but in bubble collapse stage due to the high speed motion of bubble jet and the existence of water hammer effect the velocity gradient in flow field and the pressure of water hammer is very large so it is necessary to consider the compressibility of fluid and large deformation in this case the accuracy of bem method is obviously reduced and it is difficult to adapt to the requirements of high precision simulation during bubble jet process in addition to bem the finite volume formulation of popinet and zaleski 2002 was also used to simulate oscillating bubbles near a solid surface because this method is based on incompressible navier stokes equation it cannot solve the problem of shock wave propagation and high speed motion in bubble jet stage generally underwater explosion phenomenon is a compressible multicomponent flow problem to simulate these problems two classes of methods have been developed as sharp interface methods and diffuse methods sharp interface methods are based on lagrangian viewpoints in this system the computational cell moves and deforms with the flow interface which is suitable for simple interface motion and difficult to trace complex motion of the interface daramizadeh et al 2015 the most common eulerian sharp interface methods for capturing of interfaces are the volume of fluid vof method hirt et al 1981 the ghost fluid method fedkiw et al 1999 and a level set approach mulder et al 1999 a drawback of these schemes is that this particular implementation becomes rather difficult in recent years liu et al 2018 and tian et al 2020 used eulerian finite element method effm to simulate bubble movement under the condition of free field and near wall which is based on multiphase interface captured by the vof method other numerical methodology which is going to be used in the paper is a diffuse interface method which is based upon so called single fluid modeling of multi component flows and is widely used in simulation of multi phase compressible flows abgrall 1996 kapila et al 2001 saurel et al 2009 the term single fluid here means that there are no overlaid fields for different fluids used in ghost fluid methods fedkiw et al 1999 mulder et al 1999 the diffused methods effectively avoid spurious pressure oscillations that frequently appear at the multi fluid interfaces by relaxing strict numerical conservation in favor of continuity of pressure kapila five equation two fluid model has shown good potential for the numerical simulation of interface separating compressible fluids as well as wave propagation in compressible mixtures kapila et al 2001 allaire et al 2002 proposed five equation model for the simulation of interfaces between compressible interfaces which is similar to the five equation model proposed by kapila 2001 and mulder 1999 five equation model contains the compressibility of the fluid which enables it to capture the propagation of shock waves and hand complex topological changes including dynamic creating of interfaces as in cavitation or chemical reaction one major disadvantage associated with these algorithms when executed to multi phase flows is their inability to sharply capture contact discontinuities this is very important when there are large density ratio between two fluids if these methods are applied to the simulation of bubble jet it will be difficult to accurately capture the shape and load characteristics of the water jet in order to overcome the above mentioned difficulties this article introduces interface function compression and density correction technology on the base of the five equation model of multicomponent compressible fluid to improve the capture accuracy of gas liquid interface in water jet stage this model can restrain the dispersion effect of interface and provide a clear bubble jet formation and evolution process from which some typical characteristics and load forms of water jet evolution can be obtained the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we firstly present the governing equations of the five equation model and then propose interface compression equation and density correction to restrain interface dispersion in section 3 the numerical method is testified by one dimensional tests and two dimensional tests and compression treatments are used to simulation bubble jet in undex by two dimensional axisymmetric model section 4 concludes the obtained results 2 mathematical model description 2 1 governing equations a five equation model is composed of two mass conservation equations a mixture momentum conservation equation and a mixture energy conservation equation while the last equation of this model is a non conservation equation for the volume fraction which contains a non conservative term involving the divergence of the velocity allaire et al 2002 these equations are as follows mass conservation equations for two component fluid 2 1 ρ 1 z 1 t ρ 1 z 1 u 0 2 2 ρ 2 z 2 t ρ 2 z 2 u 0 mixture momentum conservation equation 2 3 ρ u t ρ u u p 0 mixture energy conservation equation 2 4 ρ e t ρ e p u 0 volume fraction transport equation 2 5 z 1 t u z 1 0 where t u p e denote time velocity vector pressure and total energy per unit mass respectively ρ i z i i 1 2 are density and volume fraction of different fluids throughout this paper both the gas and liquid in the mixture are supposed to share the same velocity u by volume averaging we define global quantities and thermodynamical parameters for the mixture as follows 2 6 z 2 1 z 1 ρ ρ 1 z 1 ρ 2 z 2 y i z i ρ i ρ p z 1 p 1 z 2 p 2 ρ e z 1 ρ 1 e 1 z 2 ρ 2 e 2 ρ h ρ e p where y and h are mass fraction and enthalpy of fluid by h e p ρ respectively to close system 2 1 2 5 we supplement it with an isobaric closure assumption as p 1 p 2 p then according to the formula ρ e z 1 ρ 1 e 1 z 2 ρ 2 e 2 the global equation of state of the mixture can be obtained by the equation of state of each phase 2 7 p p ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ ρ e z 1 the stiffened equation of state can be used to each phase in mixture johnsen 2006 2 8 p ρ e γ 1 γ p where γ and p are parameters for different materials for perfect gases γis the ratio of specific heats and p 0 for water medium γ and p are determined based on the shock mach number which is a measure of the stiffness of the liquid in the literature johnsen 2006 is proposed for water although the sound speed does not appear explicitly in the five equation model 2 1 2 5 it is used for upwind scheme in the numerical algorithm here we define the partial derivative 2 9 ξ i ρ i e i p i ρ i the mixture sound velocityccan be defined 2 10 c 2 i y i ξ i c i 2 ξ where ξ z 1 ξ 1 z 2 ξ 2 for two phase flow allaire et al 2002 according to the stiffened equation of state 2 8 the speed of sound c i of the pure fluid i is given by 2 11 c i 2 γ i p i p ρ i in other words c is some kind of average of the phase speeds of sound c i 2 2 interface function equation with the advance of calculation time of the previous standard five equation model for compressible two fluid flow model the dispersion effect will inevitably appear near the two fluid interface which will lead to the ambiguity of the interface in the simulation process of vortex and water hammer phenomenon during the bubble jet formation the calculation accuracy of the density pressure velocity and other variables will be significantly affected so that the simulation results are not credible in serious cases the computing program will crash so that the scope of application of the computing model is reduced for eliminating these drawbacks we adopt interface function compression technology proposed by shukla et al 2010 who extend the interface compression technology for incompressible flows proposed by olsson and kreiss 2007 to compressible fluids even though the interface compression technology is well described in the literature shukla 2010 it is also outlined in this section to keep this paper as self contained as possible the first is project the gradient of 2 12 k ε h z 1 z 1 1 z 1 in the normal direction giving 2 13 z 1 t u z 1 μ 0 n k then the mass conservation equation of single phase fluid can be rewritten as 2 14 ρ 1 z 1 t ρ 1 z 1 u ρ 1 μ 0 n k where is the characteristic compression velocity of the interface sharpening ε h is a length scale of the order of the grid spacing in the limit μ 0 k 0 which means that the right term in 2 14 is zero in single phase flow and there is no need for compression the interface compression will be effective only for z 1 0 1 2 3 density correction for compressible flow the fluid density ρ will vary independently of z 1 in general which only serves to distinguish the materials across interfaces neither of these alone is sufficient to uniquely determine the interface location and density density gradients at interfaces will also diffuse in time and it is desirable to suppress the diffusion for the same reasons velocity and pressure are also subject to numerical diffusion but these are both continuous across gas liquid interface and do not require special treatment the density correction for mass conservation equation can be given as 2 15 ρ t ρ u h z 1 μ 0 n ε h n ρ 1 2 z 1 ρ where n φ φ is the local interface normal the function h z 1 is used to localize the compression to the interface region 2 16 h z 1 tanh z 1 1 z 1 10 2 2 this function is effective only for mixture which means that the source term of the density correction equation 2 15 will be zero for single phase fluid the aforementioned proof of the conservation of the five equation model based on interface compression and density correction can refer to the literature shukla et al 2010 and will not be repeated here for the simulation of bubble pulsation process of undex the bubble motion period is much longer than that of shock wave and the time step size of explicit calculation scheme is very small so the number of calculated steps needed to simulate the movement of bubble collapse to water jet appearing are very large which is easily lead to interface dispersion if the interfacial dispersion effect is no effectively suppressed and properly treated the calculated results will become unreliable in order to demonstrate the importance of interface compression technique we take the simulation of bubble motion of 100 kg trinitrotoluene tnt explosion at 400 m water depth as an example the initial and boundary conditions can be referred to formula 3 7 but with an explosive bubble of 0 245 m radius fig 1 and fig 2 show density and pressure contours for bubble collapsed with and without interface compression respectively it can be seen that there is a serious dispersion effect at the gas water interface in the process of bubble shrinkage without compression treatment and it is difficult to capture the exact position of the gas water interface which lead to low pressure during the impact of water hammer fig 3 shows the time history curve of water jet pressure at the center of the left wall with and without compression treatment note that the peak pressure of water jet decreases from 77 7 mpa to 49 4 mpa with a decrease of 36 in the case of without compression treatment and the pressure curve is postponed at the case with compression in compare to case without compression the above two phenomena on the load curve can be explained from figs 1 and 2 firstly the jet tip just hit the left bubble wall at 81 9 ms in the case with compression and local high pressure area is produced after the jet impact at 79 8 ms in the case without compression secondly the density of jet tip during impact is higher in compression case compare to the without compression case 2 4 numerical discretization consider the governing system for a 2d arrangement in a consistent form as 2 17 q t f q x g q r s q 2 18

the left and right states of the riemann problem are reconstructed from the weno reconstruction akturk 2005 the reconstruction is commonly performed in characteristic space the variables are first decomposed into the respective characteristic fields and then reconstructed thereafter they are projected back into physical space shu 1999 for the two dimensional fv reconstruction it is computationally tedious because two one dimensional reconstructions will need to perform per grid point and a gaussian quadrature rule is used in multiple dimensions titarev 2004 the intercell flux of

mentioned before the space discretization with five order weno reconstruction in order to retain uniformly high order of time accuracy the solution is advanced by 3rd order tvd runge kutta method shu

discussion in this section some numerical tests are performed to show the capability of the present numerical model for simulating gas water multicomponent compressible flows in undex first numerical

experiment involving multicomponent fluid interface is considered third 2d simulation of an undex near free surface is examined fourth the collapse of a cylindrical air bubble in water is studied finally an underwater explosion of an explosive near the wall is simulated in all the examples in this paper cfl is equal to 0 6 unless otherwise specified 3 1 one dimension shock tube problems in order to validate the ability of capturing shock wave and interface location a more difficult shock tube problem is gas liquid riemann problem used to simulate underwater explosions shyue 1998 cocchi

1 25 1 the computing field is 5 5 with 100 meshes and the initial interface position is in the middle of the length fig 4 shows the total density pressure velocity and volume fraction of gas profiles at time of 1 0 we note that the solutions computed using the interface compression technique keep a constant interface thickness of a few grid cells whereas the one without compression shows ongoing diffusion generally speaking the computed solution agrees well with the exact solution the shock wave speeds and interface between fluids are correct and there are no distinct oscillations near the interface next we consider a multicomponent sod problem with higher pressure and density ratios wackers 2005 3 2 ρ u p γ p l t 10 0 10 1 4 0 t ρ u p γ p r t 0 125 0 0 1 1 2 0 t the computing field number of meshes and initial interface position are the same as that of the above case fig 5 shows the total density pressure velocity and volume fraction of gas profiles at time of 1 6 note that without the interface compression treatment the density solution oscillates slightly on the other hand simulations with an interface compression technique show good agreement with the exact solution on the density and interface location results next let s consider a gas water shock interface interaction problem with high density ratios 3 3 ρ u p γ p l t 0 1 0 2 753 1 4 0 t ρ u p γ p r t 0 991 0 3

gas profiles at time 0 6 we also find that the density and the position accuracy of the interface near the boundary are improved by using the compression technique which is very important for the research of the complex motion of the interface for a long time 3 2 two dimensional shock bubble interaction problem the previous examples show that the present method can capture the correct wave speeds and interface movement in one dimensional problems we hope that this advantage can be maintained in two dimensional cases as well in this section we examine a mach 1 22 air shock induced collapse of a cylindrical refrigerant 22 r22 bubble to validate the present numerical model the experiment results can be found in refs haas and sturtevant 1987 the computed domain is 0 0 325 0 0 089 m2 with an 650 178 grid the cylindrical r22 is initially set at the origin with a diameter of 5 cm and the shock wave is initiated at x 0 2 the initial condition is described as 3 4 ρ u v p γ p 1 3764

to left for the purpose of comparison we present the results of experiment and simulation at different time in fig 7 which shows good agreement between the two 3 3 underwater explosion near free surface in this section a 2d underwater explosion problem is considered this problem involved in this case have been researched by many people daramizadeh et al 2015 saurel et al 2009 shukla et al 2010 and contain complex interaction between multicomponent compressible fluid and cavitation phenomena the rectangular computational domain is 2 2 1 5 1 5 using a 600 450 uniform grid a highly pressurized explosion gas cylinder of radius r 0 12 is located at the origin 0 0 3 in water the free surface is located at the straight line y 0 the reflecting boundary condition is put at the bottom while the other direction boundary conditions are non reflecting condition the initial condition is described as 3 5 ρ u v p γ p g t 1 241 0 0 2 753 1 4 0 t i f r 0 1 g a s ρ u v p γ p g t 0 001 0 0 3

the computed solutions are free of numerical oscillations 3 4 collapse of an air cavity in water this two dimensional test case is the collapse of an air cavity in water by a mach 1 72 this problem has been studied extensively johnsen and colonius 2006 shukla et al 2010 nourgaliev et al 2006 due to its application in a wide range of physical phenomena such as lithotripsy sonoluminescence and implosion in underwater engineering this example is very close to the phenomenon of underwater explosion bubble jet but the bubble collapse in this example is caused by the inhomogeneity of the pressure field caused by the initial explosion bubble energy and the surrounding boundary conditions a cylindrical air bubble is immersed in water in diameter of 6 mm the center of the bubble is located at 12 12 mm in the computational domain of size 24 24 mm a planar incident msh 1 72 shock wave is initially located 5 4 mm to the left of the air bubble center the initial condition is 3 6 ρ u v p γ p 1323 65 681 58 0 1 9 10 9 4 4 6 10 8 a f t e r w a v e 1000 0 0 1 0 10 5 4 4 6 10 8 t b e f o r e w a v e 1 0 0 1 0 10 5 1 4 0 t i n a i r c a v i t y the computational domain is discretized using a 600 600 uniform grid and cfl 0 6 is applied boundary conditions are periodical in the vertical direction and non reflection at the left and right boundaries of the domain fig 9 shows the density pressure and interface function contours at different times it can be seen that the interface remains thin throughout the simulation even after the cavity fragments during the process of water jet the simulation result shows no spurious oscillations and keeps its symmetry about y 0 which is in good agreement with the results of nourgaliev 2006 3 5 underwater explosion bubble jet near the wall when close enough to a solid boundary in the process of underwater explosion collapse of explosion bubble will occur with high speed jet formation the velocity and its gradient will change violently during bubble jet the bubble jet generally go through typical processes such as shrinkage surface depression jet tip acceleration jet impacting and splashing if the fine simulation is carried out a variety of factors need to be considered comprehensively which will bring challenges to the calculation in this section we attempt to use five equation model with compression treatment to analysis the phenomenon of underwater explosion bubble jet the two dimensional axisymmetric model and computational grid are shown in fig 10 the explosion of 200 g tnt charge with a radius of r0 30 mm explodes under 50 m deep water according to cole s theoretical formula the maximum radius of the bubble is about rmax 0 52 m and the bubble pulsation period is about 40 ms the initial distance l0 between the charge center and the wall is set to 0 416 m so the ratio of distance to radius is γ l0 rmax 0 8 the computation domain is the square domain 15 15 m2 the resulting grid allows for high resolution near the bubble and a coarse mesh far away because of the stretching a 600 500 non uniform grid is used in fig 10 which shows the computational domain for bubble jet collapse only one in ten meshes is included with the minimum mesh length of 4 mm the instantaneous detonation model is used for charge detonation and initial conditions of flow field can be given as 3 7 ρ u v p γ p 1630 0 0 3 7 10 9 1 25 0 f o r g a s 1000 0 0 6 10 5 4 4 6 15 10 8 f o r w a t e r fig 11 shows the initial stage of the explosion bubble pulsation which reaches the maximum volume at 21 2 ms and then the bubble begins to contract we can find that the bubble is not spherical when it expands to the maximum volume and the bubble wall near the left boundary is squeezed and deformed this is because the nearby fluid is discharged in the process of bubble expansion and the discharged fluid has a certain impact on the wall on the contrary because of the existence of the wall the fluid between the wall and the bubble wall has a certain impact effect on the bubble wall which leads to a high pressure region between the bubble and the wall therefore there is extrusion deformation on the bubble wall near the left boundary when the bubble expands to the maximum volume from the diagram of the density and pressure distribution at 38 ms in fig 11 it can be seen that there is an obvious high pressure area on the right of the bubble in the process of the bubble shrinkage and jet tip begins to appear which induced the phenomenon of water jet pointing to the left bubble boundary meanwhile the left bubble wall is close to the solid wall boundary and the movement is slow the main reason for the appearance of the jet is that the left wall boundary has different effects on the wall around the bubble which leads to the depression of the right wall of the bubble in contraction finally the formation of jet tip in bubble motion leads to the phenomenon of jet impact fig 12 shows that with the acceleration of the jet tip bubble jet becomes more and more obvious the front end of the jet is conical and impinged on the left bubble wall at 39 3 ms which will produce water hammer phenomenon after the impact of the water jet the local high pressure area is produced on the solid wall then the high pressure region begins to radiate in the surrounding flow meanwhile the conical water begins to move towards the bubble area after impact on the wall which results in vortex ring phenomenon as shown in fig 12 the next step is to start the second pulsation of the bubble in order to master the load characteristics of water jet on the wall fig 13 shows the pressure time history curves of the measured points in different distance ranges near the center point on the left rigid wall it can be seen that the peak pressure of water jet can maintain a high level in the region with a radius of 0 2 m near the center of the wall while the peak pressure decreases obviously at a radius of 0 5 m and the duration is relatively short fig 14 shows the equivalent radius of the explosion bubble volume and the corresponding expansion velocity time history curve where the bubble explosion velocity is positive and the velocity of bubble shrinkage is negative we can be see that when the bubble begins to expand the speed increases to the maximum in an instant and then the expansion speed decreases gradually when the bubble radius reaches the maximum the bubble expansion velocity is zero and then the bubble begins to contract and the expansion velocity is negative near the time when the conical jet hits the left wall the bubble shrinkage velocity reaches the maximum then the conical jet continues to impact and the bubble shrinkage rate decreases gradually in the process of vortex ring formation at 41 2 ms the bubble volume contracts to a minimum and then expands quickly because the transition from contraction to expansion is too fast the bubble expansion velocity increases rapidly as shown in fig 14 the above conclusions can also be obtained from time history of the equivalent radius of the explosion bubble and pressure on center point of the wall as shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the bubble volume is not the smallest when the jet begins to hit the bubble wall at the beginning of the jet impact the mass of the jet tip is small and higher water jet pressure can be achieved when the main part of the water jet hits the wall at 39 3 ms the peak pressure 49 0 mpa reached at 39 4 ms after the peak pressure 49 0 mpa is reached at 39 4 ms the pressure decreases gradually and the pressure is near the valley near the 40 2 ms combined with the density image of 40 2 ms in fig 12 it can be seen that most of the water layers on the right bubble wall collide with the left wall which makes the pressure of the water jet rise again in a short time the oscillatory phenomenon of water jet pressure on the wall is caused by the complex motion of gas water mixture with the release of water jet energy the pressure and velocity of jet decrease gradually from the whole process of bubble jet pressure curve the effective action time of water jet load is more than 3 0 ms fig 16 shows x direction velocity distribution in the flow before the conical water jet is about to hit the wall we can be see that the maximum velocity is more than 260 m s and the velocity of the main part or the water jet is more than 200 m s 4 conclusion underwater explosion undex bubble jet is investigated using numerical simulation by five equation model in view of the shortcoming in the calculation of bubble jet load in undex the interface function compression and density correcting technology are adapted in the model these compression treatments can effectively inhibit the interfacial dispersion effect in the evolution of bubble jet it can accurately capture the typical evolution processes such as the generation and development of water jet and the impact of water hammer the density pressure velocity and other variable can also be obtained the researches show that the action of water jet is mainly concentrated in a limited range and the peak pressure is large so the impact damage of water jet on nearby structures cannot be ignored the results of this paper preliminarily reveal the characteristics of water jet load caused by underwater explosion bubble collapse which can provide support for the study of water jet generation mechanism and damage effect the evaluation and analysis of structure damage caused by water jet load will be performed in the

21176,due to the nonlinear effects such as strong impact and complex movement of gas water interface in the process of water jet in underwater explosion there is no suitable method to calculate the load of water this work presents a novel and efficient method for modeling underwater explosion induced bubble jet near the wall in this method compressible multiphase five equation model with interface compression and density correction is solved by a finite volume method while a fifth order accuracy weighted essentially non oscillation weno reconstruction and hllc approximate riemann solver are employed to discretize the convective terms and 3rd order tvd runge kutta scheme is used to discretize the temporal term this method is validated by conducting one dimensional benchmarking problems and two dimensional cases it is found that the results predicted by our method agree well with those from different sources finally the proposed method is applied to simulate underwater explosion bubble jet near the wall it shows that the generation development and collapse of the water jet can be well captured confirming that the five equation model is effective for modeling bubble jet load near the wall keywords underwater explosion bubble jet five equation model interface compression weno reconstruction hllc solver 1 introduction as a complex phenomenon underwater explosion undex has been applied to many fields such as underwater obstacle suppression seafloor mining and so on undex can be divided into three important stages charge detonation shock wave propagation and bubble pulsation cole 1948 liu 2002 the same amount of explosive can cause greater damage underwater than it would have caused in air because water is much less compressible than air lundgren 1991 just after the detonation a shock wave and an expanding high pressure gas bubble will appear in water this shock wave moves at a very high speed and will generate a very high pressure the explosive products form a high pressure gas bubble to over expand and the pressure inside the bubble becomes lower than the surrounding reference pressure it then stops expanding the surrounding flow pressure is now higher than the pressure inside the bubble and a collapse phase will follow when there are boundary conditions such as structure and free surface near the explosion bubble the influence of gravity and different boundary conditions will cause a high speed water jet to develop due to the directivity of the water jet impingement process the pressure peak value is higher and lasts for a long time the local damage effect on the structure may exceed the failure effect of the early shock wave load therefore it is necessary to study the phenomenon of underwater explosion bubble jet it can be seen from the above that the motion process of bubbles in underwater explosion is very complex which involves the coupling motion of many kinds of fluids and brings difficulties to the research unfortunately at present the research progress on the water jet load caused by the collapse of explosive bubbles is very limited and the characteristics and specific forms of the water jet load are still unclear for the research of bubble motion rayleigh 1917 firstly established the motion model of ideal spherical bubble in incompressible flow field since then plesset 1971 noltinglc 1950 gilmore 1952 and others have made a series of amendments and improvements on the model which improve the calculation accuracy of bubble model geers and hunter 1987 had established a geers hunter model based on the doubly asymptotic approximation daa to calculate the shock load of underwater explosion shock wave stage and bubble pulsation stage which has been applied to a larger number of engineering analysis in addition to theoretical analysis arons 1949 and keil 1961 have provided empirical formulas for calculating the maximum radius and bubble pulsation period on the base of a large number of experiments and theoretical researches respectively some of the results show that the existence of boundary conditions such as seafloor and water surface have a certain influence on the bubble maximum radius and period tomita 1983 shima 1989 boyce 2003 and klaseboer 2005 have carried out several experimental researches on spark generated cavitation bubble laser generated bubble and small charge explosion bubbles near different wall condition with different stand off configurations to observe the bubble movement and the formation process of water jet because the theoretical analysis is limited to simple cases and the repeatability and variability of experimental researches are poor numerical simulations of the explosion bubble become more and more popular with the development of computer technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd the numerical simulation of bubbles interacting with different boundary condition has been paid more attention in the last few decades the boundary element method bem has been widely applied to simulate bubble movement phenomenon bubbles of all sizes have been simulated from large explosion bubbles to small cavitation bubbles the employment of the bem in bubble dynamics has two obvious advantages one is that the bem reduces the dimension of the problem by one since only the boundaries of the problem need to be meshed with the fluid domain remaining mesh free and the other is that the grid can move with the bubbles interface because of the decrease of computational dimension and high calculation efficiency the application of the bem in bubble dynamics simulation can be seen in blake and gibson 1981 who studied the growth and collapse of a vapour cavitation near a free surface their numerical results of the bubble shape as it evolved matched well with the experiments lundgren and mansour 1991 used the bem to study initial spherical and toroidal bubbles rising in a gravity field the three dimensional motion of a bubble close to a fixed rigid structure was simulated by harris 1992 wang et al 1996 studied the nonlinear interaction between the bubble and free surface which employed a so called surgical cut to convert the originally simply connected bubble to a toroidal shape after the jet impact zhang et al 2001 extended the surgical cut and vortex ring technique to simulate three dimensional toroidal bubble problems bem method has good accuracy in bubble pulsation period and bubble maximum radius calculation but in bubble collapse stage due to the high speed motion of bubble jet and the existence of water hammer effect the velocity gradient in flow field and the pressure of water hammer is very large so it is necessary to consider the compressibility of fluid and large deformation in this case the accuracy of bem method is obviously reduced and it is difficult to adapt to the requirements of high precision simulation during bubble jet process in addition to bem the finite volume formulation of popinet and zaleski 2002 was also used to simulate oscillating bubbles near a solid surface because this method is based on incompressible navier stokes equation it cannot solve the problem of shock wave propagation and high speed motion in bubble jet stage generally underwater explosion phenomenon is a compressible multicomponent flow problem to simulate these problems two classes of methods have been developed as sharp interface methods and diffuse methods sharp interface methods are based on lagrangian viewpoints in this system the computational cell moves and deforms with the flow interface which is suitable for simple interface motion and difficult to trace complex motion of the interface daramizadeh et al 2015 the most common eulerian sharp interface methods for capturing of interfaces are the volume of fluid vof method hirt et al 1981 the ghost fluid method fedkiw et al 1999 and a level set approach mulder et al 1999 a drawback of these schemes is that this particular implementation becomes rather difficult in recent years liu et al 2018 and tian et al 2020 used eulerian finite element method effm to simulate bubble movement under the condition of free field and near wall which is based on multiphase interface captured by the vof method other numerical methodology which is going to be used in the paper is a diffuse interface method which is based upon so called single fluid modeling of multi component flows and is widely used in simulation of multi phase compressible flows abgrall 1996 kapila et al 2001 saurel et al 2009 the term single fluid here means that there are no overlaid fields for different fluids used in ghost fluid methods fedkiw et al 1999 mulder et al 1999 the diffused methods effectively avoid spurious pressure oscillations that frequently appear at the multi fluid interfaces by relaxing strict numerical conservation in favor of continuity of pressure kapila five equation two fluid model has shown good potential for the numerical simulation of interface separating compressible fluids as well as wave propagation in compressible mixtures kapila et al 2001 allaire et al 2002 proposed five equation model for the simulation of interfaces between compressible interfaces which is similar to the five equation model proposed by kapila 2001 and mulder 1999 five equation model contains the compressibility of the fluid which enables it to capture the propagation of shock waves and hand complex topological changes including dynamic creating of interfaces as in cavitation or chemical reaction one major disadvantage associated with these algorithms when executed to multi phase flows is their inability to sharply capture contact discontinuities this is very important when there are large density ratio between two fluids if these methods are applied to the simulation of bubble jet it will be difficult to accurately capture the shape and load characteristics of the water jet in order to overcome the above mentioned difficulties this article introduces interface function compression and density correction technology on the base of the five equation model of multicomponent compressible fluid to improve the capture accuracy of gas liquid interface in water jet stage this model can restrain the dispersion effect of interface and provide a clear bubble jet formation and evolution process from which some typical characteristics and load forms of water jet evolution can be obtained the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we firstly present the governing equations of the five equation model and then propose interface compression equation and density correction to restrain interface dispersion in section 3 the numerical method is testified by one dimensional tests and two dimensional tests and compression treatments are used to simulation bubble jet in undex by two dimensional axisymmetric model section 4 concludes the obtained results 2 mathematical model

johnsen 2006 2 8 p ρ e γ 1 γ p where γ and p are parameters for different materials for perfect gases γis the ratio of specific heats and p 0 for water medium γ and p are determined based on the shock mach number which is a measure of the stiffness of the liquid in the literature johnsen 2006 is proposed for water although the sound speed does not appear explicitly in the five equation model 2 1 2

some kind of average of the phase speeds of sound c i 2 2 interface function equation with the advance of calculation time of the previous standard five equation model for compressible two fluid flow model the dispersion effect will inevitably appear near the two fluid interface which will lead to the ambiguity of the interface in the simulation process of vortex and water hammer phenomenon during the bubble jet formation the calculation accuracy of the density pressure velocity and other variables will be significantly affected so that the simulation results are not credible in serious cases the computing program will crash so that the scope of application of the computing model is reduced for eliminating these drawbacks we adopt interface function compression technology proposed by shukla et al 2010 who extend the interface compression technology for incompressible flows proposed by olsson and kreiss 2007 to compressible fluids even though the interface compression technology is well described in the literature shukla 2010 it is also outlined in this section to keep this paper as self contained as possible the first is project the gradient of 2 12 k ε h z 1 z 1 1 z 1 in the normal direction giving 2 13 z 1 t u z 1 μ 0 n k then the mass conservation equation of single phase fluid can be rewritten as 2 14 ρ 1 z 1 t ρ 1 z 1 u ρ 1 μ 0 n k where is the characteristic compression velocity of the interface sharpening ε h is a length scale of the order of the grid spacing in the limit μ 0 k 0 which means that the right term in 2 14 is zero in single phase flow and there is no need for compression the interface compression will be effective only for z 1 0 1 2 3 density correction for compressible flow the fluid density ρ will vary independently of z 1 in general which only serves to distinguish the materials across interfaces neither of these alone is sufficient to uniquely determine the interface location and density density gradients at interfaces will also diffuse in time and it is desirable to suppress the diffusion for the same reasons velocity and pressure are also subject to numerical diffusion but these are both continuous across gas liquid interface and do not require special treatment the density correction for mass conservation equation can be given as 2 15 ρ t ρ u h z 1 μ 0 n ε h n ρ 1 2 z 1 ρ where n φ φ is the local interface normal the function h z 1 is used to localize the compression to the interface region 2 16 h z 1 tanh z 1 1 z 1 10 2 2 this function is effective only for mixture which means that the source term of the density correction equation 2 15 will be zero for single phase fluid the aforementioned proof of the conservation of the five equation model based on interface compression and density correction can refer to the literature shukla et al 2010 and will not be repeated here for the simulation of bubble pulsation process of undex the bubble motion period is much longer than that of shock wave and the time step size of explicit calculation scheme is very small so the number of calculated steps needed to simulate the movement of bubble collapse to water jet appearing are very large which is easily lead to interface dispersion if the interfacial dispersion effect is no effectively suppressed and properly treated the calculated results will become unreliable in order to demonstrate the importance of interface compression technique we take the simulation of bubble motion of 100 kg trinitrotoluene tnt explosion at 400 m water depth as an example the initial and boundary conditions can be referred to formula 3 7 but with an explosive bubble of 0 245 m radius fig 1 and fig 2 show density and pressure contours for bubble collapsed with and without interface compression respectively it can be seen that there is a serious dispersion effect at the gas water interface in the process of bubble shrinkage without compression treatment and it is difficult to capture the exact position of the gas water interface which lead to low pressure during the impact of water hammer fig 3 shows the time history curve of water jet pressure at the center of the left wall with and without compression treatment note that the peak pressure of water jet decreases from 77 7 mpa to 49 4 mpa with a decrease of 36 in the case of without compression treatment and the pressure curve is postponed at the case with compression in compare to case without compression the above two phenomena on the load curve can be explained from figs 1 and 2 firstly the jet tip just hit the left bubble wall at 81 9 ms in the case with compression and local high pressure area is produced after the jet impact at 79 8 ms in the case without compression secondly the density of jet tip during impact is higher in compression case compare to the without compression case 2 4 numerical discretization consider the governing system for a 2d arrangement in a consistent form as 2 17 q t f q x g q r s q 2 18

density correction treatment a standard second order finite difference method is used on pseudo time evolution which has been well described in the literature shukla 2010 in second order fv methods the left and right states of the riemann problem are reconstructed from the weno reconstruction akturk 2005 the reconstruction is commonly performed in characteristic space the variables are first decomposed into the respective characteristic fields and then reconstructed thereafter they are projected back into physical space shu 1999 for the two dimensional fv reconstruction it is computationally tedious because two one dimensional reconstructions will need to perform per grid point and a gaussian quadrature rule is used in multiple dimensions titarev 2004 the intercell flux of

j u i 1 2 j u i 1 2 j where u z 1 s z 1 and u s are used in numerical simulation the above introduction is the discrete format in the x direction and it can be analogous to the r direction as mentioned before the space discretization with five order weno reconstruction in order to retain uniformly high order of time accuracy the solution is advanced by 3rd order tvd runge kutta method shu 1988 2 5 solution procedures the integrated algorithm for compressible multi component flow can be summarized as follows the vector of state q ρ 1 z 1 ρ 2 z 2 ρ u ρ v ρ e z 1 are given at time step n

variables q i 1 2 y α and q i 1 2 y α using right eigenvectors f apply hllc riemann solver to the variables at each gaussian integration point then the flux at the cell faces f ˆ i 1 2 j can be calculated using gaussian quadrature method 2 the flux g ˆ i j 1 2 is obtained in entirely the same way 3 computer intermediate values q using 3rd order tvd runge kutta method 4 iterate interface function equation and density compression to steady state 5 obtain conserved variables q i j at the end of the time step 6 go to the first step and continue for the next time step 3 results and discussion in this section some numerical tests are performed to show the capability of the present numerical model for simulating gas water multicomponent compressible flows in undex first numerical results for 1d shock tube problems are compared to the exact solutions to evaluate the capabilities of capturing shock wave propagation and gas water interface movement second a 2d shock tube experiment involving multicomponent fluid interface is considered third 2d simulation of an undex near free surface is examined fourth the collapse of a cylindrical air bubble in water is studied finally an underwater explosion of an explosive near the wall is simulated in all the examples in this paper cfl is equal to 0 6 unless otherwise specified 3 1 one dimension shock tube problems in order to validate the ability of capturing shock wave and interface location a more difficult shock tube problem is gas liquid riemann problem used to simulate underwater explosions shyue 1998 cocchi

1 25 1 the computing field is 5 5 with 100 meshes and the initial interface position is in the middle of the length fig 4 shows the total density pressure velocity and volume fraction of gas profiles at time of 1 0 we note that the solutions computed using the interface compression technique keep a constant interface thickness of a few grid cells whereas the one without compression shows ongoing diffusion generally speaking the computed solution agrees well with the exact solution the shock wave speeds and interface between fluids are correct and there are no distinct oscillations near the interface next we consider a multicomponent sod problem with higher pressure and density ratios wackers 2005 3 2 ρ u p γ p l t 10 0 10 1 4 0 t ρ u p γ p r t 0 125 0 0 1 1 2 0 t the computing field number of meshes and initial interface position are the same as that of the above case fig 5 shows the total density pressure velocity and volume fraction of gas profiles at time of 1 6 note that without the interface compression treatment the density solution oscillates slightly on the other hand simulations with an interface compression technique show good agreement with the exact solution on the density and interface location results next let s consider a gas water shock interface interaction problem with high density ratios 3 3 ρ u p γ p l t 0 1 0 2 753 1 4 0 t ρ u p γ p r t 0 991 0 3 059 10 4 5 5 1 505 t the computing field number of meshes and initial interface position are the same as that of the above case fig 6 shows the total density pressure velocity and volume fraction of gas profiles at time 0 6 we also find that the density and the position accuracy of the interface near the boundary are improved by using the compression technique which is very important for the research of the complex motion of the interface for a long time 3 2 two dimensional shock bubble interaction problem the previous examples show that the present method can capture the correct wave speeds and interface movement in one dimensional problems we hope that this advantage can be maintained in two dimensional cases as well in this section we examine a mach 1 22 air shock induced collapse of a cylindrical refrigerant 22 r22 bubble to validate the present numerical model the experiment results can be found in refs haas and sturtevant 1987 the computed domain is 0 0 325 0 0 089 m2 with an 650 178 grid the cylindrical r22 is initially set at the origin with a diameter of 5 cm and the shock wave is initiated at x 0 2 the initial condition is described as 3 4 ρ u v p γ p 1 3764

to left for the purpose of comparison we present the results of experiment and simulation at different time in fig 7 which shows good agreement between the two 3 3 underwater explosion near free surface in this section a 2d underwater explosion problem is considered this problem involved in this case have been researched by many people daramizadeh et al 2015 saurel et al 2009 shukla et al 2010 and contain complex interaction between multicomponent compressible fluid and cavitation phenomena the rectangular computational domain is 2 2 1 5 1 5 using a 600 450 uniform grid a highly pressurized explosion gas cylinder of radius r 0 12 is located at the origin 0 0 3 in water the free surface is located at the straight line y 0 the reflecting boundary condition is put at the bottom while the other direction boundary conditions are non reflecting condition the initial condition is described as 3 5 ρ u v p γ p g t 1 241 0 0 2 753 1 4 0 t i f r 0 1 g a s ρ u v p γ p g t 0 001 0 0 3

the computed solutions are free of numerical oscillations 3 4 collapse of an air cavity in water this two dimensional test case is the collapse of an air cavity in water by a mach 1 72 this problem has been studied extensively johnsen and colonius 2006 shukla et al 2010 nourgaliev et al 2006 due to its application in a wide range of physical phenomena such as lithotripsy sonoluminescence and implosion in underwater engineering this example is very close to the phenomenon of underwater explosion bubble jet but the bubble collapse in this example is caused by the inhomogeneity of the pressure field caused by the initial explosion bubble energy and the surrounding boundary conditions a cylindrical air bubble is immersed in water in diameter of 6 mm the center of the bubble is located at 12 12 mm in the computational domain of size 24 24 mm a planar incident msh 1 72 shock wave is initially located 5 4 mm to the left of the air bubble center the initial condition is 3 6 ρ u v p γ p 1323 65 681 58 0 1 9 10 9 4 4 6 10 8 a f t e r w a v e 1000 0 0 1 0 10 5 4 4 6 10 8 t b e f o r e w a v e 1 0 0 1 0 10 5 1 4 0 t i n a i r c a v i t y the computational domain is discretized using a 600 600 uniform grid and cfl 0 6 is applied boundary conditions are periodical in the vertical direction and non reflection at the left and right boundaries of the domain fig 9 shows the density pressure and interface function contours at different times it can be seen that the interface remains thin throughout the simulation even after the cavity fragments during the process of water jet the simulation result shows no spurious oscillations and keeps its symmetry about y 0 which is in good agreement with the results of nourgaliev 2006 3 5 underwater explosion bubble jet near the wall when close enough to a solid boundary in the process of underwater explosion collapse of explosion bubble will occur with high speed jet formation the velocity and its gradient will change violently during bubble jet the bubble jet generally go through typical processes such as shrinkage surface depression jet tip acceleration jet impacting and splashing if the fine simulation is carried out a variety of factors need to be considered comprehensively which will bring challenges to the calculation in this section we attempt to use five equation model with compression treatment to analysis the phenomenon of underwater explosion bubble jet the two dimensional axisymmetric model and computational grid are shown in fig 10 the explosion of 200 g tnt charge with a radius of r0 30 mm explodes under 50 m deep water according to cole s theoretical formula the maximum radius of the bubble is about rmax 0 52 m and the bubble pulsation period is about 40 ms the initial distance l0 between the charge center and the wall is set to 0 416 m so the ratio of distance to radius is γ l0 rmax 0 8 the computation domain is the square domain 15 15 m2 the resulting grid allows for high resolution near the bubble and a coarse mesh far away because of the stretching a 600 500 non uniform grid is used in fig 10 which shows the computational domain for bubble jet collapse only one in ten meshes is included with the minimum mesh length of 4 mm the instantaneous detonation model is used for charge detonation and initial conditions of flow field can be given as 3 7 ρ u v p γ p 1630 0 0 3 7 10 9 1 25 0 f o r g a s 1000 0 0 6 10 5 4 4 6 15 10 8 f o r w a t e r fig 11 shows the initial stage of the explosion bubble pulsation which reaches the maximum volume at 21 2 ms and then the bubble begins to contract we can find that the bubble is not spherical when it expands to the maximum volume and the bubble wall near the left boundary is squeezed and deformed this is because the nearby fluid is discharged in the process of bubble expansion and the discharged fluid has a certain impact on the wall on the contrary because of the existence of the wall the fluid between the wall and the bubble wall has a certain impact effect on the bubble wall which leads to a high pressure region between the bubble and the wall therefore there is extrusion deformation on the bubble wall near the left boundary when the bubble expands to the maximum volume from the diagram of the density and pressure distribution at 38 ms in fig 11 it can be seen that there is an obvious high pressure area on the right of the bubble in the process of the bubble shrinkage and jet tip begins to appear which induced the phenomenon of water jet pointing to the left bubble boundary meanwhile the left bubble wall is close to the solid wall boundary and the movement is slow the main reason for the appearance of the jet is that the left wall boundary has different effects on the wall around the bubble which leads to the depression of the right wall of the bubble in contraction finally the formation of jet tip in bubble motion leads to the phenomenon of jet impact fig 12 shows that with the acceleration of the jet tip bubble jet becomes more and more obvious the front end of the jet is conical and impinged on the left bubble wall at 39 3 ms which will produce water hammer phenomenon after the impact of the water jet the local high pressure area is produced on the solid wall then the high pressure region begins to radiate in the surrounding flow meanwhile the conical water begins to move towards the bubble area after impact on the wall which results in vortex ring phenomenon as shown in fig 12 the next step is to start the second pulsation of the bubble in order to master the load characteristics of water jet on the wall fig 13 shows the pressure time history curves of the measured points in different distance ranges near the center point on the left rigid wall it can be seen that the peak pressure of water jet can maintain a high level in the region with a radius of 0 2 m near the center of the wall while the peak pressure decreases obviously at a radius of 0 5 m and the duration is relatively short fig 14 shows the equivalent radius of the explosion bubble volume and the corresponding expansion velocity time history curve where the bubble explosion velocity is positive and the velocity of bubble shrinkage is negative we can be see that when the bubble begins to expand the speed increases to the maximum in an instant and then the expansion speed decreases gradually when the bubble radius reaches the maximum the bubble expansion velocity is zero and then the bubble begins to contract and the expansion velocity is negative near the time when the conical jet hits the left wall the bubble shrinkage velocity reaches the maximum then the conical jet continues to impact and the bubble shrinkage rate decreases gradually in the process of vortex ring formation at 41 2 ms the bubble volume contracts to a minimum and then expands quickly because the transition from contraction to expansion is too fast the bubble expansion velocity increases rapidly as shown in fig 14 the above conclusions can also be obtained from time history of the equivalent radius of the explosion bubble and pressure on center point of the wall as shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the bubble volume is not the smallest when the jet begins to hit the bubble wall at the beginning of the jet impact the mass of the jet tip is small and higher water jet pressure can be achieved when the main part of the water jet hits the wall at 39 3 ms the peak pressure 49 0 mpa reached at 39 4 ms after the peak pressure 49 0 mpa is reached at 39 4 ms the pressure decreases gradually and the pressure is near the valley near the 40 2 ms combined with the density image of 40 2 ms in fig 12 it can be seen that most of the water layers on the right bubble wall collide with the left wall which makes the pressure of the water jet rise again in a short time the oscillatory phenomenon of water jet pressure on the wall is caused by the complex motion of gas water mixture with the release of water jet energy the pressure and velocity of jet decrease gradually from the whole process of bubble jet pressure curve the effective action time of water jet load is more than 3 0 ms fig 16 shows x direction velocity distribution in the flow before the conical water jet is about to hit the wall we can be see that the maximum velocity is more than 260 m s and the velocity of the main part or the water jet is more than 200 m s 4 conclusion underwater explosion undex bubble jet is investigated using numerical simulation by five equation model in view of the shortcoming in the calculation of bubble jet load in undex the interface function compression and density correcting technology are adapted in the model these compression treatments can effectively inhibit the interfacial dispersion effect in the evolution of bubble jet it can accurately capture the typical evolution processes such as the generation and development of water jet and the impact of water hammer the density pressure velocity and other variable can also be obtained the researches show that the action of water jet is mainly concentrated in a limited range and the peak pressure is large so the impact damage of water jet on nearby structures cannot be ignored the results of this paper preliminarily reveal the characteristics of water jet load caused by underwater explosion bubble collapse which can provide support for the study of water jet generation mechanism and damage effect the evaluation and analysis of structure damage caused by water jet load will be performed in the

21177,in this study the complicated behavior of three dimensional 3d water entry problems of an oblique cylinder into water is investigated using a free surface model an efficient free surface solver presented in a previous study for modeling ricochet problems nguyen et al 2020b is extended to the 3d numerical analysis of flow problems in the water entries of solid objects a numerical scheme is implemented on dynamic overset body fitted grids to facilitate flow simulations of the complex geometries and arbitrary motions of objects the numerical method is validated based on studies of grid convergence in water entry problems and via comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data in the literature the effects of the impact velocity and cylinder water density ratio on the motion behaviors of the cylinder are investigated the initial conditions and cylinder density are found to have a remarkable influence on the dynamics of the cylinder through which the physical context of the problem is more clearly observed graphical abstract image 1 keywords free surface flow dynamic grid overset grid 6 dof water entry free falling cylinder 1 introduction the water entries of objects have been extensively researched for more than a century nevertheless they remain a popular topic in current research owing to their practical application in relevant problems in hydraulic and industrial engineering and natural science as well as in naval technologies such as ship slamming aerospace structures the ditching of an airplane on the sea and air to sea projectiles a detailed understanding of the behaviors of freely falling objects into a steady liquid is indispensable for the design and operation of relevant systems early investigations on the water entry problem mainly used experimental and theoretical approaches to measure and predict the maximum impact forces arising during water entries of different objects as well as to observe physical aspects of the problem worthington 1908 summarized studies providing splash photographs for water entry problems regarding rigid objects subsequently many other studies also addressed the characteristics of this phenomenon may reviewed many experimental studies on water entry to discuss the effects of different parameters on cavity formation von karman von karman 1929 studied the impact loads on seaplane floats during water landings using the added mass concept and linearized free surface boundary conditions theoretical solutions based on analytical expressions and simplified mathematical and physical assumptions have also been developed for calculating the characteristic factors of water entries such as the vertical impact force slamming coefficient and wetting factor of simple bodies miloh 1991 wagner 1932 an excellent review study regarding the problem has also been reported a a korobkin and pukhnachov 1988 investigations of water entries and their relevant problems based on both experimental and numerical approaches have received increasing attention in recent years interested readers are recommended to review recent overview studies dias and ghidaglia 2018 seddon and moatamedi 2006 truscott et al 2014 with specific regard to applications for offshore equipment and structures such as air to sea projectiles drilling pipes submerged containers ship hulls and underwater vehicles the water entry problems of cylinders with circular sections or nearly circular sections have been investigated in several studies kiara et al 2017 malvandi et al 2016 nguyen et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 theoretical solutions are based on simplified assumptions and are only applicable to problems concerning simple shapes studies based on experimental approaches often provide reliable results for problems however experimental research is quite expensive and often requires a long operation setup the development of numerical methods has been receiving increased research attention owing to the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics corresponding to elaborate the analysis of physical insights into water entry problems most investigations are based on simplified two dimensional 2d problems due to both the complex hydrodynamic characteristics of the water entry problem as well as the expensive cost of computational fluid dynamics simulations with expanding computer capabilities 3d simulations of both water entries of a horizontal cylinder and oblique cylinder have also recently been performed and the influences of the initial velocity conditions and cylinder characteristics on the behaviors of the water entries of horizontal cylinders were investigated sun et al 2018 wen and qiu 2018 xiang et al 2020 however 3d simulations constitute more complicated challenges and a vast area that is yet to be fully understood to our knowledge although simulations of water entries of oblique cylinders have been reported there remains a lack of investigations providing analyses on the effects of the factors affecting the water entries of oblique cylinders in this paper an efficient free surface solver is presented as extended for a 3d numerical analysis of a water entry problem a study of grid convergence is conducted considering the water entry problem of a circular cylinder and then validated comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data in the literature confirm the capabilities of the numerical method for complex simulations of a freely falling cylinder a water entry complicated by arbitrary motions of the object leads to a complex interaction between the solid and fluids especially in the very early stages of impact the effects of the initial velocity conditions and cylinder water density ratio on the motion behaviors of the cylinder such as vertical and horizontal displacements and rotational and translational motions are also presented the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the mathematical formulations summarizing the governing system and numerical solution procedure are presented section 3 provides a discussion of the numerical results including the validation of the numerical method and analyses regarding the influences of the initial entry velocity and density of the cylinder on the behavior of the water entry section 4 provides a conclusion summarizing the contributions of the work and a brief observation of the physical picture of the water entry problem of the cylinder 2 mathematical formulations and numerical implementation 2 1 governing equations we consider the 3d water entry problems of an oblique cylinder as shown in fig 1 freely falling into water under the effects of different initial entry velocities and cylinder densities herein the fluid flows are solved by an efficient free surface flow model as recently developed in a general curvilinear coordinate system nguyen et al 2020b the fluids are assumed using isothermal compressibility the tait equation of state eos which is

of the fluid that governs the compressibility of the fluid ρ 0 is the liquid reference density and γ is the heat capacity ratio relative to the eos and properties of the liquid under standard atmospheric conditions the properties of the water can be chosen as follows ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 γ 7 15 and c 1500 m s according to the selections a constant value of b ρ 0 c 2 γ can be obtained as the speed of sound in water is very high relative to the low mach number flows in the hydraulic and hydrodynamic applications of free surface flow problems owing to the courant friedrichs lewy stability criterion the time step is limited by the maximum eigenvalue of the hyperbolic system and a large accumulation of numerical dissipation error scan occur because of the low mach number to alleviate this limitation the mach number can be artificially set in the range of 0 1 0 3 subsequently with the artificial mach number the bulk modulus can be calculated as b ρ 0 u r e f 2 γ m 2 where u r e f

solution of the free surface flow model as expressed in eq 3 in compact vector form a finite volume riemann scheme nguyen et al 2016 2020a nguyen and park 2016 is used to discretize the model into a general structured body fitted grid an associated godunov type numerical scheme based on the characteristic wavelength information of the system is used to discretize the convective flux derivatives the convective flux vector is discretized using a cell centered finite volume procedure the flux at the cell interface is computed based on extrapolated riemann variables obtained by a monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws muscl procedure with flux limiters to obtain a sharp interface the compressive limiters can be used for extrapolated variables of the density and volume fraction in this numerical model the spatial discretization can achieve second order accuracy overall with the third order accuracy muscl procedure for time discretization a third order total variation diminishing runge kutta method is used a dynamic overset grid modeling strategy is applied during the simulation of the free falling water entry problems works nguyen et al 2016 the overset grid technique uses an overlapping grid system as shown in fig 1 including body fitted grids around solid objects and a background grid covering the entire computational domain the grids are allowed to arbitrarily overlap move and split each other facilitating simulation of the water entries of the freely falling bodies in large domains and modeling of their arbitrary motions 2 2 2 modeling of six degree of freedom nonlinear rigid body motions as objects freely fall into calm liquids the dynamics of the body are mainly governed by the combined hydrodynamic impacts of the liquids as well as various external forces and moments the flow becomes complicated from the water impact as well as from the unsteadiness of the arbitrary translational and rotational motions of the bodies a coupling algorithm for the fluid body interaction is integrated into the flow solver as shown in fig 2 a six degree of freedom 6 dof nonlinear rigid body motion system is solved to model the motion of the solid body to solve the system the fluid body interactions resulting in hydrodynamic forces and moments on the body are calculated based on the pressure and velocity fields of the flows around the body subsequently the positions and orientation of the body can be updated based on the body motions the entire dynamic overset grid system is displaced according to the motions of the body the body fitted subgrids are both translated and rotated with the position and orientation of the body whereas the background grid is only moved with the translational movements of the body for the simulation of large movements of an object the background grid does not require a large domain covering the entire trajectory of the object as the far field wake flows may not significantly affect the motion of the object therefore the simulation of the large displacement of a body can be performed without requiring large computational domains thereby increasing the computational performance the 6 dof nonlinear rigid body motion system is solved to determine the motions positions and orientation of the body details of the system can be found in our previous works nguyen et al 2016 two coordinate systems are used to solve the 6 dof equation in which one system is earth fixed system x e y e z e and the other is a body fixed system x b y b z b see fig 3 a the nonlinear rigid body motion equations are formulated based on newton s second law of motion and on the conservation of linear and angular momentum as follows 6 m r b f b 0 7 m r b f b r b 0 where m is mass of the body r b is the resulting acceleration of the rigid body and f b denotes the total forces acting on the body eqs 6 and 7 can be rewritten with respect to the linear velocity v b u b v b w b angular velocity ω b p b q b r b linear acceleration a b v b and angular acceleration α b ω b of the rigid body in the body fixed reference frame as follows 8 m a b 2 m ω b v b m α b r b m ω b ω b r b f b 0 and 9 m a b 2 m ω b v b m α b r b m ω b ω b r b f b r b 0 the nonlinear rigid body motion equations can be rewritten in vector form as follows 10 a b s b f b b ic where s b u b v b w b p b q b r b t a b is the characteristic matrix of a rigid body b ic is the inertial coupling vector and f b is a vector containing the applied forces and moments the effects of the flow on the rigid body are considered by

entry of the free falling cylinder are presented along with comparisons of the present computations with available experimental data from wei and hu wei and hu 2014 2015 the experiments were used to validate the capabilities of numerical methods in regards to water entry flows iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 wen and qiu 2018 aspects of the model and studied cases in this section are set as follows i the circular cylinder has a diameter of d 50 m m and a length of l 200 m m ii the density ratio between the cylinder and water is ρ s ρ w 1 37 iii there are three cases of water entries at initial angles of θ 0 0 55 6 a n d 87 4 and different initial velocities the motion of the cylinder comprises freely falling into the water under gravity in the simulations the bodies were placed immediately above the free surface the initial setup is shown in fig 3 the simulation was started as soon as the wedge touched the free surface the hydrostatic pressure was set as the initial pressure in fig 3 b the motions of the water entries oblique cylinder can be reduced 3 dof however a 6 dof nonlinear rigid body motion system was solved for generally modeling the motions of the cylinder in this study after the six components of the hydrodynamic force and moment were determined the motions positions and orientation of the body were calculated by solving the dynamic equations motions a grid convergence study was performed in which the grid size was gradually reduced until the numerical results converged and until no remarkable changes were found between the results from the finest grids fig 4 shows the results of the grid convergence study for the cylinder depth versus time in the case of water entry at an initial angle of θ 0 0 and initial velocity of u 0 6 22 m s in general the numerical results are consistent with the experimental data however due to the different setup conditions a slight difference was found between the predicted and experimental data this was also observed in another study using a volume of fluid approach iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 fig 5 shows visual comparisons of the numerical and experimental images in cases at an initial angle of θ 0 87 4 and an initial velocity of u 0 6 11 m s in this figure two typical stages are shown the first column shows the experimental images the second is an overlapping image of the numerical iso surface results and experimental images the last column shows top views from the numerical simulation owing to the impact of the cylinder water splashes up from the free surface forming a splash crown with thin jets that develops radially and upwards owing to the oblique entry both the splash crown and cavity grow asymmetrically and the thin splash subsequently spreads and breaks into small drops of spray the predicted splash crown and cavity shapes qualitatively agree well with the experimental images although the thin jets and drops cannot be captured by the simulation as the grid resolution is insufficient fig 6 shows velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder during the water entry the cylinder impacts the free surface inducing a high pressure region and the pressure wave radially propagates down as the cylinder penetrating the water velocity streamlines show that the fluid beside the cylinder tends to move up while fluid under the cylinder moves down an asymmetric cavity grows and one side of the cylinder interacts with and leans the cavity wall during the water entry the interaction causes a high pressure region on the cylinder surface as shown in fig 7 this is one of the main reasons inducing moment of the cylinder and changes the orientation of the cylinder fig 8 shows a similar phenomenon however the cavity is divided into two parts by a cross line starting from the lowest edge of the cylinder a good agreement between the predicted and the experimental results is obtained velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder during the water entry are also shown in fig 9 it can see the cavity separation that separates the cavity above the upper part of the cylinder the pressure is higher on the lower part of the cylinder during the entry the distribution of pressure is the main aspect that controls the orientation of the cylinder figs 10 12 show quantitative comparisons of the translational and angular velocities and rotational angles of the cylinder between the predicted and experimental results in the two cases at initial angles of θ 0 55 6 87 4 and an initial velocity of u 0 6 11 m s the numerical predictions from a constrained interpolation profile based method wen and qiu 2018 show a trend similar to that of the experimental results but are somehow overpredicted in contrast all the numerical results for quantities from the present method match well with the experimental data however there is only a slight discrepancy in the rotational velocity of the cylinder the set of comparisons demonstrate the ability of the present numerical method to solve the water entry problem in the following sections this numerical method is used to investigate the influences of the initial conditions and different densities of the cylinder on the behaviors of the body 3 2 influence of initial entry velocity in this section a numerical investigation was conducted on water entries of the cylinder at different initial velocities to explore the relationships between the water entry behaviors and velocities the effects of the initial velocities on the cylinder s motions including horizontal and vertical displacements as well as rotational angles of the cylinder during the water entries were studied numerical simulations were performed for a cylinder with a density ratio of ρ s ρ w 1 37 dropped horizontally and obliquely into the water at the initial velocities non dimensional analyses using the cylinder diameter d for length charateristics and the initial velocity u 0 were also applied to evaluate these effects more precisely and consistently first the water entries of the horizontal cylinder were simulated at seven velocities 2 3 4 6 22 8 0 10 0 and 15 0 m s fig 13 shows the vertical displacements and velocities versus time for the water entries of the horizontal cylinder the non dimensional analyses show that the nondimensional parameters at different initial velocities are similar the behaviors of water entries in a narrow range from 4 37 m s to 6 22 m s were also obtained in a previous study iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 however in this study it is found that when the velocity is reduced to 2 0 m s the cavity quickly seals and the nondimensional parameters are no longer similar to the one in the other cases based on the data two empirical formulas for the nondimensional displacement and velocity in a limited range from 3 m s to 15 m s can be obtained as follows 13 z d 0 0009 t u 0 d 3 0 0331 t u 0 d 2 0 7154 t u 0 d 0 4412 14 u u 0 0 0008 t u 0 d 3 0 0178 t u 0 d 2 0 146 t u 0 d 0 8239 comparisons of the numerical results and the results using eqs 13 and 14 are shown in fig 14 the behaviors of the water entries of the cylinder can be quickly investigated at various initial velocities using the approximation formulas second the water entries of the oblique cylinder were simulated at the three velocities 6 11 8 0 and 10 0 m s the initial entry angle of the cylinder was 55 6 fig 15 shows velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder as well as cavity evolution during the water entry at the three different velocities it can see that the cavity evolution pressure distribution and velocity streamlines at the same nondimensionalized times are not much different in all cases figs 16 20 show the effects of the initial velocities on the cylinder s motion as shown in fig 16 the initial velocity has less of an effect on the non dimensional vertical displacement of the cylinder especially at the early stages however it strongly affects the horizontal displacement during the water entries in fig 17 the velocities of the cylinder during the water entry also show similar behavior the vertical velocities are similar until t 6 while the horizontal velocities are different right after t 2 the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces and moment along x direction are shown in figs 18 and 19 even though the moments are much different in the period t 1 0 to 2 0 the orientation of the cylinder in fig 20 starts to vary differently between each case during the water entries 3 3 influence of density of the cylinder a numerical investigation of water entry of a cylinder at an initial velocity of 6 11 m s was conducted to explore the relationship between the water entry behavior and cylinder density variations the effects of the cylinder densities on the cylinder motion during the water entries were studied numerical simulations of cylinders with density ratios of ρ s ρ w 0 5 1 37 3 0 and 6 0 dropped into the water were performed non dimensional analyses were also conducted to evaluate these effects fig 21 shows the displacement of the horizontal cylinder versus time for water entry the density of the cylinder considerably affects the behavior of the cylinder and that a cylinder with a larger density ratio rapidly penetrates the water fig 22 shows velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder as well as the cavity evolution during the water entry at the three different velocities it can see that the velocity streamlines vary with a similar trend while the cavity evolution and pressure distribution at the same nondimensionalized times are different in all cases the cavities are larger and the pressure on the cylinder is also higher in case of high density ratio figs 23 27 show the effects of the density of the cylinder on its motions during the water entries at an initial angle of 55 6 fig 23 shows the vertical and horizontal displacements during the water entries it can see a similar trend of vertical displacements for the water entry of the oblique cylinder for horizontal displacements a heavier cylinder moves slower but a lighter cylinder e g ρ s ρ w 1 37 moves faster only in the early stages the heavier cylinders keep moving due to high inertia similarly the density of the cylinder strongly affects the velocity hydrodynamic forces as well as the rotational moment and orientation of the cylinder according to the results a lighter cylinder rotates faster 4 conclusion in this study a newly developed 2d free surface solver with a solid body motion modeling system from a previous study nguyen et al 2020b was extended for a 3d numerical analysis of flow problems in the water entries of solid objects the numerical method results were compared with experimental results available in the literature to quantitatively and qualitatively validate the numerical solution procedure for similar types of freely oblique falling problem a good agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental data was obtained furthermore factors such as the initial entry velocity and the density of the cylinder were investigated to observe the significant effects of the different factors on the non dimensional vertical and horizontal displacements and rotational motion through the predicted results and analyses a physical understanding of the water entry problems can be obtained and some conclusions can be drawn as follows i non dimensional analyses of the velocity and depth of a cylinder during water entries could be used to provide approximation formulas for easily obtaining approximated results of these parameters at various initial velocities without excessive numerical simulations ii both the initial water entry condition and cylinder water density ratio had remarkable influences on the behavior of the cylinder s water entry iii the non dimensional depth of the cylinder almost remains constant in cases of water entries of a horizontal cylinder but begins to show a discrepancy after large rotations of the cylinder in cases of oblique cylinders iv for an oblique cylinder water entry at a larger initial entry velocity the horizontal displacement is larger and the cylinder rotates less and v all of the analyzed parameters can vary significantly e g as the cylinder density varies a heavier cylinder moves faster both horizontally and vertically but rotates slower credit authorship contribution statement van tu nguyen conceptualization project administration

context of the problem is more clearly observed graphical abstract image 1 keywords free surface flow dynamic grid overset grid 6 dof water entry free falling cylinder 1 introduction the water entries of objects have been extensively researched for more than a century nevertheless they remain a popular topic in current research owing to their practical application in relevant problems in hydraulic and industrial engineering and natural science as well as in naval technologies such as ship slamming aerospace structures the ditching of an airplane on the sea and air to sea projectiles a detailed understanding of the behaviors of freely falling objects into a steady liquid is indispensable for the design and operation of relevant systems early investigations on the water entry problem mainly used experimental and theoretical approaches to measure and predict the maximum impact forces arising during water entries of different objects as well as to observe physical aspects of the problem worthington 1908 summarized studies providing splash photographs for water entry problems regarding rigid objects subsequently many other studies also addressed the characteristics of this phenomenon may reviewed many experimental studies on water entry to discuss the effects of different parameters on cavity formation von karman von karman 1929 studied the impact loads on seaplane floats during water landings using the added mass concept and linearized free surface boundary conditions theoretical solutions based on analytical expressions and simplified mathematical and physical assumptions have also been developed for calculating the characteristic factors of water entries such as the vertical impact force slamming coefficient and wetting factor of simple bodies miloh 1991 wagner 1932 an excellent review study regarding the problem has also been reported a a korobkin and pukhnachov 1988 investigations of water entries and their relevant problems based on both experimental and numerical approaches have received increasing attention in recent years interested readers are recommended to review recent overview studies dias and ghidaglia 2018 seddon and moatamedi 2006 truscott et al 2014 with specific regard to applications for offshore equipment and structures such as air to sea projectiles drilling pipes submerged containers ship hulls and underwater vehicles the water entry problems of cylinders with circular sections or nearly circular sections have been investigated in several studies kiara et al 2017 malvandi et al 2016 nguyen et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 theoretical solutions are based on simplified assumptions and are only applicable to problems concerning simple shapes studies based on experimental approaches often provide reliable results for problems however experimental research is quite expensive and often requires a long operation setup the development of numerical methods has been receiving increased research attention owing to the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics corresponding to elaborate the analysis of physical insights into water entry problems most investigations are based on simplified two dimensional 2d problems due to both the complex hydrodynamic characteristics of the water entry problem as well as the expensive cost of computational fluid dynamics simulations with expanding computer capabilities 3d simulations of both water entries of a horizontal cylinder and oblique cylinder have also recently been performed and the influences of the initial velocity conditions and cylinder characteristics on the behaviors of the water entries of horizontal cylinders were investigated sun et al 2018 wen and qiu 2018 xiang et al 2020 however 3d simulations constitute more complicated challenges and a vast area that is yet to be fully understood to our knowledge although simulations of water entries of oblique cylinders have been reported there remains a lack of investigations providing analyses on the effects of the factors affecting the water entries of oblique cylinders in this paper an efficient free surface solver is presented as extended for a 3d numerical analysis of a water entry problem a study of grid convergence is conducted considering the water entry problem of a circular cylinder and then validated comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data in the literature confirm the capabilities of the numerical method for complex simulations of a freely falling cylinder a water entry complicated by arbitrary motions of the object leads to a complex interaction between the solid and fluids especially in the very early stages of impact the effects of the initial velocity conditions and cylinder water density ratio on the motion behaviors of the cylinder such as vertical and horizontal displacements and rotational and translational motions are also presented the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the mathematical formulations summarizing the governing system and numerical solution procedure are presented section 3 provides a discussion of the numerical results including the validation of the numerical method and analyses regarding the influences of the initial entry velocity and density of the cylinder on the behavior of the water entry section 4 provides a conclusion summarizing the contributions of the work and a brief observation of the physical picture of the water entry problem of the cylinder 2 mathematical formulations and numerical implementation 2 1 governing equations we consider the 3d water entry problems of an oblique cylinder as shown in fig 1 freely falling into water under the effects of different initial entry velocities and cylinder densities herein the fluid flows are solved by an efficient free

entry of the free falling cylinder are presented along with comparisons of the present computations with available experimental data from wei and hu wei and hu 2014 2015 the experiments were used to validate the capabilities of numerical methods in regards to water entry flows iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 wen and qiu 2018 aspects of the model and studied cases in this section are set as follows i the circular cylinder has a diameter of d 50 m m and a length of l 200 m m ii the density ratio between the cylinder and water is ρ s ρ w 1 37 iii there are three cases of water entries at initial angles of θ 0 0 55 6 a n d 87 4 and different initial velocities the motion of the cylinder comprises freely falling into the water under gravity in the simulations the bodies were placed immediately above the free surface the initial setup is shown in fig 3 the simulation was started as soon as the wedge touched the free surface the hydrostatic pressure was set as the initial pressure in fig 3 b the motions of the water entries oblique cylinder can be reduced 3 dof however a 6 dof nonlinear rigid body motion system was solved for generally modeling the motions of the cylinder in this study after the six components of the hydrodynamic force and moment were determined the motions positions and orientation of the body were calculated by solving the dynamic equations motions a grid convergence study was performed in which the grid size was gradually reduced until the numerical results converged and until no remarkable changes were found between the results from the finest grids fig 4 shows the results of the grid convergence study for the cylinder depth versus time in the case of water entry at an initial angle of θ 0 0 and initial velocity of u 0 6 22 m s in general the numerical results are consistent with the experimental data however due to the different setup conditions a slight difference was found between the predicted and experimental data this was also observed in another study using a volume of fluid approach iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 fig 5 shows visual comparisons of the numerical and experimental images in cases at an initial angle of θ 0 87 4 and an initial velocity of u 0 6 11 m s in this figure two typical stages are shown the first column shows the experimental images the second is an overlapping image of the numerical iso surface results and experimental images the last column shows top views from the numerical simulation owing to the impact of the cylinder water splashes up from the free surface forming a splash crown with thin jets that develops radially and upwards owing to the oblique entry both the splash crown and cavity grow asymmetrically and the thin splash subsequently spreads and breaks into small drops of spray the predicted splash crown and cavity shapes qualitatively agree well with the experimental images although the thin jets and drops cannot be captured by the simulation as the grid resolution is insufficient fig 6 shows velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder during the water entry the cylinder impacts the free surface inducing a high pressure region and the pressure wave radially propagates down as the cylinder penetrating the water velocity streamlines show that the fluid beside the cylinder tends to move up while fluid under the cylinder moves down an asymmetric cavity grows and one side of the cylinder interacts with and leans the cavity wall during the water entry the interaction causes a high pressure region on the cylinder surface as shown in fig 7 this is one of the main reasons inducing moment of the cylinder and changes the orientation of the cylinder fig 8 shows a similar phenomenon however the cavity is divided into two parts by a cross line starting from the lowest edge of the cylinder a good agreement between the predicted and the experimental results is obtained velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder during the water entry are also shown in fig 9 it can see the cavity separation that separates the cavity above the upper part of the cylinder the pressure is higher on the lower part of the cylinder during the entry the distribution of pressure is the main aspect that controls the orientation of the cylinder figs 10 12 show quantitative comparisons of the translational and angular velocities and rotational angles of the cylinder between the predicted and experimental results in the two cases at initial angles of θ 0 55 6 87 4 and an initial velocity of u 0 6 11 m s the numerical predictions from a constrained interpolation profile based method wen and qiu 2018 show a trend similar to that of the experimental results but are somehow overpredicted in contrast all the numerical results for quantities from the present method match well with the experimental data however there is only a slight discrepancy in the rotational velocity of the cylinder the set of comparisons demonstrate the ability of the present numerical method to solve the water entry problem in the following sections this numerical method is used to investigate the influences of the initial conditions and different densities of the cylinder on the behaviors of the body 3 2 influence of initial entry velocity in this section a numerical investigation was conducted on water entries of the cylinder at different initial velocities to explore the relationships between the water entry behaviors and velocities the effects of the initial velocities on the cylinder s motions including horizontal and vertical displacements as well as rotational angles of the cylinder during the water entries were studied numerical simulations were performed for a cylinder with a density ratio of ρ s ρ w 1 37 dropped horizontally and obliquely into the water at the initial velocities non dimensional analyses using the cylinder diameter d for length charateristics and the initial velocity u 0 were also applied to evaluate these effects more precisely and consistently first the water entries of the horizontal cylinder were simulated at seven velocities 2 3 4 6 22 8 0 10 0 and 15 0 m s fig 13 shows the vertical displacements and velocities versus time for the water entries of the horizontal cylinder the non dimensional analyses show that the nondimensional parameters at different initial velocities are similar the behaviors of water entries in a narrow range from 4 37 m s to 6 22 m s were also obtained in a previous study iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 however in this study it is found that when the velocity is reduced to 2 0 m s the cavity quickly seals and the nondimensional parameters are no longer similar to the one in the other cases based on the data two empirical formulas for the nondimensional displacement and velocity in a limited range from 3 m s to 15 m s can be obtained as follows 13 z d 0 0009 t u 0 d 3 0 0331 t u 0 d 2 0 7154 t u 0 d 0 4412 14 u u 0 0 0008 t u 0 d 3 0 0178 t u 0 d 2 0 146 t u 0 d 0 8239 comparisons of the numerical results and the results using eqs 13 and 14 are shown in fig 14 the behaviors of the water entries of the cylinder can be quickly investigated at various initial velocities using the approximation formulas second the water entries of the oblique cylinder were simulated at the three velocities 6 11 8 0 and 10 0 m s the initial entry angle of the cylinder was 55 6 fig 15 shows velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder as well as cavity evolution during the water entry at the three different velocities it can see that the cavity evolution pressure distribution and velocity streamlines at the same nondimensionalized times are not much different in all cases figs 16 20 show the effects of the initial velocities on the cylinder s motion as shown in fig 16 the initial velocity has less of an effect on the non dimensional vertical displacement of the cylinder especially at the early stages however it strongly affects the horizontal displacement during the water entries in fig 17 the velocities of the cylinder during the water entry also show similar behavior the vertical velocities are similar until t 6 while the horizontal velocities are different right after t 2 the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces and moment along x direction are shown in figs 18 and 19 even though the moments are much different in the period t 1 0 to 2 0 the orientation of the cylinder in fig 20 starts to vary differently between each case during the water entries 3 3 influence of density of the cylinder a numerical investigation of water entry of a cylinder at an initial velocity of 6 11 m s was conducted to explore the relationship between the water entry behavior and cylinder density variations the effects of the cylinder densities on the cylinder motion during the water entries were studied numerical simulations of cylinders with density ratios of ρ s ρ w 0 5 1 37 3 0 and 6 0 dropped into the water were performed non dimensional analyses were also conducted to evaluate these effects fig 21 shows the displacement of the horizontal cylinder versus time for water entry the density of the cylinder considerably affects the behavior of the cylinder and that a cylinder with a larger density ratio rapidly penetrates the water fig 22 shows velocity streamlines and pressure distribution around and on the cylinder as well as the cavity evolution during the water entry at the three different velocities it can see that the velocity streamlines vary with a similar trend while the cavity evolution and pressure distribution at the same nondimensionalized times are different in all cases the cavities are larger and the pressure on the cylinder is also higher in case of high density ratio figs 23 27 show the effects of the density of the cylinder on its motions during the water entries at an initial angle of 55 6 fig 23 shows the vertical and horizontal displacements during the water entries it can see a similar trend of vertical displacements for the water entry of the oblique cylinder for horizontal displacements a heavier cylinder moves slower but a lighter cylinder e g ρ s ρ w 1 37 moves faster only in the early stages the heavier cylinders keep moving due to high inertia similarly the density of the cylinder strongly affects the velocity hydrodynamic forces as well as the rotational moment and orientation of the cylinder according to the results a lighter cylinder rotates faster 4 conclusion in this study a newly developed 2d free surface solver with a solid body motion modeling system from a previous study nguyen et al 2020b was extended for a 3d numerical analysis of flow problems in the water entries of solid objects the numerical method results were compared with experimental results available in the literature to quantitatively and qualitatively validate the numerical solution procedure for similar types of freely oblique falling problem a good agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental data was obtained furthermore factors such as the initial entry velocity and the density of the cylinder were investigated to observe the significant effects of the different factors on the non dimensional vertical and horizontal displacements and rotational motion through the predicted results and analyses a physical understanding of the water entry problems can be obtained and some conclusions can be drawn as follows i non dimensional analyses of the velocity and depth of a cylinder during water entries could be used to provide approximation formulas for easily obtaining approximated results of these parameters at various initial velocities without excessive numerical simulations ii both the initial water entry condition and cylinder water density ratio had remarkable influences on the behavior of the cylinder s water entry iii the non dimensional depth of the cylinder almost remains constant in cases of water entries of a horizontal cylinder but begins to show a discrepancy after large rotations of the cylinder in cases of oblique cylinders iv for an oblique cylinder water entry at a larger initial entry velocity the horizontal displacement is larger and the cylinder rotates less and v all of the analyzed parameters can vary significantly e g as the cylinder density varies a heavier cylinder moves faster both horizontally and vertically but rotates slower credit authorship contribution statement van tu nguyen conceptualization project administration

cho et al 2019 the pipeline transportation system connects the sea surface mining vessel and the seabed mining robot through a flexible hose a rigid pipe and a buffer the internal flow is an important topic in the deep sea mining pipeline transportation system research dai et al 2019 the impact of internal flow was negligible compared to other loads moreover some research in the deep sea mining pipeline fluid structure coupling mechanics simply regards the particle flow as a uniform density bingham fluid which is a single phase pseudo fluid wang et al 2012 the internal flow transported by the pipeline contains seawater seabed sediment and mineral nodules which is a typical solid liquid two phase mixed flow yang and liu 2018 it is difficult to directly manipulate the relevant mining equipment and carry out costly in situ tests due to the particularity and complexity of the deep sea operating environment yu et al 2018 therefore computer modeling and simulation is commonly used in deep sea mining system research yoon et al 2010 used fluent to perform simulations of the two phase flow in lift pumps and flexible hoses based on cfd the superiority of the increased flowrate method in terms of piping design was verified kang et al 2019 the cfd software fluent contains some multi phase flow calculation models include vof mixture eulerian and dpm models which are widely used in

van wijk j m et al de hoog et al 2020 studied particle degradation under particle wall and particle particle interactions in this study a laboratory lifting pipeline simulation test platform will be used to conduct experimental research on the motion law of the particle seawater two phase flow in the pipeline and the pipeline hydraulic lifting parameters 2 internal flow field analysis the stress situation of the pipeline transportation system is extremely complicated in the process of mining the pipeline is not only affected by the sea surface mining vessel and the seabed mining robot but also by the forces of gravity buoyancy seawater pressure ocean current hydrodynamics and fluid movement in the pipeline based on the above considerations a computer simulation analysis was carried out to explore the characteristics and effects of the internal flow 2 1 two phase flow model by ignoring the impact of other impurities the fluid in the pipeline is simplified into a particle seawater two phase flow model as shown in fig 1 the physical density of the particle phase is 2000 kg m3 and the density of seawater is 1025 kg m3 the core of the calculation lies in the treatment of solid phase particles in this paper the cfd dem coupling method is used to simulate the flow of particles and seawater in the lifting pipeline through the coupling of fluent and edem combining the advantages of the two software this method can not only obtain the information of the flow field and the physical field of the particles but also show the interactions among the particles the fluid and the walls 2 1 1 manganese nodule particle parameters in the deep sea mining system the mineral particles are mainly solid mineral nodule crushed particles which have complex types and wide particle size ranges there are usually bulk nodules in the mining process when the diameter is greater than 40 mm the power consumption will be increased and even the pipeline blockage will happen affecting the pipeline system transportation before entering the conveying system the large nodules must be broken to smaller particle size but not excessively broken as too small particles will be discharged as sludge resulting in a large waste of resources therefore the requirements of the deep sea mining process for the crusher is to control the diameter of the manganese nodule particles between 5 and 40 mm besides to ensure the transportation efficiency of the pipeline and avoid excessive collision and friction between the particles and the pipe wall the particle size of the manganese nodule particles should be controlled within 30 mm so the diameter of nodule particles in the simulation is 5 30 mm according to the production technical requirements of the pilot test system its production capacity is 30 t h dry nodules or 43 t h wet nodules after calculation and analysis the flow rate of the slurry transported by the system is 300 m3 h when the volume concentration is about 5 it can meet the requirements to improve the transportation efficiency and avoid pipeline blockage after comprehensive consideration the volume concentration of particle transportation in this simulation is 6 9 12 and the internal flow velocity is set to 2 m s 2 5 m s 3 m s 3 5 m s in actual engineering systems vertical pipes are part of a larger system with flexible jumpers or buffer and feed systems in order to reflect the impact of this situation on transportation and pipeline wear numerical simulations of the asymmetric particle concentration distribution at the entrance are also set under the condition that the overall integral number is 6 2 1 2 force model between particles the common particle to particle contact in the discrete element simplifies two contact models the hardball model and the softball model the hardball model does not consider the details of particle deformation and mutual contact force and is mainly used for fast low concentration particle flow simulation the softball model simplifies the normal force between particles to spring damping and coupler and the tangential force to spring damping and slider the contact force is calculated based on the normal overlap and tangential displacement between particles which is widely applicable to engineering practice in the transportation of manganese nodules complex collisions will occur between the particles the flow field inside the pipeline can be studied and analyzed through the softball model fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of the hertz mindlin contact model the hertz mindlin contact model is widely used in many situations such as calculating elastic velocities of sandstone and the initial sand pack modulus of the soft sand stiff sand and intermediate stiff sand models it has the advantages of accuracy and efficiency in calculating the force between particles however when mixed minerals in rocks are quite different the hertz mindlin contact model of a single type of grain may not be enough to predict elastic velocity besides the hertz mindlin contact model does not consider the degradation process of particles and the adhesion of particles due to moisture in the liquid environment since the degradation of manganese nodules is relatively slighter than that of other minerals such as quartz sand the hertz mindlin contact model is selected for the convenience and efficiency of calculation a large number of studies have completed the detailed derivation and calculation of the contact force model between particles and have studied the application calculation for particle flow and other direction cundall and strack 1979 sakaguchi et al 1993 based on the past calculation and research work on particle contact force the formulas for the contact force and damping component between particle a and particle b are as follows 1 f n 4 3 e e q r e q 1 2 δ n 3 2 2 1 e e q 1 ν a 2 e a 1 ν b 2 e b 3 1 r e q 1 r a 1 r b where e e q is the equivalent young s modulus r e q is the

component of relative velocity 2 1 3 cfd dem coupling principle in the coupled simulation calculation the liquid field is first initialized in fluent and the updated flow field information is transferred to the edem by solving the navier stokes continuity equation and momentum equation within one time step the dem module in edem calculates the motion equation of the particles by analyzing the drag force of the fluid on the particles and the interaction between the particles so as to obtain the particle speed displacement and other information which are then fed back to fluent then the next step of iterative calculation continues until a convergent solution is obtained the schematic diagram of the cfd dem coupling principle is shown in fig 3 2 2 simulation settings the cfd dem coupling method combines the advantages of fluent and edem before establishing the coupling connection the parameters of fluent and edem need to be set separately 2 2 1 geometric modeling and meshing a three dimensional geometric model of the pipeline with an inner diameter of 195 mm and a length of 1500 mm is established in the geometry module in ansys 19 0 set inflation options on the wall selection and mesh through icem cfd module the total number of nodes and elements are 44 115 and 20 670 respectively 2 2 2 fluent settings when the two phase flow is transported in the pipeline the flow field information is constantly updated during the process of coupling with edem so the transient calculation is selected in fluent since the fluids are incompressible fluids the pressure based solver is selected the standard k ϵ turbulence model is selected in the simulation process the non equilibrium wall function is selected for near wall treatment this model considers the effect of pressure gradient and is suitable for solving complex flow problems involving separation reattachment and impact where the average velocity is related to the pressure gradient and changes rapidly the fluid in the pipeline is seawater with a density of 1025 kg m3 and the particles are generated in edem the inlet is set as a velocity inlet the inlet velocity is set to 2 m s 2 5 m s 3 m s 3 5 m s and the direction is normal to the boundary the outlet is set as a pressure outlet and the outlet pressure value is set as a standard atmospheric pressure value the turbulence specification method of the inlet and outlet is set to intensity and hydraulic diameter the turbulent intensity is set to 5 and the hydraulic diameter is 0 195m in fluent the pressure velocity coupling algorithm is adopted for the solid liquid two phase flow coupling calculation among which the simple algorithm is selected which is mainly used to solve the incompressible flow field the convergence criterion is set to absolute the absolute criteria of all equations residuals are set to 0 001 in the entire flow field the acceleration of gravity is 9 81 m s2 and the default operating pressure is 1 standard atmospheric pressure 2 2 3 edem settings the particle density is set to 2000 kg m3 concerning the laboratory artificial nodules density the poisson s ratio is 0 13 and the elastic modulus is set to 1 15 1010 pa the actual manganese nodule particles are approximately spherical the shape of the particles is set to spherical using a single spherical particle model according to the foregoing the diameter of nodule particles in the deep sea mining pipeline system should be controlled at 5 30 mm and three particles with particle sizes of 8 mm 16 mm and 24 mm are set in the simulation the density of the pipe material is 7800 kg m the poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the shear modulus is 41gpa the interaction settings are shown in table 1 considering the continuous release of particles during transportation the particle factory is set to be dynamic and unlimited in the number of particles the particle factory is located at the entrance of the pipeline in the simulation of the asymmetric distribution of inlet particles two semi circular particle factories are set up one of which has a particle generation rate ten times that of the other and the overall particle volume fraction is maintained at 6 the particle velocity is consistent with the inlet flow velocity in fluent the herts mindlin no slip model is selected to define the particle particle and particle pipe wall interaction considering calculation accuracy and efficiency the euler iteration algorithm is selected 2 2 4 establishing coupling after setting up the two software load the edem fluent coupling interface file in the user defined function module in fluent then the edem coupling module appears in the model s item in fluent turning on the coupling server in edem and opening the coupling module the coupling has been established and the coupling details can be set in the dialog the eulerian coupling method is selected for computational efficiency the number of sample points is set to 10 and the mtm under relaxation and the volume under relaxation are set to 0 7 according to the rayleigh time step the time step in edem is set to 2e 06s the time step of fluent is usually 25 100 times the time step of edem and should be an integer multiple so the time step of fluent is set to 0 0001s the number of time steps is set to 20 000 to ensure that each simulation can reach a steady state the number of max iterations for each time step is set to 300 2 3 simulation results velocity and particle phase concentration are the two main parameters for studying the two phase flow through the coupling calculation simulation of fluent and edem the flow field information of two phase flow in the pipeline under different parameters is obtained the two phase flow in the screenshot has reached a steady state the calculation convergence speed is fast within that step length and the overall particle mass in the pipeline is almost unchanged fig 4 and fig 5 respectively show the particle distribution in the pipeline when the particle phase volume fraction is 6 and 12 in general there are slightly more particles near the outlet of the pipe than near the inlet in fig 4 when the flow rate is low the number of large particles is relatively small and there is a slight aggregation in the upper part of the pipe with the increase of the flow rate of the two phase flow the particle distribution is more uniform this phenomenon also shows that compared with fine particles large particles have poor following performance and are prone to clogging compared with the particle flow in fig 4 the particle phase concentration in the pipeline shown in fig 5 increased significantly and the number of large particles has increased in fig 5 a there is obvious particle aggregation and the transportation process is more dangerous than when the volume fraction is low as the number of particles increases the interaction between particles and particles and between particles and pipe wall surface increases the particles near the pipe wall will lead to slipping under the traction of the particles in the center of the pipe the increase of this phenomenon will cause plug flow in the pipeline and affect the efficiency and safety of pipeline transportation high speed internal flow provides the comparatively large axial force so properly increasing the internal flow speed can alleviate this phenomenon fig 6 shows the radial distribution of the total particle concentration under different working conditions and fig 7 shows the radial concentration distribution of each particle size the position of r r 0 indicates that the particle is located in the center of the pipe the position of r r 1 indicates that the particle is located at the wall in fig 6 the overall actual volume fraction of particles in the pipeline is a bit larger than the set value which is due to the retention effect of particles in the two phase flow the particle concentration reaches the maximum around the position of r r 0 8 indicating that the particles have a tendency to slide toward the wall as the flow rate decreases and the concentration increases these two phenomena are more obvious in fig 7 the particle concentration distribution of each particle size is generally consistent and the distribution of small particles is more uniform than that of large particles the results are consistent with the results of the vertical slurry pipeline solid concentration profile by o parkash et al 2020 fig 8 shows the velocity distribution of particles in the pipeline the overall velocity of the particles is less than the set internal flow velocity and the slip velocity is less than zero in the entire pipeline flow field the movement of particles always lags behind the fluid in the case of a larger volume fraction the velocity of the particles is lower there is a downward trend in particle velocity along the pipeline as the flow rate increases the particle velocity distribution becomes more uniform fig 9 shows the cross section distribution of particle velocity in the middle of the pipe the particle velocity in the center of the pipe is generally higher than the velocity near the wall as the particle concentration increases the position of the particles with the highest velocity begins to shift from the center of the pipe to the pipe wall particles near the wall have a leading phenomenon under the friction and collision of the wall and the interaction of the particles in the center of the pipe wall shear stress is another significant parameter fig 10 shows the shear stress distribution of the pipe wall by displaying wall shear stress on the wall selection during post processing the wall shear stress gradually increases along the axial direction of the pipe and its value is much smaller than the flow field pressure this trend is consistent with the research conclusion of van wijk j m et al van wijk et al 2014 but under the action of particles the distribution of wall shear stress is not uniform it can be seen in fig 10 c that uneven particle distribution will exacerbate this phenomenon as the particle concentration and flow rate increase the wall shear stress gradually increases fig 11 and fig 12 respectively show the particle distribution and the pipe wall shear stress distribution under the condition of asymmetric inlet particle distribution the particles gather on one side in the front section of the pipeline and gradually spread to the entire pipeline as the transportation progresses which means that the particles have a greater horizontal velocity compared with the case when the entrance particles are symmetrically distributed the distribution of particles is more messy and the aggregation phenomenon near the tube wall is more significant under the influence of particles wall shear stress is consistent with the characteristics of particle distribution and the overall trend of stress is still increasing along the pipe axis compared with the case when the inlet particles are symmetrically distributed the wall shear stress is more messy and the peak value is higher than that under the same conditions therefore the asymmetric distribution of the inlet particles will increase the instability of particle transportation and the wear and tear of the pipeline based on the above results to consider the economy and stable operation the particle concentration and conveying flow rate should be controlled within an appropriate range it is recommended that the particle volume fraction be around 9 and the conveying flow rate should be around 3 m s in the actual transportation system the asymmetry of the concentration distribution after the nodule leaves the jumper hose should be minimized it may be a feasible method to add a small section in front of the vertical pipe to uniform the particles 3 laboratory experiment to verify the reliability of the numerical simulation method to explore the particle seawater two phase flow field characteristics a laboratory experiment using the lifting pipeline test platform was carried out in this experiment the two phase flow characteristics and paths of the particle with different diameters in vertical pipelines were measured and the law and characteristics of the particle movement in the vertical lifting pipeline were summarized by comparing the results of the experiment and the simulation the effect of two phase flow on the lifting pipe is studied and the reliability and accuracy of numerical simulation are verified 3 1 experimental system the lifting pipeline system used in the experiment mainly includes data measuring device a vertical lifting pipeline and a driving adjustment device as shown in fig 12 slurry pump and speed regulating motor are the main equipment to complete the driving and circulation of the pipeline system the slurry pump of model 5cytzx 330 is selected the rated power is 18 5 kw the rated speed is 1480r min the head is 42 m to control the flow rate of the fluid in the pipeline the speed of the motor is adjusted by assembling the control cabinet which is shown in fig 13 data measurement is divided into three parts differential pressure measurement camera measurement and flow calibration the phantom veo 410ll high speed camera from vision research of the united states with a resolution of 1280 800 and a shooting rate of 5200fps is adopted the lens is nikon s af 24 85 mm f 2 8 4d if the shutter speed is fps600 and the distance to the pipeline is 1 5 m the compensation light source is a 200w led and the distance from the pipeline is 2m in the process of collecting test images the light source test pipeline and high speed camera should be on the same horizontal line as far as possible and should remain stationary the layout of the photogrammetric device is shown in fig 14 the test pipeline is the core part of the simulation test system including the lifting part and the return part as shown in fig 15 the length of the lifting pipe is 11m and the pipe diameter is 50 mm there is a transparent glass tube with a length of about 640 mm in the middle of the riser the return pipe is an important part of the fluid circulation in the test system and is used for the return flow of the fluid in the pipe the length of the return pipe is 10m and the pipe diameter is 75 mm 3 2 experimental settings water with a density of 1025 kg m3 is used as the liquid phase and the artificial nodules with a density of 2000 kg m3 to simulate manganese nodules are used as the solid phase the overall particle volume fraction in the pipeline system is set to 8 three kinds of artificial nodules with particle diameters of less than 5 mm 5 15 mm and 15 20 mm are used to simulate fine particles medium particles and large particles among them the fine particles are mainly composed of particles with a diameter of 4 mm and the extremely small particles are removed for easy observation the main particle size distribution range of medium particles is 8 mm 12mm multiple test conditions are set up to study the flow of two phase flow in the pipeline pipeline transportation tests of mixed and single particles size of the nodule particles of the three particle sizes are carried out to facilitate observation and image processing the lifting velocity in the experiment is set to be smaller than that in the simulation which is 1 14 m s besides to compare the movement laws of particles with different lifting speeds a pipeline transportation experiment of large particles with a lifting speed of 1 25m s is set up for better comparison numerical simulations under the same conditions were carried out under each test condition 3 3 experimental results the motion state of the mixed particles in the pipeline is shown in fig 16 at the beginning of the test the flow is unstable and the particle distribution is uneven as the experiment continues the particles gradually mix well and the particle flow distribution tends to be stable the number of large particles is significantly smaller than that of fine particles and the flow speed of fine particles is also faster this is because the particles with smaller sizes have a smaller slip speed between the particles and the liquid phase so it moves faster and follows the water flow better large particles will approach the pipe wall during the lifting process while fine particles are distributed in the middle of the pipe and near the pipe wall when the number of large particles is sufficient the particles may slip ahead causing plug flow near the pipe wall therefore to better complete the transportation of ore particles it is necessary to reasonably control the particle size of ore crushing in addition to the mixed particle size test a single particle size lifting test for three types of particles was also conducted the distribution of particles in the lifting pipeline is shown in fig 17 the particle size in the figure is from small to large in order from left to right in the figure that under the same test conditions coarse nodule particles with larger particle size are most sparsely distributed in the transparent lifting pipe which also indicates that the followability of large particle particles to fluid is not as good as that of small particle particles fig 18 shows the distribution of particles in the simulation which is basically consistent with the experiment with the increase of particle size the lifting speed of the particles gradually decreases when the particle size is greater than one third of the pipe diameter the pipe blockage easily occurs besides the reasonable configuration of the particle size the lifting speed affects a lot in the two phase flow lifting process fig 19 shows the distribution of particle velocity along the diameter of a group of particles with a lifting velocity of 1 14m s both the numerical simulation and the experimental results indicate that the particle velocity is less than the lifting flow rate particles have a hysteresis effect in general the particle velocity in the middle of the pipe is faster the position of the max particle velocity is slightly shifted from the center because the particle concentration is not large the leading slip phenomenon is not obvious the closer the particle is to the wall the slower the velocity is this is because the fluid velocity near the pipe wall is small and when the particles are close to the pipe wall the friction and collision with the pipe wall will increase resulting in energy dissipation the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the pipeline lifting system in the test with a lifting speed of 1 14 m s was collected and the data in table 2 were obtained the numerical simulation data is not much different from the experimental comparison which shows the accuracy of the numerical simulation some typical particles are selected to track the movement trajectory fig 20 shows the smoothed particle trajectory the particle size in the figure is the same but the lifting velocity is different the lifting velocity in the left picture is 1 14 m s and the right picture is 1 25 m s in the case of the same particulate material the lifting speed of the lifting system will affect the movement path of the particles when the lifting speed is small the radial force has a great influence on the particles and the lateral movement range of the particles during the lifting process is large the greater the lifting speed and the greater the axial force the lateral movement of the particles is reduced thereby alleviating the collision fig 21 shows the movement trajectories of particles with different particle sizes under the same lifting speed the left picture shows the movement trajectory of large particles and the right picture shows the movement trajectory of fine particles under the same working conditions compared with the movement trajectory of the coarse particle group and the fine particle group the lateral motion range is larger and the particles are more likely to collide the lifting trajectory of small particles tends to be lifted vertically and the energy dissipated during particle collisions is less therefore small particles move faster and have better fluid followability than large particles 4 conclusion in this paper based on the cfd dem coupling method the simulation of the pipeline internal flow is carried out by coupling software fluent and edem from the perspective of computational fluid mechanics the movement performances of particles such as concentration distribution and velocity distribution in the vertical pipeline are obtained in addition the wall shear stress under different working conditions is also analyzed analysis of the simulation results shows that the internal flow velocity and particle concentration have a greater influence on pipeline transportation larger particle concentration will promote the occurrence of clogging affect the flow stability of the pipeline and increase the wall shear stress high internal flow speed can promote a smooth flows but will increase wall shear stress in order to balance the stability and economy of the deep sea mining pipeline transportation system it is recommended to control the flow rate at about 3 m s and the particle concentration at about 9 in the actual transportation system the asymmetry of particle distribution at the pipeline inlet seriously affects particle transportation and pipeline wear so it should be minimized a laboratory vertical lifting pipeline experiment platform is built and the flow information of the solid liquid flow in the pipeline is collected by high speed camera equipment pipeline transportation tests of mixed and single particles size of the nodule particles of the three particle sizes are carried out with the increase of particle size the particle s followability to the fluid decreases after multiple sets of tests post processing of test data and images is carried out the velocity distribution of some particles along the pipe diameter is analyzed and several typical particles are tracked and analyzed the results of the experiment and numerical simulation are similarity it is concluded that the larger the lifting speed and the smaller the particle size the less the radial movement of the particles and the fewer collisions in summary the research in this paper provides some references for the structural design process optimization and operation control of the deep ocean mining pipeline

research hotspot lopes et al 2019 the technology and equipment for deep sea mining have received extensive attention worldwide since the 1960s various forms of development and feasibility verification around polymetallic nodule mining have been carried out and have continued to the present anil 2003 sparenberg 2019 as the most recognized practical deep sea mining system the pipeline transportation system is the only one that has been verified by deep sea actual tests a typical deep sea mining system contains a sea surface mining vessel a pipeline transportation system and a seabed mining robot cho et al 2019 the pipeline transportation system connects the sea surface mining vessel and the seabed mining robot through a flexible hose a rigid pipe and a buffer the internal flow is an important topic in the deep sea mining pipeline transportation system research dai et al 2019 the impact of internal flow was negligible compared to other loads moreover some research in the deep sea mining pipeline fluid structure coupling mechanics simply regards the particle flow as a uniform density bingham fluid which is a single phase pseudo fluid wang et al 2012 the internal flow transported by the pipeline contains seawater seabed sediment and mineral nodules which is a typical solid liquid two phase mixed flow yang and liu 2018 it is difficult to directly manipulate the relevant mining equipment and carry out costly in situ tests due to the particularity and complexity of the deep sea operating environment yu et al 2018 therefore computer modeling and simulation is commonly used in deep sea mining system research yoon et al 2010 used fluent to perform simulations of the two phase flow in lift pumps and flexible hoses based on cfd the superiority of the increased flowrate method in terms of piping design was verified kang et al 2019 the cfd software fluent contains some multi phase flow calculation models include vof mixture eulerian and dpm models which are widely used in flow field simulation and calculation however with the increase of calculation requirements a single hydrodynamic method has been unable to meet the calculation requirements of the particle phase li et al 2018 edem is a professional discrete element processing software that can be combined with fluent ma et al 2014 the cfd dem coupling method can solve the problem of particle fluid two phase flow more effectively by the fluent coupled edem software qiu and wu 2014 the cfd dem coupling method has recently been widely used in multiphase flow related research chen et al 2020 explored the influence of different particle shapes and different volume concentrations on slurry flow efficiency and flow characteristics in hydraulic pipeline transportation using the cfd dem method a multi functional cfd dem framework is proposed and it was verified that the method is suitable for solid liquid two phase flow simulation calculation kloss et al 2012 blais et al 2017 developed a cfd dem

multi phase flow model and verified them with experiments zhu et al 2018 used experiments to study the vibration problems caused by blocked flow inside the pipeline there have been many relevant studies on vertical transportation pipelines for deep sea mining stability and safety are the most important basis for the transportation process and an experiment to study transportation stability has been conducted van wijk et al 2016 van wijk j m et al van wijk et al 2015 have conducted numerical and experimental studies on the formation of blockages in pipelines john eaton et al 1999 studied the law of turbulence attenuation caused by fine particles experiments proved as well that solids concentration is not uniform in cross section for sufficiently high particle diameters and particle wall interactions have a contribution to the friction bartosik 2010 bartosik 2020 the particle degradation process has a significant impact on the flow performance of the two phase flow de hoog e and van wijk j m et al de hoog et al 2020 studied particle degradation under particle wall and particle particle interactions in this study a laboratory lifting pipeline simulation test platform will be used to conduct experimental research on the motion law of the particle seawater two phase flow in the pipeline and the pipeline hydraulic lifting parameters 2 internal flow field analysis the stress situation of the pipeline transportation system is extremely complicated in the process of mining the pipeline is not only affected by the sea surface mining vessel and the seabed mining robot but also by the forces of gravity buoyancy seawater pressure ocean current hydrodynamics and fluid movement in the pipeline based on the above considerations a computer simulation analysis was carried out to explore the characteristics and effects of the internal flow 2 1 two phase flow model by ignoring the impact of other impurities the fluid in the pipeline is simplified into a particle seawater two phase flow model as shown in fig 1 the physical density of the particle phase is 2000 kg m3 and the density of seawater is 1025 kg m3 the core of the calculation lies in the treatment of solid phase particles in this paper the cfd dem coupling method is used to simulate the flow of particles and seawater in the lifting pipeline through the coupling of fluent and edem combining the advantages of the two software this method can not only obtain the information of the flow field and the physical field of the particles but also show the interactions among the particles the fluid and the walls 2 1 1 manganese nodule particle parameters in the deep sea mining system the mineral particles are mainly solid mineral nodule crushed particles which have complex types and wide particle size ranges there are usually bulk nodules in the mining process when the diameter is greater than 40 mm the power consumption will be increased and even the pipeline blockage will happen affecting the pipeline system transportation before entering the conveying system the large nodules must be broken to smaller particle size but not excessively broken as too small particles will be discharged as sludge resulting in a large waste of resources therefore the requirements of the deep sea mining process for the crusher is to control the diameter of the manganese nodule particles between 5 and 40 mm besides to ensure the transportation efficiency of the pipeline and avoid excessive collision and friction between the particles and the pipe wall the particle size of the manganese nodule particles should be controlled within 30 mm so the diameter of nodule particles in the simulation is 5 30 mm according to the production technical requirements of the pilot test system its production capacity is 30 t h dry nodules or 43 t h wet nodules after calculation and analysis the flow rate of the slurry transported by the system is 300 m3 h when the volume concentration is about 5 it can meet the requirements to improve the transportation efficiency and avoid pipeline blockage after comprehensive consideration the volume concentration of particle transportation in this simulation is 6 9 12 and the internal flow velocity is set to 2 m s 2 5 m s 3 m s 3 5 m s in actual engineering systems vertical pipes are part of a larger system with flexible jumpers or buffer and feed systems in order to reflect the impact of this situation on transportation and pipeline wear numerical simulations of the asymmetric particle concentration distribution at the entrance are also set under the condition that the overall integral number is 6 2 1 2 force model between particles the common particle to particle contact in the discrete element simplifies two contact models the hardball model and the softball model the hardball model does not consider the details of particle deformation and mutual contact force and is mainly used for fast low concentration particle flow simulation the softball model simplifies the normal force between particles to spring damping and coupler and the tangential force to spring damping and slider the contact force is calculated based on the normal overlap and tangential displacement between particles which is widely applicable to engineering practice in the transportation of manganese nodules complex collisions will occur between the particles the flow field inside the pipeline can be studied and analyzed through the softball model fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of the hertz mindlin contact model the hertz mindlin contact model is widely used in many situations such as calculating elastic velocities of sandstone and the initial sand pack modulus of the soft sand stiff sand and intermediate stiff sand models it has the advantages of accuracy and efficiency in calculating the force between particles however when mixed minerals in rocks are quite different the hertz mindlin contact model of a single type of grain may not be enough to predict elastic velocity besides the hertz mindlin contact model does not consider the degradation process of particles and the adhesion of particles due to moisture in the liquid environment since the degradation of manganese nodules is relatively slighter than that of other minerals such as quartz sand the hertz mindlin contact model is selected for the convenience and efficiency of calculation a large number of studies have completed the detailed derivation and calculation of the contact force model between particles and have studied the application calculation for particle flow and other direction cundall and strack 1979 sakaguchi et al 1993 based on the past calculation and research work on particle contact force the formulas for the contact force and damping component between particle a and particle b are as follows 1 f n 4 3 e e q r e q 1 2 δ n 3 2 2 1 e e q 1 ν a 2 e a 1 ν b 2 e b 3 1 r e q 1 r a 1 r b where e e q is the equivalent young s modulus r e q is the

component of relative velocity 2 1 3 cfd dem coupling principle in the coupled simulation calculation the liquid field is first initialized in fluent and the updated flow field information is transferred to the edem by solving the navier stokes continuity equation and momentum equation within one time step the dem module in edem calculates the motion equation of the particles by analyzing the drag force of the fluid on the particles and the interaction between the particles so as to obtain the particle speed displacement and other information which are then fed back to fluent then the next step of iterative calculation continues until a convergent solution is obtained the schematic diagram of the cfd dem coupling principle is shown in fig 3 2 2 simulation settings the cfd dem coupling method combines the advantages of fluent and edem before establishing the coupling connection the parameters of fluent and edem need to be set separately 2 2 1 geometric modeling and meshing a three dimensional geometric model of the pipeline with an inner diameter of 195 mm and a length of 1500 mm is established in the geometry module in ansys 19 0 set inflation options on the wall selection and mesh through icem cfd module the total number of nodes and elements are 44 115 and 20 670 respectively 2 2 2 fluent settings when the two phase flow is transported in the pipeline the flow field information is constantly updated during the process of coupling with edem so the transient calculation is selected in fluent since the fluids are incompressible fluids the pressure based solver is selected the standard k ϵ turbulence model is selected in the simulation process the non equilibrium wall function is selected for near wall treatment this model considers the effect of pressure gradient and is suitable for solving complex flow problems involving separation reattachment and impact where the average velocity is related to the pressure gradient and changes rapidly the fluid in the pipeline is seawater with a density of 1025 kg m3 and the particles are generated in edem the inlet is set as a velocity inlet the inlet velocity is set to 2 m s 2 5 m s 3 m s 3 5 m s and the direction is normal to the boundary the outlet is set as a pressure outlet and the outlet pressure value is set as a standard atmospheric pressure value the turbulence specification method of the inlet and outlet is set to intensity and hydraulic diameter the turbulent intensity is set to 5 and the hydraulic diameter is 0 195m in fluent the pressure velocity coupling algorithm is adopted for the solid liquid two phase flow coupling calculation among which the simple algorithm is selected which is mainly used to solve the incompressible flow field the convergence criterion is set to absolute the absolute criteria of all equations residuals are set to 0 001 in the entire flow field the acceleration of gravity is 9 81 m s2 and the default operating pressure is 1 standard atmospheric pressure 2 2 3 edem settings the particle density is set to 2000 kg m3 concerning the laboratory artificial nodules density the poisson s ratio is 0 13 and the elastic modulus is set to 1 15 1010 pa the actual manganese nodule particles are approximately spherical the shape of the particles is set to spherical using a single spherical particle model according to the foregoing the diameter of nodule particles in the deep sea mining pipeline system should be controlled at 5 30 mm and three particles with particle sizes of 8 mm 16 mm and 24 mm are set in the simulation the density of the pipe material is 7800 kg m the poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the shear modulus is 41gpa the interaction settings are shown in table 1 considering the continuous release of particles during transportation the particle factory is set to be dynamic and unlimited in the number of particles the particle factory is located at the entrance of the pipeline in the simulation of the asymmetric distribution of inlet particles two semi circular particle factories are set up one of which has a particle generation rate ten times that of the other and the overall particle volume fraction is maintained at 6 the particle velocity is consistent with the inlet flow velocity in fluent the herts mindlin no slip model is selected to define the particle particle and particle pipe wall interaction considering calculation accuracy and efficiency the euler iteration algorithm is selected 2 2 4 establishing coupling after setting up the two software load the edem fluent coupling interface file in the user defined function module in fluent then the edem coupling module appears in the model s item in fluent turning on the coupling server in edem and opening the coupling module the coupling has been established and the coupling details can be set in the dialog the eulerian coupling method is selected for computational efficiency the number of sample points is set to 10 and the mtm under relaxation and the volume under relaxation are set to 0 7 according to the rayleigh time step the time step in edem is set to 2e 06s the time step of fluent is usually 25 100 times the time step of edem and should be an integer multiple so the time step of fluent is set to 0 0001s the number of time steps is set to 20 000 to ensure that each simulation can reach a steady state the number of max iterations for each time step is set to 300 2 3 simulation results velocity and particle phase concentration are the two main parameters for studying the two phase flow through the coupling calculation simulation of fluent and edem the flow field information of two phase flow in the pipeline under different parameters is obtained the two phase flow in the screenshot has reached a steady state the calculation convergence speed is fast within that step length and the overall particle mass in the pipeline is almost unchanged fig 4 and fig 5 respectively show the particle distribution in the pipeline when the particle phase volume fraction is 6 and 12 in general there are slightly more particles near the outlet of the pipe than near the inlet in fig 4 when the flow rate is low the number of large particles is relatively small and there is a slight aggregation in the upper part of the pipe with the increase of the flow rate of the two phase flow the particle distribution is more uniform this phenomenon also shows that compared with fine particles large particles have poor following performance and are prone to clogging compared with the particle flow in fig 4 the particle phase concentration in the pipeline shown in fig 5 increased significantly and the number of large particles has increased in fig 5 a there is obvious particle aggregation and the transportation process is more dangerous than when the volume fraction is low as the number of particles increases the interaction between particles and particles and between particles and pipe wall surface increases the particles near the pipe wall will lead to slipping under the traction of the particles in the center of the pipe the increase of this phenomenon will cause plug flow in the pipeline and affect the efficiency and safety of pipeline transportation high speed internal flow provides the comparatively large axial force so properly increasing the internal flow speed can alleviate this phenomenon fig 6 shows the radial distribution of the total particle concentration under different working conditions and fig 7 shows the radial concentration distribution of each particle size the position of r r 0 indicates that the particle is located in the center of the pipe the position of r r 1 indicates that the particle is located at the wall in fig 6 the overall actual volume fraction of particles in the pipeline is a bit larger than the set value which is due to the retention effect of particles in the two phase flow the particle concentration reaches the maximum around the position of r r 0 8 indicating that the particles have a tendency to slide toward the wall as the flow rate decreases and the concentration increases these two phenomena are more obvious in fig 7 the particle concentration distribution of each particle size is generally consistent and the distribution of small particles is more uniform than that of large particles the results are consistent with the results of the vertical slurry pipeline solid concentration profile by o parkash et al 2020 fig 8 shows the velocity distribution of particles in the pipeline the overall velocity of the particles is less than the set internal flow velocity and the slip velocity is less than zero in the entire pipeline flow field the movement of particles always lags behind the fluid in the case of a larger volume fraction the velocity of the particles is lower there is a downward trend in particle velocity along the pipeline as the flow rate increases the particle velocity distribution becomes more uniform fig 9 shows the cross section distribution of particle velocity in the middle of the pipe the particle velocity in the center of the pipe is generally higher than the velocity near the wall as the particle concentration increases the position of the particles with the highest velocity begins to shift from the center of the pipe to the pipe wall particles near the wall have a leading phenomenon under the friction and collision of the wall and the interaction of the particles in the center of the pipe wall shear stress is another significant parameter fig 10 shows the shear stress distribution of the pipe wall by displaying wall shear stress on the wall selection during post processing the wall shear stress gradually increases along the axial direction of the pipe and its value is much smaller than the flow field pressure this trend is consistent with the research conclusion of van wijk j m et al van wijk et al 2014 but under the action of particles the distribution of wall shear stress is not uniform it can be seen in fig 10 c that uneven particle distribution will exacerbate this phenomenon as the particle concentration and flow rate increase the wall shear stress gradually increases fig 11 and fig 12 respectively show the particle distribution and the pipe wall shear stress distribution under the condition of asymmetric inlet particle distribution the particles gather on one side in the front section of the pipeline and gradually spread to the entire pipeline as the transportation progresses which means that the particles have a greater horizontal velocity compared with the case when the entrance particles are symmetrically distributed the distribution of particles is more messy and the aggregation phenomenon near the tube wall is more significant under the influence of particles wall shear stress is consistent with the characteristics of particle distribution and the overall trend of stress is still increasing along the pipe axis compared with the case when the inlet particles are symmetrically distributed the wall shear stress is more messy and the peak value is higher than that under the same conditions therefore the asymmetric distribution of the inlet particles will increase the instability of particle transportation and the wear and tear of the pipeline based on the above results to consider the economy and stable operation the particle concentration and conveying flow rate should be controlled within an appropriate range it is recommended that the particle volume fraction be around 9 and the conveying flow rate should be around 3 m s in the actual transportation system the asymmetry of the concentration distribution after the nodule leaves the jumper hose should be minimized it may be a feasible method to add a small section in front of the vertical pipe to uniform the particles 3 laboratory experiment to verify the reliability of the numerical simulation method to explore the particle seawater two phase flow field characteristics a laboratory experiment using the lifting pipeline test platform was carried out in this experiment the two phase flow characteristics and paths of the particle with different diameters in vertical pipelines were measured and the law and characteristics of the particle movement in the vertical lifting pipeline were summarized by comparing the results of the experiment and the simulation the effect of two phase flow on the lifting pipe is studied and the reliability and accuracy of numerical simulation are verified 3 1 experimental system the lifting pipeline system used in the experiment mainly includes data measuring device a vertical lifting pipeline and a driving adjustment device as shown in fig 12 slurry pump and speed regulating motor are the main equipment to complete the driving and circulation of the pipeline system the slurry pump of model 5cytzx 330 is selected the rated power is 18 5 kw the rated speed is 1480r min the head is 42 m to control the flow rate of the fluid in the pipeline the speed of the motor is adjusted by assembling the control cabinet which is shown in fig 13 data measurement is divided into three parts differential pressure measurement camera measurement and flow calibration the phantom veo 410ll high speed camera from vision research of the united states with a resolution of 1280 800 and a shooting rate of 5200fps is adopted the lens is nikon s af 24 85 mm f 2 8 4d if the shutter speed is fps600 and the distance to the pipeline is 1 5 m the compensation light source is a 200w led and the distance from the pipeline is 2m in the process of collecting test images the light source test pipeline and high speed camera should be on the same horizontal line as far as possible and should remain stationary the layout of the photogrammetric device is shown in fig 14 the test pipeline is the core part of the simulation test system including the lifting part and the return part as shown in fig 15 the length of the lifting pipe is 11m and the pipe diameter is 50 mm there is a transparent glass tube with a length of about 640 mm in the middle of the riser the return pipe is an important part of the fluid circulation in the test system and is used for the return flow of the fluid in the pipe the length of the return pipe is 10m and the pipe diameter is 75 mm 3 2 experimental settings water with a density of 1025 kg m3 is used as the liquid phase and the artificial nodules with a density of 2000 kg m3 to simulate manganese nodules are used as the solid phase the overall particle volume fraction in the pipeline system is set to 8 three kinds of artificial nodules with particle diameters of less than 5 mm 5 15 mm and 15 20 mm are used to simulate fine particles medium particles and large particles among them the fine particles are mainly composed of particles with a diameter of 4 mm and the extremely small particles are removed for easy observation the main particle size distribution range of medium particles is 8 mm 12mm multiple test conditions are set up to study the flow of two phase flow in the pipeline pipeline transportation tests of mixed and single particles size of the nodule particles of the three particle sizes are carried out to facilitate observation and image processing the lifting velocity in the experiment is set to be smaller than that in the simulation which is 1 14 m s besides to compare the movement laws of particles with different lifting speeds a pipeline transportation experiment of large particles with a lifting speed of 1 25m s is set up for better comparison numerical simulations under the same conditions were carried out under each test condition 3 3 experimental results the motion state of the mixed particles in the pipeline is shown in fig 16 at the beginning of the test the flow is unstable and the particle distribution is uneven as the experiment continues the particles gradually mix well and the particle flow distribution tends to be stable the number of large particles is significantly smaller than that of fine particles and the flow speed of fine particles is also faster this is because the particles with smaller sizes have a smaller slip speed between the particles and the liquid phase so it moves faster and follows the water flow better large particles will approach the pipe wall during the lifting process while fine particles are distributed in the middle of the pipe and near the pipe wall when the number of large particles is sufficient the particles may slip ahead causing plug flow near the pipe wall therefore to better complete the transportation of ore particles it is necessary to reasonably control the particle size of ore crushing in addition to the mixed particle size test a single particle size lifting test for three types of particles was also conducted the distribution of particles in the lifting pipeline is shown in fig 17 the particle size in the figure is from small to large in order from left to right in the figure that under the same test conditions coarse nodule particles with larger particle size are most sparsely distributed in the transparent lifting pipe which also indicates that the followability of large particle particles to fluid is not as good as that of small particle particles fig 18 shows the distribution of particles in the simulation which is basically consistent with the experiment with the increase of particle size the lifting speed of the particles gradually decreases when the particle size is greater than one third of the pipe diameter the pipe blockage easily occurs besides the reasonable configuration of the particle size the lifting speed affects a lot in the two phase flow lifting process fig 19 shows the distribution of particle velocity along the diameter of a group of particles with a lifting velocity of 1 14m s both the numerical simulation and the experimental results indicate that the particle velocity is less than the lifting flow rate particles have a hysteresis effect in general the particle velocity in the middle of the pipe is faster the position of the max particle velocity is slightly shifted from the center because the particle concentration is not large the leading slip phenomenon is not obvious the closer the particle is to the wall the slower the velocity is this is because the fluid velocity near the pipe wall is small and when the particles are close to the pipe wall the friction and collision with the pipe wall will increase resulting in energy dissipation the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the pipeline lifting system in the test with a lifting speed of 1 14 m s was collected and the data in table 2 were obtained the numerical simulation data is not much different from the experimental comparison which shows the accuracy of the numerical simulation some typical particles are selected to track the movement trajectory fig 20 shows the smoothed particle trajectory the particle size in the figure is the same but the lifting velocity is different the lifting velocity in the left picture is 1 14 m s and the right picture is 1 25 m s in the case of the same particulate material the lifting speed of the lifting system will affect the movement path of the particles when the lifting speed is small the radial force has a great influence on the particles and the lateral movement range of the particles during the lifting process is large the greater the lifting speed and the greater the axial force the lateral movement of the particles is reduced thereby alleviating the collision fig 21 shows the movement trajectories of particles with different particle sizes under the same lifting speed the left picture shows the movement trajectory of large particles and the right picture shows the movement trajectory of fine particles under the same working conditions compared with the movement trajectory of the coarse particle group and the fine particle group the lateral motion range is larger and the particles are more likely to collide the lifting trajectory of small particles tends to be lifted vertically and the energy dissipated during particle collisions is less therefore small particles move faster and have better fluid followability than large particles 4 conclusion in this paper based on the cfd dem coupling method the simulation of the pipeline internal flow is carried out by coupling software fluent and edem from the perspective of computational fluid mechanics the movement performances of particles such as concentration distribution and velocity distribution in the vertical pipeline are obtained in addition the wall shear stress under different working conditions is also analyzed analysis of the simulation results shows that the internal flow velocity and particle concentration have a greater influence on pipeline transportation larger particle concentration will promote the occurrence of clogging affect the flow stability of the pipeline and increase the wall shear stress high internal flow speed can promote a smooth flows but will increase wall shear stress in order to balance the stability and economy of the deep sea mining pipeline transportation system it is recommended to control the flow rate at about 3 m s and the particle concentration at about 9 in the actual transportation system the asymmetry of particle distribution at the pipeline inlet seriously affects particle transportation and pipeline wear so it should be minimized a laboratory vertical lifting pipeline experiment platform is built and the flow information of the solid liquid flow in the pipeline is collected by high speed camera equipment pipeline transportation tests of mixed and single particles size of the nodule particles of the three particle sizes are carried out with the increase of particle size the particle s followability to the fluid decreases after multiple sets of tests post processing of test data and images is carried out the velocity distribution of some particles along the pipe diameter is analyzed and several typical particles are tracked and analyzed the results of the experiment and numerical simulation are similarity it is concluded that the larger the lifting speed and the smaller the particle size the less the radial movement of the particles and the fewer collisions in summary the research in this paper provides some references for the structural design process optimization and operation control of the deep ocean mining pipeline

21179,this paper presents a particle image velocimetry piv study of the two dimensional flow past a bluff body confined in a channel three typical shapes of bluff body with the same height namely circular cylinder cc flat plate fp and square cylinder sc but with varying blockage ratio β 0 25 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 and reynolds number re 3200 4600 and 5400 are investigated it is shown that for each body shape vortex shedding patterns are relatively insensitive to reynolds number most notably for the case of fp but strongly depend on the blockage ratio as β increases the mean recirculation length of the wake is initially constant and then displays a sharp increase at about β 0 4 0 5 which corresponds to the flow transition from periodic vortex shedding state to steady state the strength of vortex shedding generally decreases with the increase in β except for cc at β 0 25 0 3 on the other hand the vortex shedding frequency expressed in terms of dimensionless strouhal number st increases

keywords wall confinement circular cylinder flat plate square cylinder vortex shedding particle image velocimetry piv 1 introduction the flow around a bluff body is a classical problem owing to its occurrence in many naturally occurring processes as well as in numerous engineering applications a common configuration is a bluff body symmetrically confined in a two dimensional 2 d plane channel where the extra confinement provided by the stationary no slip walls of the channel affects the nature and stability of the flow which may lead to the change in hydrodynamic forces on the body as well as in the heat and mass transfer characteristics e g chakraborty et al 2004 meis et al 2010 engineering applications of this flow configuration include flow through porous media or in textile coating processes heat exchangers and food processes alves et al 2001 one of its applications in ocean engineering is energy harvesting from vortex induced vibration viv of bluff body due to ocean current bernitsas et al 2008 for which wall confinement would significantly increase the extracted power soti and de 2020 different shapes of bluff bodies have been investigated by previous researchers including circular cylinder e g rehimi et al 2008 xiong et al 2013 and sharp edged non circular cylinders such as square cylinder e g patil and tiwari 2008 chatterjee and gupta 2015 flat plate e g lasher 2001 yeung 2008 and cube e g lacey and rennie 2012 singh et al 2019 according to the published literature the flow structure around a confined bluff body is determined by two basic parameters i the blockage ratio β d h where d is the height of bluff body and h is the height of channel and ii reynolds number re ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of fluid u is the free stream velocity and μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid it displays many features different from those of the unconfined standalone case particularly on the vortex shedding patterns an important phenomenon is that the alternating vortex shedding would be completely suppressed when the cylinder is in close proximity to the confinement wall or when β is large enough which was firstly reported by shair et al 1963 a brief review of published papers on the confined flow past the three typical types of bluff body i e circular cylinder square cylinder and flat plate is provided herein respectively focusing on the effects of β and re on the flow structure the confined circular cylinder has been investigated mainly in the laminar regime with an incoming poiseuille flow parabolic profile anagnostopoulos et al 1996 numerically studied the influence of β 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 at re 106 and observed that the lateral and longitudinal spacings of the shed vortices from the cylinder decrease as β increases chakraborty et al 2004 reported that for a fixed re the drag coefficient decreases with the increase in β over the range β 0 05 0 65 rehimi et al 2008 showed that for the case of β 0 33 recri is 108 which is more than twice higher than the classical value of recri 47 for unconfined case williamson 1996 the confinement also affects the three dimensional wake transition which was examined numerically by kanaris et al 2011 and griffith et al 2011 for the case of β 0 2 and β 0 5 respectively based on non intrusive interferometric measurements vyas et al 2020 found that vortex shedding is initiated at relatively lower value of recri 65 when the blockage ratio is low β 0 25 however when three dimensional 3 d transition is considered increasing the blockage ratio leads to an increase in the value of transition e g recri 165 for β 0 5 more recently soti and de 2020 investigated the effects of confinement on viv of a circular cylinder and its flow power extraction capability within the ranges of re 100 150 and β 0 25 0 5 the extracted power is found to increase rapidly with blockage ratio at β 0 5 for example it is an order of magnitude larger than the unconfined case on the other hand the simulations by kumar and singh 2020 on a confined circular cylinder in the subcritical regime re 5000 15 000 showed that the mean drag coefficient decreases with re for a fixed β but increases with β for a fixed re which is opposed to that reported by chakraborty et al 2004 in laminar regime as compared to the circular cylinder the flow around confined square cylinder received relatively less attention similarly the confinement tends to stabilize the wake flow and the strouhal number st and drag coefficient increase with increasing β while the base suction and stagnation pressure coefficients increase as well e g mukhopadhyay et al 1992 sharma and eswaran 2005 turki et al 2003 numerically investigated a confined square cylinder for re 120 200 and β 0 125 and 0 25 and showed that the value of recri increases with increasing β a similar finding was reported by patil and tiwari 2008 in terms of the wake bubble size and shear layer behavior based on numerical simulations on the flow past a highly confined square cylinder with β 0 9 mishra et al 2019 showed that the drag coefficient is as high as in the order of magnitude 103 and the value of recri is found to be 62 this is remarkably higher than the corresponding value of 47 for the unconfined case sohankar et al 1999 considering the fact that the separation points on square cylinder are fixed and hence the wake developments are insensitive to the variation in re derakhshandeh and alam 2019 several studies investigated confined flow around a normal flat plate but mostly in subcritical regime 300 re 3 105 which is in contrast to the cases of circular cylinder or square cylinder that are almost exclusively in laminar regime re 300 takeuchi and okamoto 1983 experimentally showed that for β 0 0 4 at re 3 22 104 the mean drag coefficient increases monotonically with β but the vortex shedding frequency keeps almost unchanged by contrast based on numerical simulations using the finite element method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the same flow as that in takeuchi and okamoto 1983 lasher 2001 predicted a consistently lower mean drag moreover vortex shedding frequency increases with β for the flow past a square cylinder at various angles of incidence under weakly confined conditions β 0 05 at re 100 200 sohankar et al 1998 reported that a decrease in β from 5 to 2 5 results in a slight decrease less than 1 5 in strouhal number mean drag and root mean square rms lift less than a 3 increase in stagnation pressure and a maximum 8 decrease in base suction yeung 2008 showed that for confined flow in subcritical regime the wake width rather than the length scale of the bluff body should be used to normalized the flow parameters the strouhal number based on the wake width and the velocity at flow separation is found to be independent of blockage ratio teimourian et al 2018 reviews state of the art development on the unsteady flow structure particularly the vortex shedding patterns over flat plates in different arrangements several observations can be obtained based on the above literature review firstly most of the published studies on this topic investigated the effect of either re or β separately by fixing the other parameter as a result the combined effects of re and β in a wide parameter space are still lacking particularly in the subcritical regime since almost all the previous studies on circular cylinder and square cylinder are in the laminar regime secondly nearly all the previous studies are limited to one particular shape of bluff body and hence a direct comparison of the flow for different shapes of bluff body is difficult if not impossible due to the vast variation in geometrical parameters and flow parameters among them as reviewed above for a same flow configuration the results reported by different researchers may be inconsistent or even contradictory therefore it is desirable to obtain quantitative information about the flow and to gain deeper insight into the underlying physics this motivates the present study using particle image velocimetry piv since it is capable of measuring the whole domain of instantaneous flow fields in a non intrusive manner three typical shapes of bluff body with the same height namely circular cylinder cc flat plate fp and square cylinder sc are investigated in the same experimental set up which is the main novelty of this study the effects of varying blockage ratio β 0 25 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 and reynolds number re 3200 4600 and 5400 are systematically examined 2 experimental set up and methodology 2 1 experimental set up the schematic diagram of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the experiments were performed in a re circulating open channel flume having a test section with dimensions of 5 m 0 3 m 0 45 m length width depth to homogenize the inlet flow at a low turbulence intensity a 0 3 m 0 45 m 0 2 m width depth thickness honeycomb straighter made of 20 mm in diameter brass tubes and a series of screens with wire diameter of 0 3 mm and solid blockage ratio of 0 2 were placed upstream of the test section to straightening the incoming flow and reduce the size of the incoming coherent flow structures the maximum turbulence intensity in the incoming free stream at the test section was less than 1 5 both the side walls and the bottom wall of the test section were made of glass for the ease of optical accessibility the three types of bluff body considered have the same characteristic length scale d 20 mm in which d stands for the diameter side length and height of the circular cylinder square cylinder and flat plate respectively the thickness of the flat plate is 2 mm or 0 1 d to create a confined channel flow an upper wall and a bottom wall made of transparent perspex plate 10 mm in thickness and 900 mm in length with sharp leading edge were installed horizontally across the span of the flume the bottom wall was located 50 mm above the channel floor to ensure a uniform flow upon entering the confined channel the separation distance h between the upper and lower walls was varied as 80 60 50 and 40 mm corresponding to β d h 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the bluff body was installed horizontally and symmetrically in between the upper and lower walls along the spanwise direction with its center located at a streamwise location of 400 mm or 20 d downstream of the leading edges during the experiments the water depth was maintained at 150 mm which satisfied the condition proposed by long et al 1990 and singh et al 2016 that a 2d flow in the centerline of the channel was achieved with a flume width depth ratio of 2 the oncoming flow velocity was varied as u 0 16 0 23 and 0 27 m s corresponding to re 3200 4600 and 5400 respectively the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center of the bluff body with x y and z denoting the streamwise transverse and spanwise directions respectively 2 2 measurement system the length or span of the bluff body was 300 mm yielding an aspect ratio of 15 which was large enough to ensure the flow to be nominally 2 d along the majority of the cylinder span lam and zou 2010 thus the flow measurements were carried out on the vertical mid span plane by a lavision piv system operating in double frame double exposure mode a laser light sheet of about 1 mm in thickness generated by a double cavity nd yag laser wavelength 532 nm power 135 mj per pulse duration 5 ns was used to illuminate the flow field neutrally buoyant sphericel 110p8 hollow glass spheres of 10 15 μm in diameter were added as tracer particles a 14 bit ccd camera spatial resolution 1600 1200 pixels sampling frequency 15 hz was used to capture the particle images the size of field of view was 130 97 mm2 the obtained particle images were processed by lavision davis software version 7 2 using the fast fourier transform fft based cross correlation algorithm the particle displacements representing the flow velocities were evaluated with a window deformation iterative multi grid with window size down to 32 32 pixels at 50 overlap yielding a spatial resolution of 1 3 mm2 the time interval between each pair of images was adjusted according to the incoming velocity in the free stream so that a maximum displacement was about 7 pixels satisfying the criterion for optimum cross correlation proposed by boillot and prasad 1996 for each case piv acquisitions were made for a duration of 84 s at a sampling frequency of 15 hz hence 1260 pairs of double frame images were obtained to achieve reasonably converged statistics of the flow such as mean and turbulence properties the uncertainties in the instantaneous velocities u and v and the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z δ v δ x δ u δ y were estimated to be about 2 and 10 respectively the reader is referred to wang and tan 2007 for more details about the piv post processing procedure and uncertainty analysis 2 3 incoming flow conditions at first the incoming flow conditions in the empty channel without the bluff body have been recorded fig 2 presents the streamwise mean velocity profiles for the case of h 40 mm and re 4600 it is apparent that the profiles are in top hat shape which is in contrast to the parabolic type poiseuille flow in the laminar regime as in most of the previous studies similar profiles are found for other values of h and re and hence are not shown for brevity it can be seen that the profiles at the three streamwise locations x d 0 3 and 6 are almost identical indicating that the boundary layers on the upper and lower channel walls are fully developed the thickness δ of wall boundary layers is about 7 mm or δ d 0 35 a value similar to wang and tan 2008a for the near wall cylinder 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean flow patterns fig 3 presents the mean streamline patterns in the wake of the bluff body cc fp and sc with re 4600 at β 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 the mean wake is characterized by a symmetric recirculation zone with a pair of counter rotating bubbles it is obvious that the size width and length of the recirculation zone is a function of both the body shape and the blockage ratio at small blockage ratios β 0 25 and 0 33 the recirculation zone of fp is the largest whereas that of sc is the smallest when β is large enough e g β 0 5 the recirculation zone elongates in the streamwise direction significantly which is associated with the transition from unsteady to steady flow to be shown later in section 3 2 here we use the length scale of the recirculation zone l r as shown in the top left plot of fig 3 which is defined as the streamwise distance from the cylinder base to the saddle point where the streamlines intersect roshko 1993 as suggested by and ozkan et al 2017 the value of l r is also a quantitative indicator of vortex formation length fig 4 a c present the variation of the normalized recirculation length l r d with respect to the blockage ratio at different reynolds numbers re 3200 4600 and 5400 for cc fp and sc respectively the reported values of l r d in the literature for the bluff body under unconfined condition at similar reynolds numbers have been added as reference i e l r d 1 67 for cc in parnaudeau et al 2008 1 88 for fp in afgan et al 2013 and 1 25 for sc in minguez et al 2011 for cc fig 4 a l r varies with both re and β in general for a fixed β the higher re the smaller l r a similar trend was reported in roshko 1993 for the unconfined cylinder this is the reason why the curve for re 3200 is always higher than the corresponding value of 1 67 d for the unconfined cylinder as the latter is obtained at a relatively higher reynolds number re 3900 on the other hand the value of l r is significantly affected by the boundary conditions oruç 2012 and ozkan et al 2012 showed that for a vertical circular cylinder in shallow water with a depth of 0 5 d l r is as small as 1 1 d although re is similar re 5300 for the present wall bounded circular cylinder when re is fixed the variation of l r with β is not monotonic instead l r exhibits a local minimum at β 0 33 for fp fig 4 b by contrast l r is insensitive to the change in re since the three curves almost coincide with each other this is attributed to the fact that unlike circular cylinder the points of flow separation for sharp edged bluff bodies are fixed at the corners which is independent of reynolds number derakhshandeh and alam 2019 moreover l r d initially keeps constant at about 1 7 for β 0 25 and 0 33 and thereafter increases sharply with further increase in β for sc as shown in fig 4 c the effects of re and β seem to fall in between the cc and fp cases on the one hand similar to the fp case the value of l r is basically insensitive to re but limited to certain values of β only i e except for β 0 4 on the other hand the effect of confinement on the mean recirculation length is prominent only when β 0 4 a phenomenon similar to the fp case for both fp and sc the values of l r at β 0 25 or 0 33 are close to the corresponding values under unconfined condition suggesting that the confinement effect is relatively weak 3 2 instantaneous flow patterns fig 5 provides a representative snapshot of the instantaneous velocity vector plots for each case the plots are superimposed with flood contours of normalized spanwise vorticity ω z d u at the smallest blockage ratio β 0 25 the wake is characterized as periodic vortex shedding since the two shear layers upper and lower roll up into street of large scale von kármán like vortices just like the unconfined case among the three bluff bodies cc has the narrowest width of vortex street as indicated by the transverse distance between the two rows of opposite signed vortices and hence is the least vulnerable to wall confinement effect as manifested by the vortex induced separation on the walls each shed vortex is likely to be accompanied by an opposite signed discrete vortex in the near wall region see for example the positive anti clockwise vortex in the case of sc at β 0 25 this type of vortex pairing is an indicator of the interference between the wake and the wall similar vortex induced separation and instability have been reported in price et al 2002 dipankar and sengupta 2005 and wang and tan 2008a for a cylinder placed in proximity to a plane wall however it is not obvious in reported studies on confined bluff body in laminar regime for example meis et al 2010 found transversal plumes rather than discrete vortices produced at the interface between adjacent vortices shed from the cylinder this is likely attributed to the fact that the incoming flow is poiseuille type with much thicker boundary layers δ 0 5 h and hence smaller velocity gradient and hence vorticity magnitude fig 5 also shows that when β increases to 0 33 and 0 4 vortex shedding persists for all the three bluff bodies implying stronger wake wall interference due to the confinement effects the width of vortex street reduces with β at β 0 5 vortex shedding still persists for cc for fp and sc however the upper and lower shear layers exhibit as elongated chains of vorticity in kelvin helmholtz k h type of roll up without mutual interaction in other words the wake becomes steady to summarize the wake experiences a transition from unsteady state to steady state when the blockage ratio is large enough and the value of critical blockage ratio β c r i depends on the shape of bluff body which is β c r i 0 5 for fp and sc but higher than 0 5 for cc the flow transition from unsteady state to steady state is evident on the wake development fig 6 provides the streamwise mean velocity profiles at different locations in the wake x d 0 55 6 based on which one can observe the effects of body shape and blockage ratio due to the blockage effect a velocity defect is formed immediately downstream of the bluff body and then gradually recovers with downstream distance a phenomenon similar to the unconfined case however the wall confinement results in that the flow has some distinct features different from that of a bluff body under unconfined condition or in proximity to a plane wall for instance the magnitude of the free stream velocity which is originally around 0 23 m s increases with β from 0 25 to 0 3 m s at β 0 25 to 0 4 0 5 m s at β 0 5 according to the mass conservation principle the increase in the magnitude of free stream velocity effectively increases the velocity gradient across the shear layers therefore the magnitude of spanwise vorticity which is associated with velocity gradient is increased which is beneficial for momentum exchange and turbulent mixing here we take the recovery rate of the defected wake at x d 6 as an indicator of turbulent mixing at small blockage ratios β 0 25 fig 6 a or 0 33 fig 6 b sc is the fastest in terms of recovery rate followed by cc and fp this is attributed to the fact that the value of l r or vortex formation length for sc is smaller than that of cc or fp at large blockage ratios β 0 4 fig 6 c or 0 5 fig 6 d by contrast the recovery rate of cc exceeds that of sc or fp as compared to cc fp and sc are more susceptible to wall confinement effect a similar trend is reported for a cylinder placed adjacent to a wall boundary layer the critical gap between the cylinder and the wall for suppression of vortex shedding is found to be about 0 3 d for circular cylinder e g price et al 2002 wang and tan 2008a and 0 3 d 0 5 d for square cylinder bosch and rodi 1996 wang and tan 2008b in order to better illustrate the vortex shedding process and vortex induced separation at the wall region a time series of piv snapshots for cc with re 4600 and β 0 4 are shown in fig 7 the time interval between consecutive snapshots is 1 15 s at t 0 s fig 7 a a negative clockwise vortex labeled as a1 is formed from the upper side whereas a positive anti clockwise vortex b1 is just to be shed from the lower side each vortex induces an opposite signed vortex in the adjacent wall region resulting in the vortex pairing viz a1 and a1 b1 and b1 as time evolves fig 7 b d each pair of vortices propagate downstream at the same pace at t 4 15 s fig 7 e two new pairs of counter rotating vortices i e a2 and a2 b2 and b2 are formed they are very similar to those in fig 7 a in terms of size magnitude and location symbolizing the onset of another vortex shedding cycle similar phenomenon is found for fp and sc at moderate β when vortex shedding occurs based on the above observations a schematic representation of the wake flow structure for the bluff body moderately confined in a channel is proposed in fig 8 due to the presence of the channel wall the wake is characterized by vortex pairing between the vortex shed from the bluff body and the induced vortex with opposite signed vorticity in the adjacent wall region as a result the fluid in the near wall region is periodically ejected inward as indicated by the small arrows in fig 8 towards the channel centerline which is beneficial for the mass and heat transfer inside the channel meis et al 2010 3 3 vortex shedding frequencies as shown in fig 7 the vortex shedding and paring process is highly repeatable therefore we can calculate the vortex shedding frequency based on the piv measurement data take the 5 snapshots in fig 7 as an example which exactly consists of a complete cycle of vortex shedding therefore the period of vortex shedding for this case is 4 15 s this is equivalent to a vortex shedding frequency f 15 4 3 75 hz thus yielding a strouhal number of st f d u 0 326 to quantitatively determine the frequency of vortex shedding for each case the time history of the transverse velocity v in the wake i e at x d y d 3 0 was extracted and analyzed by spectral analysis using fft the obtained amplitude spectral density asd for the three bluff bodies at re 4600 and different blockage ratios are shown in fig 9 for cc fig 9 a the spectrum for each blockage ratio β 0 25 0 5 always exhibits a well defined peak which corresponds to the periodic vortex shedding as can be observed in the instantaneous flow fields the value of st increases monotonically with β from st 0 27 at β 0 25 to 0 48 at β 0 5 a similar trend is found for fp and sc but only up to a certain value of β viz β 0 4 beyond which the spectral peak either becomes rather broad banded for sc or even disappears completely for fp as a matter of fact the increase in vortex shedding frequency with increasing β is evident in the instantaneous snapshots shown in fig 5 as well for each body shape the longitudinal distance between two adjacent vortices reduces with increasing β moreover the strength of vortex shedding which can be appreciated based on the amplitude of spectral peak generally decreases monotonically with increasing β at the highest blockage ratio β 0 5 the spectral peak for cc though still evident attenuates in magnitude as compared to that at smaller β for sc and fp it becomes broad banded and even disappears completely respectively it is noted that for cc when β increases from 0 25 to 0 33 however there is an increase in the amplitude of spectral peak which is consistent with the observation in fig 4 a that l r achieves a local minimum at β 0 33 implying that vortex shedding is strengthened instead the above results show that vortex shedding frequency for the confined body increases with the blockage ratio whereas it maintains constant for a bluff body placed adjacent to a plane wall price et al 2002 wang and tan 2008b the increase in vortex shedding frequency for a confined body is attributed to the acceleration in the free stream due to the blockage effect theoretically for a bluff body under unconfined condition the strouhal number is st0 f d u e where u e is the effective streamwise velocity in the free stream the value of st0 for cc fp and sc over the considered re range maintains constant at about 0 2 0 17 and 0 13 respectively which agrees well with the literature for instance oruç et al 2016 reported that for a circular cylinder st0 decreases slightly from 0 2 to 0 18 as re increases from 3350 to 10 200 for a confined bluff body in a channel the free stream velocity can be calculated as u e u 1 β based on the mass conservation principle therefore we can obtain st0 f d 1 β u st 1 β or st st0 1 β the predicted strouhal numbers using this equation together with the obtained experimental data as well as those published in the literature are plotted in fig 10 in general the data agreement is fairly good for each body shape st is strongly dependent on β and is relatively insensitive to re within the measurement range it is noteworthy that for cc fig 10 a the reported data by griffith et al 2011 and mathupriya et al 2018 are consistently lower than the present results this discrepancy is attributable to the difference in re which is 300 in griffith et al 2011 and 500 in mathupriya et al 2018 vs o 103 in the present study for sharp edged bluff bodies i e fp fig 10 b or sc fig 10 b on the other hand the present data agree well the literature i e lasher 2001 sharify et al 2013 suggestive of the reduced effects from re here we summarize the effects of confinement on the wake flow structure regardless of the body shape the wake is characterized by vortex shedding patterns up to the critical blockage ratio β c r i with the increase in β vortex shedding strength generally decreases except for the case of cc at β 0 33 while vortex shedding frequency increases monotonically therefore for each body shape there would exist an optimum value of β at which maximum mixing is achieved the increase in both vortex shedding frequency and vortex strength with increasing β over a certain range may explain why the extracted power from viv of a confined circular cylinder increases rapidly with the blockage ratio as reported by soti and de 2020 further investigations will be conducted to obtain the exact value of optimal β for specific applications 3 4 reynolds shear stress the distributions of the normalized reynolds shear stress rss u v u 2 for re 4600 at β 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 are provided in fig 11 from which the spatial development of shear layers can be appreciated for example one can identify the different flow patterns elongated shear layers or alternating vortex shedding which are in local convective instability and global absolute instability respectively huerre and monkewitz 1990 in the former the shear layers are elongated chains of k h vorticity which develop basically independently without mutual interaction in the latter significant momentum exchange between the shear layers occurs leading to an increase in the magnitude of rss it can be seen that the distributions of rss vary with both the body shape and the blockage ratio at the smallest blockage ratio i e subjective to the least effect of wall confinement the rss distributions agree with the previous studies both qualitatively and quantitatively take cc as an example at β 0 25 see top left plot of fig 11 the peak positive and negative values u v u 2 max and u v u 2 min are 0 138 and 0 142 whereas the corresponding values reported in oruç 2012 for an unbounded circular cylinder at re 5200 are 0 102 and 0 106 respectively for each bluff body an overall trend can be seen with the change in blockage ratio as β increases from 0 25 to 0 5 the magnitude of rss decreases and the spatial extent of rss elongates in the streamwise direction a similar phenomenon was reported by liu et al 2016 for stabilizing the wake flow of a confined cylinder using a splitter plate at β 0 3 and re 2400 and 3000 an exception is for cc at β 0 33 when the magnitude of rss shows an increase instead a comparison of the three bluff bodies at the same β indicates that i along the streamwise direction sc displays the earliest downstream locations for peak rss particularly at β 0 25 and 0 33 which agrees with that sc has the shortest mean recirculation or vortex formation length and ii along the transverse direction the rss distributions of cc are always narrower than those of fp or sc indicating that cc is the least susceptible to wall confinement effects for instance at the smallest blockage ratio β 0 25 the magnitude of rss for cc is the lowest and that of sc is the highest at the largest blockage ratio β 0 5 on the contrary the order is reversed i e cc fp sc more importantly one can appreciate the vortex patterns based on the rss distributions in unsteady vortex shedding state e g for each bluff body up to β 0 4 the distributions of rss are characterized as two pairs of opposite signed clusters symmetric about the wake centerline besides the pair of large scale clusters located at a relatively downstream position there are two additional small scale clusters in the immediate wake of the body which are indicated by the arrows in the top left plot in fig 11 a similar phenomenon is reported by dong et al 2006 for a standalone cylinder at a similar reynolds number re 3900 based on piv measurements and direct numerical simulations this feature can be used to indicate whether vortex shedding occurs or not for example at β 0 5 last row of fig 11 the pair of small scale clusters are still evident in cc but disappear in fp or sc which is in accordance with the observation that vortex shedding does occur in the former case but not in the latter therefore the ensemble averaged statistical quantities can provide useful information about the dynamic flow features such as vortex shedding to further illustrate the effects of re and β the variations of the amplitude of rss versus blockage ratio for each bluff body at different reynolds numbers are presented in fig 12 here the amplitude of rss is defined as u v u 2 max u v u 2 min 2 it can be seen from fig 12 a that for cc the amplitude of rss is a function of both re and β when β is fixed the amplitude of rss generally increases with re when re is fixed however it attains a maximum at β 0 33 before decreasing with further increase in β for fp fig 12 b by contrast the effect of re is minimal because the three curves for different re almost collapse moreover the amplitude of rss decreases monotonically with increasing β at first mildly from β 0 25 to 0 33 and thereafter sharply particularly from β 0 4 to 0 5 when vortex shedding is inhibited for sc fig 12 c the variation trend with β is similar to that for fp but the effect of re is also evident in conjunction with the flow patterns fig 5 and the rss distributions fig 11 we can conclude that the amplitude of rss can be used as an indicator for the strength of vortex shedding an increase in the amplitude of rss see for example the case of cc from β 0 25 to 0 33 implies that vortex shedding is strengthened which is in accordance with the increase in amplitude of velocity spectral peak and the reduction in the mean recirculation length for this case on the other hand the decrease in the amplitude of rss symbolizes the attenuation of vortex shedding similar phenomenon was reported by liu et al 2016 on stabilizing the cylinder wake using a splitter plate when the flow undergoes the transition from periodic vortex shedding state to steady state such as for fp or sc from β 0 4 to 0 5 the amplitude of rss decreases remarkably take the case of re 4600 as an illustration when the blockage ratio increases from β 0 25 to 0 5 the amplitude of rss reduces by 28 6 76 3 and 85 1 for cc fp and sc respectively 4 concluding remarks the present study investigates the effects of varying reynolds number re 3200 4600 and 5400 and blockage ratio β 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 on the flow past a bluff body of different shape i e circular cylinder square cylinder and flat plate that is symmetrically confined in a two dimensional plane channel the incoming streamwise velocity profiles are in top hat shape and the thickness of the wall boundary layers is about 0 35 d based on detailed flow measurements using non intrusive particle image velocimetry piv the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the wall confinement alters the wake development and vortex shedding pattern in general wall confinement tends to stabilize the flow by attenuating the periodic vortex shedding from the bluff body until at large enough β vortex shedding is completely inhibited and the wake flow becomes steady for instance for fp and sc at β 0 5 however this is not always true for the case of cc when β increases from 0 25 to 0 33 vortex shedding is strengthened instead which has been confirmed by the value of mean recirculation length l r and the magnitude of velocity spectral peak among the three body shapes cc is the least susceptible to wall confinement effects since vortex shedding persists within the blockage ratio range considered 2 on the other hand vortex shedding frequency as expressed in terms of dimensionless strouhal number st increases monotonically with the blockage ratio once vortex shedding occurs regardless of the body shape this is attributed to the flow acceleration in the free stream due to the blockage effect of the bluff body a simple analytical expression is proposed to account for the effects of confinement on st with reference to the corresponding value of st0 under unconfined condition which shows fair agreement with the measurement data and the published results 3 the effect of reynolds number is relatively less substantial than that of blockage ratio the change in re does not alter the overall wake patterns with reference to the blockage ratio but it does affect the values of some flow parameters including the mean recirculation length l r and the strouhal number st with reference to body shape the effect of re is more obvious on cc than on the sharp edged bluff bodies sc or fp especially on fp that is nearly independent of re 4 the critical blockage ratio β c r i for the transition of wake flow from unsteady vortex shedding state to steady state depends on the shape of bluff body which is β c r i 0 5 for fp and sc but is higher than 0 5 for cc a schematic diagram of the vortex shedding patterns for moderately confined bluff body is proposed which is characterized by vortex pairing between the vortex shed from the bluff body and an induced vortex with opposite signed vorticity in the adjacent wall region 5 the effects of blockage ratio and reynolds number are also evident on the normalized reynolds shear stress rss in terms of the spatial distribution and magnitude at small β e g β 0 33 square cylinder is more effective than circular cylinder in promoting the wake development and enhancing turbulent mixing as indicated by i shorter mean recirculation length or vortex formation length ii nearer upstream location of significant rss zone towards the cylinder base yet wider rss spatial extent in the transverse direction and iii higher magnitude of rss however as compared to circular cylinder the effectiveness of square cylinder and also normal plate drops at a faster rate with increasing blockage ratio therefore in the case of strong confinement circular cylinder is preferable since vortex shedding persists over a larger blockage ratio range credit authorship

21179,this paper presents a particle image velocimetry piv study of the two dimensional flow past a bluff body confined in a channel three typical shapes of bluff body with the same height namely circular cylinder cc flat plate fp and square cylinder sc but with varying blockage ratio β 0 25 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 and reynolds number re 3200 4600 and 5400 are investigated it is shown that for each body shape vortex shedding patterns are relatively insensitive to reynolds number most notably for the case of fp but strongly depend on the blockage ratio as β increases the mean recirculation length of the wake is initially constant and then displays a sharp increase at about β 0 4 0 5 which corresponds to the flow transition from periodic vortex shedding state to steady state the strength of vortex shedding generally decreases with the increase in β except for cc at β 0 25 0 3 on the other hand the vortex shedding frequency expressed in terms of dimensionless strouhal number st increases

keywords wall confinement circular cylinder flat plate square cylinder vortex shedding particle image velocimetry piv 1 introduction the flow around a bluff body is a classical problem owing to its occurrence in many naturally occurring processes as well as in numerous engineering applications a common configuration is a bluff body symmetrically confined in a two dimensional 2 d plane channel where the extra confinement provided by the stationary no slip walls of the channel affects the nature and stability of the flow which may lead to the change in hydrodynamic forces on the body as well as in the heat and mass transfer characteristics e g chakraborty et al 2004 meis et al 2010 engineering applications of this flow configuration include flow through porous media or in textile coating processes heat exchangers and food processes alves et al 2001 one of its applications in ocean engineering is energy harvesting from vortex induced vibration viv of bluff body due to ocean current bernitsas et al 2008 for which wall confinement would significantly increase the extracted power soti and de 2020 different shapes of bluff bodies have been investigated by previous researchers including circular cylinder e g rehimi et al 2008 xiong et al 2013 and sharp edged non circular cylinders such as square cylinder e g patil and tiwari 2008 chatterjee and gupta 2015 flat plate e g lasher 2001 yeung 2008 and cube e g lacey and rennie 2012 singh et al 2019 according to the published literature the flow structure around a confined bluff body is determined by two basic parameters i the blockage ratio β d h where d is the height of bluff body and h is the height of channel and ii reynolds number re ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of fluid u is the free stream velocity and μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid it displays many features different from those of the unconfined standalone case particularly on the vortex shedding patterns an important phenomenon is that the alternating vortex shedding would be completely suppressed when the cylinder is in close proximity to the confinement wall or when β is large enough which was firstly reported by shair et al 1963 a brief review of published papers on the confined flow past the three typical types of bluff body i e circular cylinder square cylinder and flat plate is provided herein respectively focusing on the effects of β and re on the flow structure the confined circular cylinder has been investigated mainly in the laminar regime with an incoming poiseuille flow parabolic profile anagnostopoulos et al 1996 numerically studied the influence of β 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 at re 106 and observed that the lateral and longitudinal spacings of the shed vortices from the cylinder decrease as β increases chakraborty et al 2004 reported that for a fixed re the drag coefficient decreases with the increase in β over the range β 0 05 0 65 rehimi et al 2008 showed that for the case of β 0 33 recri is 108 which is more than twice higher than the classical value of recri 47 for unconfined case williamson 1996 the confinement also affects the three dimensional wake transition which was examined numerically by kanaris et al 2011 and griffith et al 2011 for the case of β 0 2 and β 0 5 respectively based on non intrusive interferometric measurements vyas et al 2020 found that vortex shedding is initiated at relatively lower value of recri 65 when the blockage ratio is low β 0 25 however when three dimensional 3 d transition is considered increasing the blockage ratio leads to an increase in the value of transition e g recri 165 for β 0 5 more recently soti and de 2020 investigated the effects of confinement on viv of a circular cylinder and its flow power extraction capability within the ranges of re 100 150 and β 0 25 0 5 the extracted power is found to increase rapidly with blockage ratio at β 0 5 for example it is an order of magnitude larger than the unconfined case on the other hand the simulations by kumar and singh 2020 on a confined circular cylinder in the subcritical regime re 5000 15 000 showed that the mean drag coefficient decreases with re for a fixed β but increases with β for a fixed re which is opposed to that reported by chakraborty et al 2004 in laminar regime as compared to the circular cylinder the flow around confined square cylinder received relatively less attention similarly the confinement tends to stabilize the wake flow and the strouhal number st and drag coefficient increase with increasing β while the base suction and stagnation pressure coefficients increase as well e g mukhopadhyay et al 1992 sharma and eswaran 2005 turki et al 2003 numerically investigated a confined square cylinder for re 120 200 and β 0 125 and 0 25 and showed that the value of recri increases with increasing β a similar finding was reported by patil and tiwari 2008 in terms of the wake bubble size and shear layer behavior based on numerical simulations on the flow past a highly confined square cylinder with β 0 9 mishra et al 2019 showed that the drag coefficient is as high as in the order of magnitude 103 and the value of recri is found to be 62 this is remarkably higher than the corresponding value of 47 for the unconfined case sohankar et al 1999 considering the fact that the separation points on square cylinder are fixed and hence the wake developments are insensitive to the variation in re derakhshandeh and alam 2019 several studies investigated confined flow around a normal flat plate but mostly in subcritical regime 300 re 3 105 which is in contrast to the cases of circular cylinder or square cylinder that are almost exclusively in laminar regime re 300 takeuchi and okamoto 1983 experimentally showed that for β 0 0 4 at re 3 22 104 the mean drag coefficient increases monotonically with β but the vortex shedding frequency keeps almost unchanged by contrast based on numerical simulations using the finite element method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the same flow as that in takeuchi and okamoto 1983 lasher 2001 predicted a consistently lower mean drag moreover vortex shedding frequency increases with β for the flow past a square cylinder at various angles of incidence under weakly confined conditions β 0 05 at re 100 200 sohankar et al 1998 reported that a decrease in β from 5 to 2 5 results in a slight decrease less than 1 5 in strouhal number mean drag and root mean square rms lift less than a 3 increase in stagnation pressure and a maximum 8 decrease in base suction yeung 2008 showed that for confined flow in subcritical regime the wake width rather than the length scale of the bluff body should be used to normalized the flow parameters the strouhal number based on the wake width and the velocity at flow separation is found to be independent of blockage ratio teimourian et al 2018 reviews state of the art development on the unsteady flow structure particularly the vortex shedding patterns over flat plates in different arrangements several observations can be obtained based on the above literature review firstly most of the published studies on this topic investigated the effect of either re or β separately by fixing the other parameter as a result the combined effects of re and β in a wide parameter space are still lacking particularly in the subcritical regime since almost all the previous studies on circular cylinder and square cylinder are in the laminar regime secondly nearly all the previous studies are limited to one particular shape of bluff body and hence a direct comparison of the flow for different shapes of bluff body is difficult if not impossible due to the vast variation in geometrical parameters and flow parameters among them as reviewed above for a same flow configuration the results reported by different researchers may be inconsistent or even contradictory therefore it is desirable to obtain quantitative information about the flow and to gain deeper insight into the underlying physics this motivates the present study using particle image velocimetry piv since it is capable of measuring the whole domain of instantaneous flow fields in a non intrusive manner three typical shapes of bluff body with the same height namely circular cylinder cc flat plate fp and square cylinder sc are investigated in the same experimental set up which is the main novelty of this study the effects of varying blockage ratio β 0 25 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 and reynolds number re 3200 4600 and 5400 are systematically examined 2 experimental set up and methodology 2 1 experimental set up the schematic diagram of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the experiments were performed in a re circulating open channel flume having a test section with dimensions of 5 m 0 3 m 0 45 m length width depth to homogenize the inlet flow at a low turbulence intensity a 0 3 m 0 45 m 0 2 m width depth thickness honeycomb straighter made of 20 mm in diameter brass tubes and a series of screens with wire diameter of 0 3 mm and solid blockage ratio of 0 2 were placed upstream of the test section to straightening the incoming flow and reduce the size of the incoming coherent flow structures the maximum turbulence intensity in the incoming free stream at the test section was less than 1 5 both the side walls and the bottom wall of the test section were made of glass for the ease of optical accessibility the three types of bluff body considered have the same characteristic length scale d 20 mm in which d stands for the diameter side length and height of the circular cylinder square cylinder and flat plate respectively the thickness of the flat plate is 2 mm or 0 1 d to create a confined channel flow an upper wall and a bottom wall made of transparent perspex plate 10 mm in thickness and 900 mm in length with sharp leading edge were installed horizontally across the span of the flume the bottom wall was located 50 mm above the channel floor to ensure a uniform flow upon entering the confined channel the separation distance h between the upper and lower walls was varied as 80 60 50 and 40 mm corresponding to β d h 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the bluff body was installed horizontally and symmetrically in between the upper and lower walls along the spanwise direction with its center located at a streamwise location of 400 mm or 20 d downstream of the leading edges during the experiments the water depth was maintained at 150 mm which satisfied the condition proposed by long et al 1990 and singh et al 2016 that a 2d flow in the centerline of the channel was achieved with a flume width depth ratio of 2 the oncoming flow velocity was varied as u 0 16 0 23 and 0 27 m s corresponding to re 3200 4600 and 5400 respectively the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center of the bluff body with x y and z denoting the streamwise transverse and spanwise directions respectively 2 2 measurement system the length or span of the bluff body was 300 mm yielding an aspect ratio of 15 which was large enough to ensure the flow to be nominally 2 d along the majority of the cylinder span lam and zou 2010 thus the flow measurements were carried out on the vertical mid span plane by a lavision piv system operating in double frame double exposure mode a laser light sheet of about 1 mm in thickness generated by a double cavity nd yag laser wavelength 532 nm power 135 mj per pulse duration 5 ns was used to illuminate the flow field neutrally buoyant sphericel 110p8 hollow glass spheres of 10 15 μm in diameter were added as tracer particles a 14 bit ccd camera spatial resolution 1600 1200 pixels sampling frequency 15 hz was used to capture the particle images the size of field of view was 130 97 mm2 the obtained particle images were processed by lavision davis software version 7 2 using the fast fourier transform fft based cross correlation algorithm the particle displacements representing the flow velocities were evaluated with a window deformation iterative multi grid with window size down to 32 32 pixels at 50 overlap yielding a spatial resolution of 1 3 mm2 the time interval between each pair of images was adjusted according to the incoming velocity in the free stream so that a maximum displacement was about 7 pixels satisfying the criterion for optimum cross correlation proposed by boillot and prasad 1996 for each case piv acquisitions were made for a duration of 84 s at a sampling frequency of 15 hz hence 1260 pairs of double frame images were obtained to achieve reasonably converged statistics of the flow such as mean and turbulence properties the uncertainties in the instantaneous velocities u and v and the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z δ v δ x δ u δ y were estimated to be about 2 and 10 respectively the reader is referred to wang and tan 2007 for more details about the piv post processing procedure and uncertainty analysis 2 3 incoming flow conditions at first the incoming flow conditions in the empty channel without the bluff body have been recorded fig 2 presents the streamwise mean velocity profiles for the case of h 40 mm and re 4600 it is apparent that the profiles are in top hat shape which is in contrast to the parabolic type poiseuille flow in the laminar regime as in most of the previous studies similar profiles are found for other values of h and re and hence are not shown for brevity it can be seen that the profiles at the three streamwise locations x d 0 3 and 6 are almost identical indicating that the boundary layers on the upper and lower channel walls are fully developed the thickness δ of wall boundary layers is about 7 mm or δ d 0 35 a value similar to wang and tan 2008a for the near wall cylinder 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean flow patterns fig 3 presents the mean streamline patterns in the wake of the bluff body cc fp and sc with re 4600 at β 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 the mean wake is characterized by a symmetric recirculation zone with a pair of counter rotating bubbles it is obvious that the size width and length of the recirculation zone is a function of both the body shape and the blockage ratio at small blockage ratios β 0 25 and 0 33 the recirculation zone of fp is the largest whereas that of sc is the smallest when β is large enough e g β 0 5 the recirculation zone elongates in the streamwise direction significantly which is associated with the transition from unsteady to steady flow to be shown later in section 3 2 here we use the length scale of the recirculation zone l r as shown in the top left plot of fig 3 which is defined as the streamwise distance from the cylinder base to the saddle point where the streamlines intersect roshko 1993 as suggested by and ozkan et al 2017 the value of l r is also a quantitative indicator of vortex formation length fig 4 a c present the variation of the normalized recirculation length l r d with respect to the blockage ratio at different reynolds numbers re 3200 4600 and 5400 for cc fp and sc respectively the reported values of l r d in the literature for the bluff body under unconfined condition at similar reynolds numbers have been added as reference i e l r d 1 67 for cc in parnaudeau et al 2008 1 88 for fp in afgan et al 2013 and 1 25 for sc in minguez et al 2011 for cc fig 4 a l r varies with both re and β in general for a fixed β the higher re the smaller l r a similar trend was reported in roshko 1993 for the unconfined cylinder this is the reason why the curve for re 3200 is always higher than the corresponding value of 1 67 d for the unconfined cylinder as the latter is obtained at a relatively higher reynolds number re 3900 on the other hand the value of l r is significantly affected by the boundary conditions oruç 2012 and ozkan et al 2012 showed that for a vertical circular cylinder in shallow water with a depth of 0 5 d l r is as small as 1 1 d although re is similar re 5300 for the present wall bounded circular cylinder when re is fixed the variation of l r with β is not monotonic instead l r exhibits a local minimum at β 0 33 for fp fig 4 b by contrast l r is insensitive to the change in re since the three curves almost coincide with each other this is attributed to the fact that unlike circular cylinder the points of flow separation for sharp edged bluff bodies are fixed at the corners which is independent of reynolds number derakhshandeh and alam 2019 moreover l r d initially keeps constant at about 1 7 for β 0 25 and 0 33 and thereafter increases sharply with further increase in β for sc as shown in fig 4 c the effects of re and β seem to fall in between the cc and fp cases on the one hand similar to the fp case the value of l r is basically insensitive to re but limited to certain values of β only i e except for β 0 4 on the other hand the effect of confinement on the mean recirculation length is prominent only when β 0 4 a phenomenon similar to the fp case for both fp and sc the values of l r at β 0 25 or 0 33 are close to the corresponding values under unconfined condition suggesting that the confinement effect is relatively weak 3 2 instantaneous flow patterns fig 5 provides a representative snapshot of the instantaneous velocity vector plots for each case the plots are superimposed with flood contours of normalized spanwise vorticity ω z d u at the smallest blockage ratio β 0 25 the wake is characterized as periodic vortex shedding since the two shear layers upper and lower roll up into street of large scale von kármán like vortices just like the unconfined case among the three bluff bodies cc has the narrowest width of vortex street as indicated by the transverse distance between the two rows of opposite signed vortices and hence is the least vulnerable to wall confinement effect as manifested by the vortex induced separation on the walls each shed vortex is likely to be accompanied by an opposite signed discrete vortex in the near wall region see for example the positive anti clockwise vortex in the case of sc at β 0 25 this type of vortex pairing is an indicator of the interference between the wake and the wall similar vortex induced separation and instability have been reported in price et al 2002 dipankar and sengupta 2005 and wang and tan 2008a for a cylinder placed in proximity to a plane wall however it is not obvious in reported studies on confined bluff body in laminar regime for example meis et al 2010 found transversal plumes rather than discrete vortices produced at the interface between adjacent vortices shed from the cylinder this is likely attributed to the fact that the incoming flow is poiseuille type with much thicker boundary layers δ 0 5 h and hence smaller velocity gradient and hence vorticity magnitude fig 5 also shows that when β increases to 0 33 and 0 4 vortex shedding persists for all the three bluff bodies implying stronger wake wall interference due to the confinement effects the width of vortex street reduces with β at β 0 5 vortex shedding still persists for cc for fp and sc however the upper and lower shear layers exhibit as elongated chains of vorticity in kelvin helmholtz k h type of roll up without mutual interaction in other words the wake becomes steady to summarize the wake experiences a transition from unsteady state to steady state when the blockage ratio is large enough and the value of critical blockage ratio β c r i depends on the shape of bluff body which is β c r i 0 5 for fp and sc but higher than 0 5 for cc the flow transition from unsteady state to steady state is evident on the wake development fig 6 provides the streamwise mean velocity profiles at different locations in the wake x d 0 55 6 based on which one can observe the effects of body shape and blockage ratio due to the blockage effect a velocity defect is formed immediately downstream of the bluff body and then gradually recovers with downstream distance a phenomenon similar to the unconfined case however the wall confinement results in that the flow has some distinct features different from that of a bluff body under unconfined condition or in proximity to a plane wall for instance the magnitude of the free stream velocity which is originally around 0 23 m s increases with β from 0 25 to 0 3 m s at β 0 25 to 0 4 0 5 m s at β 0 5 according to the mass conservation principle the increase in the magnitude of free stream velocity effectively increases the velocity gradient across the shear layers therefore the magnitude of spanwise vorticity which is associated with velocity gradient is increased which is beneficial for momentum exchange and turbulent mixing here we take the recovery rate of the defected wake at x d 6 as an indicator of turbulent mixing at small blockage ratios β 0 25 fig 6 a or 0 33 fig 6 b sc is the fastest in terms of recovery rate followed by cc and fp this is attributed to the fact that the value of l r or vortex formation length for sc is smaller than that of cc or fp at large blockage ratios β 0 4 fig 6 c or 0 5 fig 6 d by contrast the recovery rate of cc exceeds that of sc or fp as compared to cc fp and sc are more susceptible to wall confinement effect a similar trend is reported for a cylinder placed adjacent to a wall boundary layer the critical gap between the cylinder and the wall for suppression of vortex shedding is found to be about 0 3 d for circular cylinder e g price et al 2002 wang and tan 2008a and 0 3 d 0 5 d for square cylinder bosch and rodi 1996 wang and tan 2008b in order to better illustrate the vortex shedding process and vortex induced separation at the wall region a time series of piv snapshots for cc with re 4600 and β 0 4 are shown in fig 7 the time interval between consecutive snapshots is 1 15 s at t 0 s fig 7 a a negative clockwise vortex labeled as a1 is formed from the upper side whereas a positive anti clockwise vortex b1 is just to be shed from the lower side each vortex induces an opposite signed vortex in the adjacent wall region resulting in the vortex pairing viz a1 and a1 b1 and b1 as time evolves fig 7 b d each pair of vortices propagate downstream at the same pace at t 4 15 s fig 7 e two new pairs of counter rotating vortices i e a2 and a2 b2 and b2 are formed they are very similar to those in fig 7 a in terms of size magnitude and location symbolizing the onset of another vortex shedding cycle similar phenomenon is found for fp and sc at moderate β when vortex shedding occurs based on the above observations a schematic representation of the wake flow structure for the bluff body moderately confined in a channel is proposed in fig 8 due to the presence of the channel wall the wake is characterized by vortex pairing between the vortex shed from the bluff body and the induced vortex with opposite signed vorticity in the adjacent wall region as a result the fluid in the near wall region is periodically ejected inward as indicated by the small arrows in fig 8 towards the channel centerline which is beneficial for the mass and heat transfer inside the channel meis et al 2010 3 3 vortex shedding frequencies as shown in fig 7 the vortex shedding and paring process is highly repeatable therefore we can calculate the vortex shedding frequency based on the piv measurement data take the 5 snapshots in fig 7 as an example which exactly consists of a complete cycle of vortex shedding therefore the period of vortex shedding for this case is 4 15 s this is equivalent to a vortex shedding frequency f 15 4 3 75 hz thus yielding a strouhal number of st f d u 0 326 to quantitatively determine the frequency of vortex shedding for each case the time history of the transverse velocity v in the wake i e at x d y d 3 0 was extracted and analyzed by spectral analysis using fft the obtained amplitude spectral density asd for the three bluff bodies at re 4600 and different blockage ratios are shown in fig 9 for cc fig 9 a the spectrum for each blockage ratio β 0 25 0 5 always exhibits a well defined peak which corresponds to the periodic vortex shedding as can be observed in the instantaneous flow fields the value of st increases monotonically with β from st 0 27 at β 0 25 to 0 48 at β 0 5 a similar trend is found for fp and sc but only up to a certain value of β viz β 0 4 beyond which the spectral peak either becomes rather broad banded for sc or even disappears completely for fp as a matter of fact the increase in vortex shedding frequency with increasing β is evident in the instantaneous snapshots shown in fig 5 as well for each body shape the longitudinal distance between two adjacent vortices reduces with increasing β moreover the strength of vortex shedding which can be appreciated based on the amplitude of spectral peak generally decreases monotonically with increasing β at the highest blockage ratio β 0 5 the spectral peak for cc though still evident attenuates in magnitude as compared to that at smaller β for sc and fp it becomes broad banded and even disappears completely respectively it is noted that for cc when β increases from 0 25 to 0 33 however there is an increase in the amplitude of spectral peak which is consistent with the observation in fig 4 a that l r achieves a local minimum at β 0 33 implying that vortex shedding is strengthened instead the above results show that vortex shedding frequency for the confined body increases with the blockage ratio whereas it maintains constant for a bluff body placed adjacent to a plane wall price et al 2002 wang and tan 2008b the increase in vortex shedding frequency for a confined body is attributed to the acceleration in the free stream due to the blockage effect theoretically for a bluff body under unconfined condition the strouhal number is st0 f d u e where u e is the effective streamwise velocity in the free stream the value of st0 for cc fp and sc over the considered re range maintains constant at about 0 2 0 17 and 0 13 respectively which agrees well with the literature for instance oruç et al 2016 reported that for a circular cylinder st0 decreases slightly from 0 2 to 0 18 as re increases from 3350 to 10 200 for a confined bluff body in a channel the free stream velocity can be calculated as u e u 1 β based on the mass conservation principle therefore we can obtain st0 f d 1 β u st 1 β or st st0 1 β the predicted strouhal numbers using this equation together with the obtained experimental data as well as those published in the literature are plotted in fig 10 in general the data agreement is fairly good for each body shape st is strongly dependent on β and is relatively insensitive to re within the measurement range it is noteworthy that for cc fig 10 a the reported data by griffith et al 2011 and mathupriya et al 2018 are consistently lower than the present results this discrepancy is attributable to the difference in re which is 300 in griffith et al 2011 and 500 in mathupriya et al 2018 vs o 103 in the present study for sharp edged bluff bodies i e fp fig 10 b or sc fig 10 b on the other hand the present data agree well the literature i e lasher 2001 sharify et al 2013 suggestive of the reduced effects from re here we summarize the effects of confinement on the wake flow structure regardless of the body shape the wake is characterized by vortex shedding patterns up to the critical blockage ratio β c r i with the increase in β vortex shedding strength generally decreases except for the case of cc at β 0 33 while vortex shedding frequency increases monotonically therefore for each body shape there would exist an optimum value of β at which maximum mixing is achieved the increase in both vortex shedding frequency and vortex strength with increasing β over a certain range may explain why the extracted power from viv of a confined circular cylinder increases rapidly with the blockage ratio as reported by soti and de 2020 further investigations will be conducted to obtain the exact value of optimal β for specific applications 3 4 reynolds shear stress the distributions of the normalized reynolds shear stress rss u v u 2 for re 4600 at β 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 are provided in fig 11 from which the spatial development of shear layers can be appreciated for example one can identify the different flow patterns elongated shear layers or alternating vortex shedding which are in local convective instability and global absolute instability respectively huerre and monkewitz 1990 in the former the shear layers are elongated chains of k h vorticity which develop basically independently without mutual interaction in the latter significant momentum exchange between the shear layers occurs leading to an increase in the magnitude of rss it can be seen that the distributions of rss vary with both the body shape and the blockage ratio at the smallest blockage ratio i e subjective to the least effect of wall confinement the rss distributions agree with the previous studies both qualitatively and quantitatively take cc as an example at β 0 25 see top left plot of fig 11 the peak positive and negative values u v u 2 max and u v u 2 min are 0 138 and 0 142 whereas the corresponding values reported in oruç 2012 for an unbounded circular cylinder at re 5200 are 0 102 and 0 106 respectively for each bluff body an overall trend can be seen with the change in blockage ratio as β increases from 0 25 to 0 5 the magnitude of rss decreases and the spatial extent of rss elongates in the streamwise direction a similar phenomenon was reported by liu et al 2016 for stabilizing the wake flow of a confined cylinder using a splitter plate at β 0 3 and re 2400 and 3000 an exception is for cc at β 0 33 when the magnitude of rss shows an increase instead a comparison of the three bluff bodies at the same β indicates that i along the streamwise direction sc displays the earliest downstream locations for peak rss particularly at β 0 25 and 0 33 which agrees with that sc has the shortest mean recirculation or vortex formation length and ii along the transverse direction the rss distributions of cc are always narrower than those of fp or sc indicating that cc is the least susceptible to wall confinement effects for instance at the smallest blockage ratio β 0 25 the magnitude of rss for cc is the lowest and that of sc is the highest at the largest blockage ratio β 0 5 on the contrary the order is reversed i e cc fp sc more importantly one can appreciate the vortex patterns based on the rss distributions in unsteady vortex shedding state e g for each bluff body up to β 0 4 the distributions of rss are characterized as two pairs of opposite signed clusters symmetric about the wake centerline besides the pair of large scale clusters located at a relatively downstream position there are two additional small scale clusters in the immediate wake of the body which are indicated by the arrows in the top left plot in fig 11 a similar phenomenon is reported by dong et al 2006 for a standalone cylinder at a similar reynolds number re 3900 based on piv measurements and direct numerical simulations this feature can be used to indicate whether vortex shedding occurs or not for example at β 0 5 last row of fig 11 the pair of small scale clusters are still evident in cc but disappear in fp or sc which is in accordance with the observation that vortex shedding does occur in the former case but not in the latter therefore the ensemble averaged statistical quantities can provide useful information about the dynamic flow features such as vortex shedding to further illustrate the effects of re and β the variations of the amplitude of rss versus blockage ratio for each bluff body at different reynolds numbers are presented in fig 12 here the amplitude of rss is defined as u v u 2 max u v u 2 min 2 it can be seen from fig 12 a that for cc the amplitude of rss is a function of both re and β when β is fixed the amplitude of rss generally increases with re when re is fixed however it attains a maximum at β 0 33 before decreasing with further increase in β for fp fig 12 b by contrast the effect of re is minimal because the three curves for different re almost collapse moreover the amplitude of rss decreases monotonically with increasing β at first mildly from β 0 25 to 0 33 and thereafter sharply particularly from β 0 4 to 0 5 when vortex shedding is inhibited for sc fig 12 c the variation trend with β is similar to that for fp but the effect of re is also evident in conjunction with the flow patterns fig 5 and the rss distributions fig 11 we can conclude that the amplitude of rss can be used as an indicator for the strength of vortex shedding an increase in the amplitude of rss see for example the case of cc from β 0 25 to 0 33 implies that vortex shedding is strengthened which is in accordance with the increase in amplitude of velocity spectral peak and the reduction in the mean recirculation length for this case on the other hand the decrease in the amplitude of rss symbolizes the attenuation of vortex shedding similar phenomenon was reported by liu et al 2016 on stabilizing the cylinder wake using a splitter plate when the flow undergoes the transition from periodic vortex shedding state to steady state such as for fp or sc from β 0 4 to 0 5 the amplitude of rss decreases remarkably take the case of re 4600 as an illustration when the blockage ratio increases from β 0 25 to 0 5 the amplitude of rss reduces by 28 6 76 3 and 85 1 for cc fp and sc respectively 4 concluding remarks the present study investigates the effects of varying reynolds number re 3200 4600 and 5400 and blockage ratio β 0 25 0 33 0 4 and 0 5 on the flow past a bluff body of different shape i e circular cylinder square cylinder and flat plate that is symmetrically confined in a two dimensional plane channel the incoming streamwise velocity profiles are in top hat shape and the thickness of the wall boundary layers is about 0 35 d based on detailed flow measurements using non intrusive particle image velocimetry piv the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the wall confinement alters the wake development and vortex shedding pattern in general wall confinement tends to stabilize the flow by attenuating the periodic vortex shedding from the bluff body until at large enough β vortex shedding is completely inhibited and the wake flow becomes steady for instance for fp and sc at β 0 5 however this is not always true for the case of cc when β increases from 0 25 to 0 33 vortex shedding is strengthened instead which has been confirmed by the value of mean recirculation length l r and the magnitude of velocity spectral peak among the three body shapes cc is the least susceptible to wall confinement effects since vortex shedding persists within the blockage ratio range considered 2 on the other hand vortex shedding frequency as expressed in terms of dimensionless strouhal number st increases monotonically with the blockage ratio once vortex shedding occurs regardless of the body shape this is attributed to the flow acceleration in the free stream due to the blockage effect of the bluff body a simple analytical expression is proposed to account for the effects of confinement on st with reference to the corresponding value of st0 under unconfined condition which shows fair agreement with the measurement data and the published results 3 the effect of reynolds number is relatively less substantial than that of blockage ratio the change in re does not alter the overall wake patterns with reference to the blockage ratio but it does affect the values of some flow parameters including the mean recirculation length l r and the strouhal number st with reference to body shape the effect of re is more obvious on cc than on the sharp edged bluff bodies sc or fp especially on fp that is nearly independent of re 4 the critical blockage ratio β c r i for the transition of wake flow from unsteady vortex shedding state to steady state depends on the shape of bluff body which is β c r i 0 5 for fp and sc but is higher than 0 5 for cc a schematic diagram of the vortex shedding patterns for moderately confined bluff body is proposed which is characterized by vortex pairing between the vortex shed from the bluff body and an induced vortex with opposite signed vorticity in the adjacent wall region 5 the effects of blockage ratio and reynolds number are also evident on the normalized reynolds shear stress rss in terms of the spatial distribution and magnitude at small β e g β 0 33 square cylinder is more effective than circular cylinder in promoting the wake development and enhancing turbulent mixing as indicated by i shorter mean recirculation length or vortex formation length ii nearer upstream location of significant rss zone towards the cylinder base yet wider rss spatial extent in the transverse direction and iii higher magnitude of rss however as compared to circular cylinder the effectiveness of square cylinder and also normal plate drops at a faster rate with increasing blockage ratio therefore in the case of strong confinement circular cylinder is preferable since vortex shedding persists over a larger blockage ratio range credit authorship
