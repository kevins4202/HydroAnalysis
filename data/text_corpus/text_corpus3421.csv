17105,the aerobic granular sludge ags process is an effective wastewater treatment technology for organic matter and nutrient removal that has been introduced in the market rapidly until now limited information is available on ags regarding the removal of bacterial and viral pathogenic organisms present in sewage this study focussed on determining the relation between reactor operational conditions plug flow feeding turbulent aeration and settling and physical and biological mechanisms on removing two faecal surrogates escherichia coli and ms2 bacteriophages two ags laboratory scale systems were separately fed with influent spiked with 1 0 106 cfu 100 ml of e coli and 1 3 108 pfu 100 ml of ms2 bacteriophages and followed during the different operational phases the reactors contained only granular sludge and no flocculent sludge both systems showed reductions in the liquid phase of 0 3 log10 during anaerobic feeding caused by a dilution factor and attachment of the organisms on the granules higher removal efficiencies were achieved during aeration approximately 1 log10 for e coli and 0 6 log10 for the ms2 bacteriophages caused mainly by predation the 18s sequencing analysis revealed high operational taxonomic units otus of free living protozoa genera rhogostoma and telotrochidium concerning the whole eukaryotic community attached ciliates propagated after the addition of the e coli an active contribution of the genera epistylis vorticella and pseudovorticella was found when the reactor reached stability in contrast no significant growth of predators occurred when spiking the system with ms2 bacteriophages indicating a low contribution of protozoa on the phage removal settling did not contribute to the removal of the studied bacterial and viral surrogates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords escherichia coli ms2 bacteriophages nereda pathogens sanitation protozoa predation 1 introduction the aerobic granular sludge ags process has been shown to be an effective technology for wastewater treatment bengtsson et al 2018 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 the current full scale ags technology nereda operates as an up flow anaerobically fed sequencing batch reactor sbr with simultaneous feeding and effluent withdrawal and in between an extended aeration period pronk et al 2015b de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 the biomass in the ags system consists of agglomerated bacteria that simultaneously remove organic matter and nutrients de kreuk et al 2007 this agglomeration is possible due to microbial extracellular polymeric substances that bind individual cells into granules liu and tay 2002 lin et al 2010 shi and liu 2021 the bacterial community in the granule consists of phosphate accumulating organisms paos ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob winkler et al 2013 szabó et al 2017 these bacterial groups are responsible for organic matter and nutrient removal other organisms present such as filamentous bacteria protozoa and metazoans are related to the granule formation and system performance schwarzenbeck et al 2004 weber et al 2007 full scale ags systems contain a large granular sludge and smaller flocculent sludge fraction ali et al 2019 in general ags wastewater treatment systems report high removal efficiencies of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pronk et al 2015b pronk et al 2017 bengtsson et al 2018 besides a good treatment performance concerning the water quality parameters two recent studies showed the capability of the ags technology in removing bacterial and viral indicator organisms from sewage barrios hernández et al 2020b and thwaites et al 2018 compared removal efficiencies in ags and conventional aerobic sludge cas full and pilot scale wastewater treatment plants the ags full scale systems can just as effectively remove indicator organisms as the cas process for example the log10 removal for both systems ranged between 1 7 and 2 6 for bacteria as e coli and between 1 4 and 2 4 for f specific rna bacteriophages both studies mentioned above emphasised that the presence of the variety of protozoa commonly present in wastewater treatments could be influencing the removal of the indicator organisms for a good understanding of pathogen removal by ags systems more mechanistic studies are needed a large number of studies can be found for other wastewater treatment systems looking at biological cell lysis and predation and physical adsorption and precipitation removal mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria a study by van der drift et al 1977 postulated that the faecal surrogate e coli was either biologically predated by protozoa or ended up enmeshed into the sludge flocs hereafter other researchers confirmed the importance of protozoa as grazers in cas systems curds 1982 mallory et al 1983 madoni 1994 and their role as primary predator during aeration curds 1973 more recently the removal of viruses in cas systems has been studied using bacteriophages as a surrogate for viruses showing that their elimination from sewage can be challenging due to their persistence and abundance lucena et al 2004 amarasiri et al 2017 bacteriophages tend to either attach or detach from surfaces depending on the surrounding water conditions bales et al 1993 they can also be predated by heterotrophic flagellates gonzález and suttle 1993 deng et al 2014 according to stevik et al 2004 and dias et al 2017 their retention and depletion in wastewater may be affected by system configuration hydraulic retention time water quality temperature ph and organic matter and water flow velocity among other factors it is still unclear which removal mechanism plays a major role in ags systems especially in the granular fraction and how far these mechanisms are linked to the different operational phases the main goal of this study was to relate the operational conditions of an ags laboratory scale reactor with the removal of a faecal bacterial surrogate e coli and a viral surrogate ms2 bacteriophage moreover the attachment of the faecal organisms onto the granules protozoa predation and the contribution of the settling in the bacterial and viral surrogate removal process was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 research design two laboratory scale reactors were operated long term as sequencing batch reactors sbr both systems developed a steady state situation with mature granules when fed with only synthetic wastewater when the steady state was reached the influent was spiked with known concentrations of two typical surrogates for bacterial and viral water quality e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages reactors were monitored weekly for physicochemical and microbiological water quality parameters before and after each cycle operational phase anaerobic plug feeding aeration phase and settling changes in the protozoa community were observed using microscopy observation and changes in the eukaryotic community were studied using 18s rrna sequence analysis next to the long term investigation additional batch experiments were executed to better understand predation using a fluorescent staining technique and attachment of the surrogates on the granular surface the contribution of the settling phase to the removal of the studied surrogates was also evaluated 2 2 laboratory scale sbr two laboratory scale sbrs hereafter called ags e coli and ags ms2 were operated for 154 and 125 days respectively the operational cycles follow the sequence of an anaerobic phase aeration reaction phase and settling and effluent withdrawal figure 1 during the anaerobic phase the systems were fed in a plug flow mode for 60 min hereafter an air recirculation pump operated at 6 l min kept the system completely mixed and aerated 1 8 mg l for 110 min a 5 min settling time was followed by effluent discharge creating a sludge selection mechanism resulting in dense granules in the reactors the reactors consisted of a double wall glass bubble column of 2 9 l cbn the netherlands they were operated and controlled with a braun dcu4 controller coupled with both mass flow and a multi fermenter control system mfcs using acquisition software santorious stedim biotech s s germany the system was operated and controlled with an applikon adi controller model 1030 connected to a computer with the software bioxpert 2 applikon the netherlands both systems were operated at 20 1 c the ph of 7 0 0 1 was automatically controlled by adding either 1m hcl or 1m naoh both systems were inoculated with crushed sludge from an ags full scale wwtp garmerwolde the netherlands with an initial total suspended solids tss concentration of 8 3 2 5 g l 2 2 1 synthetic wastewater the systems were fed with the synthetic wastewater composed of acetate 2 9 kg m3 day ammonium nitrogen 0 48 kg nh4 n m3 day phosphorus source 0 08 kg po3 p m3 day and trace metals prepared according to the vishniac and santer 1957 solution the bacterial and viral surrogates were added once the granular stability in the reactors was established i e after day 47 in the ags e coli reactor and after day 69 of operation in the ags ms2 reactor the concentration in the influent for the ags e coli reactor was between 1 104 and 1 107 cfu 100 ml for the ags ms2 reactor concentrations were between 1 105 and 1 108 pfu 100 ml 2 2 2 bacterial and viral surrogates due to their importance for water quality regulations two faecal surrogates were selected and enumerated as explained in scoullos et al 2019 2 2 2 1 e coli strain culture and enumeration the e coli atcc reference strain 25922 was taken as bacteria surrogate for faecal contamination e coli was initially inoculated in a sterilised nutrient broth medium merck kgaa germany and incubated on a shaking platform 150 rpm at 37 1 c for 24 hours a stock concentration of about 1 109 cfu 100 ml was obtained and enumerated by spreading the medium on chromocult sigma aldrich germany coliform agar plates later the suspension was spiked to the influent of the ags e coli reactor by diluting the stock culture into a vessel of 10 l to an end concentration in the reactor of 1 107 cfu 100 ml for enumeration viable counts were conducted in triplicate according to iso 9308 1 anon 2000a aliquots of 0 1 ml of either pure or diluted sample were spread on the coliform agar plates and inoculated overnight at 37 1 c undiluted samples with expected concentrations lower than 30 cfu 100 ml were analysed in duplicate using membrane filtration that is 100 ml of the undiluted sample was passed through a cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 μm the filter was placed on chromocult coliform agar plates and incubated at 37 1 c for 24 hours 2 2 2 2 bacteriophage strain culture and enumeration the e coli bacteriophage ms2 reference strain atcc 15597 b1 was used as the viral surrogate the phage was propagated in tryptone yeast glucose broth tygb using another e coli strain atcc 15597 as host bacteria while shaking at 150 rpm the incubation temperature was 37 1 c for 24 hours to reach a stock concentration of 1 1012 pfu 100 ml working solutions were prepared in saline water buffer before being applied to the ags ms2 reactor by diluting the stock culture into a vessel of 10 l to a concentration 1 108 pfu 100 ml the ms2 bacteriophage enumeration was determined based on iso 10705 1 anon 2000b as plaque forming units pfu the host bacteria 1 ml was cultured in 50 ml of tygb to a concentration of approximately 108 pfu 100 ml samples diluted 10 fold 100 fold and 1000 fold were mixed in semisolid tryptone yeast glucose agar tyga and poured in solid tyga before being incubated at 37 1 c for 18 hours 2 3 sample collection and processing 2 3 1 physicochemical water quality parameters for the performance of the reactor 10 ml samples were taken from the liquid bulk before the aeration phase 62 min and from the effluent the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter millex hv germany and subjected to the following analysis chemical oxygen demand cod orthophosphate po4 p and nitrogen related parameters such as nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n for the cod measurement the closed reflux colorimetric standard method apha 2012 was used the rest of the measurements were performed using lck hach germany cuvette tests to control the optimal biomass growth the tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to the standard methods apha 2012 for sludge samples and treated effluent samples 2 3 2 microbiological sampling process for microbiological enumeration samples were taken weekly from both reactors ags e coli and ags ms2 at the following sampling points influent 10 ml mixed liquor at the end of the anaerobic phase 25 ml mixed liquor at the end of the aerobic phase 25 ml and effluent 10 ml from the mixed liquor samples the sludge was separated from the liquid hereafter referred to supernatant by letting the sludge settle for 5 min the supernatant 10 ml was extracted with a syringe and placed in a separated vessel approximately 1 ml of the settled sludge fraction was crushed and homogenised using a glass teflon potter elvehjem tube all samples were enumerated in duplicate as explained in section 2 2 2 results from the supernatant and sludge fractions after anaerobic and aerobic phases were subjected to a statistical analysis wilcoxon signed rank test after normalization to determine whether paired mean concentrations were significantly p 0 05 different from each other or not the number of samples n for the analysis was between 8 and 13 2 4 optical microscope observation of protozoa additional samples of granules 5 ml were taken during aeration to be inspected for protozoa presence samples of 25 µl were observed under optical microscopes olympus ch30 10x 20x and 40x and olympus bx51 10x 20x and 40x the stalked ciliated protozoa activity occurrence and mobility was studied based on a qualitative and quantitative scale observation of the individuals as described in amaral et al 2018 for the 40x magnification an area of approximately 37 mm2 was measured the highest value of 100 was assigned to the ones that showed high activity and more than six individuals mm2 in all the observations a value of 5 was assigned to samples that at least showed one individual mm2 in any of the measured samples samples were checked in triplicates 2 4 1 dna extraction and 18s rrna gene sequencing genomic dna was extracted from approximately 0 25 g of crushed sludge collected on days 104 and 160 from the ags e coli reactor day 90 from the ags ms2 reactor and the seed sludge using qiaamp powerfecal pro dna kit qiagen the dna concentration was determined using an invitrogen qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa the v4 region of 18s rrna genes was amplified using the following eukaryote specific primers pair 528f 5 gcggtaattccagctccaa 3 and

were performed by uparse software uparse v7 0 1001 operational taxonomic units otus were obtained by clustering with 97 similarity the analysis was performed using silva database for species annotation the raw sequence data were uploaded to the national center for biotechnology ncbi under accession numbers samn16526359 samn16526360 samn16526361 and samn16526362 2 5 e coli fluorescence microscopy observations to identify and record protozoa predation a fluorescence staining detection method for e coli was used granules from an additional ags laboratory scale reactor as well as granules from a full scale wwtp were checked on the abundance of ciliates attached to the granular surface the e coli atcc 25922 was labelled using a dsgreen gel staining solution 10 000x lumiprobe hannover germany it was analysed with the fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc filter set in the microscope e coli was 10 fold diluted as follows 2 µl of the 10 000x dilution of dsgreen was added to a 1 998 µl of e coli atcc 25922 to obtain the final working solution of 1 104 cfu µl mini batch reactors were prepared in 2 ml eppendorf tubes in which 1 ml of granules were spiked with 1 ml of the solution with the previously labelled e coli the solution was quickly mixed three times in a pulsing vortex mixer vwr germany then incubated in the dark for 15 minutes the treated granules were washed three times in 400 µl of 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs and centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 5 min eppendorf minispin germany then resuspended in 1x pbs to get a final volume of 2 ml aliquots of 3 µl were placed on glass slides and analysed under an olympus bx51 fluorescent microscope coupled with an xm10 camera an x cite fluorescence lamp lumen dynamics series 120q and a fitc filter approximately between 8 and 12 sets of pictures of different visual parts of the granules were taken for each picture set both phase contrast and fluorescence images were taken at magnifications from 10 to 100x overlay pictures were analysed using fiji image analysis software https fiji sc 2 6 attachment of e coli and ms2 bacteriophages to determine whether e coli and ms2 bacteriophages attached to the granules batch tests were performed at the same temperature as the long term study 20 c round shaped granules from 0 2 to 3 8 mm from an additional control ags laboratory scale reactor were tested the ags reactor was fed only with synthetic wastewater therefore there were no e coli bacteria ms2 bacteriophages nor potential predators microscopically detectable such as free swimming and attached ciliated protozoa the experimental tests were carried out based on hendricks et al 1979 with the following modifications three beakers were prepared with 50 g of the fresh granules and filled up to 200 ml with a synthetic wastewater solution the beakers were mixed continuously with a magnet stirrer 250 rpm then spiked with a known concentration of the target microorganisms 105 and 107 cfu 100 ml of e coli bacteria and 106 and 109 pfu 100 ml of ms2 bacteriophage the initial concentration in the attachment test c 0 was measured by taking 1 ml from the suspension liquid bulk the experiments aimed to analyse the behaviour of the surrogates during the 60 minutes of anaerobic feeding therefore 1 ml was consecutively taken from the suspension after letting the sludge settle at times c t 5 15 30 45 and 60 min since target organisms keep suspended in the liquid phase the difference between c 0 and c t was assumed to be caused by attachment to the granular media experiments were performed in duplicates as well as the spreading and enumeration of the microorganism kinetics were calculated using the pseudo second order equation eq 1 explained by simonin 2016 in which t corresponds to the exposure time in minutes between the target organism and the granules q is the e coli bacteria cfu g or the ms2 bacteriophages pfu g concentration attached per gram of granule q e is the maximum attachment capacity of the organisms cfu g or pfu g and k is the fitted constant 1 t q 1 q e t 1 k q e 2 2 7 contribution of the settling in the ags reactor the effects of the settling on the removal of the target microorganisms were independently evaluated in an additional ags reactor operated like the long term studied reactors but without being fed with any surrogate the granules cultivated only with synthetic wastewater were spiked with either e coli bacteria or ms2 bacteriophages and thoroughly mixed by aeration for 5 min to reach an equilibrium between supernatant and granules the test was performed twice with different concentrations per indicator around 105 and 107 cfu 100 ml for e coli and around 103 and 109 pfu 100 ml for ms2 to determine how far the outcome of the test was affected by the concentration at the end of the 5 min mixing a sample was taken to determine the initial indicator concentration in the reactor after turning off the aeration a settling time of 5 min was allowed after settling the following samples of 5 ml were taken treated supernatant at three different heights of the reactor column from the effluent discharge point 20 40 and 60 cm and a final mixed effluent sample to separate the liquid fraction from the solids the mixed sample before settling and the effluent sample were treated by let them settle for 5 min in a measuring cylinder after that microbial spreading and enumeration were carried out as described in section 2 2 2 3 results 3 1 ags reactors performance the performance of two granular sludge reactors ags e coli and ags ms2 for the concentration of cod po4 p nh4 n no2 n and no3 n are given in figure 2 the reactors contained only granular sludge while flocculent sludge was absent due to feeding with soluble substrate only the measurements showed good performance in terms of cod removal see figure 2a and figure 2b concentrations were reduced at the end of the anaerobic phase from 402 50 mg cod l to averages of 40 22 and 65 17 mg cod l after 47 and 57 days of operation in the ags e coli and ags ms2 reactor respectively the effluent showed final average concentrations of 36 21 and 34 14 mg cod l correspondingly this effluent cod was mainly related to the non biodegradable edta present in the influent the systems also showed p release with average values of 59 16 mg po4 p l for ags e coli and 61 22 mg po4 p l for ags ms2 the phosphate removal was always good with concentrations lower than 1 mg po4 p l in the treated effluent for both reactors regarding nitrogen the average ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent was 58 13 mg nh4 n l which was partially converted to no2 n and no3 n during the aeration phase effluent values were on average 20 19 mg nh4 n l 2 2 mg no2 n l and 4 5 mg no3 n l for the ags e coli reactor figure 2c and figure 2e for the ags ms2 reactor average concentrations of 8 9 mg nh4 n l 2 2 mg no2 n l and 0 6 0 5 mg no3 n l were measured figure 2d and figure 2f it seems that copper from the feeding valve negatively affected the ammonia oxidising bacteria community in the ags e coli reactor the valve was in use from day 90 to day 148 the dissolved oxygen was increased from 1 8 to 3 8 mg l to stimulate the nitrification process however after replacing the valve this was not necessary anymore oxygen was set at 1 8 mg l after which the system stabilised again since the behaviour of the n conversion process was assumed not be influencing the removal of e coli and ms2 bacteriophage the nitrification was not optimised 3 2 fate of the faecal surrogates in the long term ags laboratory scale sbrs 3 2 1 faecal surrogates removal the measured median e coli concentration in the influent was 1 0 106 cfu 100ml ranging from 4 5 104 to 2 0 107 cfu 100 ml in the ags e coli reactor the ms2 bacteriophage influent concentrations for the ags ms2 reactor ranged between 4 0 105 and 7 5 108 pfu 100 ml with a median of 1 3 108 pfu 100 ml the effluent concentrations were between 1 0 102 and 7 1 105 cfu 100 ml for e coli median of 9 0 104 cfu 100 ml and the ms2 bacteriophage concentrations were between 3 0 105 and 1 9 108 pfu 100 ml median of 5 5 107 pfu 100 ml the overall median of the e coli and ms2 bacteriophage removal in the systems comparing influent and effluent was 2 2 and 0 3 log10 figure 3 a respectively e coli and the ms2 bacteriophages removal profiles were fitted to a chick watson model figure 3b using the average concentrations measured in the influent c 0 and the liquid bulk fractions c at the end of both the anaerobic phase and the aerobic phase and effluent after the anaerobic phase at time 62 min a reduction of 0 3 log10 was measured for ags e coli and ags ms2 reactors during aeration the e coli concentration decreased by 0 9 log10 whereas the ms2 bacteriophages decreased by 0 6 log10 after settling time a further reduction of 0 5 log10 was measured for e coli ms2 bacteriophage remained constant 3 2 2 surrogates concentrations in the sludge and liquid fractions per operational phase figure 4 shows the log10 concentrations of the target microorganisms e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophage measured after the fractionation of the supernatant and the granular sludge portion after the anaerobic aerobic phases table 1 shows the p values obtained from the comparison of the phases at the end of the anaerobic plug flow feeding the median of the e coli concentration for both supernatant and the sludge fraction was 3 8 105 cfu 100 ml or 5 5 log10 figure 4a at the end of the aerobic phase 110 minutes of aeration the e coli median in the supernatant was reduced to 3 6 104 cfu 100 ml or 4 6 log10 while the sludge fraction kept a more or less similar median concentration of 1 4 105 cfu 100 ml or 5 1 log10 both reductions were significantly different p 0 05 than in the previous anaerobic phase for the ms2 bacteriophage figure 4b a median concentration of 1 0 108 pfu 100 ml or 8 0 log10 was measured at the end of the anaerobic plug flow feeding in the supernatant the median of the counts in the sludge fraction was 5 4 107 pfu 100 ml or 7 7 log10 after the aeration phase a significant difference p 0 02 table 1 was observed in the supernatant portion with 1 log10 unit reduction in the median counts 1 1 107 pfu 100 ml or 7 0 log10 in the sludge fraction no significant differences p 0 05 table 1 were observed when comparing the median of the aerobic phase 3 7 107 pfu 100 ml or 7 6 log10 with the median of the previous anaerobic phase 3 3 relationship of the protozoa relative abundance and the pathogen removal higher organisms typically present in the crushed granular sludge inoculum of the reactor were not microscopically observed when both reactors ags e coli and ags ms2 achieved their stable operation before adding e coli and ms2 the stability was indicated by well shaped granules that were formed and the accomplished stable cod and po4 p removal after approximately two months as soon as the reactors were inoculated with e coli or ms2 bacteriophages a sudden bloom of stalked ciliated protozoa attached to the granular surface was observed in the ags e coli reactor but not in the ags ms2 system the attached ciliates occurrence in the granular samples was determined and compared with the removal of e coli and ms2 figure 5 in the ags e coli reactor high activity abundance and mobility of attached ciliates was observed on days 48 76 113 and after 120 however a decrease in the stalked ciliated activity occurred between days 86 and 105 which also coincided with both the reduction of the nh4 n concentration shown in figure 1c and a reduction of the e coli removal in the system figure 5a in contrast in the ags ms2 reactor no massive changes were observed for the stalked ciliated community when the system was spiked with the ms2 bacteriophage coinciding with lower removals during the studied period 3 3 1 microbial community analysis the eukaryotic microbial community was characterised by 18s rrna gene analysis figure 6 and figure 7 the analysis covered more than 99 sequencing depths see supplementary materials table s1 which is sufficient to cover the whole community the index used to estimate the number of the species abundance in a community belonging to individual classes chao1 chao 1984 showed that the number of species richness decreased compared to the seed sludge that is from 818 3 in the seed sludge to 589 5 and 493 3 in the ags e coli day 104 and day 160 respectively at the same time it remained almost the same 818 4 for the ags ms2 reactor day 90 instead the shannon diversity index used to determine the variation of living organisms kim et al 2017 showed a reduction in the diversity in all the samples with values of 5 39 2 03 3 01 and 2 96 respectively it confirms an expected reduction of the richness and evenness of the species from the seed sludge the most abundant top 10 species in all the studied samples are described at the phylum levels figure 6 of the eukaryotic phylogenetic classifications mostly free living organisms such as nematodes tardigrades and rotifers were likely removed via the effluent along with other particulate and suspended solids ascomycota and unidentified eukaryote were the most abundant groups found in the laboratory scale systems figure 7 summarises the most abundant protozoa phyla at their class and genus level the most abundant genera in the seed sludge were rhogostoma 18 9 followed by telotrochidium 12 4 opisthonecta 4 8 and epistylis 2 6 which belongs to the oligohymenophorea class other peritrich ciliates genus such as pseudovorticella vorticella and vorticellides were in abundance between 0 1 and 0 7 most of the target genera were reduced over time in the laboratory scale samples i e telotrochidium to 2 7 and epistylis to 0 2 in the sample taken on day 104 which was during the likely copper contamination in the ags e coli reactor notably on day 160 when the ags e coli system was again stable telotrochidium highly recovered to 23 2 and epistylis to 1 8 regarding the genus rhogostoma irrespective of the circumstances the genus was prevalent and highly abundant in the ags e coli reactor it appeared to be slightly affected on day 104 46 2 for the undesired copper addition madoni et al 1992 but fully recovered on day 160 56 5 regarding the ags ms2 reactor sample on day 90 apart from the genus rhogostoma with a relative abundance of 29 telotrochidium 1 7 and epistylis to 0 2 were as conventional as the ags e coli on day 104 for the rest of the community their relative abundance was between 0 01 and 0 25 but more diverse than the ags e coli reactor 3 4 predation recorded using fluorescent staining figure 8 shows pictures obtained when recording the ingestion of the e coli by attached ciliated protozoa using dsgreen labelled e coli bacteria the pictures confirmed e coli predation by stalked ciliates the stained bacteria were visible inside the vacuoles of the organisms and the e coli bacteria were also visible embedded in the granular sludge matrix upon ingestion the bacteria were concentrated but the technique was not suitable for quantification of the partitioning of e coli bacteria between supernatant fraction attached to the granular surface or inside of the granular biomass 3 5 attachment kinetics attachment tests were carried out with the surrogates e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages the attachment kinetics are represented in figure 9 two concentrations were tested versus the exposure time regardless of the concentration and the target organism a speedy attachment occurred onto the granules in the first 15 min figure 9a and figure 9b moreover as can be observed in figure 9c and figure 9d sharper curves can be observed for the lower concentrations of both organisms meaning that a relative faster attachment occurred when compared with the more concentrated samples 3 6 contribution of settling in the ags reactors to the removal of the faecal surrogates additional tests were carried out to better understand the surrogates removal in the liquid phase shown in the curve of figure 3b specifically from the point measured in the supernatant at the end of the aeration to the mixed effluent for e coli bacteria it seems settling responsible for a 0 5 log10 removal while for the ms2 bacteriophage an increase of 0 1 log10 is measured results from the settling test figure 10 shows that regardless of the initial concentrations 2 0 105 and 5 3 107 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 2 4 103 and 4 7 109 pfu 100 ml for ms2 no differences were measured in the liquid bulk right after settling nor in the liquid fraction of the treated effluent therefore settling forces were discarded as factors to explain the variations in the long term reactors 4 discussion 4 1 reactor performance the ags reactors were both under operational conditions that triggered quick granular formation and an efficient reactor performance de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 adav et al 2008 overall both studied systems showed comparable performances to previous reports using similar substrates winkler et al 2011 the addition to the e coli and ms2 after day 47 for the ags e coli reactor and day 69 for the ags ms2 reactor did not affect the general reactor performance the measured water quality parameters shown in figure 1 confirmed healthy systems with low effluent cod values and high p release after the anaerobic feeding of the ags e coli and ags ms2 reactor respectively except for the low nh4 n removal in the ags e coli reactor from day 95 to 120 good conversion of nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n during aeration was observed in both systems the low nh4 n removal in the ags e coli reactor was most likely caused by the unexpected presence of copper in the system copper can be toxic for ammonia oxidising bacteria sato et al 1988 and other organisms such protozoa which can also interfere in the nitrification process lee and welander 1994 after copper was excluded from the influent the system recovered and showed a good performance until the end of the study 4 2 fate of the target surrogates during the operational conditions of the long term reactors the overall e coli removal efficiency 2 2 log10 calculated for the ags e coli reactor was within the range previously reported for e coli in full scale ags systems however the ms2 bacteriophage removal 0 7 log10 was lower than reported barrios hernández et al 2020b it is worth mentioning that full scale ags systems contain both a large granular sludge fraction and a smaller flocculent sludge fraction pronk et al 2015b ali et al 2019 have shown variances in the bacterial assembly depending on the different size of the aggregates including flocs large and small granular fractions reactors here studied contained only granular sludge potentially impacting the removal of the faecal surrogates therefore the fate of the two different faecal surrogates e coli and ms2 bacteriophages focused on evaluating only the contribution of the granular fraction during different operational stages of two ags systems to better understand their influence on the pathogen surrogates removals 4 2 1 faecal surrogates removals during the anaerobic plug flow feeding in this study an average reduction of 0 3 log10 was observed in the liquid fraction for the faecal surrogates during the anaerobic stage in both ags e coli and ags ms2 reactors in the ags systems the influent is fed in a plug flow mode causing a concentration gradient from high to low in the water phase over the granular bed a high concentration of the faecal surrogates present in the influent at the feeding point bottom of the reactor was expected which is diluted with the clean water at the top part of the reactor after feeding chong et al 2012 and vymazal 2005 have shown that coliforms survive longer in anaerobic environments thus due to the fully anaerobic conditions and the short time the feeding takes the faecal surrogates decay was negligible furthermore the batch attachment tests showed that irrespective of the organisms the e coli bacteria and the ms2 bacteriophage quickly attach and saturate the granular surface when passing through the granular media figure 9 they kept an equilibrium concentration between the granules and the supernatant fraction as can also be observed in figure 4 in case sludge waste occurs at this stage as is practice in full scale ags treatment plants a high concentration of surrogates approximately 105 cfu 100 ml and 107 pfu 100 ml would leave the system via the mixed liquor a combination of the sludge and supernatant fraction here studied corpuz et al 2020 martín díaz et al 2020 sludge treatment and dewatering will result in additional removal of pathogens zeng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore based on previous findings the minor reduction reported during the anaerobic period can be attained to a constant dilution effect of the influent with the remaining reactor media during steady state conditions 4 2 2 faecal surrogate removal during the aeration phase during the aeration phase the self immobilised granular bed is continuously mixed and granules are exposed to all the components remaining in the liquid bulk besides providing the right oxygen concentration in the systems lochmatter et al 2013 aeration provides high shear stress helping to form round shaped granules van loosdrecht et al 1995 this aerated phase is meaningful for some organisms that are oxygen depended such as protozoa fenchel 2014 protozoa play a major role in wastewater treatment technologies mckinney and gram 1956 madoni 2011 amaral et al 2018 they are unicellular heterotrophs and eukaryotic organisms fed either by the absorption of dissolved nutrients or the ingestion of particulate matter including bacteria or organism present during the assimilation nisbet 1984 pauli et al 2001 stated that protozoa could bind to bacterial conglomerates such as flocs in our laboratory scale ags reactors the sludge beds were almost completely formed of granules smaller granules were quickly discharged during the effluent withdrawal inducing free living metazoans such as nematodes tardigrades and rotifers to wash out figure 6 at the beginning of this study a reduction of the protozoa was measured using a microscope however once e coli was added to the ags e coli system a bloom of stalked ciliated protozoa attached to the granular surface occurred this tendency has been previously reported in laboratory scale systems fed on particulate material de kreuk et al 2010 barrios hernández et al 2020a and generally in full scale wastewater treatment systems stevik et al 2004 as can be seen in figure 5a a higher e coli removal was detected when a higher abundance of attached ciliated protozoa was microscopically observed ciliates are a dominant class in wastewater treatment systems curds 1973 varma et al 1975 dubber and gray 2011 they move through cilia and are subdivided into three categories free swimming crawling and attached organisms examples of this are the free swimming genera telotrochidium and opisthonecta and the attached ciliates epistylis pseudovorticella vorticella and vorticellides which were part of the ciliophora phylum level found in this study gao et al 2016 leal et al 2016 adl et al 2019 the free living genus rhogostoma from the cercozoa phylum showed to be the most abundant in the ags e coli reactor after both 104 46 and 160 57 operational days it grows quickly under controlled laboratory conditions belar 1921 öztoprak et al 2020 describe this genus as a bacteria predator with a high diversity of clades able to colonise a variety of habitats including wastewater matrices some species such as the r micra are related to debris and bacteria howe et al 2011 others r epiphylla have been recognized as food selective with an affinity to predate yeast from the ascomycota and basidiomicota phyla dumack et al 2017 organisms that were also present during steady conditions of the ags e coli reactor figure 6 concerning the protozoa filter feeding process called phagocytosis berman 2012 the feeding starts by generating a water current concentrating the particulate matter present in the liquid bulk while retaining the particles in size between 0 3 and 5 µm mallory et al 1983 lynn 2008 it includes our e coli 1 2 µm the process continues with the intake of the retained particulate matter in vacuoles this intake was recorded in the individual batch tests when using fluorescently labelled e coli figure 8 phagocytosis was anticipated to occur only during aeration bacterivorous commonly found in anoxic environments such as metopus and caenomorpha from the armophorea class were not present in the samples hirakata et al 2016 interestedly the anaerobic ciliates trimyema plagiopylea occurred but in a very low taxonomic abundance 0 002 when the ags e coli system was stable at day 160 schulz et al 1990 fenchel 2014 stated that some other protozoa could also adapt and sustain their growth under oxygen limitations it applies to euplotes and rimostrombidium from the spirotrichea class however such genera were negligible in the studied systems matsunaga et al 2014 reported a greater diversity of uncultured eukaryotes including phylogenetic affiliations found in this study overall our results were consistent with eukaryotic molecular diversity studies using 18s rrna gene analysis in different sewage systems for the ms2 bacteriophages no significant changes were recorded when the bacteriophage was added to the reactor bacteriophages in general are very selective on their host saha and mukherjee 2019 the host specificity of ms2 bacteriophage used in this study depended mostly on e coli f pili berzin et al 1974 salas and de vega 2008 therefore infections of bacteria forming the granules aob nob and paos were not expected and not measured based on the physicochemical reactor performance zhang et al 2013 therefore due to lack of favourable conditions for reproducing the ms2 bacteriophage including a low host range of bacteria marks and sharp 2000 khan et al 2002 and slow infection cycles hantula et al 1991 cell lysis was assumed negligible indeed the ms2 bacteriophages addition did not induce the same stalked ciliated protozoa bloom rate as in the ags e coli reactor as a particle ms2 bacteriophage 27 nm is much smaller than the e coli bacteria 1 by 2 µm kuzmanovic et al 2003 besides the low rate bacteria erosion expected from the granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 and the lack of particulate material or any other bacteria in the synthetic influent resulted in the reduced protozoa growth indirectly affecting the ms2 bacteriophages removal overall bacterivorous genera such as the free swimming telotrochidium 1 7 and stalked epistylis 0 2 occurred however their relative abundance was lower compared with the values found for the ags e coli reactor which were 23 and 2 respectively the genus rhogostoma 29 which was also the most abundant organism found in the ags ms2 reactor potentially grew by predating such free bacteria and fungi derived from the sludge granules little contributing to the viral surrogates removal deng et al 2014 reported that the free living salpingoeca craspedida can use the phage as a potential carbon source by actively feeding on ms2 it coincides with the relative taxonomic occurrence of this flagellate in the ags ms2 reactor 0 01 which was slightly lower than in the seed sludge 0 02 but not abundant in the reactor fed only with e coli hence based on prey selection criteria the protozoa feeding rate determined the grazing pressure on the added bacteriophages jürgens 2007 regarding attachment it was assumed that the granule surface reached an attachment equilibrium with the liquid bulk right after the anaerobic feeding this assumption can be confirmed when looking at the long term experiments in figure 4a and figure 4b the e coli median concentrations of the granular fractions at the end of the aerobic phase kept the same order of magnitude than the previous phase about 105 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 107 pfu 100 ml for ms2 therefore recognising the role of the protozoa in our laboratory scale systems the main removal mechanism during aeration can be documented as a one phase process on average 1 log10 e coli and 0 6 log10 ms2 bacteriophages were measured during aeration by filter feeding protozoa van der drift et al 1977 mallory et al 1983 which for the system fed only with ms2 were less abundant than in the ags e coli reactor 4 3 contribution of the settling in the removal of the faecal surrogates the settling batch tests executed in the additional column reactor showed that settling forces do not contribute to removing any of the studied faecal surrogates in the liquid phase figure 10 in the laboratory scale reactors the treated effluent is rapidly separated from the biomass due to its high density beun et al 2002 the surrogates initially attached to the granular surface settle along with the granules figure 4 therefore the effluent is a mixture of supernatant with high concentrations of suspended organisms and very small granules that did not settle during the short settling time 5 min such effluent composition explains the dynamic of the organism s depletion curve during settling time shown in figure 3b which for the e coli seemed that settling is adding to the overall removal but for ms2 bacteriophage similar concentrations between effluent and the liquid fraction after aeration were observed therefore the variations found in the organism s depletion curve were based on the composition of the effluent samples but not caused by any selection pressure 4 4 the relevance of the findings for future applications in this study in the laboratory granular sludge system fed only with synthetic wastewater the removal of bacteria was higher than the removal of bacteriophages the granules were saturated with high amounts of the surrogates e coli and ms2 achieving a saturation point during steady state as previously mentioned in section 4 2 1 such surrogates and actual pathogenic organisms will potentially abandon the system via waste sludge guzman et al 2007 goberna et al 2018 in ags full scale systems sludge waste normally occurs by a selection pressure that will discharge a high amount of flocculent sludge not commonly found in laboratory scale reactors van dijk et al 2020 some physical properties such as cell mobility pratt and kolter 1998 opposite charge attraction tay et al 2000 hydrophobicity tay et al 2001 liu et al 2003 and type of substrate added pronk et al 2015a might influence their attachment e coli and ms2 bacteriophages are considered good indicators of actual bacterial and viral pathogens in wastewater dias et al 2018 their removal in full scale ags systems has been reported and compared with parallel cas systems barrios hernández et al 2020b along with the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes pallares vega et al 2020 so far further research of the behaviour of actual bacterial viral and eukaryotic pathogenic organism in the ags system is missing full scale ags systems are fed with complex substrates they develop a significant flocculent sludge fraction derived from the influent suspended solids according to ali et al 2019 bacteria entering the system via the influent may end up in that flocculent fraction of the ags systems therefore the influence of the flocculent fraction on the bacterial and viral pathogen removal dynamics can be further considered influent raw wastewater can also have an impact on the diversity of the eukaryotic structures hirakata et al 2019 in our study protozoa predation was the dominant mechanism to the actual removal of the surrogates as protozoa are ideal grazers their abundance and diversity could help to achieve pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria removal a characterization of the protozoa community in a full scale ags system may help to better understand the pathogen removal dynamics of the ags systems 5 conclusions this study investigated the effects of physical and biological mechanisms on removing two important water quality surrogates e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages in ags systems regardless of the organism the bacterial and viral surrogates quickly attached to the granular surface saturating the granules during steady state conditions therefore physical removal plays a role when sludge waste occurs during aeration the e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages were reduced to approximately 1 and 0 6 log10 respectively protozoa predation was the main contributor to the removal of e coli during aeration the 18s rrna sequence analysis confirmed the occurrence of the genera pseudovorticella vorticella and vorticellides which are attached ciliates from the phylum ciliophoran a higher abundance of free living genus rhogostoma and the free swimming ciliates telotrochidium were also found in the system fed with ms2 bacteriophages a similar eukaryotic community was observed although at much lower amounts bacteriophages removal was low in the system spiked only with ms2 in full scale ags systems protozoa growth on the granular sludge fraction can significantly contribute to the removal of bacteria from the influent the flocculent sludge fraction is responsible for further reducing bacterial numbers and bacteriophages and needs more attention in future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17105,the aerobic granular sludge ags process is an effective wastewater treatment technology for organic matter and nutrient removal that has been introduced in the market rapidly until now limited information is available on ags regarding the removal of bacterial and viral pathogenic organisms present in sewage this study focussed on determining the relation between reactor operational conditions plug flow feeding turbulent aeration and settling and physical and biological mechanisms on removing two faecal surrogates escherichia coli and ms2 bacteriophages two ags laboratory scale systems were separately fed with influent spiked with 1 0 106 cfu 100 ml of e coli and 1 3 108 pfu 100 ml of ms2 bacteriophages and followed during the different operational phases the reactors contained only granular sludge and no flocculent sludge both systems showed reductions in the liquid phase of 0 3 log10 during anaerobic feeding caused by a dilution factor and attachment of the organisms on the granules higher removal efficiencies were achieved during aeration approximately 1 log10 for e coli and 0 6 log10 for the ms2 bacteriophages caused mainly by predation the 18s sequencing analysis revealed high operational taxonomic units otus of free living protozoa genera rhogostoma and telotrochidium concerning the whole eukaryotic community attached ciliates propagated after the addition of the e coli an active contribution of the genera epistylis vorticella and pseudovorticella was found when the reactor reached stability in contrast no significant growth of predators occurred when spiking the system with ms2 bacteriophages indicating a low contribution of protozoa on the phage removal settling did not contribute to the removal of the studied bacterial and viral surrogates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords escherichia coli ms2 bacteriophages nereda pathogens sanitation protozoa predation 1 introduction the aerobic granular sludge ags process has been shown to be an effective technology for wastewater treatment bengtsson et al 2018 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 the current full scale ags technology nereda operates as an up flow anaerobically fed sequencing batch reactor sbr with simultaneous feeding and effluent withdrawal and in between an extended aeration period pronk et al 2015b de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 the biomass in the ags system consists of agglomerated bacteria that simultaneously remove organic matter and nutrients de kreuk et al 2007 this agglomeration is possible due to microbial extracellular polymeric substances that bind individual cells into granules liu and tay 2002 lin et al 2010 shi and liu 2021 the bacterial community in the granule consists of phosphate accumulating organisms paos ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob winkler et al 2013 szabó et al 2017 these bacterial groups are responsible for organic matter and nutrient removal other organisms present such as filamentous bacteria protozoa and metazoans are related to the granule formation and system performance schwarzenbeck et al 2004 weber et al 2007 full scale ags systems contain a large granular sludge and smaller flocculent sludge fraction ali et al 2019 in general ags wastewater treatment systems report high removal efficiencies of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pronk et al 2015b pronk et al 2017 bengtsson et al 2018 besides a good treatment performance concerning the water quality parameters two recent studies showed the capability of the ags technology in removing bacterial and viral indicator organisms from sewage barrios hernández et al 2020b and thwaites et al 2018 compared removal efficiencies in ags and conventional aerobic sludge cas full and pilot scale wastewater treatment plants the ags full scale systems can just as effectively remove indicator organisms as the cas process for example the log10 removal for both systems ranged between 1 7 and 2 6 for bacteria as e coli and between 1 4 and 2 4 for f specific rna bacteriophages both studies mentioned above emphasised that the presence of the variety of protozoa commonly present in wastewater treatments could be influencing the removal of the indicator organisms for a good understanding of pathogen removal by ags systems more mechanistic studies are needed a large number of studies can be found for other wastewater treatment systems looking at biological cell lysis and predation and physical adsorption and precipitation removal mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria a study by van der drift et al 1977 postulated that the faecal surrogate e coli was either biologically predated by protozoa or ended up enmeshed into the sludge flocs hereafter other researchers confirmed the importance of protozoa as grazers in cas systems curds 1982 mallory et al 1983 madoni 1994 and their role as primary predator during aeration curds 1973 more recently the removal of viruses in cas systems has been studied using bacteriophages as a surrogate for viruses showing that their elimination from sewage can be challenging due to their persistence and abundance lucena et al 2004 amarasiri et al 2017 bacteriophages tend to either attach or detach from surfaces depending on the surrounding water conditions bales et al 1993 they can also be predated by heterotrophic flagellates gonzález and suttle 1993 deng et al 2014 according to stevik et al 2004 and dias et al 2017 their retention and depletion in wastewater may be affected by system configuration hydraulic retention time water quality temperature ph and organic matter and water flow velocity among other factors it is still unclear which removal mechanism plays a major role in ags systems especially in the granular fraction and how far these mechanisms are linked to the different operational phases the main goal of this study was to relate the operational conditions of an ags laboratory scale reactor with the removal of a faecal bacterial surrogate e coli and a viral surrogate ms2 bacteriophage moreover the attachment of the faecal organisms onto the granules protozoa predation and the contribution of the settling in the bacterial and viral surrogate removal process was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 research design two laboratory scale reactors were operated long term as sequencing batch reactors sbr both systems developed a steady state situation with mature granules when fed with only synthetic wastewater when the steady state was reached the influent was spiked with known concentrations of two typical surrogates for bacterial and viral water quality e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages reactors were monitored weekly for physicochemical and microbiological water quality parameters before and after each cycle operational phase anaerobic plug feeding aeration phase and settling changes in the protozoa community were observed using microscopy observation and changes in the eukaryotic community were studied using 18s rrna sequence analysis next to the long term investigation additional batch experiments were executed to better understand predation using a fluorescent staining technique and attachment of the surrogates on the granular surface the contribution of the settling phase to the removal of the studied surrogates was also evaluated 2 2 laboratory scale sbr two laboratory scale sbrs hereafter called ags e coli and ags ms2 were operated for 154 and 125 days respectively the operational cycles follow the sequence of an anaerobic phase aeration reaction phase and settling and effluent withdrawal figure 1 during the anaerobic phase the systems were fed in a plug flow mode for 60 min hereafter an air recirculation pump operated at 6 l min kept the system completely mixed and aerated 1 8 mg l for 110 min a 5 min settling time was followed by effluent discharge creating a sludge selection mechanism resulting in dense granules in the reactors the reactors consisted of a double wall glass bubble column of 2 9 l cbn the netherlands they were operated and controlled with a braun dcu4 controller coupled with both mass flow and a multi fermenter control system mfcs using acquisition software santorious stedim biotech s s germany the system was operated and controlled with an applikon adi controller model 1030 connected to a computer with the software bioxpert 2 applikon the netherlands both systems were operated at 20 1 c the ph of 7 0 0 1 was automatically controlled by adding either 1m hcl or 1m naoh both systems were inoculated with crushed sludge from an ags full scale wwtp garmerwolde the netherlands with an initial total suspended solids tss concentration of 8 3 2 5 g l 2 2 1 synthetic wastewater the systems were fed with the synthetic wastewater composed of acetate 2 9 kg m3 day ammonium nitrogen 0 48 kg nh4 n m3 day phosphorus source 0 08 kg po3 p m3 day and trace metals prepared according to the vishniac and santer 1957 solution the bacterial and viral surrogates were added once the granular stability in the reactors was established i e after day 47 in the ags e coli reactor and after day 69 of operation in the ags ms2 reactor the concentration in the influent for the ags e coli reactor was between 1 104 and 1 107 cfu 100 ml for the ags ms2 reactor concentrations were between 1 105 and 1 108 pfu 100 ml 2 2 2 bacterial and viral surrogates due to their importance for water quality regulations two faecal surrogates were selected and enumerated as explained in scoullos et al 2019 2 2 2 1 e coli strain culture and enumeration the e coli atcc reference strain 25922 was taken as bacteria surrogate for faecal contamination e coli was initially inoculated in a sterilised nutrient broth medium merck kgaa germany and incubated on a shaking platform 150 rpm at 37 1 c for 24 hours a stock concentration of about 1 109 cfu 100 ml was obtained and enumerated by spreading the medium on chromocult sigma aldrich germany coliform agar plates later the suspension was spiked to the influent of the ags e coli reactor by diluting the stock culture into a vessel of 10 l to an end concentration in the reactor of 1 107 cfu 100 ml for enumeration viable counts were conducted in triplicate according to iso 9308 1 anon 2000a aliquots of 0 1 ml of either pure or diluted sample were spread on the coliform agar plates and inoculated overnight at 37 1 c undiluted samples with expected concentrations lower than 30 cfu 100 ml were analysed in duplicate using membrane filtration that is 100 ml of the undiluted sample was passed through a cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 μm the filter was placed on chromocult coliform agar plates and incubated at 37 1 c for 24 hours 2 2 2 2 bacteriophage strain culture and enumeration the e coli bacteriophage ms2 reference strain atcc 15597 b1 was used as the viral surrogate the phage was propagated in tryptone yeast glucose broth tygb using another e coli strain atcc 15597 as host bacteria while shaking at 150 rpm the incubation temperature was 37 1 c for 24 hours to reach a stock concentration of 1 1012 pfu 100 ml working solutions were prepared in saline water buffer before being applied to the ags ms2 reactor by diluting the stock culture into a vessel of 10 l to a concentration 1 108 pfu 100 ml the ms2 bacteriophage enumeration was determined based on iso 10705 1 anon 2000b as plaque forming units pfu the host bacteria 1 ml was cultured in 50 ml of tygb to a concentration of approximately 108 pfu 100 ml samples diluted 10 fold

physicochemical water quality parameters for the performance of the reactor 10 ml samples were taken from the liquid bulk before the aeration phase 62 min and from the effluent the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter millex hv germany and subjected to the following analysis chemical oxygen demand cod orthophosphate po4 p and nitrogen related parameters such as nh4 n nitrite no2 n

the optimal biomass growth the tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to the standard methods apha 2012 for sludge samples and treated effluent samples 2 3 2 microbiological

anaerobic phase 25 ml mixed liquor at the end of the aerobic phase 25 ml and effluent 10 ml from the mixed liquor samples the sludge was separated from the liquid hereafter referred to supernatant by letting the sludge settle for 5 min the supernatant 10 ml was extracted with a syringe and placed in a separated vessel approximately 1 ml of the settled sludge fraction was crushed and homogenised using a glass teflon potter elvehjem tube all samples were enumerated in duplicate as explained in section 2 2 2 results from the supernatant and sludge fractions after anaerobic and aerobic phases were subjected to a statistical analysis wilcoxon signed rank test after normalization to determine whether paired mean concentrations were significantly p 0 05 different from each other or not the number of samples n for the analysis was between 8 and 13 2 4 optical microscope observation of protozoa additional samples of granules 5 ml were taken during aeration to be inspected for protozoa presence samples of 25 µl were observed under optical microscopes olympus ch30 10x 20x and 40x and olympus bx51 10x 20x and 40x the stalked ciliated protozoa activity occurrence and mobility was studied based on a qualitative and quantitative scale observation of the individuals as described in amaral et al 2018 for the 40x magnification an area of approximately 37 mm2 was measured the highest value of 100 was assigned to the ones that showed high activity and more than six individuals mm2 in all the observations a value of 5 was assigned to samples that at least showed one individual mm2 in any of the measured samples samples were checked in triplicates 2 4 1 dna extraction and 18s rrna gene sequencing genomic dna was extracted from approximately 0 25 g of crushed

annotation the raw sequence data were uploaded to the national center for biotechnology ncbi under accession numbers samn16526359 samn16526360 samn16526361 and samn16526362 2 5 e coli fluorescence microscopy observations to identify and record protozoa predation a fluorescence staining detection method for e coli was used granules from an additional ags laboratory scale reactor as well as granules from a full scale wwtp were checked on the abundance of ciliates attached to the granular surface the e coli atcc 25922 was labelled using a dsgreen gel staining solution 10 000x lumiprobe hannover germany it was analysed with the fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc filter set in the microscope e coli was 10 fold diluted as follows 2 µl of the 10 000x dilution of dsgreen was added to a 1 998 µl of e coli atcc 25922 to obtain the final working solution of 1 104 cfu µl mini batch reactors were prepared in 2 ml eppendorf tubes in which 1 ml of granules were spiked with 1 ml of the solution with the previously labelled e coli the solution was quickly mixed three times in a pulsing vortex mixer vwr germany then incubated in the dark for 15 minutes the treated granules were washed three times in 400 µl of 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs and centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 5 min eppendorf minispin germany then resuspended in 1x pbs to get a final volume of 2 ml aliquots of 3 µl were placed on glass slides and analysed under an olympus bx51 fluorescent microscope coupled with an xm10 camera an x cite fluorescence lamp lumen dynamics series 120q and a fitc filter approximately between 8 and 12 sets of pictures of different visual parts of the granules were taken for each picture set both phase contrast and fluorescence images were taken at magnifications from 10 to 100x overlay pictures were analysed using fiji image analysis software https fiji sc 2 6 attachment of e coli and ms2 bacteriophages to determine whether e coli and ms2 bacteriophages attached to the granules batch tests were performed at the same temperature as the long term study 20 c round shaped granules from 0 2 to 3 8 mm from an additional control ags laboratory scale reactor were tested the ags reactor was fed only with synthetic wastewater therefore there were no e coli bacteria ms2 bacteriophages nor potential predators microscopically detectable such as free swimming and attached ciliated protozoa the experimental tests were carried out based on hendricks et al 1979 with the following modifications three beakers were prepared with 50 g of the fresh granules and filled up to 200 ml with a synthetic wastewater solution the beakers were mixed continuously with a magnet stirrer 250 rpm then spiked with a known concentration of the target microorganisms 105 and 107 cfu 100 ml of e coli bacteria and 106 and 109 pfu 100 ml of ms2 bacteriophage the initial concentration in the attachment test c 0 was measured by taking 1 ml from the suspension liquid bulk the experiments aimed to analyse the behaviour of the surrogates during the 60 minutes of anaerobic feeding therefore 1 ml was consecutively taken from the suspension after letting the sludge settle at times c t 5 15 30 45 and 60 min since target organisms keep suspended in the liquid phase the difference between c 0 and c t was assumed to be caused by attachment to the granular media experiments were performed in duplicates as well as the spreading and enumeration of the microorganism kinetics were calculated using the pseudo second order equation eq 1 explained by simonin 2016 in which t corresponds to the exposure time in minutes between the target organism and the granules q is the e coli bacteria cfu g or the ms2 bacteriophages pfu g concentration attached per gram of granule q e is the maximum attachment capacity of the organisms cfu g or pfu g and k is the fitted constant 1 t q 1 q e t 1 k q e 2 2 7 contribution of the settling in the ags reactor the effects of the settling on the removal of the target microorganisms were independently evaluated in an additional ags reactor operated like the long term studied reactors but without being fed with any surrogate the granules cultivated only with synthetic wastewater were spiked with either e coli bacteria or ms2 bacteriophages and thoroughly mixed by aeration for 5 min to reach an equilibrium between supernatant and granules the test was performed twice with different concentrations per indicator around 105 and 107 cfu 100 ml for e coli and around 103 and 109 pfu 100 ml for ms2 to determine how far the outcome of the test was affected by the concentration at the end of the 5 min mixing a sample was taken to determine the initial indicator concentration in the reactor after turning off the aeration a settling time of 5 min was allowed after settling the following samples of 5 ml were taken treated supernatant at three different heights of the reactor column from the effluent discharge point 20 40 and 60 cm and a final mixed effluent sample to separate the liquid fraction from the solids the mixed sample before settling and the effluent sample were treated by let them settle for 5 min in a measuring cylinder after that microbial spreading and enumeration were carried out as described in section 2 2 2 3 results 3 1 ags reactors performance the performance of two granular sludge reactors ags e coli and ags ms2 for the concentration of cod po4 p nh4 n no2 n and no3 n are given in figure 2 the reactors contained only granular sludge while flocculent sludge was absent due to feeding with soluble substrate only the measurements showed good performance in terms of cod removal see figure 2a and figure 2b concentrations were reduced at the end of the anaerobic phase from 402 50 mg cod l to averages of 40 22 and 65 17 mg cod l after 47 and 57 days of operation in the ags e coli and ags ms2 reactor respectively the effluent showed final average concentrations of 36 21 and 34 14 mg cod l correspondingly this effluent cod was mainly related to the non biodegradable edta present in the influent the systems also showed p release with average values of 59 16 mg po4 p l for ags e coli and 61 22 mg po4 p l for ags ms2 the phosphate removal was always good with concentrations lower than 1 mg po4 p l in the treated effluent for both reactors regarding nitrogen the average ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent was 58 13 mg nh4 n l which was partially converted to no2 n and no3 n during the aeration phase effluent values were on average 20 19 mg nh4 n l 2 2 mg no2 n l and 4 5 mg no3 n l for the ags e coli reactor figure 2c and figure 2e for the ags ms2 reactor average concentrations of 8 9 mg nh4 n l 2 2 mg no2 n l and 0 6 0 5 mg no3 n l were measured figure 2d and figure 2f it seems that copper from the feeding valve negatively affected the ammonia oxidising bacteria community in the ags e coli reactor the valve was in use from day 90 to day 148 the dissolved oxygen was increased from 1 8 to 3 8 mg l to stimulate the nitrification process however after replacing the valve this was not necessary anymore oxygen was set at 1 8 mg l after which the system stabilised again since the behaviour of the n conversion process was assumed not be influencing the removal of e coli and ms2 bacteriophage the nitrification was not optimised 3 2 fate of the faecal surrogates in the long term ags laboratory scale sbrs 3 2 1 faecal surrogates removal the measured median e coli concentration in the influent was 1 0 106 cfu 100ml ranging from 4 5 104 to 2 0 107 cfu 100 ml in the ags e coli reactor the ms2 bacteriophage influent concentrations for the ags ms2 reactor ranged between 4 0 105 and 7 5 108 pfu 100 ml with a median of 1 3 108 pfu 100 ml the effluent concentrations were between 1 0 102 and 7 1 105 cfu 100 ml for e coli median of 9 0 104 cfu 100 ml and the ms2 bacteriophage concentrations were between 3 0 105 and 1 9 108 pfu 100 ml median of 5 5 107 pfu 100 ml the overall median of the e coli and ms2 bacteriophage removal in the systems comparing influent and effluent was 2 2 and 0 3 log10 figure 3 a respectively e coli and the ms2 bacteriophages removal profiles were fitted to a chick watson model figure 3b using the average concentrations measured in the influent c 0 and the liquid bulk fractions c at the end of both the anaerobic phase and the aerobic phase and effluent after the anaerobic phase at time 62 min a reduction of 0 3 log10 was measured for ags e coli and ags ms2 reactors during aeration the e coli concentration decreased by 0 9 log10 whereas the ms2 bacteriophages decreased by 0 6 log10 after settling time a further reduction of 0 5 log10 was measured for e coli ms2 bacteriophage remained constant 3 2 2 surrogates concentrations in the sludge and liquid fractions per operational phase figure 4 shows the log10 concentrations of the target microorganisms e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophage measured after the fractionation of the supernatant and the granular sludge portion after the anaerobic aerobic phases table 1 shows the p values obtained from the comparison of the phases at the end of the anaerobic plug flow feeding the median of the e coli concentration for both supernatant and the sludge fraction was 3 8 105 cfu 100 ml or 5 5 log10 figure 4a at the end of the aerobic phase 110 minutes of aeration the e coli median in the supernatant was reduced to 3 6 104 cfu 100 ml or 4 6 log10 while the sludge fraction kept a more or less similar median concentration of 1 4 105 cfu 100 ml or 5 1 log10 both reductions were significantly different p 0 05 than in the previous anaerobic phase for the ms2 bacteriophage figure 4b a median concentration of 1 0 108 pfu 100 ml or 8 0 log10 was measured at the end of the anaerobic plug flow feeding in the supernatant the median of the counts in the sludge fraction was 5 4 107 pfu 100 ml or 7 7 log10 after the aeration phase a significant difference p 0 02 table 1 was observed in the supernatant portion with 1 log10 unit reduction in the median counts 1 1 107 pfu 100 ml or 7 0 log10 in the sludge fraction no significant differences p 0 05 table 1 were observed when comparing the median of the aerobic phase 3 7 107 pfu 100 ml or 7 6 log10 with the median of the previous anaerobic phase 3 3 relationship of the protozoa relative abundance and the pathogen removal higher organisms typically present in the crushed granular sludge inoculum of the reactor were not microscopically observed when both reactors ags e coli and ags ms2 achieved their stable operation before adding e coli and ms2 the stability was indicated by well shaped granules that were formed and the accomplished stable cod and po4 p removal after approximately two months as soon as the reactors were inoculated with e coli or ms2 bacteriophages a sudden bloom of stalked ciliated protozoa attached to the granular surface was observed in the ags e coli reactor but not in the ags ms2 system the attached ciliates occurrence in the granular samples was determined and compared with the removal of e coli and ms2 figure 5 in the ags e coli reactor high activity abundance and mobility of attached ciliates was observed on days 48 76 113 and after 120 however a decrease in the stalked ciliated activity occurred between days 86 and 105 which also coincided with both the reduction of the nh4 n concentration shown in figure 1c and a reduction of the e coli removal in the system figure 5a in contrast in the ags ms2 reactor no massive changes were observed for the stalked ciliated community when the system was spiked with the ms2 bacteriophage coinciding with lower removals during the studied period 3 3 1 microbial community analysis the eukaryotic microbial community was characterised by 18s rrna gene analysis figure 6 and figure 7 the analysis covered more than 99 sequencing depths see supplementary materials table s1 which is sufficient to cover the whole community the index used to estimate the number of the species abundance in a community belonging to individual classes chao1 chao 1984 showed that the number of species richness decreased compared to the seed sludge that is from 818 3 in the seed sludge to 589 5 and 493 3 in the ags e coli day 104 and day 160 respectively at the same time it remained almost the same 818 4 for the ags ms2 reactor day 90 instead the shannon diversity index used to determine the variation of living organisms kim et al 2017 showed a reduction in the diversity in all the samples with values of 5 39 2 03 3 01 and 2 96 respectively it confirms an expected reduction of the richness and evenness of the species from the seed sludge the most abundant top 10 species in all the studied samples are described at the phylum levels figure 6 of the eukaryotic phylogenetic classifications mostly free living organisms such as nematodes tardigrades and rotifers were likely removed via the effluent along with other particulate and suspended solids ascomycota and unidentified eukaryote were the most abundant groups found in the laboratory scale systems figure 7 summarises the most abundant protozoa phyla at their class and genus level the most abundant genera in the seed sludge were rhogostoma 18 9 followed by telotrochidium 12 4 opisthonecta 4 8 and epistylis 2 6 which belongs to the oligohymenophorea class other peritrich ciliates genus such as pseudovorticella vorticella and vorticellides were in abundance between 0 1 and 0 7 most of the target genera were reduced over time in the laboratory scale samples i e telotrochidium to 2 7 and epistylis to 0 2 in the sample taken on day 104 which was during the likely copper contamination in the ags e coli reactor notably on day 160 when the ags e coli system was again stable telotrochidium highly recovered to 23 2 and epistylis to 1 8 regarding the genus rhogostoma irrespective of the circumstances the genus was prevalent and highly abundant in the ags e coli reactor it appeared to be slightly affected on day 104 46 2 for the undesired copper addition madoni et al 1992 but fully recovered on day 160 56 5 regarding the ags ms2 reactor sample on day 90 apart from the genus rhogostoma with a relative abundance of 29 telotrochidium 1 7 and epistylis to 0 2 were as conventional as the ags e coli on day 104 for the rest of the community their relative abundance was between 0 01 and 0 25 but more diverse than the ags e coli reactor 3 4 predation recorded using fluorescent staining figure 8 shows pictures obtained when recording the ingestion of the e coli by attached ciliated protozoa using dsgreen labelled e coli bacteria the pictures confirmed e coli predation by stalked ciliates the stained bacteria were visible inside the vacuoles of the organisms and the e coli bacteria were also visible embedded in the granular sludge matrix upon ingestion the bacteria were concentrated but the technique was not suitable for quantification of the partitioning of e coli bacteria between supernatant fraction attached to the granular surface or inside of the granular biomass 3 5 attachment kinetics attachment tests were carried out with the surrogates e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages the attachment kinetics are represented in figure 9 two concentrations were tested versus the exposure time regardless of the concentration and the target organism a speedy attachment occurred onto the granules in the first 15 min figure 9a and figure 9b moreover as can be observed in figure 9c and figure 9d sharper curves can be observed for the lower concentrations of both organisms meaning that a relative faster attachment occurred when compared with the more concentrated samples 3 6 contribution of settling in the ags reactors to the removal of the faecal surrogates additional tests were carried out to better understand the surrogates removal in the liquid phase shown in the curve of figure 3b specifically from the point measured in the supernatant at the end of the aeration to the mixed effluent for e coli bacteria it seems settling responsible for a 0 5 log10 removal while for the ms2 bacteriophage an increase of 0 1 log10 is measured results from the settling test figure 10 shows that regardless of the initial concentrations 2 0 105 and 5 3 107 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 2 4 103 and 4 7 109 pfu 100 ml for ms2 no differences were measured in the liquid bulk right after settling nor in the liquid fraction of the treated effluent therefore settling forces were discarded as factors to explain the variations in the long term reactors 4 discussion 4 1 reactor performance the ags reactors were both under operational conditions that triggered quick granular formation and an efficient reactor performance de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 adav et al 2008 overall both studied systems showed comparable performances to previous reports using similar substrates winkler et al 2011 the addition to the e coli and ms2 after day 47 for the ags e coli reactor and day 69 for the ags ms2 reactor did not affect the general reactor performance the measured water quality parameters shown in figure 1 confirmed healthy systems with low effluent cod values and high p release after the anaerobic feeding of the ags e coli and ags ms2 reactor respectively except for the low nh4 n removal in the ags e coli reactor from day 95 to 120 good conversion of nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n during aeration was observed in both systems the low nh4 n removal in the ags e coli reactor was most likely caused by the unexpected presence of copper in the system copper can be toxic for ammonia oxidising bacteria sato et al 1988 and other organisms such protozoa which can also interfere in the nitrification process lee and welander 1994 after copper was excluded from the influent the system recovered and showed a good performance until the end of the study 4 2 fate of the target surrogates during the operational conditions of the long term reactors the overall e coli removal efficiency 2 2 log10 calculated for the ags e coli reactor was within the range previously reported for e coli in full scale ags systems however the ms2 bacteriophage removal 0 7 log10 was lower than reported barrios hernández et al 2020b it is worth mentioning that full scale ags systems contain both a large granular sludge fraction and a smaller flocculent sludge fraction pronk et al 2015b ali et al 2019 have shown variances in the bacterial assembly depending on the different size of the aggregates including flocs large and small granular fractions reactors here studied contained only granular sludge potentially impacting the removal of the faecal surrogates therefore the fate of the two different faecal surrogates e coli and ms2 bacteriophages focused on evaluating only the contribution of the granular fraction during different operational stages of two ags systems to better understand their influence on the pathogen surrogates removals 4 2 1 faecal surrogates removals during the anaerobic plug flow feeding in this study an average reduction of 0 3 log10 was observed in the liquid fraction for the faecal surrogates during the anaerobic stage in both ags e coli and ags ms2 reactors in the ags systems the influent is fed in a plug flow mode causing a concentration gradient from high to low in the water phase over the granular bed a high concentration of the faecal surrogates present in the influent at the feeding point bottom of the reactor was expected which is diluted with the clean water at the top part of the reactor after feeding chong et al 2012 and vymazal 2005 have shown that coliforms survive longer in anaerobic environments thus due to the fully anaerobic conditions and the short time the feeding takes the faecal surrogates decay was negligible furthermore the batch attachment tests showed that irrespective of the organisms the e coli bacteria and the ms2 bacteriophage quickly attach and saturate the granular surface when passing through the granular media figure 9 they kept an equilibrium concentration between the granules and the supernatant fraction as can also be observed in figure 4 in case sludge waste occurs at this stage as is practice in full scale ags treatment plants a high concentration of surrogates approximately 105 cfu 100 ml and 107 pfu 100 ml would leave the system via the mixed liquor a combination of the sludge and supernatant fraction here studied corpuz et al 2020 martín díaz et al 2020 sludge treatment and dewatering will result in additional removal of pathogens zeng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore based on previous findings the minor reduction reported during the anaerobic period can be attained to a constant dilution effect of the influent with the remaining reactor media during steady state conditions 4 2 2 faecal surrogate removal during the aeration phase during the aeration phase the self immobilised granular bed is continuously mixed and granules are exposed to all the components remaining in the liquid bulk besides providing the right oxygen concentration in the systems lochmatter et al 2013 aeration provides high shear stress helping to form round shaped granules van loosdrecht et al 1995 this aerated phase is meaningful for some organisms that are oxygen depended such as protozoa fenchel 2014 protozoa play a major role in wastewater treatment technologies mckinney and gram 1956 madoni 2011 amaral et al 2018 they are unicellular heterotrophs and eukaryotic organisms fed either by the absorption of dissolved nutrients or the ingestion of particulate matter including bacteria or organism present during the assimilation nisbet 1984 pauli et al 2001 stated that protozoa could bind to bacterial conglomerates such as flocs in our laboratory scale ags reactors the sludge beds were almost completely formed of granules smaller granules were quickly discharged during the effluent withdrawal inducing free living metazoans such as nematodes tardigrades and rotifers to wash out figure 6 at the beginning of this study a reduction of the protozoa was measured using a microscope however once e coli was added to the ags e coli system a bloom of stalked ciliated protozoa attached to the granular surface occurred this tendency has been previously reported in laboratory scale systems fed on particulate material de kreuk et al 2010 barrios hernández et al 2020a and generally in full scale wastewater treatment systems stevik et al 2004 as can be seen in figure 5a a higher e coli removal was detected when a higher abundance of attached ciliated protozoa was microscopically observed ciliates are a dominant class in wastewater treatment systems curds 1973 varma et al 1975 dubber and gray 2011 they move through cilia and are subdivided into three categories free swimming crawling and attached organisms examples of this are the free swimming genera telotrochidium and opisthonecta and the attached ciliates epistylis pseudovorticella vorticella and vorticellides which were part of the ciliophora phylum level found in this study gao et al 2016 leal et al 2016 adl et al 2019 the free living genus rhogostoma from the cercozoa phylum showed to be the most abundant in the ags e coli reactor after both 104 46 and 160 57 operational days it grows quickly under controlled laboratory conditions belar 1921 öztoprak et al 2020 describe this genus as a bacteria predator with a high diversity of clades able to colonise a variety of habitats including wastewater matrices some species such as the r micra are related to debris and bacteria howe et al 2011 others r epiphylla have been recognized as food selective with an affinity to predate yeast from the ascomycota and basidiomicota phyla dumack et al 2017 organisms that were also present during steady conditions of the ags e coli reactor figure 6 concerning the protozoa filter feeding process called phagocytosis berman 2012 the feeding starts by generating a water current concentrating the particulate matter present in the liquid bulk while retaining the particles in size between 0 3 and 5 µm mallory et al 1983 lynn 2008 it includes our e coli 1 2 µm the process continues with the intake of the retained particulate matter in vacuoles this intake was recorded in the individual batch tests when using fluorescently labelled e coli figure 8 phagocytosis was anticipated to occur only during aeration bacterivorous commonly found in anoxic environments such as metopus and caenomorpha from the armophorea class were not present in the samples hirakata et al 2016 interestedly the anaerobic ciliates trimyema plagiopylea occurred but in a very low taxonomic abundance 0 002 when the ags e coli system was stable at day 160 schulz et al 1990 fenchel 2014 stated that some other protozoa could also adapt and sustain their growth under oxygen limitations it applies to euplotes and rimostrombidium from the spirotrichea class however such genera were negligible in the studied systems matsunaga et al 2014 reported a greater diversity of uncultured eukaryotes including phylogenetic affiliations found in this study overall our results were consistent with eukaryotic molecular diversity studies using 18s rrna gene analysis in different sewage systems for the ms2 bacteriophages no significant changes were recorded when the bacteriophage was added to the reactor bacteriophages in general are very selective on their host saha and mukherjee 2019 the host specificity of ms2 bacteriophage used in this study depended mostly on e coli f pili berzin et al 1974 salas and de vega 2008 therefore infections of bacteria forming the granules aob nob and paos were not expected and not measured based on the physicochemical reactor performance zhang et al 2013 therefore due to lack of favourable conditions for reproducing the ms2 bacteriophage including a low host range of bacteria marks and sharp 2000 khan et al 2002 and slow infection cycles hantula et al 1991 cell lysis was assumed negligible indeed the ms2 bacteriophages addition did not induce the same stalked ciliated protozoa bloom rate as in the ags e coli reactor as a particle ms2 bacteriophage 27 nm is much smaller than the e coli bacteria 1 by 2 µm kuzmanovic et al 2003 besides the low rate bacteria erosion expected from the granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 and the lack of particulate material or any other bacteria in the synthetic influent resulted in the reduced protozoa growth indirectly affecting the ms2 bacteriophages removal overall bacterivorous genera such as the free swimming telotrochidium 1 7 and stalked epistylis 0 2 occurred however their relative abundance was lower compared with the values found for the ags e coli reactor which were 23 and 2 respectively the genus rhogostoma 29 which was also the most abundant organism found in the ags ms2 reactor potentially grew by predating such free bacteria and fungi derived from the sludge granules little contributing to the viral surrogates removal deng et al 2014 reported that the free living salpingoeca craspedida can use the phage as a potential carbon source by actively feeding on ms2 it coincides with the relative taxonomic occurrence of this flagellate in the ags ms2 reactor 0 01 which was slightly lower than in the seed sludge 0 02 but not abundant in the reactor fed only with e coli hence based on prey selection criteria the protozoa feeding rate determined the grazing pressure on the added bacteriophages jürgens 2007 regarding attachment it was assumed that the granule surface reached an attachment equilibrium with the liquid bulk right after the anaerobic feeding this assumption can be confirmed when looking at the long term experiments in figure 4a and figure 4b the e coli median concentrations of the granular fractions at the end of the aerobic phase kept the same order of magnitude than the previous phase about 105 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 107 pfu 100 ml for ms2 therefore recognising the role of the protozoa in our laboratory scale systems the main removal mechanism during aeration can be documented as a one phase process on average 1 log10 e coli and 0 6 log10 ms2 bacteriophages were measured during aeration by filter feeding protozoa van der drift et al 1977 mallory et al 1983 which for the system fed only with ms2 were less abundant than in the ags e coli reactor 4 3 contribution of the settling in the removal of the faecal surrogates the settling batch tests executed in the additional column reactor showed that settling forces do not contribute to removing any of the studied faecal surrogates in the liquid phase figure 10 in the laboratory scale reactors the treated effluent is rapidly separated from the biomass due to its high density beun et al 2002 the surrogates initially attached to the granular surface settle along with the granules figure 4 therefore the effluent is a mixture of supernatant with high concentrations of suspended organisms and very small granules that did not settle during the short settling time 5 min such effluent composition explains the dynamic of the organism s depletion curve during settling time shown in figure 3b which for the e coli seemed that settling is adding to the overall removal but for ms2 bacteriophage similar concentrations between effluent and the liquid fraction after aeration were observed therefore the variations found in the organism s depletion curve were based on the composition of the effluent samples but not caused by any selection pressure 4 4 the relevance of the findings for future applications in this study in the laboratory granular sludge system fed only with synthetic wastewater the removal of bacteria was higher than the removal of bacteriophages the granules were saturated with high amounts of the surrogates e coli and ms2 achieving a saturation point during steady state as previously mentioned in section 4 2 1 such surrogates and actual pathogenic organisms will potentially abandon the system via waste sludge guzman et al 2007 goberna et al 2018 in ags full scale systems sludge waste normally occurs by a selection pressure that will discharge a high amount of flocculent sludge not commonly found in laboratory scale reactors van dijk et al 2020 some physical properties such as cell mobility pratt and kolter 1998 opposite charge attraction tay et al 2000 hydrophobicity tay et al 2001 liu et al 2003 and type of substrate added pronk et al 2015a might influence their attachment e coli and ms2 bacteriophages are considered good indicators of actual bacterial and viral pathogens in wastewater dias et al 2018 their removal in full scale ags systems has been reported and compared with parallel cas systems barrios hernández et al 2020b along with the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes pallares vega et al 2020 so far further research of the behaviour of actual bacterial viral and eukaryotic pathogenic organism in the ags system is missing full scale ags systems are fed with complex substrates they develop a significant flocculent sludge fraction derived from the influent suspended solids according to ali et al 2019 bacteria entering the system via the influent may end up in that flocculent fraction of the ags systems therefore the influence of the flocculent fraction on the bacterial and viral pathogen removal dynamics can be further considered influent raw wastewater can also have an impact on the diversity of the eukaryotic structures hirakata et al 2019 in our study protozoa predation was the dominant mechanism to the actual removal of the surrogates as protozoa are ideal grazers their abundance and diversity could help to achieve pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria removal a characterization of the protozoa community in a full scale ags system may help to better understand the pathogen removal dynamics of the ags systems 5 conclusions this study investigated the effects of physical and biological mechanisms on removing two important water quality surrogates e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages in ags systems regardless of the organism the bacterial and viral surrogates quickly attached to the granular surface saturating the granules during steady state conditions therefore physical removal plays a role when sludge waste occurs during aeration the e coli bacteria and ms2 bacteriophages were reduced to approximately 1 and 0 6 log10 respectively protozoa predation was the main contributor to the removal of e coli during aeration the 18s rrna sequence analysis confirmed the occurrence of the genera pseudovorticella vorticella and vorticellides which are attached ciliates from the phylum ciliophoran a higher abundance of free living genus rhogostoma and the free swimming ciliates telotrochidium were also found in the system fed with ms2 bacteriophages a similar eukaryotic community was observed although at much lower amounts bacteriophages removal was low in the system spiked only with ms2 in full scale ags systems protozoa growth on the granular sludge fraction can significantly contribute to the removal of bacteria from the influent the flocculent sludge fraction is responsible for further reducing bacterial numbers and bacteriophages and needs more attention in future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17106,microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation affect the biogeochemical cycles of many elements although the processes have been widely studied the underlying mechanisms and especially how the surface structures of iron oxides affect these redox processes are poorly understood therefore 001 facet dominated hematite nanoplates hnp and 100 facet dominated hematite nanorods hnr were used to explore the effects of surface structure on the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes during the reduction stage the production of total fe ii normalized by specific surface area ssa was higher for hnp than hnr due to steric effects and the ligand bound conformation of the connection between iron on different exposed facets and electron donors from microorganisms however during the aerobic oxidation stage both the ssa and fe ii normalized reactive oxygen species ros including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were higher for hnr than hnp theoretical calculation results showed that the 100 facets exhibited a lower activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction reaction than 001 facets supporting the experimental observation that 100 facet dominated hnr had a higher ros production efficiency than 001 facet dominated hnp these results indicated that surface characteristics not only mediated the microbial reduction of fe iii but also affected the aerobic oxidation of microbially reduced fe ii accessibility of electron donors to surface iron atom determined the reduction of fe iii and activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction by surface fe ii dominated the ros production during the redox processes this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms through which ros are produced by iron oxyhydr oxides during microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords reactive oxygen species redox surface structure iron oxides shewanella oneidensis mr 1 1 introduction iron reducing bacteria are widespread and can reduce iron oxyhydr oxides in anaerobic environments this process plays an important role in the dissolution and transformation of iron oxyhydr oxides kappler and straub 2005 and thus affects all the biogeochemical cycles in which iron participates malakar et al 2020 shi et al 2020 wu et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to explore the properties of iron oxyhydr oxides that influence their reduction using a variety of chemical reductants such as hydrogen sulfide sodium dithionite and ascorbic acid kappler and straub 2005 echigo et al 2012 huang et al 2017b and different dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria bose et al 2009 cutting et al 2009 hu et al 2020a the results of these studies demonstrated that morphological properties such as particle size morphology specific surface area crystallinity and aggregation state greatly determined both the microbial and chemical reduction of iron oxyhydr oxides bose et al 2009 cutting et al 2009 roden 2006 roden and zachara 1996 very recently hu et al 2020a and 2020b investigated the reductive dissolution of hematite with different exposed facets by shewanella putrefaciens cn 32 and found that the reductive dissolution of hematite was dependent on its exposed facets however the microbially reduced iron is usually unstable and tends to be oxidized by oxygen resulting in the coupling cycles of dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation for iron oxyhydr oxides in the fluctuating redox environment nevertheless the effects of the crystallographic surface structures of iron oxyhydr oxides on the whole microbial reduction and aerobic oxidation cycle have been far from clear in recent decades many studies have reported the formation of reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh during the oxidation of structural fe ii the produced ros play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients lalonde et al 2012 weber et al 2006 and transformation of pollutants in the environment davison 1993 sekar and dichristina 2014 mechanisms of ros production during the oxygenation of microbially and chemically reduced iron oxyhydr oxides clay minerals and sediments have also been investigated in recent years han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 yan et al 2016b zeng et al 2017 iron oxyhydr oxides with different morphological properties were observed to display different capacities to produce ros which however were not simply dependent on particle size morphology specific surface area or the reduced iron content han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 voinov et al 2011 therefore it is critically necessary to reveal how the crystallographic surface structures determine the whole microbial reduction oxidation cycle which will be of much help in exploring the mechanisms responsible for the production of ros by iron oxyhydr oxides hematite α fe2o3 is widespread as one of the most thermodynamically stable iron oxides in soils and sediments and exhibits a diversity of morphologies such as rounded clubbed rhombohedral and platy structures and so on which are determined by the development of their exposed facets during the process of mineral formation cornell and schwertmann 2003 li et al 2009 generally the morphology of a mineral is closely related to its crystallographic surface structure and each facet displays unique surface structure and properties lv et al 2010 previous studies have reported that designed surface structures of hematite can be obtained by shape controlled synthesis chen et al 2010 and exposed facet mediated catalytic degradation and adsorption of pollutants by hematite have been well studied huang et al 2019 jian et al 2019 lv et al 2018 zhou et al 2012 these studies suggest that hematites with different exposed facets can be used as ideal models to study the effects of crystallographic surface structures on the iron reduction and ros generation during dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes therefore two hematite nanocrystals with different exposed facets were synthesized and shewanella oneidensis mr 1 was used as the model iron reducing bacteria in this study to investigate facet mediated iron reduction and ros production by hematite during dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes the results will improve our understanding on the mechanisms of iron transformation and ros production by iron oxyhydr oxides at the mineral microbe interface during redox processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials shewanella oneidensis mr 1 purchased from american type culture collection atcc manassas usa was incubated and

productions of oh h2o2 and o2 during the oxidation of fe ii were determined for all the aerobic and anaerobic samples experimental groups without shewanella oneidensis mr 1 or hematite were used as controls all experiments were performed in triplicate notably we did not observe an obvious toxicity of free radicals to shewanella oneidensis mr 1 in both the hnr and hnp systems which might contribute to the adaption in response of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 to ros through various mechanisms shi et al 2015 feng et al 2019 2 3 determinations of fe ii and reactive oxygen species the production of total dissolved and particulate fe ii were measured with the 1 10 o phenanthroline analytical method as described in our previous study han et al 2020 the oh produced was determined

supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in morphology and microstructure of hematite nanocrystals during microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles the sem and hrtem images showed that the original hnr and hnp were consistent with the well defined single crystals with regular morphology figs 1 a and 1c figs 2 a c and figs 2g i and the morphologies and particle sizes of hnr figs 1a 1b 2a and 2d and hnp figs 1c 1d 2g and 2k remained unchanged after seven redox cycles indicating that the primary structures of the hematite nanocrystals were stable however high magnification tem and saed analyses showed that the diffraction patterns of hnr and hnp changed from monocrystals to polycrystals after seven redox cycles figs 2c 2f 2i and 2n new nanocrystallites including goethite no 29 0713 lepidocrocite no 08 0098 vivianite no 30 0662 siderite no 29 0696 maghemite no 25 1402 and metavivianite no 26 1137 were formed after the redox cycles for both hnr and hnp the presence of ferrous secondary minerals including vivianite siderite and metavivianite in the bioreduced reoxidized samples of hnp and hnr indicated the formation of some stable ferrous secondary minerals more secondary minerals were identified in this study than those found in previous studies luo et al 2017 han et al 2020 due to the facts that multiple redox cycles were performed and the use of hematite monocrystals favored the observation and identification of the newly formed secondary minerals in this study moreover the fe sem images showed an abundance of hnr or hnp accumulated on the surface of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 figs 1b and 1d which might result in the interaction between hematite and shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and benefit electron transfer from microorganisms to hematite previous studies have demonstrated that shewanella oneidensis mr 1 can adhere on iron oxide surface to form the mineral microorganism interactions through the formation of surface complexes by the phosphate or carboxylic moieties on cell surface yan et al 2016a or the formation of hydrogen bonding between the fe iii on the mineral surface and the outer membrane cytochrome omca or mtrc proteins lower et al 2007 lower et al 2008 3 2 facet mediated production of fe ii in hematite during redox cycles the reduction extents of hnr and hnp increased with the number of redox cycles and the total fe ii contents were 5 7 times higher in the seventh cycle anaerobic samples than in the first cycle anaerobic samples of both hnr and hnp fig s3a there are three possible reasons for this observation first the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances including flavins and soluble c type cytochromes which play important roles in accelerating electron transfer shi et al 2009 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b increased with the increase of redox cycles second some ferrous secondary minerals were formed by microbial reduction figs 2f and 2n which were more difficult to oxidize as confirmed by the increase in the fe ii content in the oxidation stage with the increase in redox cycles fig 3 a third the secondary minerals formed after redox cycling were more easily reduced by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 than the primary minerals the average yields of the total fe ii and particulate fe ii produced in hnp by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 in the seven redox cycles were 26 83 mg g and 20 46 mg g about 3 4 times higher than those in hnr figs s3b and 3b in order to compare the reduction abilities of hnr and hnp by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 the average yields of fe ii were normalized by their ssas roden 2006 the ssa normalized average yields of total fe ii produced in hnr and hnp were 0 69 and 0 83 mg m2 respectively fig s3d and the ssa normalized average yields of particulate fe ii were 0 38 and 0 63 mg m2 respectively fig 3d these results indicated that hnp were more easily reduced than hnr by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 similar to the results reported recently by hu et al 2020a and they ascribed such difference to hematite 001 possessing higher conductivity lower resistance and a more strongly oxidizing surface than hematite 100 the reduction of fe iii on iron oxide surfaces by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 is generally considered to be the result of electron transfer through direct or shuttle mediated electron transfer pathways melton et al 2014 shi et al 2016 bai et al 2020 for direct electron transfer electrons produced by microorganisms are transferred to fe iii by direct bonding of c type cytochromes such as mtrc and omca in the outer membrane of microorganisms to iron oxides lower et al 2007 therefore the iron reduction efficiency is highly dependent on the accessible fe iii sites the 001 facet of hematite appeared as a flat plane with a density of surface fe iii sites of 0 066 å 2 figs 4 a and 4b all of which were accessible to electron donors when they were exposed to the surface by contrast the 100 facet displayed a concave convex topography with the width of the grooves only 4 56 å the densities of convex fe iii sites and concave fe iii sites were calculated to be 0 034 å 2 and 0 08 å 2 figs 4c and 4d respectively thus the concave fe iii sites are inaccessible to the outer membrane cytochrome of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 through direct electron transfer due to the fact that the sizes of mtrc and omca are in the range of 5 8 nm wigginton et al 2007 lower et al 2009 madej et al 2014 much larger than the width of the groove on the 100 facet of hematite fig 4e therefore the accessible fe iii sites on 100 facet dominated hnr were about half those on 001 facet dominated hnp for direct electron transfer for shuttle mediated electron transfer electrons are transferred to the redox active organic molecules such as flavins secreted by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and then transferred to fe iii wang et al 2015 the electron shuttles with size smaller than the width of the groove can come in contact with concave fe iii sites on the 100 facet of hematite huang et al have found that the reductive dissolution of hematite 001 facets by ascorbic acid is faster than that of hematite 012 facets due to the formation of inner sphere bidentate mononuclear complexes on hematite 001 facet surfaces which favors electron transfer between ascorbic acid and fe iii huang et al 2017a huang et al 2017b considering that many organic electron shuttles have a structure similar to ascorbic acid larsen et al 2006 and hematite 012 facets have a similar topography to hematite 100 facets shuttle mediated electron transfer efficiency was expected to be higher on 001 facets than on 100 facets therefore both steric effects and the ligand bound conformation are beneficial for direct and shuttle mediated reduction of 001 facet dominated hnp rather than 100 facet dominated hnr 3 3 facet mediated production of reactive oxygen species during iron redox cycles shewanella oneidensis mr 1 alone produced a small amount of oh likely through the biological pathway reported previously han et al 2020 which contributed less than 6 to the total yield of oh in the microbe hematite systems under the conditions of this study the content of oh produced by oxidation increased with the increase in redox cycles a little lower in the first four cycles and slightly higher in the next three cycles for hnr than for hnp fig 5 a however the ssa normalized oh was consistently higher for hnr than for hnp fig 5b which became more obvious with the increase of cycles furthermore the production of oh was significantly linearly correlated with the content of particulate fe ii for both hnp r2 0 97 p 0 01 and hnr r2 0 99 p 0 01 fig 5c the slopes of the linear equations indicated that the yields of oh per unit particulate fe ii were 0 105 and 0 019 μmol for hnr and hnp respectively indicating that fe ii present in hnr displayed nearly five times higher ability to produce oh than that in hnp considering that hnr was dominated by 100 facets while hnp by 001 facets it was expected that the production of oh by the oxidation of surface fe ii of hematite was mediated by the surface configuration of fe ii on different facets and fe ii sited on the 100 facets was more efficient at producing oh than that on the 001 facets the generation of o2 and h2o2 upon the oxygenation of microbially reduced hematite was also determined nbt a scavenger of o2 was added into the reduced hematites collected at the end of the last redox cycle and the production of oh was quantified the addition of nbt suppressed the yield of oh by about 50 fig s4 confirming the involvement of o2 in the oxidation process the remaining 50 of oh not formed by the oxidation of o2 was expected to be generated through the two electron transfer process cheng et al 2016a zhang et al 2016 in which o2 was oxidized to generate h2o2 directly and then reacted with fe ii through a fenton like reaction to form oh the h2o2 produced upon the oxygenation of the microbially reduced hnp and hnr was detected online with a highly sensitive continuous flow chemiluminescence method using ae as the fluorescent probe the concentration of h2o2 increased sharply at first which was ascribed to the rapid oxidation of fe ii and then it decreased over time with the consumption of fe ii in both of the systems fig s5 the production of h2o2 upon the oxygenation of microbially reduced hnp was higher than that in hnr however it is interesting to find that after being normalized by the specific surface area the h2o2 generated was almost two times higher in hnr than in hnp consistent with the results of oh these suggest that h2o2 was the most important precursor of oh in addition the decrease rate of h2o2 was higher for hnr than for hnp indicating that fe ii in hnr were oxidized more easily and produced oh more efficiently than those in hnp this is consistent with the results of the study by huang et al 2016 in which they found that nonpolar 001 facets confined ferrous ions with a six coordination binding mode rather than five coordination binding mode on polar facets thus having a higher h2o2 decomposition energy span and displaying a lower efficiency of h2o2 decomposition 3 4 dft calculations differences in the adsorption energy of oxygen molecules onto hematite surface and the energy barriers for oxygen reduction on hnp and hnr may affect the production of oh dft calculations were therefore performed to gain insights into the thermodynamic mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction on different crystal faces elementary reactions of oxygen reduction involve the adsorption of oxygen molecules onto fe ii sites and the electron transfer process models of crystal cells and oxygen adsorption configurations are shown in fig s6 the adsorption energies of oxygen molecules onto the α fe2o3 001 and 100 facets were 2 86 and 2 35 ev respectively suggesting that the adsorption process was exothermic and the 001 facets had stronger binding capacity for oxygen than the 100 facets the minimum energy paths for the adsorption and reduction of oxygen on the α fe2o3 001 and 100 facets are displayed in fig 6 the initial state of α fe2o3 was a clean surface with an oxygen vacancy on 001 and 100 facets respectively platform 1 and then o2 was adsorbed onto the vacancy sites to form adsorbed o2 o2ad platform 2 fe ii on the facets then transferred an electron to o2ad to form the transition state ooh platform 3 and reached the steady state of ooh platform 4 as shown in fig 6 the activation energy barrier for the formation of transition state ooh was much lower on the 100 facets than on the 001 facets which benefits the formation of ooh and further facilitates the generation of h2o2 and oh schoonen et al 2006 yuan et al 2018 leading to a higher reduction efficiency for oxygen on the 100 facets than on the 001 facets these theoretical calculation results suggest that the surface atomic arrangement of iron oxides determines the activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction reaction therefore affecting the production efficiency of ros on the exposed facets of α fe2o3 this to some extent explains the underlying thermodynamic mechanism of oh production during the microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles of iron with different mineralogical phases 3 5 implication the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction is an important biogeochemical process in anaerobic environment which has been widely studied bose et al 2009 hu et al 2020a when changed into aerobic environment the microbially reduced fe ii is easily to be oxidized followed by the production of ros cheng et al 2016a han et al 2020 such microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles of iron oxyhydr oxides occur frequently in soils and sediments and have profound effects on the elemental geochemical cycles lalonde et al 2012 as well as the fate of pollutants sekar and dichristina 2014 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 the findings of this study provide a new insight into the effects of crystallographic surface structures on the microbe mineral interactions in a fluctuating redox environment and a mechanism for understanding the ros production during microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles of iron oxyhydr oxides in the natural environment a variety of factors including morphology particle size specific surface area phase composition surrounding materials and so on affect the surface structures of minerals thus natural iron oxyhydr oxides display different and changing iron reduction and ros production efficiencies and result in diverse environmental and geological impacts 4 conclusions this study investigated how crystallographic surface structure affects dissimilatory iron reduction and ros production during oxidation using two hematite nanocrystals dominated by 001 and 100 facets respectively the results showed that 001 facet dominated hnp had higher fe iii reduction efficiency than 100 facet dominated hnr likely attributed to the accessibility of iron on exposed facets to the outer membrane c cytochromes of dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria and ligand bound conformations of iron and electron shuttles on the other hand the production efficiency of ros upon oxygenation of microbially reduced hnr was higher than that by microbially reduced hnp which is dependent on the activation energy barrier of the oxygen reduction reaction on the exposed facets the intrinsic differences between exposed facets were determined by their surface atomic arrangement therefore it was the crystallographic surface structure of hematite that affected the iron reduction and ros production during microbial dissimilatory iron

17106,microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation affect the biogeochemical cycles of many elements although the processes have been widely studied the underlying mechanisms and especially how the surface structures of iron oxides affect these redox processes are poorly understood therefore 001 facet dominated hematite nanoplates hnp and 100 facet dominated hematite nanorods hnr were used to explore the effects of surface structure on the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes during the reduction stage the production of total fe ii normalized by specific surface area ssa was higher for hnp than hnr due to steric effects and the ligand bound conformation of the connection between iron on different exposed facets and electron donors from microorganisms however during the aerobic oxidation stage both the ssa and fe ii normalized reactive oxygen species ros including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were higher for hnr than hnp theoretical calculation results showed that the 100 facets exhibited a lower activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction reaction than 001 facets supporting the experimental observation that 100 facet dominated hnr had a higher ros production efficiency than 001 facet dominated hnp these results indicated that surface characteristics not only mediated the microbial reduction of fe iii but also affected the aerobic oxidation of microbially reduced fe ii accessibility of electron donors to surface iron atom determined the reduction of fe iii and activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction by surface fe ii dominated the ros production during the redox processes this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms through which ros are produced by iron

dissolution and transformation of iron oxyhydr oxides kappler and straub 2005 and thus affects all the biogeochemical cycles in which iron participates malakar et al 2020 shi et al 2020 wu et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to explore the properties of iron oxyhydr oxides that influence their reduction using a variety of chemical reductants such as hydrogen sulfide sodium dithionite and ascorbic acid kappler and straub 2005 echigo et al 2012 huang et al 2017b and different dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria bose et al 2009 cutting et al 2009 hu et al 2020a the results of these studies demonstrated that morphological properties such as particle size morphology specific surface area crystallinity and aggregation state greatly determined both the microbial and chemical reduction of iron oxyhydr oxides bose et al 2009 cutting et al 2009 roden 2006 roden and zachara 1996 very recently hu et al 2020a and 2020b investigated the reductive dissolution of hematite with different exposed facets by shewanella putrefaciens cn 32 and found that the reductive dissolution of hematite was dependent on its exposed facets however the microbially reduced iron is usually unstable and tends to be oxidized by oxygen resulting in the coupling cycles of dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation for iron oxyhydr oxides in the fluctuating redox environment nevertheless the effects of the crystallographic surface structures of iron oxyhydr oxides on the whole microbial reduction and aerobic oxidation cycle have been far from clear in recent decades many studies have reported the formation of reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh during the oxidation of structural fe ii the produced ros play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients lalonde et al 2012 weber et al 2006 and transformation of pollutants in the environment davison 1993 sekar and dichristina 2014 mechanisms of ros production during the oxygenation of microbially and chemically reduced iron oxyhydr oxides clay minerals and sediments have also been investigated in recent years han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 yan et al 2016b zeng et al 2017 iron oxyhydr oxides with different morphological properties were observed to display different capacities to produce ros which however were not simply dependent on particle size morphology specific surface area or the reduced iron content han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 voinov et al 2011 therefore it is critically necessary to reveal how the crystallographic surface structures determine the whole microbial reduction oxidation cycle which will be of much help in exploring the mechanisms responsible for the production of ros by iron oxyhydr oxides hematite α fe2o3 is widespread as one of the most thermodynamically stable iron oxides in soils and sediments and exhibits a diversity of morphologies such as rounded clubbed rhombohedral and platy structures and so on which are determined by the development of their exposed facets during the process of mineral formation cornell and schwertmann 2003 li et al 2009 generally the morphology of a mineral is closely related to its crystallographic surface structure and each facet displays unique surface structure and properties lv et al 2010 previous studies have reported that designed

crystallographic surface structures on the iron reduction and ros generation during dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes therefore two hematite nanocrystals with different

liquid chromatography hplc agilent technologies usa coupled with a fluorescence detector fld an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm i d 5 μm film thickness was employed forty μl of sample was injected and the mobile phase was composed of 70 ultrapure water with 0 5 acetic acid and 30 methanol at 1 ml min the excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 nm and 460 nm respectively the concentration of 7 hcou was calculated using a calibration curve from 0 005 to 1 μm and the detection limit was 0 0032 μm the total amount of oh produced was estimated as 7 hcou 14 5 tokumura et al 2011 the detection of h2o2 was carried out with a continuous flow chemiluminescence system using ae as the probe as previously described with a minor modification king et al 2007 the milli q water used for the preparation of buffer solutions and reagents was treated with 3 mg l cat for at least 0 5 h to remove trace amounts of h2o2 in water the ae reagent 1 μm was dissolved in 1 mm phosphate buffer ph 3 to avoid base hydrolysis the sample was mixed with ae reagent and 0 1 m carbonate ph 11 3 serially with the flow rate of 2 4 ml min before being introduced into to the detection loop the chemiluminescent cl intensity was detected by a photomultiplier operated at 900 v the concentrations of the stock h2o2 solutions were determined with an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer using the h2o2 molar absorptivity of 38 1 1 4 m 1cm 1 at 240 nm miller and kester 1988 a calibration curve of h2o2 concentrations versus cl intensities was constructed from 0 10 to 50 0 μm 2 4

supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in morphology and microstructure of hematite nanocrystals during microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles the sem and hrtem images showed that the original hnr and hnp were consistent with the well defined single crystals with regular morphology figs 1 a and 1c figs 2 a c and figs 2g i and the morphologies and particle sizes of hnr figs 1a 1b 2a and 2d and hnp figs 1c 1d 2g and 2k remained unchanged after seven redox cycles indicating that the primary structures of the hematite nanocrystals were stable however high magnification tem and saed analyses showed that the diffraction patterns of hnr and hnp changed from monocrystals to polycrystals after seven redox cycles figs 2c 2f 2i and 2n new nanocrystallites including goethite no 29 0713 lepidocrocite no 08 0098 vivianite no 30 0662 siderite no 29 0696 maghemite no 25 1402 and metavivianite no 26 1137 were formed after the redox cycles for both hnr and hnp the presence of ferrous secondary minerals including vivianite siderite and metavivianite in the bioreduced reoxidized samples of hnp and hnr indicated the formation of some stable ferrous secondary minerals more secondary minerals were identified in this study than those found in previous studies luo et al 2017 han et al 2020 due to the facts that multiple redox cycles were performed and the use of hematite monocrystals favored the observation and identification of the newly formed secondary minerals in this study moreover the fe sem images showed an abundance of hnr or hnp accumulated on the surface of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 figs 1b and 1d which might result in the interaction between hematite and shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and benefit electron transfer from microorganisms to hematite previous studies have demonstrated that shewanella oneidensis mr 1 can adhere on iron oxide surface to form the mineral microorganism interactions through the formation of surface complexes by the phosphate or carboxylic moieties on cell surface yan et al 2016a or the formation of hydrogen bonding between the fe iii on the mineral surface and the outer membrane cytochrome omca or mtrc proteins lower et al 2007 lower et al 2008 3 2 facet mediated production of fe ii in hematite during redox cycles the reduction extents of hnr and hnp increased with the number of redox cycles and the total fe ii contents were 5 7 times higher in the seventh cycle anaerobic samples than in the first cycle anaerobic samples of both hnr and hnp fig s3a there are three possible reasons for this observation first the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances including flavins and soluble c type cytochromes which play important roles in accelerating electron transfer shi et al 2009 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b increased with the increase of redox cycles second some ferrous secondary minerals were formed by microbial reduction figs 2f and 2n which were more difficult to oxidize as confirmed by the increase in the fe ii content in the oxidation stage with the increase in redox cycles fig 3 a third the secondary minerals formed after redox cycling were more easily reduced by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 than the primary minerals the average yields of the total fe ii and particulate fe ii produced in hnp by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 in the seven redox cycles were 26 83 mg g and 20 46 mg g about 3 4 times higher than those in hnr figs s3b and 3b in order to compare the reduction abilities of hnr and hnp by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 the average yields of fe ii were normalized by their ssas roden 2006 the ssa normalized average yields of total fe ii produced in hnr and hnp were 0 69 and 0 83 mg m2 respectively fig s3d and the ssa normalized average yields of particulate fe ii were 0 38 and 0 63 mg m2 respectively fig 3d these results indicated that hnp were more easily reduced than hnr by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 similar to the results reported recently by hu et al 2020a and they ascribed such difference to hematite 001 possessing higher conductivity lower resistance and a more strongly oxidizing surface than hematite 100 the reduction of fe iii on iron oxide surfaces by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 is generally considered to be the result of electron transfer through direct or shuttle mediated electron transfer pathways melton et al 2014 shi et al 2016 bai et al 2020 for direct electron transfer electrons produced by microorganisms are transferred to fe iii by direct bonding of c type cytochromes such as mtrc and omca in the outer membrane of microorganisms to iron oxides lower et al 2007 therefore the iron reduction efficiency is highly dependent on the accessible fe iii sites the 001 facet of hematite appeared as a flat plane with a density of surface fe iii sites of 0 066 å 2 figs 4 a and 4b all of which were accessible to electron donors when they were exposed to the surface by contrast the 100 facet displayed a concave convex topography with the width of the grooves only 4 56 å the densities of convex fe iii sites and concave fe iii sites were calculated to be 0 034 å 2 and 0 08 å 2 figs 4c and 4d respectively thus the concave fe iii sites are inaccessible to the outer membrane cytochrome of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 through direct electron transfer due to the fact that the sizes of mtrc and omca are in the range of 5 8 nm wigginton et al 2007 lower et al 2009 madej et al 2014 much larger than the width of the groove on the 100 facet of hematite fig 4e therefore the accessible fe iii sites on 100 facet dominated hnr were about half those on 001 facet dominated hnp for direct electron transfer for shuttle mediated electron transfer electrons are transferred to the redox active organic molecules such as flavins secreted by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and then transferred to fe iii wang et al 2015 the electron shuttles with size smaller than the width of the groove can come in contact with concave fe iii sites on the 100 facet of hematite huang et al have found that the reductive dissolution of hematite 001 facets by ascorbic acid is faster than that of hematite 012 facets due to the formation of inner sphere bidentate mononuclear complexes on hematite 001 facet surfaces which favors electron transfer between ascorbic acid and fe iii huang et al 2017a huang et al 2017b considering that many organic electron shuttles have a structure similar to ascorbic acid larsen et al 2006 and hematite 012 facets have a similar topography to hematite 100 facets shuttle mediated electron transfer efficiency was expected to be higher on 001 facets than on 100 facets therefore both steric effects and the ligand bound conformation are beneficial for direct and shuttle mediated reduction of 001 facet dominated hnp rather than 100 facet dominated hnr 3 3 facet mediated production of reactive oxygen species during iron redox cycles shewanella oneidensis mr 1 alone produced a small amount of oh likely through the biological pathway reported previously han et al 2020 which contributed less than 6 to the total yield of oh in the microbe hematite systems under the conditions of this study the content of oh produced by oxidation increased with the increase in redox cycles a little lower in the first four cycles and slightly higher in the next three cycles for hnr than for hnp fig 5 a however the ssa normalized oh was consistently higher for hnr than for hnp fig 5b which became more obvious with the increase of cycles furthermore the production of oh was significantly linearly correlated with the content of particulate fe ii for both hnp r2 0 97 p 0 01 and hnr r2 0 99 p 0 01 fig 5c the slopes of the linear equations indicated that the yields of oh per unit particulate fe ii were 0 105 and 0 019 μmol for hnr and hnp respectively indicating that fe ii present in hnr displayed nearly five times higher ability to produce oh than that in hnp considering that hnr was dominated by 100 facets while hnp by 001 facets it was expected that the production of oh by the oxidation of surface fe ii of hematite was mediated by the surface configuration of fe ii on different facets and fe ii sited on the 100 facets was more efficient at producing oh than that on the 001 facets the generation of o2 and h2o2 upon the oxygenation of microbially reduced hematite was also determined nbt a scavenger of o2 was added into the reduced hematites collected at the end of the last redox cycle and the production of oh was quantified the addition of nbt suppressed the yield of oh by about 50 fig s4 confirming the involvement of o2 in the oxidation process the remaining 50 of oh not formed by the oxidation of o2 was expected to be generated through the two electron transfer process cheng et al 2016a zhang et al 2016 in which o2 was oxidized to generate h2o2 directly and then reacted with fe ii through a fenton like reaction to form oh the h2o2 produced upon the oxygenation of the microbially reduced hnp and hnr was detected online with a highly sensitive continuous flow chemiluminescence method using ae as the fluorescent probe the concentration of h2o2 increased sharply at first which was ascribed to the rapid oxidation of fe ii and then it decreased over time with the consumption of fe ii in both of the systems fig s5 the production of h2o2 upon the oxygenation of microbially reduced hnp was higher than that in hnr however it is interesting to find that after being normalized by the specific surface area the h2o2 generated was almost two times higher in hnr than in hnp consistent with the results of oh these suggest that h2o2 was the most important precursor of oh in addition the decrease rate of h2o2 was higher for hnr than for hnp indicating that fe ii in hnr were oxidized more easily and produced oh more efficiently than those in hnp this is consistent with the results of the study by huang et al 2016 in which they found that nonpolar 001 facets confined ferrous ions with a six coordination binding mode rather than five coordination binding mode on polar facets thus having a higher h2o2 decomposition energy span and displaying a lower efficiency of h2o2 decomposition 3 4 dft calculations differences in the adsorption energy of oxygen molecules onto hematite surface and the energy barriers for oxygen reduction on hnp and hnr may affect the production of oh dft calculations were therefore performed to gain insights into the thermodynamic mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction on different crystal faces elementary reactions of oxygen reduction involve the adsorption of oxygen molecules onto fe ii sites and the electron transfer process models of crystal cells and oxygen adsorption configurations are shown in fig s6 the adsorption energies of oxygen molecules onto the α fe2o3 001 and 100 facets were 2 86 and 2 35 ev respectively suggesting that the adsorption process was exothermic and the 001 facets had stronger binding capacity for oxygen than the 100 facets the minimum energy paths for the adsorption and reduction of oxygen on the α fe2o3 001 and 100 facets are displayed in fig 6 the initial state of α fe2o3 was a clean surface with an oxygen vacancy on 001 and 100 facets respectively platform 1 and then o2 was adsorbed onto the vacancy sites to form adsorbed o2 o2ad platform 2 fe ii on the facets then transferred an electron to o2ad to form the transition state ooh platform 3 and reached the steady state of ooh platform 4 as shown in fig 6 the activation energy barrier for the formation of transition state ooh was much lower on the 100 facets than on the 001 facets which benefits the formation of ooh and further facilitates the generation of h2o2 and oh schoonen et al 2006 yuan et al 2018 leading to a higher reduction efficiency for oxygen on the 100 facets than on the 001 facets these theoretical calculation results suggest that the surface atomic arrangement of iron oxides determines the activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction reaction therefore affecting the production efficiency of ros on the exposed facets of α fe2o3 this to some extent explains the underlying thermodynamic mechanism of oh production during the microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles of iron with different mineralogical phases 3 5 implication the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction is an important biogeochemical process in anaerobic environment which has been widely studied bose et al 2009 hu et al 2020a when changed into aerobic environment the microbially reduced fe ii is easily to be oxidized followed by the production of ros cheng et al 2016a han et al 2020 such microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles of iron oxyhydr oxides occur frequently in soils and sediments and have profound effects on the elemental geochemical cycles lalonde et al 2012 as well as the fate of pollutants sekar and dichristina 2014 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 the findings of this study provide a new insight into the effects of crystallographic surface structures on the microbe mineral interactions in a fluctuating redox environment and a mechanism for understanding the ros production during microbial dissimilatory reduction and aerobic oxidation cycles of iron oxyhydr oxides in the natural environment a variety of factors including morphology particle size specific surface area phase composition surrounding materials and so on affect the surface structures of minerals thus natural iron oxyhydr oxides display different and changing iron reduction and ros production efficiencies and result in diverse environmental and geological impacts 4 conclusions this study investigated how crystallographic surface structure affects dissimilatory iron reduction and ros production during oxidation using two hematite nanocrystals dominated by 001 and 100 facets respectively the results showed that 001 facet dominated hnp had higher fe iii reduction efficiency than 100 facet dominated hnr likely attributed to the accessibility of iron on exposed facets to the outer membrane c cytochromes of dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria and ligand bound conformations of iron and electron shuttles on the other hand the production efficiency of ros upon oxygenation of microbially reduced hnr was higher than that by microbially reduced hnp which is dependent on the activation energy barrier of the oxygen reduction reaction on the exposed facets the intrinsic differences between exposed facets were determined by their surface atomic arrangement therefore it was the crystallographic surface structure of hematite that affected the iron reduction and ros production during microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and aerobic oxidation processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

17107,wastewater based epidemiology wbe can be a useful tool to face some of the existing challenges in monitoring the use of new psychoactive substances nps as it can provide objective and updated information this europe wide study aimed to verify the suitability of wbe for investigating the use of nps selected nps were monitored in urban wastewater by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms the main classical illicit drugs were monitored in the same samples to compare their levels with those of nps raw composite wastewater samples were collected in 2016 and 2017 in 14 european countries 22 cities following best practice sampling protocols methcathinone was most frequent 65 of the cities followed by mephedrone 25 of the cities and only mephedrone methcathinone and methylone were found in both years this study depicts the use of nps in europe confirming that it is much lower than the use of classical drugs wbe proved able to assess the qualitative and quantitative spatial and temporal profiles of nps use the results show the changeable nature of the nps market and the importance of large wbe monitoring campaigns for selected priority nps wbe is valuable for complementing epidemiological studies to follow rapidly changing profiles of use of drugs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wastewater new psychoactive substances monitoring europe spatial and temporal trends use profiles 1 introduction urban wastewater reflects the lifestyle of a population as it represents anonymous urine samples from thousands of people when an individual ingests a substance it can be excreted in urine or faeces as the parent substance or a metabolite and enters the urban sewage system wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a promising approach for estimating the use of a substance in a population by chemical analysis of urban wastewater for selected urinary metabolites biomarkers gracia lor et al 2017 wbe was developed to estimate the use of illicit drugs more than a decade ago zuccato et al 2005 2008 van nuijs et al 2011 and is now regularly applied worldwide to assess the use of cocaine amphetamine like stimulants and cannabis gonzález mariño et al 2020 with its advantage of providing objective and updated information on a population in a short period of time wbe is considered a new indicator of drug use complementary to the established drug monitoring tools emcdda 2016 wbe can be useful to tackle some of the challenges in monitoring the use of new psychoactive substances nps nps are an extremely heterogeneous group of substances originally designed as legal alternatives to the more established illicit drugs and they have challenged traditional approaches to drug monitoring surveillance control and public health response peacock et al 2019 these challenges include the large number of substances and the speed with which they enter and exit the market the lack of awareness of the exact content of nps products and their often unknown potency and effects peacock et al 2019 by the end of 2019 the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction emcdda was recording about 790 nps in europe emcdda 2020 and the early warning advisory ewa of the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc reported more than 950 nps worldwide unodc 2020 in europe the number of new substances identified for the first time reached a peak in 2014 2015 with 100 newly reported nps per year and dropped to 53 in 2019 emcdda 2020 the nps market is highly dynamic depending on the substances availability over time that may vary because of the changing laws i e when a substance from licit become protected illegal producers create rapidly an alternative substance with the same or similar effect nps are now increasingly manufactured and marketed as counterfeit prescription medicines or mixed with established illicit substances but their composition is usually mostly unknown emcdda 2015 surveys of self reported use and seizure data are not suitable alone to assess the prevalence of nps use and the current best option is to adopt monitoring systems that triangulate different information sources including forensic and toxicology analyses of human biological or drug samples peacock et al 2019 wbe can be used as a new additional tool to monitor nps use by the general population or in specific sub populations e g at festivals as for established illicit drugs benaglia et al 2020 bijlsma et al 2020 emcdda 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2020 the main limitation when assessing nps use by wbe is the very low concentration levels expected in urban wastewater because of the lower prevalence of use this in combination with the often unknown excretion pattern that hinders focusing on specific metabolic products and the large number of different substances that should ideally be investigated because they were recorded in the market bade et al 2019a bijlsma et al 2019 salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 makes monitoring nps use very challenging these limitations can be partially overcome using advanced analytical techniques based on mass spectrometry which reaches very good sensitivity for detecting a substance in wastewater even at trace levels and screening the presence of large number of substances hernandez et al 2016 some recent studies investigated urban wastewater for nps in different countries addressing a selected set of substances bade et al 2020 2017 gonzalez marino et al 2016 reid et al 2014 or screening hundreds bade et al 2019b diamanti et al 2019 salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 although relatively few substances were detected in wastewater at low levels few ng l literature did identify temporal trends of synthetic cathinones use in australia bade et al 2019a chen et al 2013 tscharke et al 2016 and spatial trends of use in three countries in europe gonzalez marino et al 2016 nevertheless most of previous studies were limited to a single country and very few cities as far as we know the present work is the most extensive monitoring study of nps use in the general population ever done through wbe and it was part of the nps euronet project funded by the european commission the aim was to test the suitability of wbe for investigating the use of nps in the general population in an extensive monitoring campaign this study covered two years in 14 european countries and 22 cities a selected number of nps including mostly synthetic cathinones and phenethylamines were quantified in urban wastewater to assess their spatial and temporal profiles of use the main classical illicit drugs amphetamine methamphetamine mdma and cocaine were analysed in the same samples to compare their levels with those of the nps 2 material and methods 2 1 compounds selection thirty nps were selected according to their frequency of citation in alert reports from the early warning systems of the emcdda and unodc the availability of analytical standards their reported presence in urban wastewater in previous studies and stability in wastewater the selected nps were 19 synthetic cathinones 7 phenethylamines 1 synthetic cannabinoid 1 tryptamine 1 aminorex derivative and 1 arylcyclohexylamine ketamine analog table 1 in total thirteen deuterated compound analogues of eleven nps plus amphetamine d6 amph d6 and methamphetamine d9 meth d9 were used as internal standards table 1 all the substances are parent drugs as for most nps the metabolism is unknown and very few analytical standards of metabolites are available furthermore the majority of the nps considered are synthetic cathinones that are mainly excreted as parent compounds uralets et al 2014 the main classical drugs were included in the analysis to compare their use and were amphetamine amph methamphetamine meth 3 4 methylenedioxy methamphetamine mdma ketamine ket as parent substances and benzoylecgonine be as the main metabolite of cocaine 2 2 chemicals and

weekend in 2016 and for 7 consecutive days in 2017 from wastewater treatment plants wwtp in different cities in europe the sampling period was march may in 2016 and may june plus one city in october in 2017 table s1 the sampling in 2017 was randomly stratified over four weeks taking one two samples per week to ensure better representability of samples ort et al 2014 each sample was collected as a

weekend samples were created by mixing aliquots from saturday sunday and monday and pooled weekday samples by mixing aliquots from tuesday to friday this design was adopted to optimize the analytical effort to achieve our objectives i e evaluate the use of nps and investigate their weekly pattern of use week weekend the investigation included 20 cities from 14 european countries 21 wwtps with approximately 6 9 million people connected in 2016 and 7 cities in 5 european countries 7 wwtps with approximately 3 4 million people connected in 2017 unfortunately the sampling capacity was not the same in 2016 and 2017 but five cities were included in both campaigns in order to follow the time trends weekend pooled samples from 2016 and 2017 were compared information on population size and wwtp characteristics including the daily flow rates are reported in the supplementary material sm table s1 the sampling scheme was designed according to best practice protocols castiglioni et al 2013 in order to limit sampling uncertainty to 5 10 samples were collected volume or time proportionally ensuring the collection of at least one aliquot per hour for substances with a low prevalence of use as nps sampling errors may be higher than for substances used more widely cocaine alcohol nicotine but this can be partially balanced by the large populations investigated which lowers the uncertainty

zuccato et al 2016 2 5 method validation and quality control the analytical method was validated for accuracy precision linearity and sensitivity according to international guidelines united nation industrial development organization 2006 results are reported in table s3 recovery and repeatability of the analytical method were tested in raw wastewater n 3 by spiking 50 ml aliquots with 100 ng l

lower than 14 table s3 limits of detection lod and quantitation loq of the whole method were calculated from raw wastewater samples as the values corresponding to signal to noise ratios s n of 3 and

and multiquanttm 2 1 software ab sciex concentrations ng l were multiplied by wastewater daily flow rates m3 day to obtain the mass load of each substance the loads were then normalised to the population served by the wwtp to obtain the mg d 1000inh d day inh inhabitants which allowed the comparison of results for different cities normalised mass loads were used as an indicator of nps use per day in the population the back calculation normally done considering the illicit drug metabolism to estimate drug consumption castiglioni et al 2013 gracia lor et al 2016 was not done in the present study because of the lack of information on nps metabolism this currently impedes the development of specific correction factors for back calculation the comparison with classical drugs took account of the mass loads too without back calculation for a more realistic comparison 3 results and discussion 3 1 nps occurrence in urban wastewater table 2 reports the mean median and concentrations ranges of the nps quantified in the different cities only synthetic cathinones and phenetylamines were found in wastewater twenty six nps were searched in 2016 and 10 were detected 38 while 30 nps were targeted in 2017 and 5 were detected 17 metc was the substance most frequently detected as it was found in 13 cities 65 of the cities investigated and 8 different countries 57 of the countries investigated in 2016 and 6 cities 86 and 4 countries 80 in 2017 meph was also frequently found 5 cities from 5 countries in 2016 and 4 cities from 4 countries in 2017 table 2 meph metc and metl were the only substances found in wastewater in both years metc was also one of the substances found most frequently over the years in australia with a steady profile of use bade et al 2019a chen et al 2013 tscharke et al 2016 in europe it was found in previous investigations in italy and the uk gonzalez marino et al 2016 but not in croatia senta et al 2015 nps concentrations were generally in the low ng l range 1 20 ng l except for pma a phenethylamine that was found up to 100 ng l in 2016 pma was not found in 2017 but we detected another phenethylamine 25 ip nbome which was not identified in 2016 suggesting the variability of the nps market and the interchangeable nature of this group of psychoactive stimulants concentrations above 20 ng l were also found for meph and metl in 2016 up to 23 ng l and for meph in 2017 up to 60 ng l these levels are generally in agreement with previous investigations where nps were found at trace levels in wastewater but there were some differences among countries for some substances for instance α pvp was found in greece at similar levels to the present study while meph in greece was not detected borova et al 2015 in belgium pma was not detected but methoxetamine was detected very often kinyua et al 2015 in croatia metl and meph were found at lower levels than in the present study and mdpv was not found senta et al 2015 but it was found in china gao et al 2017 and in finland where the levels were quite high in a specific area kankaanpaa et al 2014 in previous european studies meph was found at the highest levels in the uk suggesting a decrease of meph use in that country bade et al 2017 castrignanò et al 2016 gonzalez marino et al 2016 and metl was found also in denmark bade et al 2017 results from the literature give only a snapshot of nps use in different countries because different substances were investigated over the years and studies mainly focused on single countries in view of the complex and dynamic market of nps it would be useful to apply wbe for repeated monitoring campaigns focused on a core group of relevant substances to identify temporal and spatial trends of use especially compounds that have an established niche market and or are highly potent 3 2 spatial profiles of nps use figs 1 and 2 reports population normalized mass loads mg d 1000inh of the nps found in this study detailed values are set out in sm tables s4 s5 the highest loads 30 mg d 1000inh were for pma in 2016 in novi sad serbia and bratislava slovakia fig 1 meph was second highest with considerably lower loads 8 8 mg d 1000inh in krakow poland and 5 mg d 1000inh in cluj napoca romania and ljubljana slovenia metc was the substance found most frequently but at lower mass loads with maximum values of 3 mg d 1000inh in bucharest romania and novi sad serbia fig 1 metl and α pvp were detected less frequently and were found only in ljubljana slovenia 5 5 mg d 1000inh and utrecht the netherlands 0 7 mg d 1000inh for metl and lugano switzerland 3 3 mg d 1000inh and porto portugal 0 3 mg d 1000inh for α pvp table s4 in 2017 fig 2 the highest loads were found for meph in krakow poland up to 11 mg d 1000inh and ljubljana slovenia 3 mg d 1000inh and for metc and buph up to 2 mg d 1000inh in all the places where they were found all the other substances detected butl 3 4 dmmc ethc mdpv pentl buph and 25 ip nbome were at levels lower than 1 mg d 1000inh and were found only in one city or country each table s5 meph was already reported in krakow few years ago 2012 where it was found in sewage effluents at comparable loads 3 6 7 1 mg d 1000 inh styszko et al 2016 in the same study 4 mec was also reported at similar levels 4 8 5 8 mg d 1000 inh but it was not anymore detected in this study generally the loads found in this study were similar to those in previous investigations in australia bade et al 2019a chen et al 2013 norway baz lomba et al 2016 uk italy and spain gonzalez marino et al 2016 china gao et al 2017 and greece diamanti et al 2019 nevertheless there are some interesting differences for certain substances such as pma that was found in this study at the highest levels ever found before but only in a few cities pma was reported previously only in greece up to 11 mg d 1000inh diamanti et al 2019 but not in belgium kinyua et al 2015 indicating a scattered profile of use metl was the first synthetic cathinone appearing in the market in europe in 2005 unodc 2013 and was found in europe at levels 10 mg d 1000inh in a few studies this study and baz lomba et al 2016 while an increasing trend was seen a few years ago in australia chen et al 2013 thai et al 2016 where it reached loads up to 40 mg d 1000inh mdpv was found at levels of 1 mg d 1000inh in italy this study and gonzalez marino et al 2016 australia chen et al 2013 and china gao et al 2017 but increased consumption was recorded a few years ago in finland where it ranged up to 19 mg d 1000inh kankaanpaa et al 2014 these results were confirmed by unusually high rates of mdpv related crimes and mdpv positive biological specimens from clinical sources in the same region emcdda 2014 kankaanpaa et al 2014 the ketamine analog methoxetamine was not found in the present study but was recorded in belgium about 1 2 mg d 1000inh kinyua et al 2015 norway 0 8 mg d 1000inh baz lomba et al 2016 and more recently in australia 1 3 mg d 1000inh bade et al 2020 and the uk up to more than 100 mg d 1000inh rice et al 2020 3 3 temporal trends of use of nps temporal trends were evaluated on the five cities investigated in 2016 and 2017 meph metc and metl were the only substances found in both years figure s1 and tables s4 s5 no major differences were seen between the loads found in the two years though there were differences for the single cities figure s1 the only exception was pma that was found only in 2016 and disappeared in 2017 indicating a potential change in the market use of this drug over the investigated period meph was higher in 2017 than 2016 in krakow poland and porto portugal and lower in ljubljana slovenia while metc was generally higher in 2017 except in bratislava slovakia metl was found only in ljubljana and loads decreased from 5 5 mg d 1000inh in 2016 to 1 mg d 1000inh in 2017 table s4 s5 meph mass loads in italy and uk resulted in lower levels than in previous studies gonzalez marino et al 2016 rice et al 2020 particularly in the uk where mass loads dropped from about 30 mg d 1000inh in 2015 to 0 5 mg d 1000inh in 2016 this trend was seen also in other countries such as australia where meph use peaked in 2010 2011 chen et al 2013 then dropped rapidly remaining very low in the next few years bade et al 2019a thai et al 2016 meph was one of the first nps to become popular in the market in the mid 2000s especially in the uk and ireland and its use increased for a few years 2008 2010 reaching the levels of mdma in the general population and cocaine among young people emcdda europol 2013 until it was put under control and its use gradually decreased emcdda 2014 no particular patterns of use have been identified so far in europe for other substances but an interesting trend was recently noted in australia where different substances were preferentially used over the few last years even if not always in the same area i e meph in 2010 2011 metl in 2012 2013 ethl in 2014 2016 and more recently bade et al 2019a pentl it would be useful to start periodic monitoring campaigns also in europe for a priority group i e those substances for which preliminary information is available in some countries in order to identify patterns of use better selecting this group of priority substances is not easy due to the high numbers of nps on the market and the speedy changes in their profiles of use but combining different information such as their presence in wastewater seizures epidemiological and forensic data will help to establish a list of selected substances a prioritization approach was proposed recently by our research group for selecting priority nps based on wide screening by hrms using a database of substances selected on the basis of their reporting frequency by the early warning systems of different agencies and previous detection in wastewater in several european countries salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 future strategies could make use of a first hrms screening using broad lists of compounds followed by triangulation with information from other sources to build up a panel of priority nps for target quantitative methods 3 4 weekly profiles of nps use pooled samples from weekdays and weekends collected in 2017 were compared to assess any changing pattern but no noteworthy differences were found fig 3 this may be due to the small number of samples investigated that were too limited to identify potential changes properly and thus future investigations should expand the sample size however the weekdays vs weekend comparison was also done for classical drugs measured in the same samples giving results in line with the known profiles of use fig 4 a and b increases during the weekends for mdma and cocaine i e be been et al 2016 kankaanpaa et al 2016 lai et al 2016 thomas et al 2012 zuccato et al 2016 but usually not for meth and amph kankaanpaa et al 2016 zuccato et al 2016 this boosts the reliability of the results also for nps which probably have less marked differences in their weekly profiles of use between weekdays and weekends for instance metc shows a constant profile of use during the week chen et al 2013 gonzalez marino et al 2016 tscharke et al 2016 and this was confirmed in the present investigation on the contrary in previous investigations meph and metl have shown an increase in use during the weekend chen et al 2013 gonzalez marino et al 2016 tscharke et al 2016 this was also seen here but only in porto portugal fig 3 3 5 comparison of the use of classical established illicit drugs and nps mass loads of classical illicit drugs were measured in the same samples to compare results and identify differences of use table 3 reports the means and ranges of the mass loads for each substance in 2016 and 2017 with the exception of pma mean mass loads of nps ranged between 0 2 and 4 2 mg d 1000inh thus resulting 20 to 50 times lower than classical illicit drugs such as cocaine expressed as its metabolite be or amph pma instead had higher loads up to 62 mg d 1000inh in 2016 at a comparable level with some classical drugs such as amph table 3 ketamine ket a dissociative anesthetic used in veterinary medicine and to a lesser extent in human medicine thus not classified as an nps was also monitored because of its illegal use as a recreational drug for its psychoactive effects emcdda 2002 ket use was lower than for the other classical illicit drugs and the mean mass load 5 2 mg d 1000inh was comparable to those of the nps in this study and to those already found in italy in a previous investigation castiglioni et al 2015 these results showed that with the exception of the phenethylamine pma which might be used at a similar level to amph the consumption of nps is normally much lower than classical drugs in the general population confirming observations from previous studies moreover among the 30 nps selected only a few were found in wastewater suggesting that many of them were not used anymore or were used at very low extent not detectable by wastewater analysis this in addition to the fact that several substances identified in 2016 were not found in 2017 confirms the changing patterns of these substances data provided by wastewater analysis are referred to the general population and complement the epidemiological information that is scanty for nps and mainly focused on specific populations e g festival attendees students and young people emcdda 2020 2015 unodc 2020 4 conclusions the present study demonstrates the suitability of wbe for investigating nps use in the general population as this approach was able to identify spatial profiles and temporal trends for selected substances in 14 european countries despite the limitations still related to monitoring nps in wastewater wbe can provide quantitative and qualitative information on the use of these substances in a population this is particularly difficult for other epidemiological tools such as population surveys because consumers often do not know exactly which drug or mixture of drugs they are taking this study gives information on the use of nps in europe confirming that it is lower than classical drugs but also highlights the changeable nature of the market and consequently of the profiles of use this is a useful contribution to epidemiological studies in view of the difficulties of following these rapid changes this study also highlighted the scattered nature of the current wbe information for nps at least in europe where studies so far have addressed different substances and few locations it would therefore be very useful in the next few years to implement large international nps monitoring campaigns e g yearly employing appropriate strategies for choosing a set of priority substances and monitoring them over time the best strategy for selecting nps will be the triangulation of different sources of information including epidemiological surveys forensic and toxicology analyses analysis of seized drugs and wbe results from previous studies despite its focus on a limited number of substances target analysis of selected priority substances has the advantage of providing qualitative and quantitative information on use facilitating comparisons among different areas for wbe studies on nps the main current limitation is related to the scant information on human metabolism that prevents back calculation of drug consumption as is done for the classical illicit drugs further studies in this field are required in order to help identify the best biomarkers of use parent drugs or urinary metabolites and refine wbe back calculation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17107,wastewater based epidemiology wbe can be a useful tool to face some of the existing challenges in monitoring the use of new psychoactive substances nps as it can provide objective and updated information this europe wide study aimed to verify the suitability of wbe for investigating the use of nps selected nps were monitored in urban wastewater by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms the main classical illicit drugs were monitored in the same samples to compare their levels with those of nps raw composite wastewater samples were collected in 2016 and 2017 in 14 european countries 22 cities following best practice sampling protocols methcathinone was most frequent 65 of the cities followed by mephedrone 25 of the cities and only mephedrone methcathinone and methylone were found in both years this study depicts the use of nps in europe confirming that it is much lower than the use of classical drugs wbe proved able to assess the qualitative and quantitative spatial and temporal profiles of nps use the results show the changeable nature of the nps market and the importance of large wbe monitoring campaigns for selected priority nps wbe is valuable for complementing epidemiological studies to follow rapidly changing profiles of use of drugs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wastewater new psychoactive substances monitoring europe spatial and temporal trends use profiles 1 introduction urban wastewater reflects the lifestyle of a population as it represents anonymous urine samples from thousands of people when an individual ingests a substance it can be excreted in urine or faeces as the parent substance or a metabolite and enters the urban sewage system wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a promising approach for estimating the use of a substance in a population by chemical analysis of urban wastewater for selected urinary metabolites biomarkers gracia lor et al 2017 wbe was developed to estimate the use of illicit drugs more than a decade ago zuccato et al 2005 2008 van nuijs et al 2011 and is now regularly applied worldwide to assess the use of cocaine amphetamine like stimulants and cannabis gonzález mariño et al 2020 with its advantage of providing objective and updated information on a population in a short period of time wbe is considered a new indicator of drug use complementary to the established drug monitoring tools emcdda 2016 wbe can be useful to tackle some of the challenges in monitoring the use of new psychoactive substances nps nps are an extremely heterogeneous group of substances originally designed as legal alternatives to the more established illicit drugs and they have challenged traditional approaches to drug monitoring surveillance control and public health response peacock et al 2019 these challenges include the large number of substances and the speed with which they enter and exit the market the lack of awareness of the exact content of nps products and their often unknown potency and effects peacock et al 2019 by the end of 2019 the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction emcdda was recording about 790 nps in europe emcdda 2020 and the early warning advisory ewa of the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc reported more than 950 nps worldwide unodc 2020 in europe the number of new substances identified for the first time reached a peak in 2014 2015 with 100 newly reported nps per year and dropped to 53 in 2019 emcdda 2020 the nps market is highly dynamic depending on the substances availability over time that may vary because of the changing laws i e when a substance from licit become protected illegal producers create rapidly an alternative substance with the same or similar effect nps are now increasingly manufactured and marketed as counterfeit prescription medicines or mixed with established illicit substances but their composition is usually mostly unknown emcdda 2015 surveys of self reported use and seizure data are not suitable alone to assess the prevalence of nps use and the current best option is to adopt monitoring systems that triangulate different information sources including forensic and toxicology analyses of human biological or drug samples peacock et al 2019 wbe can be used as a new additional tool to monitor nps use by the general population or in specific sub populations e g at festivals as for established illicit drugs benaglia et al 2020 bijlsma et al 2020 emcdda 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2020 the main limitation when assessing nps use by wbe is the very low concentration levels expected in urban wastewater because of the lower prevalence of use this in combination with the often unknown excretion pattern that hinders focusing on specific metabolic products and the large number of different substances that should ideally be investigated because they were recorded in the market bade et al 2019a bijlsma et al 2019 salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 makes monitoring nps use very challenging these limitations can be partially overcome using advanced analytical techniques based on mass spectrometry which reaches very good sensitivity for detecting a substance in wastewater even at trace levels and screening the presence of large number of substances hernandez et al 2016 some recent studies investigated urban wastewater for nps in different countries addressing a selected set of substances bade et al 2020 2017 gonzalez marino et al 2016 reid et al 2014 or screening hundreds bade et al 2019b diamanti et al 2019 salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 although relatively few substances were detected in wastewater at low levels few ng l literature did identify temporal trends of synthetic cathinones use in australia bade et al 2019a chen et al 2013 tscharke et al 2016 and spatial trends of use in three countries in europe gonzalez marino et al 2016 nevertheless most of previous studies were limited to a single country and very few cities as far as we know the present work is the most extensive monitoring study of nps use in the general population ever done through wbe and it was part of the nps euronet project funded by the european commission the aim was to test the suitability of wbe for investigating the use of nps in the general population in an extensive monitoring campaign this study covered two years in 14 european countries and 22 cities a selected number of nps including mostly synthetic cathinones and phenethylamines were quantified in urban wastewater to assess their spatial and temporal profiles of use the main classical illicit drugs amphetamine methamphetamine mdma and cocaine were analysed in the same samples to compare their levels with those of the nps 2 material and methods 2 1 compounds selection thirty nps were selected according to their frequency of citation in alert reports from the early warning systems of the emcdda and unodc the availability of analytical standards their reported presence in urban wastewater in previous studies and stability in wastewater the selected nps were 19 synthetic cathinones 7 phenethylamines 1 synthetic cannabinoid 1 tryptamine 1 aminorex derivative and 1 arylcyclohexylamine ketamine analog table 1 in total thirteen deuterated compound analogues of eleven nps plus amphetamine d6 amph d6 and methamphetamine d9 meth d9 were used as internal standards table 1 all the substances are parent drugs as for most nps the metabolism is unknown and very few analytical standards of metabolites are available furthermore the majority of the nps considered are synthetic cathinones that are mainly excreted as parent compounds uralets et al 2014 the main classical drugs were included in the analysis to compare their use and were amphetamine amph methamphetamine meth 3 4 methylenedioxy methamphetamine mdma ketamine ket as parent substances and benzoylecgonine be as the main metabolite of cocaine 2 2 chemicals and materials analytical reference standards of nps and classical drugs were supplied by lgc teddington uk cerilliant round rock tx usa and cayman chemicals ann arbor mi usa as 0 1 0 4 or 1 mg ml solutions in acetonitrile acn or methanol meoh working solutions containing either the 30 analytes or the 13 deuterated compounds were prepared in meoh before each analytical run and stored in the dark at 20 c up to two months reference standards of classical drugs were purchased from cerilliant round rock tx usa as 0 1 or 1 mg ml solutions in acn or meoh working solutions were prepared as described for nps hplc grade acn and meoh formic acid 98 hydrochloric acid hcl 37 and ammonium hydroxide solution nh4oh 25 were purchased from fluka buchs switzerland and carlo erba italy milli q water hplc grade was obtained directly from a milli ro plus 90 apparatus millipore molsheim france 2 3 wastewater sampling composite 24 hour raw wastewater samples were collected for 3 days over the weekend in 2016 and for 7 consecutive days in 2017 from wastewater treatment plants wwtp in different cities in europe the sampling period was march may in 2016 and may june plus one city in october in 2017 table s1 the sampling in 2017 was randomly stratified over four weeks taking one two samples per week to ensure better representability of samples ort et al 2014 each sample was collected as a daily composite sample and 0 5 1 l aliquots were received by our laboratory pooled weekend and weekday samples were prepared for analysis mixing fixed aliquots from each sample 50 100 ml pooled weekend samples were created by mixing aliquots from saturday sunday and monday and pooled weekday samples by mixing aliquots from tuesday to friday this design was adopted to optimize the analytical effort to achieve our objectives i e evaluate the use of nps and investigate their weekly pattern of use week weekend the investigation included 20 cities from 14 european countries 21 wwtps with approximately 6 9 million people connected in 2016 and 7 cities in 5 european countries 7 wwtps with approximately 3 4 million people connected in 2017 unfortunately the sampling capacity was not the same in 2016 and 2017 but five cities were included in both campaigns in order to follow the time trends weekend pooled samples from 2016 and 2017 were compared information on population size and wwtp characteristics including the daily flow rates are reported in the supplementary material sm table s1 the sampling scheme was designed according to best practice protocols castiglioni et al 2013 in order to limit sampling uncertainty to 5 10 samples were collected volume or time proportionally ensuring the collection of at least one aliquot per hour for substances with a low prevalence of use as nps sampling errors may be higher than for substances used more widely cocaine alcohol nicotine but this can be partially balanced by the large populations investigated which lowers the uncertainty ort et al 2010 2 4 chemical analysis the analytical method used to measure nps was adapted from a previous study gonzalez marino et al 2016 including additional substances samples were solid phase extracted and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms the analytical procedure and method validation are described in detail in the sm briefly 50 ml of wastewater samples were filtered and spiked with deuterated labelled internal standards to compensate for matrix effects and potential loss during analysis samples were acidified to ph 2 and solid phase extracted on oasis mcx 6 ml 150 mg cartridges waters milford ma usa to clean up the sample and enrich the concentrations of the target analytes cartridges were conditioned by washing with 12 ml meoh 6 ml milli q water and 6 ml milli q water acidified to ph 2 and were eluted with 2 ml of meoh and 2 ml of 2 nh4oh in meoh chromatographic separation was carried out at room temperature using an atlantis t3 100 2 1 mm 3 μm column waters milford ma usa and analyses were done with a triple quadruple mass spectrometer triplequad 5500 absciex concord ontario canada analytical parameters are reported in table s2 quantification was done using the isotopic dilution method with six point calibration curves prepared freshly before each analytical run instrumental and procedural blanks were included in each analytical batch to check for contamination for classical illicit drugs samples were prepared and analyzed using solid phase extraction spe and hplc ms ms as previously described zuccato et al 2016 2 5 method validation and quality control the analytical method was validated for accuracy precision linearity and sensitivity according to international guidelines united nation industrial development organization 2006 results are reported in table s3 recovery and repeatability of the analytical method were tested in raw wastewater n 3 by spiking 50 ml aliquots with 100 ng l of each analyte a non spiked wastewater sample was analysed as well to correct the recoveries for the background levels recoveries ranged between 75 and 116 with few exceptions and variability was lower than 14 table s3 limits of detection lod and quantitation loq of the whole method were calculated from raw wastewater samples as the values corresponding to signal to noise ratios s n of 3 and 10 respectively loqs were all in the low ng l concentration range 0 06 15 ng l table s3 2 6 mass loads and statistical analysis all instrumental data were acquired and processed using analyst 1 6 1 and multiquanttm 2 1 software ab sciex concentrations ng l were multiplied by wastewater daily flow rates m3 day to obtain the mass load of each substance the loads were then normalised to the population served by the wwtp to obtain the mg d 1000inh d day inh inhabitants which allowed the comparison of results for different cities normalised mass loads were used as an indicator of nps use per day in the population the back calculation normally done considering the illicit drug metabolism to estimate drug consumption castiglioni et al 2013 gracia lor et al 2016 was not done in the present study because of the lack of information on nps metabolism this currently impedes the development of specific correction factors for back calculation the comparison with classical drugs took account of the mass loads too without back calculation for a more realistic comparison 3 results and discussion 3 1 nps occurrence in urban wastewater table 2 reports the mean median and concentrations ranges of the nps quantified in the different cities only synthetic cathinones and phenetylamines were found in wastewater twenty six nps were searched in 2016 and 10 were detected 38 while 30 nps were targeted in 2017 and 5 were detected 17 metc was the substance most frequently detected as it was found in 13 cities 65 of the cities investigated and 8 different countries 57 of the countries investigated in 2016 and 6 cities 86 and 4 countries 80 in 2017 meph was also frequently found 5 cities from 5 countries in 2016 and 4 cities from 4 countries in 2017 table 2 meph metc and metl were the only substances found in wastewater in both years metc was also one of the substances found most frequently over the years in australia with a steady profile of use bade et al 2019a chen et al 2013 tscharke et al 2016 in europe it was found in previous investigations in italy and the uk gonzalez marino et al 2016 but not in croatia senta et al 2015 nps concentrations were generally in the low ng l range 1 20 ng l except for pma a phenethylamine that was found up to 100 ng l in 2016 pma was not found in 2017 but we detected another phenethylamine 25 ip nbome which was not identified in 2016 suggesting the variability of the nps market and the interchangeable nature of this group of psychoactive stimulants concentrations above 20 ng l were also found for meph and metl in 2016 up to 23 ng l and for meph in 2017 up to 60 ng l these levels are generally in agreement with previous investigations where nps were found at trace levels in wastewater but there were some differences among countries for some substances for instance α pvp was found in greece at similar levels to the present study while meph in greece was not detected borova et al 2015 in belgium pma was not detected but methoxetamine was detected very often kinyua et al 2015 in croatia metl and meph were found at lower levels than in the present study and mdpv was not found senta et al 2015 but it was found in china gao et al 2017 and in finland where the levels were quite high in a specific area kankaanpaa et al 2014 in previous european studies meph was found at the highest levels in the uk suggesting a decrease of meph use in that country bade et al 2017 castrignanò et al 2016 gonzalez marino et al 2016 and metl was found also in denmark bade et al 2017 results from the literature give only a snapshot of nps use in different countries because different substances were investigated over the years and studies mainly focused on single countries in view of the complex and dynamic market of nps it would be useful to apply wbe for repeated monitoring campaigns focused on a core group of relevant substances to identify temporal and spatial trends of use especially compounds that have an established niche market and or are highly potent 3 2 spatial profiles of nps use figs 1 and 2 reports population normalized mass loads mg d 1000inh of the nps found in this study detailed values are set out in sm tables s4 s5 the highest loads 30 mg d 1000inh were for pma in 2016 in novi sad serbia and bratislava slovakia fig 1 meph was second highest with considerably lower loads 8 8 mg d 1000inh in krakow poland and 5 mg d 1000inh in cluj napoca romania and ljubljana slovenia metc was the substance found most frequently but at lower mass loads with maximum values of 3 mg d 1000inh in bucharest romania and novi sad serbia fig 1 metl and α pvp were detected less frequently and were found only in ljubljana slovenia 5 5 mg d 1000inh and utrecht the netherlands 0 7 mg d 1000inh for metl and lugano switzerland 3 3 mg d 1000inh and porto portugal 0 3 mg d 1000inh for α pvp table s4 in 2017 fig 2 the highest loads were found for meph in krakow poland up to 11 mg d 1000inh and ljubljana slovenia 3 mg d 1000inh and for metc and buph up to 2 mg d 1000inh in all the places where they were found all the other substances detected butl 3 4 dmmc ethc mdpv pentl buph and 25 ip nbome were at levels lower than 1 mg d 1000inh and were found only in one city or country each table s5 meph was already reported in krakow few years ago 2012 where it was found in sewage effluents at comparable loads 3 6 7 1 mg d 1000 inh styszko et al 2016 in the same study 4 mec was also reported at similar levels 4 8 5 8 mg d 1000 inh but it was not anymore detected in this study generally the loads found in this study were similar to those in previous investigations in australia bade et al 2019a chen et al 2013 norway baz lomba et al 2016 uk italy and spain gonzalez marino et al 2016 china gao et al 2017 and greece diamanti et al 2019 nevertheless there are some interesting differences for certain substances such as pma that was found in this study at the highest levels ever found before but only in a few cities pma was reported previously only in greece up to 11 mg d 1000inh diamanti et al 2019 but not in belgium kinyua et al 2015 indicating a scattered profile of use metl was the first synthetic cathinone appearing in the market in europe in 2005 unodc 2013 and was found in europe at levels 10 mg d 1000inh in a few studies this study and baz lomba et al 2016 while an increasing trend was seen a few years ago in australia chen et al 2013 thai et al 2016 where it reached loads up to 40 mg d 1000inh mdpv was found at levels of 1 mg d 1000inh in italy this study and gonzalez marino et al 2016 australia chen et al 2013 and china gao et al 2017 but increased consumption was recorded a few years ago in finland where it ranged up to 19 mg d 1000inh kankaanpaa et al 2014 these results were confirmed by unusually high rates of mdpv related crimes and mdpv positive biological specimens from clinical sources in the same region emcdda 2014 kankaanpaa et al 2014 the ketamine analog methoxetamine was not found in the present study but was recorded in belgium about 1 2 mg d 1000inh kinyua et al 2015 norway 0 8 mg d 1000inh baz lomba et al 2016 and more recently in australia 1 3 mg d 1000inh bade et al 2020 and the uk up to more than 100 mg d 1000inh rice et al 2020 3 3 temporal trends of use of nps temporal trends were evaluated on the five cities investigated in 2016 and 2017 meph metc and metl were the only substances found in both years figure s1 and tables s4 s5 no major differences were seen between the loads found in the two years though there were differences for the single cities figure s1 the only exception was pma that was found only in 2016 and disappeared in 2017 indicating a potential change in the market use of this drug over the investigated period meph was higher in 2017 than 2016 in krakow poland and porto portugal and lower in ljubljana slovenia while metc was generally higher in 2017 except in bratislava slovakia metl was found only in ljubljana and loads decreased from 5 5 mg d 1000inh in 2016 to 1 mg d 1000inh in 2017 table s4 s5 meph mass loads in italy and uk resulted in lower levels than in previous studies gonzalez marino et al 2016 rice et al 2020 particularly in the uk where mass loads dropped from about 30 mg d 1000inh in 2015 to 0 5 mg d 1000inh in 2016 this trend was seen also in other countries such as australia where meph use peaked in 2010 2011 chen et al 2013 then dropped rapidly remaining very low in the next few years bade et al 2019a thai et al 2016 meph was one of the first nps to become popular in the market in the mid 2000s especially in the uk and ireland and its use increased for a few years 2008 2010 reaching the levels of mdma in the general population and cocaine among young people emcdda europol 2013 until it was put under control and its use gradually decreased emcdda 2014 no particular patterns of use have been identified so far in europe for other substances but an interesting trend was recently noted in australia where different substances were preferentially used over the few last years even if not always in the same area i e meph in 2010 2011 metl in 2012 2013 ethl in 2014 2016 and more recently bade et al 2019a pentl it would be useful to start periodic monitoring campaigns also in europe for a priority group i e those substances for which preliminary information is available in some countries in order to identify patterns of use better selecting this group of priority substances is not easy due to the high numbers of nps on the market and the speedy changes in their profiles of use but combining different information such as their presence in wastewater seizures epidemiological and forensic data will help to establish a list of selected substances a prioritization approach was proposed recently by our research group for selecting priority nps based on wide screening by hrms using a database of substances selected on the basis of their reporting frequency by the early warning systems of different agencies and previous detection in wastewater in several european countries salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 future strategies could make use of a first hrms screening using broad lists of compounds followed by triangulation with information from other sources to build up a panel of priority nps for target quantitative methods 3 4 weekly profiles of nps use pooled samples from weekdays and weekends collected in 2017 were compared to assess any changing pattern but no noteworthy differences were found fig 3 this may be due to the small number of samples investigated that were too limited to identify potential changes properly and thus future investigations should expand the sample size however the weekdays vs weekend comparison was also done for classical drugs measured in the same samples giving results in line with the known profiles of use fig 4 a and b increases during the weekends for mdma and cocaine i e be been et al 2016 kankaanpaa et al 2016 lai et al 2016 thomas et al 2012 zuccato et al 2016 but usually not for meth and amph kankaanpaa et al 2016 zuccato et al 2016 this boosts the reliability of the results also for nps which probably have less marked differences in their weekly profiles of use between weekdays and weekends for instance metc shows a constant profile of use during the week chen et al 2013 gonzalez marino et al 2016 tscharke et al 2016 and this was confirmed in the present investigation on the contrary in previous investigations meph and metl have shown an increase in use during the weekend chen et al 2013 gonzalez marino et al 2016 tscharke et al 2016 this was also seen here but only in porto portugal fig 3 3 5 comparison of the use of classical established illicit drugs and nps mass loads of classical illicit drugs were measured in the same samples to compare results and identify differences of use table 3 reports the means and ranges of the mass loads for each substance in 2016 and 2017 with the exception of pma mean mass loads of nps ranged between 0 2 and 4 2 mg d 1000inh thus resulting 20 to 50 times lower than classical illicit drugs such as cocaine expressed as its metabolite be or amph pma instead had higher loads up to 62 mg d 1000inh in 2016 at a comparable level with some classical drugs such as amph table 3 ketamine ket a dissociative anesthetic used in veterinary medicine and to a lesser extent in human medicine thus not classified as an nps was also monitored because of its illegal use as a recreational drug for its psychoactive effects emcdda 2002 ket use was lower than for the other classical illicit drugs and the mean mass load 5 2 mg d 1000inh was comparable to those of the nps in this study and to those already found in italy in a previous investigation castiglioni et al 2015 these results showed that with the exception of the phenethylamine pma which might be used at a similar level to amph the consumption of nps is normally much lower than classical drugs in the general population confirming observations from previous studies moreover among the 30 nps selected only a few were found in wastewater suggesting that many of them were not used anymore or were used at very low extent not detectable by wastewater analysis this in addition to the fact that several substances identified in 2016 were not found in 2017 confirms the changing patterns of these substances data provided by wastewater analysis are referred to the general population and complement the epidemiological information that is scanty for nps and mainly focused on specific populations e g festival attendees students and young people emcdda 2020 2015 unodc 2020 4 conclusions the present study demonstrates the suitability of wbe for investigating nps use in the general population as this approach was able to identify spatial profiles and temporal trends for selected substances in 14 european countries despite the limitations still related to monitoring nps in wastewater wbe can provide quantitative and qualitative information on the use of these substances in a population this is particularly difficult for other epidemiological tools such as population surveys because consumers often do not know exactly which drug or mixture of drugs they are taking this study gives information on the use of nps in europe confirming that it is lower than classical drugs but also highlights the changeable nature of the market and consequently of the profiles of use this is a useful contribution to epidemiological studies in view of the difficulties of following these rapid changes this study also highlighted the scattered nature of the current wbe information for nps at least in europe where studies so far have addressed different substances and few locations it would therefore be very useful in the next few years to implement large international nps monitoring campaigns e g yearly employing appropriate strategies for choosing a set of priority substances and monitoring them over time the best strategy for selecting nps will be the triangulation of different sources of information including epidemiological surveys forensic and toxicology analyses analysis of seized drugs and wbe results from previous studies despite its focus on a limited number of substances target analysis of selected priority substances has the advantage of providing qualitative and quantitative information on use facilitating comparisons among different areas for wbe studies on nps the main current limitation is related to the scant information on human metabolism that prevents back calculation of drug consumption as is done for the classical illicit drugs further studies in this field are required in order to help identify the best biomarkers of use parent drugs or urinary metabolites and refine wbe back calculation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17108,sustainable water management is one of the sustainable development goals sdgs and is characterized by a high level of interdependencies with other sdgs from regional to global scales many water assessment studies are restricted to silo thinking mostly focusing on water related consequences while lacking a quantification of trade offs and synergies of economic social and environmental dimensions to fill this knowledge gap we propose a nexus approach that integrates a water supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model scenario analysis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda to quantify the trade offs and synergies at the sectoral level for the capital region of china i e the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration a total of 120 industrial transition scenarios including nine major industries with high water intensities and water consumption under current development pathways were developed to facilitate the trade off and synergy analysis between economic loss social goals here the number of jobs and environmental protection with grey water footprint representing water pollution triggered by water conservation measures our simulation results show that an imposition of a tolerable water constraint a necessary water consumption reduction for regional water stress level to move from severe to moderate in the region would result in an average economic loss of 68 4 16 0 billion yuan 1 yuan 0 158 usd in 2012 or 1 3 of regional gdp a loss of 1 94 0 18 million jobs i e 3 5 of the work force and a reduction of 1 27 0 40 billion m3 or about 2 2 of the regional grey water footprint a tolerable water rationing in water intensive sectors such as agriculture food and tobacco processing electricity and heating power production and chemicals would result in the lowest economic and job losses and the largest environmental benefits based on mcda we selected the 10 best scenarios with regard to their economic social and environmental performances as references for guiding future water management and suggested industrial transition policies this integrated approach could be a powerful policy support tool for 1 assessing trade offs and synergies among multiple criteria and across multiple region sectors under resource constraints 2 quantifying the short term supply chain effects of different containment measures and 3 facilitating more insightful evaluation of sdgs at the regional level so as to determine priorities for local governments and practitioners to achieve sdgs graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords industrial transition trade offs synergy supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model multi criteria decision analysis mcda sustainable development goals 1 introduction in september 2015 193 members of the united nations adopted the 2030 sustainable development agenda united nation 2016 this agenda features 169 targets under 17 sustainable development goals sdgs in response to rapidly rising consumption demand resource scarcity environmental contamination and climate extremes with the commitments to implement those by 2030 nerini et al 2018 in aggregate these sdgs entail a roadmap to ensure human well being economic prosperity and environmental protection by tackling multiple challenges faced by humankind of which goal 6 sustainable water and sanitation is the one with high shares of trade offs and synergies with other sdgs on global and national scales pradhan et al 2017 these interactions emphasize the importance of water resources in determining the achievement of other sdgs szabo et al 2016 the worsening scarcity of water resources has become a threat to the sustainable development of modern society especially in some rapidly developing regions like india and china gosling and arnell 2016 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 zhao et al 2015 liu et al 2017 available water per capita in china is only 1 976 m3 in 2018 which is just one fourth of the global average gu et al 2017 ministry of water resources of china 2018 therefore water shortages have become choking points that potentially restrict economic production in china especially in the water scarce northern regions such as beijing tianjin hebei metropolitan region the so called capital region or jing jin ji region according to the latest statistics the capital region is feeding 8 of china s population 110 million inhabitants and producing nearly 10 of china s gdp with only 0 6 of total water availability 18 1 billion m3 in 2017 and the freshwater endowment per capita is only 165 m3 national bureau of statistics of china 2018 the imbalance between economic production and distribution of available water resources has hindered further sustainable development to alleviate water stress in 2012 the central government proposed the the most stringent water resource management system or so called redline regulations which is measured by the three redlines controlling national water use improving water use efficiency and reducing wastewater discharge to conserve limited water resources liu et al 2013 li et al 2020 as a result the capital region has put forward the jing jin ji integration strategy in response to this ambitious water strategy and rising water demand the state council of china 2015 the re evaluation of development options under the special consideration of water supply constraints was the key feature of this integration policy thus planning future economic development from a demand side perspective based on water endowment is a significant measure in this strategy available water resources assessments focus mainly on assessing the environmental status of water resources in terms of water quantity quality and scarcity impacts and rarely consider other environmental aspects liu et al 2017 to model and assess the interactions of economic activities and their impacts on water resources at regional national and global levels hydrological models and water footprint accounting are widely used hoekstra et al 2011 zhuo et al 2016 mao and liu 2019 qi et al 2018 xu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 a large bunch of global hydrological models forced by climate models greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and shared socioeconomic pathways have been developed and integrated to assess climate change impacts on water scarcity from an earth system sciences perspective schewe et al 2014 wada et al 2013 2017 prudhomme et al 2014 wang et al 2021 many scholars have also integrated hydrological models with human activities to assess the water footprint distribution and its contribution to the water scarcity at various spatial temporal scales within the framework of water footprint accounting since the concepts and methodologies of virtual water and water footprint were introduced hoekstra et al 2011 allan 1996 as a result hydrological models provide a comprehensive understanding on the mechanisms that shape the availability cycling and quality of water in geological and hydrological terms oki and kanae 2006 whereas the water footprint approach can be used for accounting water consumption caused by economic production and consumption mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 liu et al 2015 in addition considerable efforts have been made to simulate the impacts of water use the approaches for assessing the impacts can be categorized into three main categories indicator systems schlör et al 2018 system dynamic models zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and input output feng and hubacek 2015 feng et al 2014 or ecological network analysis wu et al 2016 yang et al 2012 for instance cai et al 2017 used a composite index approach to demonstrate the spatial temporal characteristics of china s water resource vulnerability to highlight key challenges of china s water resources wang et al 2019 introduced a comprehensive modeling framework based on system dynamic approach for integrated water resources management iwrm to provide users with social economic and environmental assessments from the perspective of basin scale water security in the bow river basin of canada furthermore many scholars have applied input output or ecological network analysis to calculate virtual water trade across regions and sectors and quantify the distribution or allocation of water use through complex economic activities zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 fang and chen 2015 guan et al 2014 hubacek et al 2009 despite previous studies have provided a solid basis for water resource assessments in endowment vulnerability and scarcity they have frequently ignored trade offs and synergies between protecting water resources and other sdgs this had led to a growing recognition that water underpins economic and social development without which it would be impossible to achieve other sdgs successfully bizikova et al 2013 for instance achieving water sustainability by reducing demand can lead to trade offs both in terms of economic output sdg8 12 and in terms of human well being sdg1 2 3 4 7 8 but might generate synergies with environmental protection sdg13 14 15 because of the interconnected nature of water economic development social issues and other environmental factors and the aspiration to improve them simultaneously quantifying the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental dimensions under water supply constraints is crucial the nexus framework has emerged to address the interactions between environmental resources and most recently the links among food energy and water systems through coupling network analysis life cycle assessment and footprint analysis to quantify water and other resource footprints at different scales liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 newell et al 2019 kurian 2017 white et al 2015 2018 castillo et al 2019 these methods help to show how these resources or impacts virtually flow through production and consumption networks wang and chen 2016 feng et al 2019 white et al 2018 but are unable to explicitly consider supply constraints and evaluate trade offs among different indicators some scholars have pointed out that the impacts of supply chain disruption may result in production bottlenecks influencing other sectors and regions via the reduction in the intermediate demands sahin and okuyama 2009 in turn this bottleneck could lead to cascading effects resulting from a decline level of activities across the supply demand chain for example hubacek and sun 2001 2005 developed a mixed input output io model featured by land supply constraints to evaluate how the changing economy and society of china affect water use and land use at the regional level representing provinces and hydro economic regions respectively liang et al 2016 proposed an integrated approach based on mixed io and linear regression models to estimate the overall economic effect and carbon emission under electricity rationing triggered by heat waves in shanghai china in general the quantification of the impacts of supply constraints and the associated trade offs and synergies are of primary importance in mitigating the vulnerability of modern economies however the existing literature has rarely evaluated such compound impacts under resource constraints often being limited by the chosen indicators e g galli et al 2011 more specifically the literature doesn t take into consideration spillover effects of supply constraints because the studied economy is typically in a closed rather than opening setting making it impossible to consider inter regional trade flows in the analysis actually the teleconnection of water consumption between producers and consumers accompanied by interregional trade is increasingly growing along with the expansion of trade cai et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 therefore a systematic accounting of water use along the supply chains and trade network will extend the opportunities for trades offs and synergies between economic social and environmental impacts among different trading partners from the perspective of production and consumption hubacek et al 2014 this means that there is an urgent demand for a unifying framework capable of capturing trade offs and synergies between water and other sdgs in a multi regional and multi sectoral setting this research aims to establish such a framework and demonstrate its utility in more detail we propose a nexus approach that integrates a water supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model scenario analysis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda to quantify the trade offs and synergies of economic social and environmental indicators under water supply constraints at the regional sectoral level we regard water resources as the bottleneck in the production system we selected china s capital region as our research area because of the severe water shortages in this region fig 1 first we developed 120 water constraint scenarios based on water stress level sectoral water intensity and economic importance in the region second we mixed mrio model with water supply constraints to calculate economic losses triggered by rationing water use in individual key sectors in the region and to estimate trade offs and synergies between social wellbeing unemployment and environmental protection grey water footprint reduction induced by water rationing third we introduced mcda to select optimal scenarios finally we explored sustainable development pathways of the capital region and the potential of this framework to inform and guide policy 2 materials and methods 2 1 water supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model the classic mrio model which takes the form of i a x f or x i a 1 f is a demand driven model that is the final demand f of the economic sector is an exogenous variable of the economic system that is predetermined by other factors consumer preferences government behavior etc outside the model accordingly a change of final demand δ f will lead to changes in gross economic output δ x a mrio model consists of a system of linear equations which describes the distribution of a region sector s product throughout the multi regional economy miller and blair 2009 this interdependence of regions and sectors makes the approach powerful for assessing the direct and indirect impacts of alternative policy selections across regions and sectors additionally the method can be used to deal with shocks and contingencies across the economy policy evaluation based on mrio analysis can supply new insights to the efforts on searching the most promising policy choice garcia et al 2020 to calculate resource consumption water energy land etc triggered by f we extend the standard mrio model with a diagonal of sectoral resources requirement coefficients matrix e then the sectoral change in resource consumption triggered by f can be calculated as follows 1 δ e e i a 1 δ f equation 1 is used to estimate the changes in economic social and environmental impacts induced by water rationing from consumption perspective we selected gdp loss to represent economic impact employment loss unemployment to represent social impact and grey water footprint reduction to represent environmental benefits the grey water footprint refers to the volume of freshwater that is consumed to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 thus the diagonal elements in variable e is value added per unit of gross economic output the number of jobs per unit of gross economic output and grey water footprint intensity respectively the standard mrio model assumes that economy adjusts to changes in spending patterns within a given year and all production activities are driven by final demand and fully endogenous that is to say supply is to be elastic in all regions and sectors perfectly and a change in final demand is sufficient to stimulate changes in production outputs and incomes across other sectors and regions however in this case the situation is obviously that water rationing sectors will not expand or shrink its output level automatically in proportion with changes in δ f equation 1 would provide multipliers that are unrealistically large due to an elastic supply response assumption thus a supply constrained mrio model may be appropriate for this study in which final demand for some region sectors and gross outputs for the remaining region sectors are specified exogenously this method is a technique that allows the estimation of economic impacts of exogenous changes originating from supply constraints such as those caused by strikes natural disasters pandemics such as the covid 19 trade barriers or resource shortages davis and salkin 1984 arto et al 2015 to illustrate supply constraints caused by water shortage we present a case of two regions i j with two sectors 1 2 products produced by each region sector can be merchandised as intermediate inputs or final products see table s1 table s1 can be expressed as a system of linear equations 2 x i x j z ii z ij z ij z jj 1 1 y ii y ji y ij y jj where z matrix is the intermediate use by sector k in region i and j yij is the final demand of region j for goods produced by sector k of region i xi is the total output of sector k in region i and vi is the value added of sector k in region i the input coefficients are a ij z ij x j 1 and equation 2 is rewritten as follows 3 x i x j a ii a ij a ij a jj x i x j y i y j then reordering equation 3 yields the following 4 i a ii a ij a ij i a jj x i x j y i y j in standard mrio analysis the gross output is assumed as endogenous variable and the final demand as exogenous equation 4 could be rewritten as follows 5 x 1 i x 2 i x 1 j x 2 j 1 a 11 i i a 21 i i a 11 j i a 21 j i a 12 i i 1 a 22 i i a 12 j i a 22 j i a 11 i j a 21 i j 1 a 11 j j a 21 j j a 12 i j a 22 i j a 12 j j 1 a 22 j j 1 y 1 i y 2 i y 1 j y 2 j we assume that some external shocks e g resources shortage pandemic etc happen in sector 2 of region j which will shrink the production capacity of the affected sector the initial impact of the external shock is the reduction in the gross output of sector 2 in region j subsequently this initial reduction will decrease the demand for goods from the industries supplying intermediate inputs to the constrained sector both directly and indirectly in this case the gross output of sector 2 in region j should be exogenous while the final demand is endogenous thus we rearranged equation 5 to leave the endogenous variables on the left hand side and the exogenous variables on the right hand side to obtain the following 6 1 a 11 i i a 21 i i a 11 j i a 21 j i a 12 i i 1 a 22 i i a 12 j i a 22 j i a 11 i j a 21 i j 1 a 11 j j a 21 j j 0 0 0 1 x 1 i x 2 i x 1 j y 2 j 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 a 12 i j a 22 i j a 12 j j 1 a 22 j j y 1 i y 2 i y 1 j x 2 j by arranging equation 6 we find the following 7 x 1 i x 2 i x 1 j y 2 j 1 a 11 i i a 21 i i a 11 j i a 21 j i a 12 i i 1 a 22 i i a 12 j i a 22 j i a 11 i j a 21 i j 1 a 11 j j a 21 j j 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 a 12 i j a 22 i j a 12 j j 1 a 22 j j y 1 i y 2 i y 1 j x 2 j finally this mixed mrio model with supply constraints could be expressed as follows 8 x no f co p k k 0 k n k r n k k i n k n k 1 i k k q k n k 0 n k k s n k n k f no x co the sub matrices in equation 8 are defined as follows p k k is the k k matrix that is extracted from the first k columns and k rows of matrix i a and represents the average expenditure propensities of the unconstrained sectors in the supply side the first k sectors are the endogenous and the last n k sectors are the exogenous ones r n k k is the n k k matrix from the first k columns and the last n k rows of a which is the average expenditure propensities of the non supply constrained sectors on the supply constrained sectors q k n k is the matrix from the first k columns and last n k rows of a matrix and represents the expenditure propensities of supply constrained sectors on the non supply constrained sectors s n k n k is matrix that is extracted from the last n k rows and columns of i a and it represents the average expenditure propensities among the supply constrained sectors f no is column vector of elements from y1 to yk which means the exogenous final demand for the unconstrained sectors in the supply side x co is column vector of elements xk 1 through xn which means the exogenous total economic output for the supply constrained sectors x no is column vector with elements x1 through xk representing the endogenous total economic output of unconstrained sectors in the supply side f co is column vector with elements yk 1 through yn representing the endogenous final demand of the supply constrained sectors n is the number of sectors in the io table and k refers to the number of water rationing sectors equation 8 can be easily converted in a difference form with δ x co x co 0 x co i e the constraint induced output reduction in comparison to that in the reference economy x co 0 without the imposition of the constraint which will be determined by the scenario calibration in section 2 2 and δ f no refers to the change of the final demand caused by exogenous water shortage mixed mrio model is embedded in an opening market allowing for imports from outside the region to compensate its shrinking final demand thus we assume that there is no exogenous change in the final demand for non constrained sectors δ f no f no 0 f no 0 meaning that f no remaining the same as in the reference economy f co 0 without the imposition of water rationing δ x no corresponds to the change in the economic output of the non water supply constraint sectors triggered by the indirect impact of the water supply constraint sectors δ f co represents the change in the final demand of the water supply constraint sectors finally we can calculate the impacts in economic social and environmental dimensions from production perspective based on equation 8 through pre multiply e by δ x no and δ x co hubacek and sun 2005 described how to formulate this model hubacek and sun 2005 2 2 industrial transition scenarios for evaluating water rationing across sectors the sustainability consideration in determining production under water supply constraint is that economic development should be aligned with the carrying capacity of local water resources trade allows local shortages triggered by water conservation to be offset to ensure livelihoods and to meet ecological water requirements the allocation of water resources across different economic uses is an important measure to inform demand side management thus industrial transition scenarios are designed to reduce water consumption in production activities in this study we defined water supply constraints as water consumption that must be reduced to mitigate regional water stress by one level in line with water stress index which is categorized based on the ratio of water consumption to water availability for human this index originate from hoekstra et al 2012 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 many previous publications has applied this index for their studies e g chouchane et al 2020 ma et al 2020 zhuo et al 2016 sun et al 2016 there are different methods to estimate the environmental water requirement regarded as 80 of total water availability is the simplest way hoekstra et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 several studies have shown that changes to the industrial structure have become the biggest decelerator in driving water consumption in some regions liu et al 2018 mi et al 2017 plank et al 2018 zhao 2019 cai et al 2016 for example zhao 2019 using structural decomposition analysis showed that structural change in the economy of beijing led to a reduction in water consumption by 21 between 2002 and 2012 thus we assume that 21 of reduced water consumption in tianjin and hebei could also be achieved through adjusting the industrial structure in the future zhao 2019 table 1 shows the step by step process of how we could obtain tolerable water supply constraints finally the tolerable water supply constraint translates into a reduction of the water consumption by 0 039 billion m3 2 of the total from the reference year economy for beijing 0 031 billion m3 2 of the total for tianjin and 1 143 8 of the total billion m3 for hebei see table 1 after determining the necessary reduction to achieve tolerable water constraints based on water stress levels in the capital region in the base year the next step was to determine the sectoral distribution of the reduction referring to the measures for industrial structure adjustment with energy conservation song and liu 2013 and available literature related to the water footprint at the sectoral scale we designed industrial transition scenarios zhao et al 2017 in order to mitigate the adverse impacts of water shortages on human health and well being tertiary sectors such as freight transport and warehousing hotels food and beverage places establishments would not be considered as water supply constraint sectors liang et al 2016 to maintain the safe and necessary functioning of urban systems the water supply to key sectors such as gas and water production and supply social services and wholesale and retail would not be rationed liang et al 2016 as a consequence the water constraints are mainly imposed upon agriculture and some secondary sectors our previous research results showed that some sectors such as agriculture food and tobacco processing and textile industries have higher water dependency in terms of direct water consumption and water footprint zhao 2019 zhao et al 2017 thus we identified the top five non service sectors with highest direct water consumption and water footprint as the water supply constraint sectors to calculate the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental aspects triggered by water shortage agricultural water consumption accounted for more than 60 of total water consumption due to the special production law of agriculture in form of evapotranspiration et during the whole growing period zhao 2019 which had a very large impact on water sustainability we regarded agriculture as a mandatory water supply constrained sector and other selected sectors as additional constrained sectors we allocated the water supply constraint see table 1 across the selected sectors according to their proportions of current water consumption in the total and then we calculated the direct decline of economic output caused by the hard water availability constraints based on water intensity per unit of economic output finally we developed 3 scenarios for beijing 5 scenarios for tianjin and 8 scenarios for hebei see table 2 and used a supply constrained mrio model to calculate the total economic loss across all sectors at the regional scale the combination of scenarios used to meet the imposed water supply constraint in the capital region could be b1 t1 h1 or b3 t4 h7 in table 2 consequently the total combinations that meet the condition were equal to c 3 1 c 5 1 c 8 1 120 fig 2 presents the flowchart of this evaluation procedure 2 3 optimal scenarios pathways based on multi criteria decision analysis mcda mcda helps balance multiple criteria in a structured way allowing different preferences for the criteria is particularly significant for policy decisions where many assessment criteria and even more frequently opposing views of different stakeholders coexist scholars have developed numerous mcda approaches for reviews see e g kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2009 in this research we adopted the most widely used multi attribute value theory mavt and multi attribute utility theory maut wang et al 2009 we set up three kinds of weights to assess the importance of each trade off and synergy in the context of the capital region priority to the social dimension 0 3 for the economy 0 5 for society and 0 2 for the environment priority to economic and social dimensions 0 4 for the economy 0 4 for society and 0 2 for the environment and equal weights 0 333 for each then weighted averages were used to evaluate the scenario rankings afgan and carvalho 2008 begić and afgan 2007 santoyo castelazo and azapagic 2014 and ishizaka and nemery 2013 provided detailed principles on these two methods the key equations are as follows 9 v s i 1 3 w i v s i 10 u s i 1 3 w i u s i where v s is the composite value function based on mavt representing the total performance score for scenario s w i is the weight for criterion i and three combinations of w i 0 3 0 5 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 333 0 333 0 333 were used separately in this study v s i is the ranking value that reflects the performance of scenario s on criterion i using a scale from 1 to 120 where 1 is the best option and 120 is the worst option correspondingly u s is the composite value function based on maut u s i is the simulated value of scenario s on criterion i which has been normalized between 0 and 1 where 1 is the best and 0 is the worst we selected the weighted average value as the threshold to evaluate scenario sustainability liang et al 2016 2 4 data sources to calculate the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental pillars at sectoral level based on equations 1 8 we need the mrio table water consumption labor input grey water footprint and value added or gdp in capital region and the rest of china roc see table s3 and table s4 we collected the provincial level mrio table for the year 2012 in china from mi et al 2017 and therefore we use this table as the reference economy the information was converted to 2010 constant prices for the focus of this research the provinces beyond the capital region were aggregated into rest of china region water consumption data came from the provincial water resource bulletin ministry of water resources of china 2012 zhao 2019 and zhao et al 2019 we distribute direct water consumption in 2012 to mrio sectors based on previous water survey data economic output and some technical assumptions the corresponding validation assessment and the works on how to distribute water consumption data to match with mrio sectors have been done by zhao et al 2017 and liu 2016 labour data for each sector at the regional scale were obtained from the china labour statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2013a the china statistical book national bureau of statistics of china 2013 and the china rural statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2013b we calculated the grey water footprint based on hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 and zhao et al 2016 which is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to an extent that water quality remains above agreed water environment standards the chemical oxygen demand cod and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n or nh 4 n discharge in wastewater were selected as water pollution indicators to estimate the grey water footprint for each sector the related data is retrieved from the environmental statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2013 and pollution census dataset editoral board of first pollution census 2011 sectoral value added gdp is obtained from mi et al 2017 2 5 limitations and uncertainties some limitations and uncertainties should be included when interpreting the results first our supply constrained mrio model accounted for trade flows across the three target regions and the rest of china but does not pay much attention to the evaluation of the spillover effects to international markets or other countries because such an extension goes beyond the scope of this research to carry out such a comprehensive extension along global supply chains a two tier mrio model that couples our mrio with a global mrio would be needed given that the focus of our research is on the impacts induced by water rationing at the capital regions and potential spill over to other regions in china rather than global regions we deem the national level mrio to be sufficient for the purposes of this paper second only one indicator was selected for each economic social and environmental dimension to show how the framework works in the future it will be straightforward to add more indicators reflecting different sdgs to extend our analysis using this framework third in this study we attributed regional invariant weights to economic development social well being and environmental enhancement it would be more policy relevant to assign weights for each criterion based on regional endowments and stakeholder inputs kumar et al 2017 cinelli et al 2014 fourth to some extent social wellbeing here number of jobs is tightly linked to gdp whereas other sdgs or social targets are less well captured by an input output framework fifth the chinese government publishes input output tables every 5 years our analysis is based on the economic structure in 2012 but the technical matrix and thus the production functions will gradually change over time trading patterns from 2012 cannot capture future trends but for the purposes of this paper it is sufficient to keep them constant to show the impacts supply constraints would have everything else kept constant it should be also noted that zheng et al 2020 constructed the 2015 china mrio table for investigating the regional determinants of china s co2 emission however the interpretation of this 2015 mrio table are done in the absence of provincial 2015 io tables and based on a minimization of an entropy function subject to constraints of many assumed relationships on production structure and trading patterns given the focus of our research on the response of the intra provincial industrial structure to water shortage and developing one integrated method framework to quantify economic social environmental trade offs and synergies under water supply constraints and its potential applications to support environmental policies such a purely calibrated 2015 mrio without the real intra provincial input output interactions across industries is not suitable for our research therefore we opted to use the best available mrio of mi et al 2017 and set the base year in 2012 it is worth noting that the exact data on which the application is based is not of major importance once better data become available these can be easily used to update the model and apply the framework in addition the selection of pollutants will have an influence on grey water footprint to some extent we select two common pollutants cod and nh3 n in the discharged wastewater as water pollution proxies to estimate the grey water footprints for each sector on the one hand this selection is largely determined by the fact that these two pollutants are the most frequently monitored and recorded in china and have been widely employed to evaluate surface water quality e g ma et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 guan et al 2014 on the other hand these two pollutants accounted for more than 84 of total discharged pollutants in agriculture industry and domestic sectors in 2012 national bureau of statistics of china 2013 finally the reduction of final demand in the region would inevitably lead to production increase in other regions to meet the demand the reduction within the region does not necessarily lead to an overall reduction in china because of outsourcing unless we know where the resources might be outsourced to and that region s economic structure technology and water use efficiency as well as associated pollution 3 results 3 1 economic loss employment loss and environmental gains by scenario and region fig 3 fig s1 and table s5 illustrate economic loss gdp loss employment loss unemployment and environmental benefit grey water footprint reduction triggered by hypothetical water supply constraints imposed on china s capital region the introduction of water rationing in agriculture scenarios b1 t1 and h1 would lead to the least reduction of gdp which was 1 67 billion yuan 0 90 billion within the capital region and 0 77 billion in the roc equal to 0 1 of beijing s gdp 1 15 billion yuan 0 67 billion within the capital region and 0 48 billion in the roc 0 1 of tianjin s gdp and 35 5 billion yuan 22 7 billion within the capital region and 12 8 billion in the roc 1 5 of hebei s gdp respectively in comparison the highest loss of gdp was from scenarios b3 agriculture electricity and heating power production t4 agriculture smelting and pressing processing of metals and h6 agriculture smelting and pressing processing of metals which were 10 8 billion yuan 3 75 billion within capital region and 7 0 billion in the roc equal to 0 7 of beijing s gdp 10 6 billion yuan 4 07 billion within the capital region and 6 56 billion in the roc equal to 0 9 of tianjin s gdp and 89 4 billion yuan 41 7 billion within the capital region and 47 7 billion in the roc equal to 3 7 of hebei s gdp respectively the differences in gdp losses by region between scenarios changed from 6 5 times in beijing b3 b1 to 2 5 times h6 h1 in hebei which indicates that the output response of non agricultural industrial products to one unit of water reduction was larger than that of agriculture and each manufacture sector had different extents of output response because of differences in production recipes and processes our results showed that water constraints reduced economic activities not only in the rationed regions and sectors but also in other regions and sectors across the supply chain upstream and downstream for example in scenario h6 53 of economic loss was from supply chain sectors freight transport and warehousing other services etc related to sector 1 agriculture and sector 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals thus an exogenous shock such as limits to water availability would affect the whole economy through supply chain linkages similar to economic loss only adjusting agricultural water consumption scenario b1 t1 and h1 would have the lowest impact on unemployment namely 0 11 million jobs 0 10 million within the capital region and 0 01 million in the roc accounting for 0 76 of total employment in beijing 0 04 million jobs 0 036 million within the capital region and 0 006 million in the roc accounting for 0 6 of total employment in tianjin and 1 43 million jobs 1 265 million within capital region and 0 17 million in the roc accounting for 4 2 of total employment in hebei in contrast the scenario b3 1 agriculture 22 electricity and heating power production 0 20 million t4 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals 0 14 million and h6 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals 2 04 million would lead to the largest losses in employment in this region the differences in job losses triggered by water rationing across scenarios by region changed from 1 4 times in hebei h6 h1 to 3 3 times t4 t1 in tianjin which were smaller than that of gdp because farmers accounted for rather large proportion of the total employment in terms of environmental benefits we found that scenario b3 1 agriculture 22 electricity and heating power production t4 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals and h6 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals contributed to the largest reduction in the grey water footprint with values of 0 25 billion m3 0 017 billion m3 within the capital region and 0 235 billion m3 in the roc equal to 2 0 of the total grey water footprint of beijing 0 27 billion m3 0 046 billion m3 within the capital region and 0 22 billion m3 in the roc equal to 1 9 of the total grey water footprint of tianjin and 1 83 billion m3 0 25 billion m3 within the capital region and 1 57 billion m3 in the roc equal to 5 8 of the total grey water footprint of hebei restricting only agriculture b1 t1 and h1 would have the least effect on environmental protection which was 0 03 billion m3 in beijing 0 02 billion m3 in tianjin and 0 45 billion m3 in hebei respectively the differences in environmental gains triggered by water rationing across scenarios by region varied from 4 times in hebei h6 h1 to 16 times t4 t1 in tianjin which were much bigger than in the case of gdp and social losses because of significant water pollution discharge in manufacturing compared with agriculture our results indicate that water rationing in sectors with high grey water footprints per unit of output such as electricity and heating power production smelting and pressing processing of metals and chemicals would have the largest contribution to grey water footprint mitigation 3 2 economic and social losses versus environmental gains by sector and region the heat map in fig 4 and table s6 show the average relative shares and absolute values in loss of value added and jobs and environmental benefits under water supply constraints at the sectoral scale in the capital region the economic losses vary from 36 4 or 24 9 billion yuan of the total value added in agriculture sector 1 to 0 4 0 27 billion yuan of total value added in nonmetal minerals mining and dressing sector 5 in the capital region the second largest ones are from other services sector 30 12 6 of the total value added with 8 6 billion yuan and smelting and pressing of metals sector 14 with 5 2 of the total value added 3 5 billion yuan at the regional scale agriculture contributed with 17 the greatest share to total economic loss in beijing 13 in tianjin and 41 in hebei respectively similarly the proportions of job losses ranged from 77 3 1 50 million jobs in agriculture to 0 07 0 0014 million jobs in other manufacturing products sector 21 of all jobs due to the water constraint the second largest ones are from wholesale and retail trade sector 26 3 8 and other services 3 at the regional scale agriculture still showed the biggest contribution ranging from 70 5 of all lost jobs in beijing 48 4 in tianjin and 79 6 in hebei respectively in terms of environmental benefits hotels food and beverage places sector 27 has the largest grey water footprint 0 541 billion m3 accounting for 42 5 of the total grey water footprint in capital region this ratio is 43 in beijing 36 6 in tianjin and 43 5 in hebei other services sector 30 and chemicals sector 12 show the second largest relative effects which are 12 8 and 8 3 respectively but sector 20 measuring instrument machinery for cultural activity office work manufacturing is the smallest one only 0 026 of the total grey water footprint yet when looking at distribution of costs and benefits some interesting patterns emerge damages to the economy and jobs are heavily concentrated in food related sectors agriculture food and tobacco processing sector 6 and service sectors wholesale and retail trade other services however the benefit to the environment is mainly due to sectors with heavy wastewater discharges hotels food and beverage places chemicals for example under the water supply constraints in our designed scenarios the resultant economic loss job loss and environmental gain in sector 30 other services in the capital regions as a whole will account for 13 3 and 13 of the total economic and job loss and the total environmental gain respectively by contrast the corresponding shares in sector 27 hotels food and beverage places will be 3 2 and 43 respectively this mismatch shows the hotspots of pollution as well as points for intervention at least costs considering impacts along the entire supply chain 3 3 industrial transition scenarios under water constraints fig 5 shows the boxplots of the 120 industrial transition scenarios under water supply constraints in the capital region the overall economic loss varies from 38 3 billion yuan b1t1h1 to 110 8 billion yuan b3t4h6 and approximately 70 of these scenarios have economic losses ranging between 50 billion yuan and 80 billion yuan industrial transitions resulted in an average economic loss of 68 4 16 0 billion rmb accounting for 1 3 of total gdp of the capital region national bureau of statistics of china 2013 in terms of unemployment job losses ranged from 1 59 million b1t1h1 to 2 38 million b3t4h6 with an average of 1 94 0 18 million jobs lost this value accounts for 3 5 of the region s total employment in 2012 national bureau of statistics of china 2013 meanwhile the reduction in total grey water footprint fluctuated between 0 49 billion m3 b1t1h1 and 2 34 billion m3 b3t4h6 which was nearly 5 times the difference between maximum and minimum values and the average reduction in the grey water footprint was 1 27 0 40 billion m3 approximately 2 2 of the total grey water footprint in this region 3 4 trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental dimensions fig 6 shows the 3 dimensional 3d scatter plot of the 120 scenario combinations this 3d scatter plot is designed to provide instructions on the future development pathway selection we found that water security has trade off relationships with economic growth and jobs and some measures induced by water conservation would bring about economic losses and increases in unemployment conversely synergic connections exist between water conservation policies and the grey water footprint for the capital region scenarios with sectors of agriculture food and tobacco processing and chemicals b1t1h1 b2t1h1 b2t3h1 yellow spheres in fig 6 etc would have less impacts on the economy than scenarios with the sectors of electricity and heating power production smelting and pressing processing of metals and construction b3t4h6 b3t5h6 golden spheres etc similarly some adjusted scenarios including food and tobacco processing b1t1h1 b2t2h1 yellow spheres etc would lead to fewer job losses than scenarios with the sectors electricity and heating power production smelting and pressing processing of metals b3t4h6 b3t5h6 golden spheres etc as for environmental benefit scenarios including smelting and pressing processing of metals electricity and heating power production and construction b3t4h6 b3t5h6 b3t3h6 golden spheres etc would mitigate the grey water footprint much more than scenarios with the sectors of food and tobacco processing and chemicals b1t1h1 b2t1h1 b1t2h1 b1t3h1 yellow spheres etc 3 5 optimal scenarios based on multi criterion decision aid mcda we applied the mcda framework to calculate a composite value as the evaluation index to measure the performance of each scenario in the context of economic social and environmental dimensions see fig 7 in mavt system the weighted average value was 60 5 and scenarios whose values were smaller than 60 5 were regarded as sustainable in the three dimensions in contrast scenarios with higher values were considered unsustainable our results show that adjusting the agriculture and food and tobacco processing sectors in beijing the agriculture food and tobacco processing or chemicals sectors in tianjin and the agriculture and electricity and heating power production in hebei would have a more positive influence on the development of the capital region correspondingly in maut system the weighted average value was 0 54 which means that scenarios with values greater than 0 54 were accepted as reference scenarios for future development and similar to mavt changing the shares of production in the sectors of agriculture food and tobacco processing electricity and heating power production and chemicals would be likely to have the lowest losses and the most environmental benefits based on composite values under two mcda theories these top 10 scenarios with regard to their performances in terms of economic social and environmental sustainability could serve as references for guiding future industrial transition policies 4 discussion we proposed a policy support technique that combines mixed mrio models with mcda theory to evaluate the consequences of water constraints and applied it to the largest urban agglomeration in china the capital region or the jing jin ji region on the one hand these results on the rank and magnitude of trades offs and synergies provide useful information for policy makers and planners to effectively identify priority policy selections and balance policy actions in line with policy considerations and value judgements kurian 2017 on the other hand our mixed mrio approach coupled with the mcda allows to evaluate not only the direct impacts of alternative policy options but also the indirect impacts induced by supply chain effects triggered by exogenous shocks e g resource shortage natural disasters emergency events etc which have more advantages than footprint accounting or system indicators in impact assessments liang et al 2016 eiser and roberts 2002 leung and pooley 2001 in comparison with the results simulated by a standard mrio model driven by consumption activities i e fig 4 figure s1 versus figure s2 and table s5 versus table s7 the mixed mrio model driven by production activities under the constraint of resource supply is able to provide a more realistic representation of structural interactions across regions and sectors in response to resource constraints and thus better facilitating the design of economic development pathways despite the persistent concern in the literature on water scarcity there has been a lack of development of simple and effective tools that can be used to clearly assess the losses and benefits caused by water conservation measures across economic social and environmental systems our research fills an important niche in water resource field agriculture is a crucial but high water demanding sector it mainly provides raw products wheat rice soybean cotton with low economic value added but manifests high water requirements compared with manufacturing industries for example in scenarios b1 b2 and b3 see fig 3 row 1 water rationing reduces the same amount of water consumption but gdp losses in b2 and b3 are bigger than in b1 because scenarios b2 and b3 include industries with higher gdp productivity per unit of water which means that the elasticity of economic output to water availability is larger in non agricultural sectors than for agriculture in other words reduction in value added from agriculture is lower than in other sectors under the same water reduction scenarios in addition agricultural production is labor intensive and approximately one third of the labor force is still engaged in agricultural work with low income farmers migrant workers in the capital region zhao et al 2019 as a result most of the unemployed population in the labor market triggered by water scarcity comes from food related sectors fig 3 shows that the job loss in agriculture accounted for about 80 of the total job loss in each scenario but the share of environmental benefit in agriculture is less than 10 of the total which means that the relatively small extent of economic decline triggered by water rationing in agriculture would lead to large fluctuations on the agricultural labor market and a smaller grey water footprint van arendonk 2015 there are also some opposite cases with small change in labor market but big change in grey water footprint in some scenarios e g b1 b2 t1 t2 h5 h6 these findings indicate that when social and environmental costs are excluded from water conservation planning policy makers are more likely to promote some water saving policies at the expense of job losses and unexpected environmental side effects and this result could be more pronounced in the agriculture sector because of its high water and job intensity a direct policy implication of this recognition is that although the adjustment in agriculture has the lowest impact on the economy the responses of social and environmental aspects should also be considered when policy makers propose water policy guidelines fig 7 shows the overall scores for each scenario with regard to their performance in economic social and environmental sustainability dimensions for guiding future industrial transition policies in the capital region it should be noted that we could achieve the goal of decreasing the water stress level to be aligned with the carrying capacity of local water resources based on a range of plausible pathways in other words there is space for the stakeholders to join the discussion on the calibration of criterion weights and to choose the most suitable scenario based on their needs for example beijing is on a pathway with an economic structure toward highly advanced services and away from the current water intensive industries thus the share of irrigation agriculture could be significantly reduced even close to zero entirely tianjin attempts to become a research center for manufacturing and a pilot region for financial reform thus some manufacturing with high water intensities and heavy pollutions will be replaced by some high technology industries hebei is treated as an important ecological conservation region with many natural parks surrounding the capital for this goal to renew heavy industries by upgrading production processes and modernizing the industrial base will become required in the near future to some extent the visualized presentation of the links between policy relevant requirements and the industrial transitions can better serve the knowledge co production process between scientists and decision makers in water demand side management our findings indicate that trade offs and synergies exist simultaneously in terms of economic development social well being and environmental protection when the economic system is constrained by water resource endowment water policies aiming to save water in agriculture will have limited effects on economic development but have negative and significant influences on social and environmental issues similarly shrinking economic output in the smelting and pressing processing of metals and construction sectors will have significant environmental values but reduced economic and employment benefits thus quantifying the interactions between water and other elements at sectoral scale is very important for water policy planning many water studies have been confined to sectorial silo thinking without considering the trade offs between multiple development indicators which has usually led to inefficient regulatory decisions and spillover and backfire effects leading to environmental and social problems elsewhere bizikova et al 2013 our research suggests that this well constructed nexus approach has great advantages on impact assessments and scenario selection and this approach could be a powerful and integrative technique for assessing the trade offs and synergies among multiple criteria under resource shortages or surpluses and for addressing the economic social environmental and physical contexts of resource systems to achieve more balanced solutions for policy makers and relevant stakeholders the proposed framework can also be applied to modeling potential impacts of supply chain disruptions from external shocks such as the current pandemic see also for similar modeling approaches guan et al 2020 and shan et al 2020 the outbreak of covid 19 caused by sard cov 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become the most disruptive viral public health event since the 1918 influenza pandemic a century ago giani et al 2020 some strict lockdown measures like travel restrictions quarantine closing caterings and entertainment places and social distancing are enforced by many governments with high infection rate and confirmed cases to slow down the spread of covid 19 guan et al 2020 this newly integrated toolbox with mixed mrio scenario analysis and mcda theory provides decision makers with the ability to assess short term supply chain effects of different containment measures to reveal how pandemic related economic losses will be reallocated along supply chains across regions and industrial sectors and quantify associated potential economic social and environmental impacts for instance travelling restrictions and closing public places restaurants pubs sports etc will bring about external economic shocks in several key service sectors directly then the impacts of these constrained sectors will be enhanced through complex supply chain linkages subsequently secondary impacts like unemployment and changes in air pollution water resources and biodiversity effects triggered by lockdown measures can be captured by this framework and allows quantification and comparisons between costs and benefits of various strategies the successful achievement of the sdg agenda is a pathway to respond to the global sustainability challenges in ensuring economic prosperity human well being and environmental protection and the attainment of sdgs will greatly depend on whether synergies can be leveraged and trade offs are minimized pradhan et al 2017 the un has established these sdg targets on the global scale however assessing these targets at the regional scale in a scientific way is more practical for local governments and practitioners our analytical framework can be one tool to assess trade offs and synergies of sdg targets at the regional level a coupling of this regional tool with national and global mrio models in a nested structure in future research would achieve more insightful national overviews and help determine priorities in supporting sdg targets the mixed mrio model results show the necessity of considering the impacts of the disruption triggered by water constraints on the supply chain across region sectors our results indicate that of the total economic loss triggered by the imposition of water rationing in the capital region 54 occurred in the capital region and 45 occurred in the rest of china we expect that our integrated approach can serve as a stepping stone for further research into the cascading relationships among food security energy consumption and environmental restoration in these fields the relative intensities of pressures trade offs and co benefits will depend on the scope of each analysis and the indicators used to measure the outcomes obersteiner et al 2016 we believe that the simplicity and the rich information provided by mrio models have advantages in contributing to coherent and comprehensive policy planning with due attention focused on economic prosperity resource security and social stability 5 conclusion this study proposed a novel approach that integrates supply constrained mrio model with multi criteria assessment to quantify the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental dimensions at the regional sectoral level with an application to the capital region of china we developed 120 industrial transition scenarios including nine industries with the high water intensities and water consumption under current development pathways we calculated economic loss job loss and environmental protection gains triggered by water conservation measures under each of the 120 scenarios then we employed mcda to select optimal scenarios the following conclusions were drawn 1 a tolerable water rationing in agriculture food and tobacco processing electricity and heating power production and chemicals sectors would result in the lowest economic and job losses as well as the largest environmental benefits to the region 2 the mcda procedure recommends 10 reference scenarios with regard to their economic social and environmental performance that can facilitate the design of future water regulation and industrial transition policies the visualized presentation of the links between policy relevant requirements and the industrial transitions can better serve the knowledge co production process between scientists and decision makers in water demand side management 3 this newly integrated toolbox allows to assess the short term supply chain effects of different crisis containment strategies to reveal how pandemic related economic losses will be reallocated along the supply chains across regions and sectors and potential other impacts and allows quantification and comparisons between the losses and gains of various mitigation strategies 4 this integrated approach could be a powerful policy support tool for assessing trade offs and synergies among multiple criteria under resource constraints and for evaluating sdgs at the regional level to determine priorities for local governments and practitioners author contributions j l d z l s o v k h and k f

17108,sustainable water management is one of the sustainable development goals sdgs and is characterized by a high level of interdependencies with other sdgs from regional to global scales many water assessment studies are restricted to silo thinking mostly focusing on water related consequences while lacking a quantification of trade offs and synergies of economic social and environmental dimensions to fill this knowledge gap we propose a nexus approach that integrates a water supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model scenario analysis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda to quantify the trade offs and synergies at the sectoral level for the capital region of china i e the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration a total of 120 industrial transition scenarios including nine major industries with high water intensities and water consumption under current development pathways were developed to facilitate the trade off and synergy analysis between economic loss social goals here the number of jobs and environmental protection with grey water footprint representing water pollution triggered by water conservation measures our simulation results show that an imposition of a tolerable water constraint a necessary water consumption reduction for regional water stress level to move from severe to moderate in the region would result in an average economic loss of 68 4 16 0 billion yuan 1 yuan 0 158 usd in 2012 or 1 3 of regional gdp a loss of 1 94 0 18 million jobs i e 3 5 of the work force and a reduction of 1 27 0 40 billion m3 or about 2 2 of the regional grey water footprint a tolerable water rationing in water intensive sectors such as agriculture food and tobacco processing electricity and heating power production and chemicals would result in the lowest economic and job losses and the largest environmental benefits based on mcda we selected the 10 best scenarios with regard to their economic social and environmental performances as references for guiding future water management and suggested industrial transition policies this integrated approach could be a powerful policy support tool for 1 assessing trade offs and synergies

industrial transition trade offs synergy supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model multi criteria decision analysis mcda sustainable development goals 1 introduction in september 2015 193 members of the united nations adopted the 2030 sustainable development agenda united nation 2016 this agenda features 169 targets under 17 sustainable development goals sdgs in response to rapidly rising consumption demand resource scarcity environmental contamination and climate extremes with the commitments to implement those by 2030 nerini et al 2018 in aggregate these sdgs entail a roadmap to ensure human well being economic prosperity and environmental protection by tackling multiple challenges faced by humankind of which goal 6 sustainable water and sanitation is the one with high shares of trade offs and synergies with other sdgs on global and national scales pradhan et al 2017 these interactions emphasize the importance of water resources in determining the achievement of other sdgs szabo et al 2016 the worsening scarcity of water resources has become a threat to the sustainable development of modern society especially in some rapidly developing regions like india and china gosling and arnell 2016 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 zhao et al 2015 liu et al 2017 available water per capita in china is only 1 976 m3 in 2018 which is just one fourth of the global average gu et al 2017 ministry of water resources of china 2018 therefore water shortages have become choking points that potentially restrict economic production in china especially in the water scarce northern regions such as beijing tianjin hebei metropolitan region the so called capital region or jing jin ji region according to the latest statistics the capital region is feeding 8 of china s population 110 million inhabitants and producing nearly 10 of china s gdp with only 0 6 of total water availability 18 1 billion m3 in 2017 and the freshwater endowment per capita is only 165 m3 national bureau of statistics of china 2018 the imbalance between economic production and distribution of available water resources has hindered further sustainable development to alleviate water stress in 2012 the central government proposed the the most stringent water resource management system or so called redline regulations which is measured by the three redlines controlling national water use improving water use efficiency and reducing wastewater discharge to conserve limited water resources liu et al 2013 li et al 2020 as a result the capital region has put forward the jing jin ji integration strategy in response to this ambitious water strategy and rising water demand the state council of china 2015 the re evaluation of development options under the special consideration of water supply constraints was the key feature of this integration policy thus planning future economic development from a demand side perspective based on water endowment is a significant measure in this strategy available water resources assessments focus mainly on assessing the environmental status of water resources in terms of water quantity quality and scarcity impacts and rarely consider other environmental aspects liu et al 2017 to model and assess the interactions of economic activities and their impacts on water resources at regional national and global levels hydrological models and water footprint accounting are widely used hoekstra et al 2011 zhuo et al 2016 mao and liu 2019 qi et al 2018 xu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 a large bunch of global hydrological models forced by climate models greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and shared socioeconomic pathways have been developed and integrated to assess climate change impacts on water scarcity from an earth system sciences perspective schewe et al 2014 wada et al 2013 2017 prudhomme et al 2014 wang et al 2021 many scholars have also integrated hydrological models with human activities to assess the water footprint distribution and its contribution to the water scarcity at various spatial temporal scales within the framework of water footprint accounting since the concepts and methodologies of virtual water and water footprint were introduced hoekstra et al 2011 allan 1996 as a result hydrological models provide a comprehensive understanding on the mechanisms that shape the availability cycling and quality of water in geological and hydrological terms oki and kanae 2006 whereas the water footprint approach can be used for accounting water consumption caused by economic production and consumption mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 liu et al 2015 in addition considerable efforts have been made to simulate the impacts of water use the approaches for assessing the impacts can be categorized into three main categories indicator systems schlör et al 2018 system dynamic models zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and input output feng and hubacek 2015 feng et al 2014 or ecological network analysis wu et al 2016 yang et al 2012 for instance cai et al 2017 used a composite index approach to demonstrate the spatial temporal characteristics of china s water resource vulnerability to highlight key challenges of china s water resources wang et al 2019 introduced a comprehensive modeling framework based on system dynamic approach for integrated water resources management iwrm to provide users with social economic and environmental assessments from the perspective of basin scale water security in the bow river basin of canada furthermore many scholars have applied input output or ecological network analysis to calculate virtual water trade across regions and sectors and quantify the distribution or allocation of water use through complex economic activities zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 fang and chen 2015 guan et al 2014 hubacek et al 2009 despite previous studies have provided a solid basis for water resource assessments in endowment vulnerability and scarcity they have frequently ignored trade offs and synergies between protecting water resources and other sdgs this had led to a growing recognition that water underpins economic and social development without which it would be impossible to achieve other sdgs successfully bizikova et al 2013 for instance achieving water sustainability by reducing demand can lead to trade offs both in terms of economic output sdg8 12 and in terms of human well being sdg1 2 3 4 7 8 but might generate synergies with environmental protection sdg13 14 15 because of the interconnected nature of water economic development social issues and other environmental factors and the aspiration to improve them simultaneously quantifying the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental dimensions under water supply constraints is crucial the nexus framework has emerged to address the interactions between environmental resources and most recently the links among food energy and water systems through coupling network analysis life cycle assessment and footprint analysis to quantify water and other resource footprints at different scales liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 newell et al 2019 kurian 2017 white et al 2015 2018 castillo et al 2019 these methods help to show how these resources or impacts virtually flow through production and consumption networks wang and chen 2016 feng et al 2019 white et al 2018 but are unable to explicitly consider supply constraints and evaluate trade offs among different indicators some scholars have pointed out that the impacts of supply chain disruption may result in production bottlenecks influencing other sectors and regions via the reduction in the intermediate demands sahin and okuyama 2009 in turn this bottleneck could lead to cascading effects resulting from a decline level of activities across the supply demand chain for example hubacek and sun 2001 2005 developed a mixed input output io model featured by land supply constraints to evaluate how the changing economy and society of china affect water use and land use at the regional level representing provinces and hydro economic regions respectively liang et al 2016 proposed an integrated approach based on mixed io and linear regression models to estimate the overall economic effect and carbon emission under electricity rationing triggered by heat waves in shanghai china in general the quantification of the impacts of supply constraints and the associated trade offs and synergies are of primary importance in mitigating the vulnerability of modern economies however the existing literature has rarely evaluated such compound impacts under resource constraints often being limited by the chosen indicators e g galli et al 2011 more specifically the literature doesn t take into consideration spillover effects of supply constraints because the studied economy is typically in a closed rather than opening setting making it impossible to consider inter regional trade flows in the analysis actually the teleconnection of water consumption between producers and consumers accompanied by interregional trade is increasingly growing along with the expansion of trade cai et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 therefore a systematic accounting of water use along the supply chains and trade network will extend the opportunities for trades offs and synergies between economic social and environmental impacts among different trading partners from the perspective of production and consumption hubacek et al 2014 this means that there is an urgent demand for a unifying framework capable of capturing trade offs and synergies between water and other sdgs in a multi regional and multi sectoral setting this research aims to establish such a framework and demonstrate its utility in more detail we propose a nexus approach that integrates a water supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model scenario analysis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda to quantify the trade offs and synergies of economic social and environmental indicators under water supply constraints at the regional sectoral level we regard water resources as the bottleneck in the production system we selected china s capital region as our research area because of the severe water shortages in this region fig 1 first we developed 120 water constraint scenarios based on water stress level sectoral water intensity and economic importance in the region second we mixed mrio model with water supply constraints to calculate economic losses triggered by rationing water use in individual key sectors in the region and to estimate trade offs and synergies between social wellbeing unemployment and environmental protection grey water footprint reduction induced by water rationing third we introduced mcda to select optimal scenarios finally we explored sustainable development pathways of the capital region and the potential of this framework to inform and guide policy 2 materials and methods 2 1 water supply constrained multi regional input output mixed mrio model the classic mrio model which takes the form of i a x f or x i a 1 f is a demand driven model that is the final demand f of the economic sector is an exogenous variable of the economic system that is predetermined by other factors consumer preferences government behavior etc outside the model accordingly a change of final demand δ f will lead to changes in gross economic output δ x a mrio model consists of a system of linear equations which describes the distribution of a region sector s product throughout the multi regional economy miller and blair 2009 this interdependence of regions and sectors makes the approach powerful for assessing the direct and indirect impacts of alternative policy selections across regions and sectors additionally the method can be used to deal with shocks and contingencies across the economy policy evaluation based on mrio analysis can supply new insights to the efforts on searching the most promising policy choice garcia et al 2020 to calculate resource consumption water energy land etc triggered by f we extend the standard mrio model with a diagonal of sectoral resources requirement coefficients matrix e then the sectoral change in resource consumption triggered by f can be calculated as follows 1 δ e e i a 1 δ f equation 1 is used to estimate the changes in economic social and environmental impacts induced by water rationing from consumption perspective we selected gdp loss to represent economic impact employment loss unemployment to represent social impact and grey water footprint reduction to represent environmental benefits the grey water footprint refers to the volume of freshwater that is consumed to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 thus the diagonal elements in variable e is value added per unit of gross economic output the number of jobs per unit of gross economic output and grey water footprint intensity respectively the standard mrio model assumes that economy adjusts to changes in spending patterns within a given year and all production activities are driven by final demand and fully endogenous that is to say supply is to be elastic in all regions and sectors perfectly and a change in final demand is sufficient to stimulate changes in production outputs and incomes across other sectors and regions however in this case the situation is obviously that water rationing sectors will not expand or shrink its output level automatically in proportion with changes in δ f equation 1 would provide multipliers that are unrealistically large due to an elastic supply response assumption thus a supply constrained mrio model may be appropriate for this study in which final demand for some region sectors and gross outputs for the remaining region sectors are specified exogenously this method is a technique that allows the estimation of economic impacts of exogenous changes originating from supply constraints such as those caused by strikes natural disasters pandemics such as the covid 19 trade barriers or resource shortages davis and salkin 1984 arto et al 2015 to illustrate supply constraints caused by water shortage we present a case of two regions i j with two sectors 1 2 products produced by each region sector can be merchandised as intermediate inputs or final products see table s1 table s1 can be expressed as a system of linear equations 2 x i x j z ii z ij z ij z jj 1 1 y ii y ji y ij y jj where z matrix is the intermediate use by sector k in region i and j yij is the final demand of region j for goods produced by sector k of region i xi is the total output of sector k in region i and vi is the value added of sector k in region i the input coefficients are a ij z ij x j 1 and equation 2 is rewritten as follows 3 x i x j a ii a ij a ij a jj x i x j y i y j then reordering equation 3 yields the following 4 i a ii a ij a ij i a jj x i x j y i y j in standard mrio analysis the gross output is assumed as endogenous variable and the final demand as exogenous equation 4 could be rewritten as follows 5 x 1 i x 2 i x 1 j x 2 j 1 a 11 i i a 21 i i a 11 j i a 21 j i a 12 i i 1 a 22 i i a 12 j i a 22 j i a 11 i j a 21 i j 1 a 11 j j a 21 j j a 12 i j a 22 i j a 12 j j 1 a 22 j j 1 y 1 i y 2 i y 1 j y 2 j we assume that some external shocks e g resources shortage pandemic etc happen in sector 2 of region j which will shrink the production capacity of the affected sector the initial impact of the external shock is the reduction in the gross output of sector 2 in region j subsequently this initial reduction will decrease the demand for goods from the industries supplying intermediate inputs to the constrained sector both directly and indirectly in this case the gross output of sector 2 in region j should be exogenous while the final demand is endogenous thus we rearranged equation 5 to leave the endogenous variables on the left hand side and the exogenous variables on the right hand side to obtain the following 6 1 a 11 i i a 21 i i a 11 j i a 21 j i a 12 i i 1 a 22 i i a 12 j i a 22 j i a 11 i j a 21 i j 1 a 11 j j a 21 j j 0 0 0 1 x 1 i x 2 i x 1 j y 2 j 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 a 12 i j a 22 i j a 12 j j 1 a 22 j j y 1 i y 2 i y 1 j x 2 j by arranging equation 6 we find the following 7 x 1 i x 2 i x 1 j y 2 j 1 a 11 i i a 21 i i a 11 j i a 21 j i a 12 i i 1 a 22 i i a 12 j i a 22 j i a 11 i j a 21 i j 1 a 11 j j a 21 j j 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 a 12 i j a 22 i j a 12 j j 1 a 22 j j y 1 i y 2 i y 1 j x 2 j finally this mixed mrio model with supply constraints could be expressed as follows 8 x no f co p k k 0 k n k r n k k i n k n k 1 i k k q k n k 0 n k k s n k n k f no x co the sub matrices in equation 8 are defined as follows p k k is the k k matrix that is extracted from the first k columns and k rows of matrix i a and represents the average expenditure propensities of the unconstrained sectors in the supply side the first k sectors are the endogenous and the last n k sectors are the exogenous ones r n k k is the n k k matrix from the first k columns and the last n k rows of a which is the average expenditure propensities of the non supply constrained sectors on the supply constrained sectors q k n k is the matrix from the first k columns and last n k rows of a matrix and represents the expenditure propensities of supply constrained sectors on the non supply constrained sectors s n k n k is matrix that is extracted from the last n k rows and columns of i a and it represents the average expenditure propensities among the supply constrained sectors f no is column vector of elements from y1 to yk which means the exogenous final demand for the unconstrained sectors in the supply side x co is column vector of elements xk 1 through xn which means the exogenous total economic output for the supply constrained sectors x no is column vector with elements x1 through xk representing the endogenous total economic output of unconstrained sectors in the supply side f co is column vector with elements yk 1 through yn representing the endogenous final demand of the supply constrained sectors n is the number of sectors in the io table and k refers to the number of water rationing sectors equation 8 can be easily converted in a difference form with δ x co x co 0 x co i e the constraint induced output reduction in comparison to that in the reference economy x co 0 without the imposition of the constraint which will be determined by the scenario calibration in section 2 2 and δ f no refers to the change of the final demand caused by exogenous water shortage mixed mrio model is embedded in an opening market allowing for imports from outside the region to compensate its shrinking final demand thus we assume that there is no exogenous change in the final demand for non constrained sectors δ f no f no 0 f no 0 meaning that f no remaining the same as in the reference economy f co 0 without the imposition of water rationing δ x no corresponds to the change in the economic output of the non water supply constraint sectors triggered by the indirect impact of the water supply constraint sectors δ f co represents the change in the final demand of the water supply constraint sectors finally we can calculate the impacts in economic social and environmental dimensions from production perspective based on equation 8 through pre multiply e by δ x no and δ x co hubacek and sun 2005 described how to formulate this model hubacek and sun 2005 2 2 industrial transition scenarios for evaluating water rationing across sectors the sustainability consideration in determining production under water supply constraint is that economic development should be aligned with the carrying capacity of local water resources trade allows local shortages triggered by water conservation to be offset to ensure livelihoods and to meet ecological water requirements the allocation of water resources across different economic uses is an important measure to inform demand side management thus industrial transition scenarios are designed to reduce water consumption in production activities in this study we defined water supply constraints as water consumption that must be reduced to mitigate regional water stress by one level in line with water stress index which is categorized based on the ratio of water consumption to water availability for human this index originate from hoekstra et al 2012 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 many previous publications has applied this index for their studies e g chouchane et al 2020 ma et al 2020 zhuo et al 2016 sun et al 2016 there are different methods to estimate the environmental water requirement regarded as 80 of total water availability is the simplest way hoekstra et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 several studies have shown that changes to the industrial structure have become the biggest decelerator in driving water consumption in some regions liu et al 2018 mi et al 2017 plank et al 2018 zhao 2019 cai et al 2016 for example zhao 2019 using structural decomposition analysis showed that structural change in the economy of beijing led to a reduction in water consumption by 21 between 2002 and 2012 thus we assume that 21 of reduced water consumption in tianjin and hebei could also be achieved through adjusting the industrial structure in the future zhao 2019 table 1 shows the step by step process of how we could obtain tolerable water supply constraints finally the tolerable water supply constraint translates into a reduction of the water consumption by 0 039 billion m3 2 of the total from the reference year economy for beijing 0 031 billion m3 2 of the total for tianjin and 1 143 8 of the total billion m3 for hebei see table 1 after determining the necessary reduction to achieve tolerable water constraints based on water stress levels in the capital region in the base year the next step was to determine the sectoral distribution of the reduction referring to the measures for industrial structure adjustment with energy conservation song and liu 2013 and available literature related to the water footprint at the sectoral scale we designed industrial transition scenarios zhao et al 2017 in order to mitigate the adverse impacts of water shortages on human health and well being tertiary sectors such as freight transport and warehousing hotels food and beverage places establishments would not be considered as water supply constraint sectors liang et al 2016 to maintain the safe and necessary functioning of urban systems the water supply to key sectors such as gas and water production and supply social services and wholesale and retail would not be rationed liang et al 2016 as a consequence the water constraints are mainly imposed upon agriculture and some secondary sectors our previous research results showed that some sectors such as agriculture food and tobacco processing and textile industries have higher water dependency in terms of direct water consumption and water footprint zhao 2019 zhao et al 2017 thus we identified the top five non service sectors with highest direct water consumption and water footprint as the water supply constraint sectors to calculate the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental aspects triggered by water shortage agricultural water consumption accounted for more than 60 of total water consumption due to the special production law of agriculture in form of evapotranspiration et during the whole growing period zhao 2019 which had a very large impact on water sustainability we regarded agriculture as a mandatory water supply constrained sector and other selected sectors as additional constrained sectors we allocated the water supply constraint see table 1 across the selected sectors according to their proportions of current water consumption in the total and then we calculated the direct decline of economic output caused by the hard water availability constraints based on water intensity per unit of economic output finally we developed 3 scenarios for beijing 5 scenarios for tianjin and 8 scenarios for hebei see table 2 and used a supply constrained mrio model to calculate the total economic loss across all sectors at the regional scale the combination of scenarios used to meet the imposed water supply constraint in the capital region could be b1 t1 h1 or b3 t4 h7 in table 2 consequently the total combinations that meet the condition were equal to c 3 1 c 5 1 c 8 1 120 fig 2 presents the flowchart of this evaluation procedure 2 3 optimal scenarios pathways based on multi criteria decision analysis mcda mcda helps balance multiple criteria in a structured way allowing different preferences for the criteria is particularly significant for policy decisions where many assessment criteria and even more frequently opposing views of different stakeholders coexist scholars have developed numerous mcda approaches for reviews see e g kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2009 in this research we adopted the most widely used multi attribute value theory mavt and multi attribute utility theory maut wang et al 2009 we set up three kinds of weights to assess the importance of each trade off and synergy in the context of the capital region priority to the social dimension 0 3 for the economy 0 5 for society and 0 2 for the environment priority to economic and social dimensions 0 4 for the economy 0 4 for society and 0 2 for the environment and equal weights 0 333 for each then weighted averages were used to evaluate the scenario rankings afgan and carvalho 2008 begić and afgan 2007 santoyo castelazo and azapagic 2014 and ishizaka and nemery 2013 provided detailed principles on these two methods the key equations are as follows 9 v s i 1 3 w i v s i 10 u s i 1 3 w i u s i where v s is the composite value function based on mavt representing the total performance score for scenario s w i is the weight for criterion i and three combinations of w i 0 3 0 5 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 333 0 333 0 333 were used separately in this study v s i is the ranking value that reflects the performance of scenario s on criterion i using a scale from 1 to 120 where 1 is the best option and 120 is the worst option correspondingly u s is the composite value function based on maut u s i is the simulated value of scenario s on criterion i which has been normalized between 0 and 1 where 1 is the best and 0 is the worst we selected the weighted average value as the threshold to evaluate scenario sustainability liang et al 2016 2 4 data sources to calculate the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental pillars at sectoral level based on equations 1 8 we need the mrio table water consumption labor input grey water footprint and value added or gdp in capital region and the rest of china roc see table s3 and table s4 we collected the provincial level mrio table for the year 2012 in china from mi et al 2017 and therefore we use this table as the reference economy the information was converted to 2010 constant prices for the focus of this research the provinces beyond the capital region were aggregated into rest of china region water consumption data came from the provincial water resource bulletin ministry of water resources of china 2012 zhao 2019 and zhao et al 2019 we distribute direct water consumption in 2012 to mrio sectors based on previous water survey data economic output and some technical assumptions the corresponding validation assessment and the works on how to distribute water consumption data to match with mrio sectors have been done by zhao et al 2017 and liu 2016 labour data for each sector at the regional scale were obtained from the china labour statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2013a the china statistical book national bureau of statistics of china 2013 and the china rural statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2013b we calculated the grey water footprint based on hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 and zhao et al 2016 which is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to an extent that water quality remains above agreed water environment standards the chemical oxygen demand cod and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n or nh 4 n discharge in wastewater were selected as water pollution indicators to estimate the grey water footprint for each sector the related data is retrieved from the environmental statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2013 and pollution census dataset editoral board of first pollution census 2011 sectoral value added gdp is obtained from mi et al 2017 2 5 limitations and uncertainties some limitations and uncertainties should be included when interpreting the results first our supply constrained mrio model accounted for trade flows across the three target regions and the rest of china but does not pay much attention to the evaluation of the spillover effects to international markets or other countries because such an extension goes beyond the scope of this research to carry out such a comprehensive extension along global supply chains a two tier mrio model that couples our mrio with a global mrio would be needed given that the focus of our research is on the impacts induced by water rationing at the capital regions and potential spill over to other regions in china rather than global regions we deem the national level mrio to be sufficient for the purposes of this paper second only one indicator was selected for each economic social and environmental dimension to show how the framework works in the future it will be straightforward to add more indicators reflecting different sdgs to extend our analysis using this framework third in this study we attributed regional invariant weights to economic development social well being and environmental enhancement it would be more policy relevant to assign weights for each criterion based on regional endowments and stakeholder inputs kumar et al 2017 cinelli et al 2014 fourth to some extent social wellbeing here number of jobs is tightly linked to gdp whereas other sdgs or social targets are less well captured by an input output framework fifth the chinese government publishes input output tables every 5 years our analysis is based on the economic structure in 2012 but the technical matrix and thus the production functions will gradually change over time trading patterns from 2012 cannot capture future trends but for the purposes of this paper it is sufficient to keep them constant to show the impacts supply constraints would have everything else kept constant it should be also noted that zheng et al 2020 constructed the 2015 china mrio table for investigating the regional determinants of china s co2 emission however the interpretation of this 2015 mrio table are done in the absence of provincial 2015 io tables and based on a minimization of an entropy function subject to constraints of many assumed relationships on production structure and trading patterns given the focus of our research on the response of the intra provincial industrial structure to water shortage and developing one integrated method framework to quantify economic social environmental trade offs and synergies under water supply constraints and its potential applications to support environmental policies such a purely calibrated 2015 mrio without the real intra provincial input output interactions across industries is not suitable for our research therefore we opted to use the best available mrio of mi et al 2017 and set the base year in 2012 it is worth noting that the exact data on which the application is based is not of major importance once better data become available these can be easily used to update the model and apply the framework in addition the selection of pollutants will have an influence on grey water footprint to some extent we select two common pollutants cod and nh3 n in the discharged wastewater as water pollution proxies to estimate the grey water footprints for each sector on the one hand this selection is largely determined by the fact that these two pollutants are the most frequently monitored and recorded in china and have been widely employed to evaluate surface water quality e g ma et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 guan et al 2014 on the other hand these two pollutants accounted for more than 84 of total discharged pollutants in agriculture industry and domestic sectors in 2012 national bureau of statistics of china 2013 finally the reduction of final demand in the region would inevitably lead to production increase in other regions to meet the demand the reduction within the region does not necessarily lead to an overall reduction in china because of outsourcing unless we know where the resources might be outsourced to and that region s economic structure technology and water use efficiency as well as associated pollution 3 results 3 1 economic loss employment loss and environmental gains by scenario and region fig 3 fig s1 and table s5 illustrate economic loss gdp loss employment loss unemployment and environmental benefit grey water footprint reduction triggered by hypothetical water supply constraints imposed on china s capital region the introduction of water rationing in agriculture scenarios b1 t1 and h1 would lead to the least reduction of gdp which was 1 67 billion yuan 0 90 billion within the capital region and 0 77 billion in the roc equal to 0 1 of beijing s gdp 1 15 billion yuan 0 67 billion within the capital region and 0 48 billion in the roc 0 1 of tianjin s gdp and 35 5 billion yuan 22 7 billion within the capital region and 12 8 billion in the roc 1 5 of hebei s gdp respectively in comparison the highest loss of gdp was from scenarios b3 agriculture electricity and heating power production t4 agriculture smelting and pressing processing of metals and h6 agriculture smelting and pressing processing of metals which were 10 8 billion yuan 3 75 billion within capital region and 7 0 billion in the roc equal to 0 7 of beijing s gdp 10 6 billion yuan 4 07 billion within the capital region and 6 56 billion in the roc equal to 0 9 of tianjin s gdp and 89 4 billion yuan 41 7 billion within the capital region and 47 7 billion in the roc equal to 3 7 of hebei s gdp respectively the differences in gdp losses by region between scenarios changed from 6 5 times in beijing b3 b1 to 2 5 times h6 h1 in hebei which indicates that the output response of non agricultural industrial products to one unit of water reduction was larger than that of agriculture and each manufacture sector had different extents of output response because of differences in production recipes and processes our results showed that water constraints reduced economic activities not only in the rationed regions and sectors but also in other regions and sectors across the supply chain upstream and downstream for example in scenario h6 53 of economic loss was from supply chain sectors freight transport and warehousing other services etc related to sector 1 agriculture and sector 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals thus an exogenous shock such as limits to water availability would affect the whole economy through supply chain linkages similar to economic loss only adjusting agricultural water consumption scenario b1 t1 and h1 would have the lowest impact on unemployment namely 0 11 million jobs 0 10 million within the capital region and 0 01 million in the roc accounting for 0 76 of total employment in beijing 0 04 million jobs 0 036 million within the capital region and 0 006 million in the roc accounting for 0 6 of total employment in tianjin and 1 43 million jobs 1 265 million within capital region and 0 17 million in the roc accounting for 4 2 of total employment in hebei in contrast the scenario b3 1 agriculture 22 electricity and heating power production 0 20 million t4 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals 0 14 million and h6 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals 2 04 million would lead to the largest losses in employment in this region the differences in job losses triggered by water rationing across scenarios by region changed from 1 4 times in hebei h6 h1 to 3 3 times t4 t1 in tianjin which were smaller than that of gdp because farmers accounted for rather large proportion of the total employment in terms of environmental benefits we found that scenario b3 1 agriculture 22 electricity and heating power production t4 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals and h6 1 agriculture 14 smelting and pressing processing of metals contributed to the largest reduction in the grey water footprint with values of 0 25 billion m3 0 017 billion m3 within the capital region and 0 235 billion m3 in the roc equal to 2 0 of the total grey water footprint of beijing 0 27 billion m3 0 046 billion m3 within the capital region and 0 22 billion m3 in the roc equal to 1 9 of the total grey water footprint of tianjin and 1 83 billion m3 0 25 billion m3 within the capital region and 1 57 billion m3 in the roc equal to 5 8 of the total grey water footprint of hebei restricting only agriculture b1 t1 and h1 would have the least effect on environmental protection which was 0 03 billion m3 in beijing 0 02 billion m3 in tianjin and 0 45 billion m3 in hebei respectively the differences in environmental gains triggered by water rationing across scenarios by region varied from 4 times in hebei h6 h1 to 16 times t4 t1 in tianjin which were much bigger than in the case of gdp and social losses because of significant water pollution discharge in manufacturing compared with agriculture our results indicate that water rationing in sectors with high grey water footprints per unit of output such as electricity and heating power production smelting and pressing processing of metals and chemicals would have the largest contribution to grey water footprint mitigation 3 2 economic and social losses versus environmental gains by sector and region the heat map in fig 4 and table s6 show the average relative shares and absolute values in loss of value added and jobs and environmental benefits under water supply constraints at the sectoral scale in the capital region the economic losses vary from 36 4 or 24 9 billion yuan of the total value added in agriculture sector 1 to 0 4 0 27 billion yuan of total value added in nonmetal minerals mining and dressing sector 5 in the capital region the second largest ones are from other services sector 30 12 6 of the total value added with 8 6 billion yuan and smelting and pressing of metals sector 14 with 5 2 of the total value added 3 5 billion yuan at the regional scale agriculture contributed with 17 the greatest share to total economic loss in beijing 13 in tianjin and 41 in hebei respectively similarly the proportions of job losses ranged from 77 3 1 50 million jobs in agriculture to 0 07 0 0014 million jobs in other manufacturing products sector 21 of all jobs due to the water constraint the second largest ones are from wholesale and retail trade sector 26 3 8 and other services 3 at the regional scale agriculture still showed the biggest contribution ranging from 70 5 of all lost jobs in beijing 48 4 in tianjin and 79 6 in hebei respectively in terms of environmental benefits hotels food and beverage places sector 27 has the largest grey water footprint 0 541 billion m3 accounting for 42 5 of the total grey water footprint in capital region this ratio is 43 in beijing 36 6 in tianjin and 43 5 in hebei other services sector 30 and chemicals sector 12 show the second largest relative effects which are 12 8 and 8 3 respectively but sector 20 measuring instrument machinery for cultural activity office work manufacturing is the smallest one only 0 026 of the total grey water footprint yet when looking at distribution of costs and benefits some interesting patterns emerge damages to the economy and jobs are heavily concentrated in food related sectors agriculture food and tobacco processing sector 6 and service sectors wholesale and retail trade other services however the benefit to the environment is mainly due to sectors with heavy wastewater discharges hotels food and beverage places chemicals for example under the water supply constraints in our designed scenarios the resultant economic loss job loss and environmental gain in sector 30 other services in the capital regions as a whole will account for 13 3 and 13 of the total economic and job loss and the total environmental gain respectively by contrast the corresponding shares in sector 27 hotels food and beverage places will be 3 2 and 43 respectively this mismatch shows the hotspots of pollution as well as points for intervention at least costs considering impacts along the entire supply chain 3 3 industrial transition scenarios under water constraints fig 5 shows the boxplots of the 120 industrial transition scenarios under water supply constraints in the capital region the overall economic loss varies from 38 3 billion yuan b1t1h1 to 110 8 billion yuan b3t4h6 and approximately 70 of these scenarios have economic losses ranging between 50 billion yuan and 80 billion yuan industrial transitions resulted in an average economic loss of 68 4 16 0 billion rmb accounting for 1 3 of total gdp of the capital region national bureau of statistics of china 2013 in terms of unemployment job losses ranged from 1 59 million b1t1h1 to 2 38 million b3t4h6 with an average of 1 94 0 18 million jobs lost this value accounts for 3 5 of the region s total employment in 2012 national bureau of statistics of china 2013 meanwhile the reduction in total grey water footprint fluctuated between 0 49 billion m3 b1t1h1 and 2 34 billion m3 b3t4h6 which was nearly 5 times the difference between maximum and minimum values and the average reduction in the grey water footprint was 1 27 0 40 billion m3 approximately 2 2 of the total grey water footprint in this region 3 4 trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental dimensions fig 6 shows the 3 dimensional 3d scatter plot of the 120 scenario combinations this 3d scatter plot is designed to provide instructions on the future development pathway selection we found that water security has trade off relationships with economic growth and jobs and some measures induced by water conservation would bring about economic losses and increases in unemployment conversely synergic connections exist between water conservation policies and the grey water footprint for the capital region scenarios with sectors of agriculture food and tobacco processing and chemicals b1t1h1 b2t1h1 b2t3h1 yellow spheres in fig 6 etc would have less impacts on the economy than scenarios with the sectors of electricity and heating power production smelting and pressing processing of metals and construction b3t4h6 b3t5h6 golden spheres etc similarly some adjusted scenarios including food and tobacco processing b1t1h1 b2t2h1 yellow spheres etc would lead to fewer job losses than scenarios with the sectors electricity and heating power production smelting and pressing processing of metals b3t4h6 b3t5h6 golden spheres etc as for environmental benefit scenarios including smelting and pressing processing of metals electricity and heating power production and construction b3t4h6 b3t5h6 b3t3h6 golden spheres etc would mitigate the grey water footprint much more than scenarios with the sectors of food and tobacco processing and chemicals b1t1h1 b2t1h1 b1t2h1 b1t3h1 yellow spheres etc 3 5 optimal scenarios based on multi criterion decision aid mcda we applied the mcda framework to calculate a composite value as the evaluation index to measure the performance of each scenario in the context of economic social and environmental dimensions see fig 7 in mavt system the weighted average value was 60 5 and scenarios whose values were smaller than 60 5 were regarded as sustainable in the three dimensions in contrast scenarios with higher values were considered unsustainable our results show that adjusting the agriculture and food and tobacco processing sectors in beijing the agriculture food and tobacco processing or chemicals sectors in tianjin and the agriculture and electricity and heating power production in hebei would have a more positive influence on the development of the capital region correspondingly in maut system the weighted average value was 0 54 which means that scenarios with values greater than 0 54 were accepted as reference scenarios for future development and similar to mavt changing the shares of production in the sectors of agriculture food and tobacco processing electricity and heating power production and chemicals would be likely to have the lowest losses and the most environmental benefits based on composite values under two mcda theories these top 10 scenarios with regard to their performances in terms of economic social and environmental sustainability could serve as references for guiding future industrial transition policies 4 discussion we proposed a policy support technique that combines mixed mrio models with mcda theory to evaluate the consequences of water constraints and applied it to the largest urban agglomeration in china the capital region or the jing jin ji region on the one hand these results on the rank and magnitude of trades offs and synergies provide useful information for policy makers and planners to effectively identify priority policy selections and balance policy actions in line with policy considerations and value judgements kurian 2017 on the other hand our mixed mrio approach coupled with the mcda allows to evaluate not only the direct impacts of alternative policy options but also the indirect impacts induced by supply chain effects triggered by exogenous shocks e g resource shortage natural disasters emergency events etc which have more advantages than footprint accounting or system indicators in impact assessments liang et al 2016 eiser and roberts 2002 leung and pooley 2001 in comparison with the results simulated by a standard mrio model driven by consumption activities i e fig 4 figure s1 versus figure s2 and table s5 versus table s7 the mixed mrio model driven by production activities under the constraint of resource supply is able to provide a more realistic representation of structural interactions across regions and sectors in response to resource constraints and thus better facilitating the design of economic development pathways despite the persistent concern in the literature on water scarcity there has been a lack of development of simple and effective tools that can be used to clearly assess the losses and benefits caused by water conservation measures across economic social and environmental systems our research fills an important niche in water resource field agriculture is a crucial but high water demanding sector it mainly provides raw products wheat rice soybean cotton with low economic value added but manifests high water requirements compared with manufacturing industries for example in scenarios b1 b2 and b3 see fig 3 row 1 water rationing reduces the same amount of water consumption but gdp losses in b2 and b3 are bigger than in b1 because scenarios b2 and b3 include industries with higher gdp productivity per unit of water which means that the elasticity of economic output to water availability is larger in non agricultural sectors than for agriculture in other words reduction in value added from agriculture is lower than in other sectors under the same water reduction scenarios in addition agricultural production is labor intensive and approximately one third of the labor force is still engaged in agricultural work with low income farmers migrant workers in the capital region zhao et al 2019 as a result most of the unemployed population in the labor market triggered by water scarcity comes from food related sectors fig 3 shows that the job loss in agriculture accounted for about 80 of the total job loss in each scenario but the share of environmental benefit in agriculture is less than 10 of the total which means that the relatively small extent of economic decline triggered by water rationing in agriculture would lead to large fluctuations on the agricultural labor market and a smaller grey water footprint van arendonk 2015 there are also some opposite cases with small change in labor market but big change in grey water footprint in some scenarios e g b1 b2 t1 t2 h5 h6 these findings indicate that when social and environmental costs are excluded from water conservation planning policy makers are more likely to promote some water saving policies at the expense of job losses and unexpected environmental side effects and this result could be more pronounced in the agriculture sector because of its high water and job intensity a direct policy implication of this recognition is that although the adjustment in agriculture has the lowest impact on the economy the responses of social and environmental aspects should also be considered when policy makers propose water policy guidelines fig 7 shows the overall scores for each scenario with regard to their performance in economic social and environmental sustainability dimensions for guiding future industrial transition policies in the capital region it should be noted that we could achieve the goal of decreasing the water stress level to be aligned with the carrying capacity of local water resources based on a range of plausible pathways in other words there is space for the stakeholders to join the discussion on the calibration of criterion weights and to choose the most suitable scenario based on their needs for example beijing is on a pathway with an economic structure toward highly advanced services and away from the current water intensive industries thus the share of irrigation agriculture could be significantly reduced even close to zero entirely tianjin attempts to become a research center for manufacturing and a pilot region for financial reform thus some manufacturing with high water intensities and heavy pollutions will be replaced by some high technology industries hebei is treated as an important ecological conservation region with many natural parks surrounding the capital for this goal to renew heavy industries by upgrading production processes and modernizing the industrial base will become required in the near future to some extent the visualized presentation of the links between policy relevant requirements and the industrial transitions can better serve the knowledge co production process between scientists and decision makers in water demand side management our findings indicate that trade offs and synergies exist simultaneously in terms of economic development social well being and environmental protection when the economic system is constrained by water resource endowment water policies aiming to save water in agriculture will have limited effects on economic development but have negative and significant influences on social and environmental issues similarly shrinking economic output in the smelting and pressing processing of metals and construction sectors will have significant environmental values but reduced economic and employment benefits thus quantifying the interactions between water and other elements at sectoral scale is very important for water policy planning many water studies have been confined to sectorial silo thinking without considering the trade offs between multiple development indicators which has usually led to inefficient regulatory decisions and spillover and backfire effects leading to environmental and social problems elsewhere bizikova et al 2013 our research suggests that this well constructed nexus approach has great advantages on impact assessments and scenario selection and this approach could be a powerful and integrative technique for assessing the trade offs and synergies among multiple criteria under resource shortages or surpluses and for addressing the economic social environmental and physical contexts of resource systems to achieve more balanced solutions for policy makers and relevant stakeholders the proposed framework can also be applied to modeling potential impacts of supply chain disruptions from external shocks such as the current pandemic see also for similar modeling approaches guan et al 2020 and shan et al 2020 the outbreak of covid 19 caused by sard cov 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become the most disruptive viral public health event since the 1918 influenza pandemic a century ago giani et al 2020 some strict lockdown measures like travel restrictions quarantine closing caterings and entertainment places and social distancing are enforced by many governments with high infection rate and confirmed cases to slow down the spread of covid 19 guan et al 2020 this newly integrated toolbox with mixed mrio scenario analysis and mcda theory provides decision makers with the ability to assess short term supply chain effects of different containment measures to reveal how pandemic related economic losses will be reallocated along supply chains across regions and industrial sectors and quantify associated potential economic social and environmental impacts for instance travelling restrictions and closing public places restaurants pubs sports etc will bring about external economic shocks in several key service sectors directly then the impacts of these constrained sectors will be enhanced through complex supply chain linkages subsequently secondary impacts like unemployment and changes in air pollution water resources and biodiversity effects triggered by lockdown measures can be captured by this framework and allows quantification and comparisons between costs and benefits of various strategies the successful achievement of the sdg agenda is a pathway to respond to the global sustainability challenges in ensuring economic prosperity human well being and environmental protection and the attainment of sdgs will greatly depend on whether synergies can be leveraged and trade offs are minimized pradhan et al 2017 the un has established these sdg targets on the global scale however assessing these targets at the regional scale in a scientific way is more practical for local governments and practitioners our analytical framework can be one tool to assess trade offs and synergies of sdg targets at the regional level a coupling of this regional tool with national and global mrio models in a nested structure in future research would achieve more insightful national overviews and help determine priorities in supporting sdg targets the mixed mrio model results show the necessity of considering the impacts of the disruption triggered by water constraints on the supply chain across region sectors our results indicate that of the total economic loss triggered by the imposition of water rationing in the capital region 54 occurred in the capital region and 45 occurred in the rest of china we expect that our integrated approach can serve as a stepping stone for further research into the cascading relationships among food security energy consumption and environmental restoration in these fields the relative intensities of pressures trade offs and co benefits will depend on the scope of each analysis and the indicators used to measure the outcomes obersteiner et al 2016 we believe that the simplicity and the rich information provided by mrio models have advantages in contributing to coherent and comprehensive policy planning with due attention focused on economic prosperity resource security and social stability 5 conclusion this study proposed a novel approach that integrates supply constrained mrio model with multi criteria assessment to quantify the trade offs and synergies of economic social environmental dimensions at the regional sectoral level with an application to the capital region of china we developed 120 industrial transition scenarios including nine industries with the high water intensities and water consumption under current development pathways we calculated economic loss job loss and environmental protection gains triggered by water conservation measures under each of the 120 scenarios then we employed mcda to select optimal scenarios the following conclusions were drawn 1 a tolerable water rationing in agriculture food and tobacco processing electricity and heating power production and chemicals sectors would result in the lowest economic and job losses as well as the largest environmental benefits to the region 2 the mcda procedure recommends 10 reference scenarios with regard to their economic social and environmental performance that can facilitate the design of future water regulation and industrial transition policies the visualized presentation of the links between policy relevant requirements and the industrial transitions can better serve the knowledge co production process between scientists and decision makers in water demand side management 3 this newly integrated toolbox allows to assess the short term supply chain effects of different crisis containment strategies to reveal how pandemic related economic losses will be reallocated along the supply chains across regions and sectors and potential other impacts and allows quantification and comparisons between the losses and gains of various mitigation strategies 4 this integrated approach could be a powerful policy support tool for assessing trade offs and synergies among multiple criteria under resource constraints and for evaluating sdgs at the regional level to determine priorities for local governments and practitioners author contributions j l d z l s o v k h and k f

17109,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in different nanofiltration phases including the short term membrane flux behaviors and the long term ones on the basic of correlation analysis between the changing physicochemical properties of feed solution and membrane fouling the inner mechanisms were revealed from aspects of bulk crystallization interaction between humic acid and inorganic ions and surface crystallization compositions and morphologies of surface crystallization furthermore the reliability of applicating differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling was also systematically evaluated there was an upward trend in short term membrane fouling with increasing dosage of naclo while long term membrane fouling decreased after an initial increase during short term filtration the enhanced combination between inorganic ions and the humic acid with stronger density of carboxyl groups which was generated more easily under stronger oxidation conditions favored the earlier appearance of flux decline during long term filtration the size of bulk crystallization depended on the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution both of them increased firstly and then decreased with increasing oxidation the terminal fouling layer resistance also shared a similar tendency with them because the deposition of bulk crystallization on membranes and the formation of dense scaling layer were the direct reasons for the long term membrane fouling furthermore the differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy was proven to be an efficient approach to predict short term membrane fouling especially in the wavelength range of 260 to 280 nm this research could not only provide guidance on alleviating oxidation enhanced membrane fouling in nanofiltration but also propose an efficient way to predict the membrane fouling which was influenced by the interaction between organic matters and inorganic ions graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidation sodium hypochlorite naclo humic acid ha gypsum scaling nanofiltration nf

concerns when evaluating the performance of nanofiltration based process in water treatment process ren et al 2020 as the dominated fouling in nanofiltration process inorganic scaling usually resulted from the excess of solubility limit for slightly soluble salts not only in feed solution as bulk crystallization but also on membranes as surface crystallization lee and lee 2000 these scaling processes could be enhanced by coexisting pollutants especially natural organic compounds noms le gouellec and elimelech 2002 noms could interact with metal ions and then the combined network of crystal organics was generated favoring the formation of scaling precipitates wang et al 2016a our previous studies showed that humic acid could act as nuclei to enhance bulk crystallization and then favor the precipitation of inorganic crystals on membranes due to the electrostatic attraction between them lin et al 2020 oxidation was widely applied for degrading micro organic compounds enhancing coagulation disinfection and others in drinking water treatment process chen et al 2017 camel and bermond 1998 besides it was also considered as a reliable pretreatment to alleviate organic fouling in membranes filtration it meant that oxidation and nanofiltration could probably coexist in a same drinking water treatment process and the effects of oxidation on the performance of nanofiltration should not be neglected during oxidation organic pollutants could be partly degraded into carbon dioxide and water while nom molecules were also decomposed into smaller fragments cheng et al 2016 van geluwe et al 2011 despite that the potential effects of oxidation on inorganic organic combined fouling in nanofiltration was still controversial because the inorganic organic combination was more complicated than organics themselves let alone the crystallization development based on the combination for instance more carboxy groups might generated on noms after oxidation and then the combination between noms and metal ions was enhanced benefiting the precipitation of inorganic scaling seidel and elimelech 2002 xue et al 2016 this meant that the inorganic fouling on membranes might be aggravated by the enhanced deposition of bulk crystallization on the other hand the mineralization of noms might reduce the crystal nuclei and the latter was proven to favor the acceleration of crystallization process wang et al 2016a besides since the crystallization process consisted of the different steps of nucleation and sequent crystal growth and these steps showed different sensitivity to the coexisting pollutants in feed solution lin et al 2020 bhattacharjee and johnston 2002 oxidation might have different influences on crystallization in different filtration phases therefore the effects of oxidation on noms enhanced gypsum scaling in nanofiltration should be systematically investigated considering different dosage of oxidants and the membrane performance in different nanofiltration phases short term filtration and long term filtration despite the fact that the membrane fouling was depended on water qualities the measurement of single index failed to efficiently predict membrane fouling in nanofiltration because nanofiltration was governed by complex fouling mechanisms in different filtration phases lin et al 2019a however the membrane fouling in nanofiltration process could be always influenced by the interaction between organics and inorganics so the latter should be properly evaluated before the prediction of membrane fouling a number of methods for instance nica donnan models stockholm humic models and others have been applied for that purpose yan et al 2013a however these methods were also limited by some experiment challenges such as the necessary redetermination of equilibrium constants of different compounds and precipitates under different conditions differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy is another operational method that has been widely used to characterize the metal noms combination yan et al 2013b the absorbance spectra of feed solution were sensitive to the deprotonation of organic compounds yan and korshin 2014 furthermore the competition on binding the sites of carboxyl groups on organic compounds existed between inorganics and hydrogen ions proton during their interaction resulting in the variation of absorbance spectra gao et al 2015 given that differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy seems to be a reliable way to predict certain membrane fouling in nanofiltration but needs further investigation to the best of our knowledge no published literatures focused on these fields as illustrated in fig 1 this study aimed to evaluate the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in different phases of nanofiltration process both short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling were considered on the basic of correlation analysis between the changing physicochemical properties of feed solution and membrane fouling the inner mechanisms were revealed from the aspects of surface crystallization compositions and morphologies of surface crystallization and bulk crystallization interaction between humic acid and inorganic ions furthermore the reliability of applying differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling was also systematically evaluated in different range of wavelength the research results could not only provide guidance on alleviating oxidation enhanced membrane fouling in nanofiltration but also propose an operational approach to predict this certain type of membrane fouling efficiently 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed solution and membranes sodium sulphate na2so4 20 mm and calcium chloride cacl2 35 mm were used to make up of oversaturated brackish water 4 l both of them were purchased with american chemical society asc grade from aladdin industrial co ltd usa it should be noted that the concentration of these salts was made slightly higher than that of gypsum so that scaling could take place at a reasonable speed mi and elimelech 2010 wang et al 2016b humic acid ha was chosen to represent the humic substance in natural water environment and supplied by sigma aldrich co ltd usa in powder form to make the stock solution 2g l humic acid powder was dissolved in sodium hydroxide naoh aqueous solution 0 01 mm and then stirred by a magnetic stirrer for at least 24 h before adjusting ph back to neutral with hydrochloric acid hcl aqueous solution 0 1 mm before the pre oxidation and filtration experiment it was diluted in feed solution with the concentration of 5 mg l to enhance gypsum scaling during the analysis of absorbance spectra reference solution only consisted of humic acid 5 mg l and a certain dosage of oxidant but without any salts polyamide thin film composite tfc membranes nf270 dow filmetc usa were applied throughout this study the characterizations of the membranes were presented in table s 1 in the supplementary material raw membranes should be rewetted in sodium bisulfite nahso3 aqueous solution 1 5 wt and then washed by ultrapure water for at least 3 times before filtration membranes were soaked in ultrapure water in the dark 2 2 experiment setups 2 2 1 pre oxidation on one hand hypochlorite clo is widely applied in drinking water treatment process for disinfection coagulation enhancement algae removal and others because it is suitable for long distance transportation and long time storage yang et al 2016 yu et al 2015 ding et al 2020 hence the existence of hypochlorite should be considered in the influent of nanofiltration on the other hand the reduction products of hypochlorite mainly consist of strong electrolytes instead of weak electrolytes which were proved to influence crystallization process as crystal nuclei lin et al 2019b hence the application of hypochlorite will be helpful for this study to distinguish the effects of oxidation on the physicochemical properties of organic matters which might further influence the combination between organics and inorganics based on the above analysis sodium hypochlorite naclo was chosen to represent typical oxidants in this study as presented in fig 2 the pre oxidation experiments were conducted in a 5 l breaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer naclo was added in feed solution to induce oxidation and its dosage varied from 0 to 1 9 0 0 3 0 6 1 0 1 9 mg mg total organic carbon toc in different experiments during the oxidation procedure it was stirred with the speed of 300 r min for 20 min subsequently 4 ml 0 5 m sodium sulfite na2so3 was spiked into the feed solution to quench the residual oxidation for avoiding the damage to nanofiltration membranes 2 2 2 nanofiltration filtration the membrane filtration was conducted in a cross flow nanofiltration system consisting of membrane module pressure pump thermostatic bath flowmeter valves and pipes fig 2 during filtration the filtrate from membrane module effective area 42 cm2 was collected by an erlenmeyer flask and weighted by an electronic balance which data were transferred to an affiliated computer and then used to calculate membrane flux j the working pressure of nanofiltration system δpw was kept at 0 7 mpa by pressure pump crossflow rate of membrane module was set of 30 l h and monitored by flowmeter the filtration was conducted at room temperature 25 with the help of thermostatic bath it should be noted that nanofiltration membranes were equilibrated by sodium chloride nacl aqueous solution with the same ionic strength of feed solution 165 mm previously to acquire the initial membrane flux j0 before the official filtration experiments according to resistance in series models lin et al 2009 total resistance rt consisted of membrane resistance rm and membrane scaling layer resistance rs as presented in eq 1 and 2 j0 was used to calculate rm while rt could be calculated by j therefore membrane scaling layer resistance rs could be obtained when rt minus rm eq 3 besides normalized flux was defined as the ratio of the membrane flux during filtration to the initial membrane flux eq 4 1 r m δ p w μ j 0 2 r t δ p w μ j 3 r s r t r m δ p w μ j δ p w μ j 0 4 n o r m a i l i z e d f l u x j j 0 while μ is dynamic viscosity of water at room temperature 0 8937 10 3 pa s the detailed composition of feed solution for filtration experiments and reference solution for differential absorbance spectroscopy were listed in table 1 all the experiments would be conducted at least in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods and formulas 2 3 1 characterization of membrane scaling layer scaling deposited and accumulated on nanofiltration membranes during the filtration to distinguish the specific composition of membrane scaling scaling on membranes with an area of about 1 cm2 should be soaked and dissolved in 40 ml ultrapure water before further detection for avoiding the unnecessary experimental error from insolvable scaling and its damage to the instruments 500 μl hcl 1 m was spiked into the ultrapure water simultaneously after the pretreatment inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 5300 dv perkinelmer usa was applied to investigate the concentration of calcium in solution and ion chromatograph integerion hpic theromfisher usa was responsible for determining the concentration of sulfate scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200feg fei usa was used to perform an autopsy on the morphologies of membrane scaling layer the magnification of autopsy was maintained at 50 times the original size before the autopsy fouled membranes should be dehydrated in a vacuum drying oven dzf 6050 yiheng instruments china and sputtered with platinum for more than 120 s in an ion sputter coater mc1000 hitachi japan during the drying process the membranes should be kept in a vertical form to avoid the salts crystallization from residual feed solution 2 3 2 physicochemical properties of feed solution total organic carbon analyzer multi n c jena germany was performed to analyze the toc of feed solution after oxidation both zeta potential and particle size distribution of feed solution were measured by a zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk to evaluate the effects of oxidation on carboxyl groups concentration of humic acid and the bulk crystallization in feed solution respectively 2 3 3 differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy could efficiently reflect the nature and extent of interactions between metal cations and dissolved organic matters gao et al 2015 the calculation process was presented as below according to eq 5 and 6 both the differential absorbance spectra δaλ and differential log transformed absorbance spectra δlnaλ could be calculated by raw absorbance data 5 δ a λ a λ a λ r e f e r e n c e 6 δ ln a λ l n a λ l n a λ r e f e r e n c e while aλ was the absorbance of feed solution at certain wavelength λ aλ reference was the absorbance of humic acid reference solution with the same extent of oxidation but without gypsum at certain wavelength λ before the application of differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy the slope of linear correlation that fits the log transformed absorbance spectra in the certain range of wavelength should be calculated using eq 7 previously the differential log transformed absorbance spectra were defined as the difference between the slope in feed solution and the slope in reference solution eq 8 7 s λ 1 λ 2 l n a λ 1 l n a λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 8 δ s λ 1 λ 2 s λ 1 λ 2 s λ 1 r e f e r e n c e λ 2 r e f e r e n c e l n a λ 1 l n a λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 l n a λ

conducted to investigate the relationships between membrane fouling and differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy using linear fitting in origin version 2019b originlab usa the correlation was determined by correlation coefficient r2 correlation was stronger when r2 was closer to 1 correlation was weaker when r2 was closer to 0 both short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling were taken into consideration during the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of normalized flux and scaling layer resistance during filtration the curves of normalized flux and scaling layer resistance during nanofiltration were drawn in fig 3 without humic acid or oxidation salts solution could still induce obvious flux decline and continuous resistance increasement fig 3a however the flux curve did not decrease remarkably in the beginning of filtration until a certain volume of feed solution was filtrated this phenomenon was consistent with some previous studies in which scientists found that a delayed period before flux decline was required during the nanofiltration of brackish water lin et al 2005 it could be attributed to the necessary time for sufficient nuclei to generate in feed solution since a whole crystallization process consists of the different steps of nucleation and sequent crystal growth lin et al 2020 bhattacharjee and johnston 2002 and the scaling layer developed in this phase was loose and porous therefore it was indicated that a whole filtration process could be divided into two sequent phases in present study namely plateau and decline in plateau phase few flux declines were observed and the curve of scaling layer resistance remained horizontal on the contrary flux curve decreased sharply in decline phase and the most significant scaling layer resistance was developed at the end of this phase probably because significant crystallization could occur once sufficient nuclei formed leading to obvious cake formation after the deposition of crystallization lin et al 2005 similar phenomena could also be observed when the humic acid contaminated feed solution was pre oxidized fig 3b 3f though the influence of oxidation on the filtration volume for plateau phase and the terminal scaling layer resistance which could be considered as the reflection of short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling respectively in present study varied in different experiments the variation of filtration volume for plateau phase was fully summarized in fig 4 it could be seen that the filtration volume for plateau phase maintained at 118 2 ml in control groups but decreased significantly to 89 1 ml with the adding of humic acid in feed solution even though our previous study also indicated that single humic acid failed to cause obvious flux decline in nanofiltration process lin et al 2019c it could act as nuclei to remarkably enhance gypsum scaling and then deteriorate short term membrane fouling wang et al 2016a furthermore the filtration volume was on the decrease when the dosage of oxidants increased from 0 to 1 9 mg mg toc indicating the continuously enhanced short term membrane fouling by naclo oxidation probably because of the faster generation of crystal nuclei hoek and elimelech 2003 the most dramatic short term membrane fouling was developed when the feed solution was oxidized by 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo which filtration volume for plateau phase dropped to 52 1 ml however the variation of long term membrane fouling under different oxidation conditions fail to share a similar tendency with the variation of short term membrane fouling all the time fig 4 when the dosage of oxidants increased from 0 to 0 6 mg mg toc there was a marked growth in the terminal scaling layer resistance rising from 6 47 1013 m 1 to 2 72 1014 m 1 instead of increasing continuously a notable downward trend formed in long term membrane fouling when feed solutions were oxidized by more naclo only 2 33 1014 m 1 and 2 10 1014 m 1 resistances could be developed with 1 3 and 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo respectively it was indicated that the long term membrane fouling was alleviated to some extent after an initial enhancement with increasing oxidation these membrane flux behaviors indicated that naclo aggravated the membrane fouling in nanofiltration process however xing et al considered naclo based oxidation process as an efficient pretreatment strategy to remarkably mitigate ultrafiltration membrane fouling xing et al 2019 the difference between these two studies could result from the different fouling mechanisms in nanofiltration and ultrafiltration in oxidation ultrafiltration combined process oxidation could mineralize the organic pollutants and then the organic fouling was alleviated accordingly cheng et al 2019 however single ha was proven to hardly induce obvious membrane fouling in nanofiltration process lin et al 2019c meanwhile inorganic fouling usually predominated nanofiltration membrane fouling because of the efficient retention of ions by nanofiltration membranes matin et al 2019 in section 3 2 the specific composition of fouling layers also showed that the membrane fouling layer mainly consisted of inorganic gypsum therefore the phenomena mentioned above might result from the different effects of oxidation on the physicochemical properties of organic pollutants and the variation of inorganic organic interaction instead of the mere mineralization of organic matters these hypotheses would be further verified from the perspective of the crystallization development and the changing physicochemical properties of feed solution in following sections 3 2 characterization of surface crystallization and bulk crystallization 3 2 1 surface crystallization according to the surface blockage mechanisms scaling layer could form on membrane surface due to the growth of crystals blocking membrane pores seriously lee et al 1999 in fig 5 the specific composition of scaling layer on nanofiltration membranes was investigated as surface crystallization considering calcium and sulfate concentration compared with control groups ha could considerably enhance the surface crystallization which calcium scaling concentration increased from 7210 9 mg m2 to 7845 3 mg m2 furthermore the figure climbed to 8024 4 mg m2 with 0 3 mg mg toc of naclo after which it rose steadily with more oxidants in feed solution and then grew to 14635 3 mg m2 with 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo the rising trend could be also seen in the variation of sulfate scaling concentration under different oxidation conditions the sulfate concentration was expected to rise to 28230 3 mg m2 with 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo more than two times the figure for control groups only 13628 1 mg m2 the correlation analysis showed that neither calcium scaling concentration nor sulfate scaling concentration variation shared a consistent tendency with the variation of terminal scaling layer resistance under different oxidation conditions table s 2 indicating that foulant concentration on membranes was not the main reason resulting in the difference of long term membrane fouling in present study it has been proven that both foulant concentration on membranes and morphologies of membrane fouling layer could be responsible for flux decline and fouling layer resistance akhondi et al 2015 given that the morphologies of membrane scaling layer were further scanned by sem and the images were presented in fig 6 as seen in fig 6a the scaling layer was found broken and incomplete in control groups even though the integrity of scaling layer could be considerably promoted by humic acid crystallization was still found acicular and dendritic fig 6b the lamellar scaling in fig 6c and fig 6d indicated oxidation could enlarge the size of crystals and induce denser scaling layer to some extent especially when naclo was applied with the dosage of 0 6 mg mg toc however further increase of oxidants fail to enhance crystallization as expected but had a negative effect on the integrity of scaling layer resulting in porous structure observed in fig 6e and fig 6f which could be the direct reason for the alleviation of membrane scaling layer resistance under strong oxidation conditions 1 0 and 1 9 mg naclo mg toc 3 2 2 bulk crystallization the structures of pollutants had a great impact on the membrane fouling mechanisms not only in ultrafiltration process cheng et al 2016 but also in nanofiltration process yu et al 2018 during filtration the crystals formed in bulk phase could also deposit on membranes forming a scaling layer and coming up with flux decline lee et al 1999 meanwhile the size of bulk crystallization also represented the degree of interaction between humic acid and gypsum because their interaction was beneficial of scaling precipitation wang et al 2016a therefore to descript the membrane fouling process during nanofiltration on the scale of nanometer the nanoparticle size distribution of bulk crystallization in feed solution was monitored not only in the beginning of filtration but also at the end of it fig 7 in the beginning of filtration few bulk crystallizations were developed in feed solution without oxidation but the average particle size of them gradually increased with increasing dosage of oxidants rising to 643 5 nm with 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo indicating the enhanced interaction between humic acid and gypsum by oxidation in a short time yu et al 2016 contracting the particle size distribution of bulk crystallization in the beginning of filtration with that at the end of filtration it was notable that the bulk crystallization preferred to grow continuously during the filtration rather than remain unchanged for example despite the fact that the particle size distribution of the bulk crystallization in naclo 0 6 feed solution only varied from 295 nm to 342 nm in the beginning of filtration most of them spread in an area between 1280 nm and 1720 nm at the end of filtration which were also the largest among all experiments similar to the variation of terminal membrane scaling resistance the average particle size of bulk crystallization also showed a decreasing trend after an initial increase when the dosage of naclo was continuously increased furthermore the results of correlation analysis indicated that the oxidation enhanced membrane fouling was positively associated with the development of bulk crystallization table 2 not matter in short term filtration but also in long term filtration it could be concluded that the membrane fouling was aggravated with the enhanced combination between humic acid and gypsum although the measurement of the particle size of bulk crystallization could benefit the understanding of the mechanisms of humic acid enhanced nanofiltration scaling influenced by oxidation it was conducted in parallel to the filtration indicating its infeasibility to predict long term membrane fouling 3 3 physicochemical properties of feed solution 3 3 1 zeta potential and toc the carboxyl groups of humic acid could attract metal cations quickly through electrostatic interaction and benefited the precipitation of scaling arkhangelsky et al 2012 according to previous studies zeta potential could reflect the charge properties of organic matters which might originate from the ionization of carboxyl groups yin et al 2020 specifically zeta potential up to ph 8 0 was due to the deprotonation of carboxyl groups while zeta potential at higher ph was attributed to the phenolic groups collins et al 1986 in this study the ph of feed solution was strictly maintained at 7 0 hence zeta potential could be used to efficiently evaluate the abundance of carboxyl groups furthermore the toc of feed solutions were also measured to determine the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid as illustrated in fig 8 the zeta potential in naclo 0 group was 8 61 mv in marked contrast to 1 55 mv of control groups furthermore zeta potential decreased gradually after an initial increase when the humic acid involved feed solution was continuously oxidized by naclo the most negative zeta potential was measured in naclo 0 6 groups dipping to 10 32 mv and attributing to the most generation of carboxyl groups in feed solution on the other hand toc showed a moderate decrease to 2 84 mg l in naclo 1 9 groups while 3 10 mg l toc was provided in the feed solution without oxidation these results showed that the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution would decrease after an initial increase with increasing oxidation when humic acid was more likely to be mineralized with higher dosage of naclo the ratio of zeta potential to toc was further calculated and summarized in figure s 1 in present study zeta potential reflected the richness of total carboxyl groups in feed solution while the zeta potential per toc could be used to evaluate the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid these results implied that the there was an upward tendency for the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid a downward tendency for zeta potential per toc with the aggravation of oxidation generally speaking the total content of carboxyl groups on humic acid was increased firstly and then decreased with increasing oxidation while the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid was continuously increased because humic acid was also mineralized during the reaction based on the analysis of water quality section 3 3 1 and the development of crystallization section 3 2 2 the mechanisms of the changing membrane fouling behaviors under different oxidation conditions were further revealed from the perspective of the interaction between the carboxyl groups of organic matters and inorganic ions in section 3 3 2 3 3 2 correlations analysis between membrane fouling and water quality the correlations between different membrane fouling short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling and the physicochemical properties of feed solution were systematically estimated the fitting formulas and coefficients of determination r2 were presented in fig 9 when investigating the relationships between long term membrane fouling and water quality zeta potential was found exhibiting a strong correlation with terminal scaling layer resistance fig 9a r2 0 898 and the latter would near linearly decrease with the increase of zeta potential slope 1 18 1014 it was concluded that the terminal scaling layer resistance increased with increasing content of carboxyl groups in feed solution in this study the long term membrane fouling was also aggravated with the enhanced combination between humic acid and calcium ions table 2 these results indicated that the enhanced metal noms combination synchronized with the increase of carboxyl groups in feed solution these findings were consistent with the phenomena in a previous study that the carboxyl groups of humic acid could attract metal cations quickly through electrostatic interaction and benefited the precipitation of scaling arkhangelsky et al 2012 during the long term filtration the bulk crystallization deposited on membranes and formed a dense scaling layer which could block up the membrane pores and induce flux decline her et al 2000 dydo et al 2004 therefore it could be easily concluded that oxidation could continuously enhance the long term membrane fouling by the means of increasing the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution fig 9a enhancing the metal noms combination and then enhancing the bulk crystallization fig 7 when the dosage of naclo was limited to less than 0 6 mg mg toc however excessive naclo alleviated the long term membrane fouling to some extent instead of continuously deteriorating it probably because humic acid was partly mineralized when more than 0 6 mg mg toc naclo was added fig 8 and then the metal noms combination was weakened fig 7 besides the measure of zeta potential in feed solution was proven to be an efficient way to evaluate the potential of long term membrane fouling in fig 9b the relationships between long term membrane fouling and the ratio of zeta potential to toc were also investigated but there was no reliable correlation the relationships between short term membrane fouling and water quality were also investigated in present study though zeta potential seemed to be slightly associated with the filtration volume for plateau phase fig 9c r2 0 795 the ratio of zeta potential to toc showed a more significant correlation with short term membrane fouling fig 9d r2 0 955 besides the positive value of the fitting formula in fig 9d indicated that short term membrane fouling could be remarkably enhanced when zeta potential per toc increased slope 218 54 it meant that the degree of short term membrane fouling was positively related to the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid as mentioned in section 3 2 2 the short term membrane fouling degree was also dependent on the particle size of bulk crystallization which could reflect the degree of combination between humic acid and calcium ions in the beginning of filtration therefore the fouling process could be drawn as follow in a short time calcium ions were more likely to adhere to humic acid molecule with higher density of carboxyl groups which was developed under strong oxidation conditions instead of the humic acid molecule with lower density of carboxyl groups which was developed under weak oxidation conditions even though the toc of feed solution was higher under weak oxidation conditions however there still did not exist any obvious flux decline until certain amount of bulk crystallization accumulated on membrane surface and the flux decline appeared earlier if the metal noms combination was stronger and the generation of sufficient crystal nuclei was faster 3 4 elaboration of the mechanisms about the oxidation influenced membrane fouling behaviors in nanofiltration process based on the analysis mentioned above the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in nanofiltration process were described in fig 10 in the feed solution oxidation had at least two different effects on humic acid including the increase of density of carboxyl groups and the mineralization of organic matters both of them were positively associated with the dosage of oxidants therefore the total content of carboxyl groups on humic acid showed a decreasing trend after an initial increase with increasing oxidants in the beginning of filtration calcium ions preferred to combined with the humic acid molecule with higher density of carboxyl groups and then the stronger bulk crystallization was developed favoring the earlier appearance of flux decline in nanofiltration however the mechanisms of long term membrane fouling were slightly different from the short term ones during the long term filtration calcium ions could fully interact with the carboxyl groups of humic acid therefore the long term particle size of bulk crystallization was dependent on the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution it was found decreasing after an initial increase with increasing dosage of oxidants because humic acid was efficiently mineralized under strong oxidation conditions and the long term membrane fouling degree also shared a similar tendency with the size of bulk crystallization because the deposition of bulk crystallization on membranes and formation of dense scaling layer were the direct reasons for long term membrane fouling considering the performance of oxidation influenced nanofiltration process and the inner mechanisms it is suggested that the dosage of oxidants applied before nanofiltration should be strictly controlled otherwise the oxidation strategies in nanofiltration should be changed from pretreatment to posttreatment as far as possible to avoid the enhanced metal noms combination and membrane fouling 3 5 effect of pre oxidation on the absorbance spectra of humic acid although the variation of bulk crystallization size shared similar tendencies with not only short term membrane fouling but also long term membrane fouling in present study table 2 its measure was complicated and failed to predict membrane fouling before filtration the filtration had already finished before the particle size of bulk crystallization for correlating with long term membrane fouling was measured section 3 2 on the other hand zeta potential of feed solution could be a reasonable index to predict terminal membrane scaling resistance but the extra measure of toc was needed for predicting short term membrane fouling and the results could not be obtained in real time section 3 3 given that another operational and fast approach should be developed to predict the short term membrane fouling in nanofiltration process in this section the reliability of applying differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy on predicting membrane fouling was systematically evaluated on the basic of correlation analysis 3 5 1 absorbance spectra differential absorbance spectra and differential log transformed absorbance spectra of humic acid the absorbance of feed solution and reference solution in the beginning of filtration were presented in fig 11 there was a nearly exponential decrease in the absorbance intensity with increasing wavelength in feed solution fig 11a though the difference of absorbance curves could be hardly recognized between different feed solution the changes in spectra of reference solution were conspicuous and followed certain rules with more dosage of naclo fig 11b according to eq 5 the differential absorbance spectra between them could be calculated and it was also found discernible in fig 12 a with a negative peak at the wavelength of about 220 nm meanwhile the intensity of this peak dropped from 0 102 to 0 074 with the increasing dosage of naclo from 0 to 1 9 mg mg toc probably because of the different degree of deprotonation on carboxyl groups on humic acid under different oxidation conditions dryer et al 2008 similar phenomena could be also observed in the differential absorbance spectra between feed solution and reference solution at the end of filtration fig 12b though the absorbance spectra of different solution were also expected to coincide figure s 2 given that it was speculated that the differential absorbance spectroscopy could be a potential approach to evaluate the degree of interaction between humic acid and calcium ions one of the major constituents of gypsum and even the membrane fouling the log transformed absorbance spectra of the feed solution in the beginning of filtration and at the end of it were illustrated in fig 13 a and fig 13b respectively it was showed that the oxidized feed solution had a stronger intensity of log transformed absorbance spectra than the unoxidized feed solution at any time because oxidation could promote the extent of metal binding by humic acid fig 7 by the means of increasing the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid figure s 1 the intensity of log transformed absorbance spectra was also stronger in feed solution at the end of filtration than that in the beginning of filtration probably because the combination between humic acid and calcium ions was continuously enhanced during filtration fig 7 on the other hand the log transformed absorbance spectra decreased near linearly with stable increasing wavelength from 200 to 400 nm though the slopes varied in different band as shown in fig 13a the spectra curve declined rapidly with increasing wavelength in the range of 200 to 230 nm furthermore two inflections were developed at the wavelength of about 240 nm and 270 nm compared with the slopes fitting the curves between 200 and 230 nm the slopes were gentler not only in the 260 280 nm range but also in the 300 400 nm range according to previous studies the slopes fitted the curves of log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 260 to 280 nm was correlated with the reactivity of natural organic matters roccaro et al 2015 while the content of metal noms was also positively associated with the slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 300 to 350 nm gao et al 2015 therefore the differential log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 260 280 nm 280 350 nm 300 350 nm and 350 400 nm would be also taken into consideration when conducting correlation analysis between differential log transformed absorbance spectra with membrane fouling in present study 3 5 2 correlations between differential log transformed absorbance spectra and membrane fouling to evaluate the possibility of applying differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling the correlation analysis between the degree of metal noms combination and the differential log transformed absorbance spectra was conducted previously given that the relationship between δs260 280 values and the size of bulk crystallization in the beginning of filtration was investigated and the results in fig 14 a implied that there exhibited a strong linear correlation between them r2 0 867 therefore the correlation analysis between δs260 280 values and filtration volume for plateau phase which could be considered as the short term membrane fouling in present study was further performed the great correlation coefficient r2 0 852 confirmed the reliability of differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy in predicting short term membrane fouling fig 14b it should be noted that the data utilized in the prediction came from the spectra in feed solution before filtration it meant that a reliable evaluation of short term membrane fouling could be easily obtained by differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy before the operation of membrane technology providing meaningful guidance in advance in supplementary material the research results of a supplementary experiment using actual water as study object further indicated the reliability of applicating differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting short term membrane fouling in practical nanofiltration process however δs260 280 values failed to significantly correlate with the size of bulk crystallization at the end of filtration r2 0 414 fig 14c while there also existed few correlations between δs260 280 and terminal scaling layer resistance the index of long term membrane fouling r2 0 617 fig 14d the reason why differential log transformed absorbance spectra failed to correlate with the size of bulk crystallization at the end of filtration or long term membrane fouling but correlated with short term membrane fouling could be the differential absorbance spectra s feather in independence to concentration of organic compounds yan et al 2013b it was already proved in section 3 3 that the short term membrane fouling was closely related to the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid independent to the concentration of humic acid while the long term membrane fouling was positively associated with the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution related to the concentration of humic acid the differential log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of 280 350 nm 300 350 nm and 350 400 nm were also used to fit the degree of metal noms combination and the short term membrane fouling via linear correlation table s 3 the results demonstrated that none of them could predict short term membrane fouling as efficiently as the δs260 280 values did therefore the differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy in the range of 260 280 nm was proved to be the most efficient way to predict short term membrane fouling 4 conclusions this study aimed to investigate the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in nanofiltration process and evaluate the reliability of applicating differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling the main conclusion can be drawn as follow the short term membrane fouling was continuously enhanced by increasing oxidation in nanofiltration process while the long term membrane fouling showed a downward trend after an initial increase these membrane behaviors resulted from the variation of physicochemical properties of feed solution under different oxidation conditions and the different fouling mechanisms during short term nanofiltration and long term nanofiltration in the beginning of filtration calcium ions preferred to combine with the humic acid molecules with higher density of carboxyl groups which were generated under stronger oxidation conditions and the bigger bulk crystallization was developed subsequently even though the humic acid was also more likely to be mineralized during the filtration calcium ions continuously adhered to the residual carboxyl groups on humic acid and then the bulk crystallization kept growing in feed solution eventually the size of bulk crystallization depended on the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution both of them were found decreasing after an initial increase with increasing dosage of oxidants the terminal fouling layer resistance also shared a similar tendency with them because the sem images showed that the deposition of bulk crystallization on membranes and the formation of dense scaling layer were the direct reasons for the long term membrane fouling furthermore the results of correlation analysis demonstrated that differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy especially in the wavelength range of 260 to 280 nm was a reliable approach to predict short term membrane fouling in nanofiltration process in present study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17109,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in different nanofiltration phases including the short term membrane flux behaviors and the long term ones on the basic of correlation analysis between the changing physicochemical properties of feed solution and membrane fouling the inner mechanisms were revealed from aspects of bulk crystallization interaction between humic acid and inorganic ions and surface crystallization compositions and morphologies of surface crystallization furthermore the reliability of applicating differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling was also systematically evaluated there was an upward trend in short term membrane fouling with increasing dosage of naclo while long term membrane fouling decreased after an initial increase during short term filtration the enhanced combination between inorganic ions and the humic acid with stronger density of carboxyl groups which was generated more easily under stronger oxidation conditions favored the earlier appearance of flux decline during long term filtration the size of bulk crystallization depended on the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution both of them increased firstly and then decreased with increasing oxidation the terminal fouling layer resistance also shared a similar tendency with them because the deposition of bulk crystallization on membranes and the formation of dense scaling layer were the direct reasons for the long term membrane fouling furthermore the differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy was proven to be an efficient approach to predict short term membrane fouling especially in the wavelength range of 260 to 280 nm this research could not only provide guidance on alleviating oxidation enhanced membrane fouling in nanofiltration but also propose an efficient way to predict the membrane fouling which was influenced by the

concerns when evaluating the performance of nanofiltration based process in water treatment process ren et al 2020 as the dominated fouling in nanofiltration process inorganic scaling usually resulted from the excess of solubility limit for slightly soluble salts not only in feed solution as bulk crystallization but also on membranes as surface crystallization lee and lee 2000 these scaling processes could be enhanced by coexisting pollutants especially natural organic compounds noms le gouellec and elimelech 2002 noms could interact with metal ions and then the combined network of crystal organics was generated favoring the formation of scaling precipitates wang et al 2016a our previous studies showed that humic acid could act as nuclei to enhance bulk crystallization and then favor the precipitation of inorganic crystals on membranes due to the electrostatic attraction between them lin et al 2020 oxidation was widely applied for degrading micro organic compounds enhancing coagulation disinfection and others in drinking water treatment process chen et al 2017 camel and bermond 1998 besides it was also considered as a reliable pretreatment to alleviate organic fouling in membranes filtration it meant that oxidation and nanofiltration could probably coexist in a same drinking water treatment process and the effects of oxidation on the performance of nanofiltration should not be neglected during oxidation organic pollutants could be partly degraded into carbon dioxide and water while nom molecules were also decomposed into smaller fragments cheng et al 2016 van geluwe et al 2011 despite that the potential effects of oxidation on inorganic organic combined fouling in nanofiltration was still controversial because the inorganic organic combination was more complicated than organics themselves let alone the crystallization development based on the combination for instance more carboxy groups might generated on noms after oxidation and then the combination between noms and metal ions was enhanced benefiting the precipitation of inorganic scaling seidel and elimelech 2002 xue et al 2016 this meant that the inorganic fouling on membranes might be aggravated by the enhanced deposition of bulk crystallization on the other hand the mineralization of noms might reduce the crystal nuclei and the latter was proven to favor the acceleration of crystallization process wang et al 2016a besides since the crystallization process consisted of the different steps of nucleation and sequent crystal growth and these steps showed different sensitivity to the coexisting pollutants in feed solution lin et al 2020 bhattacharjee and johnston 2002 oxidation might have different influences on crystallization in different filtration phases therefore the effects of oxidation on noms enhanced gypsum scaling in nanofiltration should be systematically investigated considering different dosage of oxidants and the membrane performance in different nanofiltration phases short term filtration and long term filtration despite the fact that the membrane fouling was depended on water qualities the measurement of single index failed to efficiently predict membrane fouling in nanofiltration because nanofiltration was governed by complex fouling mechanisms in different filtration phases lin et al 2019a however the membrane fouling in nanofiltration process could be always influenced by the interaction between organics and inorganics so the latter should be properly evaluated before the prediction of membrane fouling a number of methods for instance nica donnan models stockholm humic models and others have been applied for that purpose yan et al 2013a however these methods were also limited by some experiment challenges such as the necessary redetermination of equilibrium constants of different compounds and precipitates under different conditions differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy is another operational method that has been widely used to characterize the metal noms combination yan et al 2013b the absorbance spectra of feed solution were sensitive to the deprotonation of organic compounds yan and korshin 2014 furthermore the competition on binding the sites of carboxyl groups on organic compounds existed between inorganics and hydrogen ions proton during their interaction resulting in the variation of absorbance spectra gao et al 2015 given that differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy seems to be a reliable way to predict certain membrane fouling in nanofiltration but needs further investigation to the best of our knowledge no published literatures focused on these fields as illustrated in fig 1 this study aimed to evaluate the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in different phases of nanofiltration process both short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling were considered on the basic of correlation analysis between the changing physicochemical properties of feed solution and membrane fouling the inner mechanisms were revealed from the aspects of surface crystallization compositions and morphologies of surface crystallization and bulk crystallization interaction between humic acid and inorganic ions furthermore the reliability of applying differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling was also systematically evaluated in different range of wavelength the research results could not only provide guidance on alleviating oxidation enhanced membrane fouling in nanofiltration but also propose an operational approach to predict this certain type of membrane fouling efficiently 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed solution and membranes sodium sulphate na2so4 20 mm and calcium chloride cacl2 35 mm were used to make up of oversaturated brackish water 4 l both of them were purchased with american chemical society asc grade from aladdin industrial co ltd usa it should be noted that the concentration of these salts was made slightly higher than that of gypsum so that scaling could take place at a reasonable speed mi and elimelech 2010 wang et al 2016b humic acid ha was chosen to represent the humic substance in natural water environment and supplied by sigma aldrich co ltd usa in powder form to make the stock solution 2g l humic acid powder was dissolved in sodium hydroxide naoh aqueous solution 0 01 mm and then stirred by a magnetic stirrer for at least 24 h before adjusting ph back to neutral with hydrochloric acid hcl aqueous solution 0 1 mm before the pre oxidation and filtration experiment it was diluted in feed solution with the concentration of 5 mg l to enhance gypsum scaling during the analysis of absorbance spectra reference solution only consisted of humic acid 5 mg l and a certain dosage of oxidant but without any salts polyamide thin film composite tfc membranes nf270 dow filmetc usa were applied throughout this study the characterizations of the membranes were presented in table s 1 in the supplementary material raw membranes should be rewetted in sodium bisulfite nahso3 aqueous solution 1 5 wt and then washed by ultrapure water for at least 3 times before filtration membranes were soaked in ultrapure water in the dark 2 2 experiment setups 2 2 1 pre oxidation on one hand hypochlorite clo is widely applied in drinking water treatment process for disinfection coagulation enhancement algae removal and others because it is suitable for long distance transportation and long time storage yang et al 2016 yu et al 2015 ding et al 2020 hence the existence of hypochlorite should be considered in the influent of nanofiltration on the other hand the reduction products of hypochlorite mainly consist of strong electrolytes instead of weak electrolytes which were proved to influence crystallization process as crystal nuclei lin et al 2019b hence the application of hypochlorite will be helpful for this study to distinguish the effects of oxidation on the physicochemical properties of organic matters which might further influence the combination between organics and inorganics based on the above analysis sodium hypochlorite naclo was chosen to represent typical oxidants in this study as presented in fig 2 the pre oxidation experiments were conducted in a 5 l breaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer naclo was added in feed solution to induce oxidation and its dosage varied from 0 to 1 9 0 0 3 0 6 1 0 1 9 mg mg total organic carbon toc in different experiments during the oxidation procedure it was stirred with the speed of 300 r min for 20 min subsequently 4 ml 0 5 m sodium sulfite na2so3 was spiked into the feed solution to quench the residual oxidation for avoiding the damage to nanofiltration membranes 2 2 2 nanofiltration filtration the membrane filtration was conducted in a cross flow nanofiltration system consisting of membrane module pressure pump thermostatic bath flowmeter valves and pipes fig 2 during filtration the filtrate from membrane module effective area 42 cm2 was collected by an erlenmeyer flask and weighted by an electronic balance which data were transferred to an affiliated computer and then used to calculate membrane flux j the working pressure of nanofiltration system δpw was kept at 0 7 mpa by pressure pump crossflow rate of membrane module was set of 30 l h and monitored by flowmeter the filtration was conducted at room temperature 25 with the help of thermostatic bath it should be noted that nanofiltration membranes were equilibrated by sodium chloride nacl aqueous solution with the same ionic strength of feed solution 165 mm previously to acquire the initial membrane flux j0 before the official filtration experiments according to resistance in series models lin et al 2009 total resistance rt consisted of membrane resistance rm and membrane scaling layer resistance rs as presented in eq 1 and 2 j0 was used to calculate rm while rt could be calculated by j therefore membrane scaling layer resistance rs could be obtained when rt minus rm eq 3 besides normalized flux was defined as the ratio of the membrane flux during filtration to the initial membrane flux eq 4 1 r m δ p w μ j 0 2 r t δ p w μ j 3 r s r t r m δ p w μ j δ p w μ j 0 4 n o r m a i l i z e d f l u x j j 0 while μ is dynamic viscosity of water at room temperature 0 8937 10 3 pa s the detailed composition of feed solution for filtration experiments and reference solution for differential absorbance spectroscopy were listed in table 1 all the experiments would be conducted at least in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods and formulas 2 3 1 characterization of membrane scaling layer scaling deposited and accumulated on nanofiltration membranes during the filtration to distinguish the specific composition of membrane scaling scaling on membranes with an area of about 1 cm2 should be soaked and dissolved in 40 ml ultrapure water before further detection for avoiding the unnecessary experimental error from insolvable scaling and its damage to the instruments 500 μl hcl 1 m was spiked into the ultrapure water simultaneously after the pretreatment inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 5300 dv perkinelmer usa was applied to investigate the concentration of calcium in solution and ion chromatograph integerion hpic theromfisher usa was responsible for determining the concentration of sulfate scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200feg fei usa was used to perform an autopsy on the morphologies of membrane scaling layer the magnification of autopsy was maintained at 50 times the original size before the autopsy fouled membranes should be dehydrated in a vacuum drying oven dzf 6050 yiheng instruments china and sputtered with platinum for more than 120 s in an ion sputter coater mc1000 hitachi japan during the drying process the membranes should be kept in a vertical form to avoid the salts crystallization from residual feed solution 2 3 2 physicochemical properties of feed solution total organic carbon analyzer multi n c jena germany was performed to analyze the toc of feed solution after oxidation both zeta potential and particle size distribution of feed solution were measured by a zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk to evaluate the effects of oxidation on carboxyl groups concentration of humic acid and the bulk crystallization in feed solution respectively 2 3 3 differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy could efficiently reflect the nature and extent of interactions between metal cations and dissolved organic matters gao et al 2015 the calculation process was presented as below according to eq 5 and 6 both the differential absorbance spectra δaλ and differential log transformed absorbance spectra δlnaλ could be calculated by raw absorbance data 5 δ a λ a λ a λ r e f e r e n c e 6 δ ln a λ l n a λ l n a λ r e f e r e n c e while aλ was the absorbance of feed solution at certain wavelength λ aλ reference was the absorbance of humic acid reference solution with the same extent of oxidation but without gypsum at certain wavelength λ before the application of differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy the slope of linear correlation that fits the log transformed absorbance spectra in the certain range of wavelength should be calculated using eq 7 previously the differential log transformed absorbance spectra were defined as the difference between the slope in feed solution and the slope in reference solution eq 8 7 s λ 1 λ 2 l n a λ 1 l n a λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 8 δ s λ 1 λ 2 s λ 1 λ 2 s λ 1 r e f e r e n c e λ 2 r e f e r e n c e l n a λ 1 l n a λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 l n a λ

conducted to investigate the relationships between membrane fouling and differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy using linear fitting in origin version 2019b originlab usa the correlation was determined by correlation coefficient r2 correlation was stronger when r2 was closer to 1 correlation was weaker when r2 was closer to 0 both short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling were taken into consideration during the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of normalized flux and scaling layer resistance during filtration the curves of normalized flux and scaling layer resistance during nanofiltration were drawn in fig 3 without humic acid or oxidation salts solution could still induce obvious flux decline and continuous resistance increasement fig 3a however the flux curve did not decrease remarkably in the beginning of filtration until a certain volume of feed solution was filtrated this phenomenon was consistent with some previous studies in which scientists found that a delayed period before flux decline was required during the nanofiltration of brackish water lin et al 2005 it could be attributed to the necessary time for sufficient nuclei to generate in feed solution since a whole crystallization process consists of the different steps of nucleation and sequent crystal growth lin et al 2020 bhattacharjee and johnston 2002 and the scaling layer developed in this phase was loose and porous therefore it was indicated that a whole filtration process could be divided into two sequent phases in present study namely plateau and decline in plateau phase few flux declines were observed and the curve of scaling layer resistance remained horizontal on the contrary flux curve decreased sharply in decline phase and the most significant scaling layer resistance was developed at the end of this phase probably because significant crystallization could occur once sufficient nuclei formed leading to obvious cake formation after the deposition of crystallization lin et al 2005 similar phenomena could also be observed when the humic acid contaminated feed solution was pre oxidized fig 3b 3f though the influence of oxidation on the filtration volume for plateau phase and the terminal scaling layer resistance which could be considered as the reflection of short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling respectively in present study varied in different experiments the variation of filtration volume for plateau phase was fully summarized in fig 4 it could be seen that the filtration volume for plateau phase maintained at 118 2 ml in control groups but decreased significantly to 89 1 ml with the adding of humic acid in feed solution even though our previous study also indicated that single humic acid failed to cause obvious flux decline in nanofiltration process lin et al 2019c it could act as nuclei to remarkably enhance gypsum scaling and then deteriorate short term membrane fouling wang et al 2016a furthermore the filtration volume was on the decrease when the dosage of oxidants increased from 0 to 1 9 mg mg toc indicating the continuously enhanced short term membrane fouling by naclo oxidation probably because of the faster generation of crystal nuclei hoek and elimelech 2003 the most dramatic short term membrane fouling was developed when the feed solution was oxidized by 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo which filtration volume for plateau phase dropped to 52 1 ml however the variation of long term membrane fouling under different oxidation conditions fail to share a similar tendency with the variation of short term membrane fouling all the time fig 4 when the dosage of oxidants increased from 0 to 0 6 mg mg toc there was a marked growth in the terminal scaling layer resistance rising from 6 47 1013 m 1 to 2 72 1014 m 1 instead of increasing continuously a notable downward trend formed in long term membrane fouling when feed solutions were oxidized by more naclo only 2 33 1014 m 1 and 2 10 1014 m 1 resistances could be developed with 1 3 and 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo respectively it was indicated that the long term membrane fouling was alleviated to some extent after an initial enhancement with increasing oxidation these membrane flux behaviors indicated that naclo aggravated the membrane fouling in nanofiltration process however xing et al considered naclo based oxidation process as an efficient pretreatment strategy to remarkably mitigate ultrafiltration membrane fouling xing et al 2019 the difference between these two studies could result from the different fouling mechanisms in nanofiltration and ultrafiltration in oxidation ultrafiltration combined process oxidation could mineralize the organic pollutants and then the organic fouling was alleviated accordingly cheng et al 2019 however single ha was proven to hardly induce obvious membrane fouling in nanofiltration process lin et al 2019c meanwhile inorganic fouling usually predominated nanofiltration membrane fouling because of the efficient retention of ions by nanofiltration membranes matin et al 2019 in section 3 2 the specific composition of fouling layers also showed that the membrane fouling layer mainly consisted of inorganic gypsum therefore the phenomena mentioned above might result from the different effects of oxidation on the physicochemical properties of organic pollutants and the variation of inorganic organic interaction instead of the mere mineralization of organic matters these hypotheses would be further verified from the perspective of the crystallization development and the changing physicochemical properties of feed solution in following sections 3 2 characterization of surface crystallization and bulk crystallization 3 2 1 surface crystallization according to the surface blockage mechanisms scaling layer could form on membrane surface due to the growth of crystals blocking membrane pores seriously lee et al 1999 in fig 5 the specific composition of scaling layer on nanofiltration membranes was investigated as surface crystallization considering calcium and sulfate concentration compared with control groups ha could considerably enhance the surface crystallization which calcium scaling concentration increased from 7210 9 mg m2 to 7845 3 mg m2 furthermore the figure climbed to 8024 4 mg m2 with 0 3 mg mg toc of naclo after which it rose steadily with more oxidants in feed solution and then grew to 14635 3 mg m2 with 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo the rising trend could be also seen in the variation of sulfate scaling concentration under different oxidation conditions the sulfate concentration was expected to rise to 28230 3 mg m2 with 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo more than two times the figure for control groups only 13628 1 mg m2 the correlation analysis showed that neither calcium scaling concentration nor sulfate scaling concentration variation shared a consistent tendency with the variation of terminal scaling layer resistance under different oxidation conditions table s 2 indicating that foulant concentration on membranes was not the main reason resulting in the difference of long term membrane fouling in present study it has been proven that both foulant concentration on membranes and morphologies of membrane fouling layer could be responsible for flux decline and fouling layer resistance akhondi et al 2015 given that the morphologies of membrane scaling layer were further scanned by sem and the images were presented in fig 6 as seen in fig 6a the scaling layer was found broken and incomplete in control groups even though the integrity of scaling layer could be considerably promoted by humic acid crystallization was still found acicular and dendritic fig 6b the lamellar scaling in fig 6c and fig 6d indicated oxidation could enlarge the size of crystals and induce denser scaling layer to some extent especially when naclo was applied with the dosage of 0 6 mg mg toc however further increase of oxidants fail to enhance crystallization as expected but had a negative effect on the integrity of scaling layer resulting in porous structure observed in fig 6e and fig 6f which could be the direct reason for the alleviation of membrane scaling layer resistance under strong oxidation conditions 1 0 and 1 9 mg naclo mg toc 3 2 2 bulk crystallization the structures of pollutants had a great impact on the membrane fouling mechanisms not only in ultrafiltration process cheng et al 2016 but also in nanofiltration process yu et al 2018 during filtration the crystals formed in bulk phase could also deposit on membranes forming a scaling layer and coming up with flux decline lee et al 1999 meanwhile the size of bulk crystallization also represented the degree of interaction between humic acid and gypsum because their interaction was beneficial of scaling precipitation wang et al 2016a therefore to descript the membrane fouling process during nanofiltration on the scale of nanometer the nanoparticle size distribution of bulk crystallization in feed solution was monitored not only in the beginning of filtration but also at the end of it fig 7 in the beginning of filtration few bulk crystallizations were developed in feed solution without oxidation but the average particle size of them gradually increased with increasing dosage of oxidants rising to 643 5 nm with 1 9 mg mg toc of naclo indicating the enhanced interaction between humic acid and gypsum by oxidation in a short time yu et al 2016 contracting the particle size distribution of bulk crystallization in the beginning of filtration with that at the end of filtration it was notable that the bulk crystallization preferred to grow continuously during the filtration rather than remain unchanged for example despite the fact that the particle size distribution of the bulk crystallization in naclo 0 6 feed solution only varied from 295 nm to 342 nm in the beginning of filtration most of them spread in an area between 1280 nm and 1720 nm at the end of filtration which were also the largest among all experiments similar to the variation of terminal membrane scaling resistance the average particle size of bulk crystallization also showed a decreasing trend after an initial increase when the dosage of naclo was continuously increased furthermore the results of correlation analysis indicated that the oxidation enhanced membrane fouling was positively associated with the development of bulk crystallization table 2 not matter in short term filtration but also in long term filtration it could be concluded that the membrane fouling was aggravated with the enhanced combination between humic acid and gypsum although the measurement of the particle size of bulk crystallization could benefit the understanding of the mechanisms of humic acid enhanced nanofiltration scaling influenced by oxidation it was conducted in parallel to the filtration indicating its infeasibility to predict long term membrane fouling 3 3 physicochemical properties of feed solution 3 3 1 zeta potential and toc the carboxyl groups of humic acid could attract metal cations quickly through electrostatic interaction and benefited the precipitation of scaling arkhangelsky et al 2012 according to previous studies zeta potential could reflect the charge properties of organic matters which might originate from the ionization of carboxyl groups yin et al 2020 specifically zeta potential up to ph 8 0 was due to the deprotonation of carboxyl groups while zeta potential at higher ph was attributed to the phenolic groups collins et al 1986 in this study the ph of feed solution was strictly maintained at 7 0 hence zeta potential could be used to efficiently evaluate the abundance of carboxyl groups furthermore the toc of feed solutions were also measured to determine the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid as illustrated in fig 8 the zeta potential in naclo 0 group was 8 61 mv in marked contrast to 1 55 mv of control groups furthermore zeta potential decreased gradually after an initial increase when the humic acid involved feed solution was continuously oxidized by naclo the most negative zeta potential was measured in naclo 0 6 groups dipping to 10 32 mv and attributing to the most generation of carboxyl groups in feed solution on the other hand toc showed a moderate decrease to 2 84 mg l in naclo 1 9 groups while 3 10 mg l toc was provided in the feed solution without oxidation these results showed that the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution would decrease after an initial increase with increasing oxidation when humic acid was more likely to be mineralized with higher dosage of naclo the ratio of zeta potential to toc was further calculated and summarized in figure s 1 in present study zeta potential reflected the richness of total carboxyl groups in feed solution while the zeta potential per toc could be used to evaluate the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid these results implied that the there was an upward tendency for the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid a downward tendency for zeta potential per toc with the aggravation of oxidation generally speaking the total content of carboxyl groups on humic acid was increased firstly and then decreased with increasing oxidation while the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid was continuously increased because humic acid was also mineralized during the reaction based on the analysis of water quality section 3 3 1 and the development of crystallization section 3 2 2 the mechanisms of the changing membrane fouling behaviors under different oxidation conditions were further revealed from the perspective of the interaction between the carboxyl groups of organic matters and inorganic ions in section 3 3 2 3 3 2 correlations analysis between membrane fouling and water quality the correlations between different membrane fouling short term membrane fouling and long term membrane fouling and the physicochemical properties of feed solution were systematically estimated the fitting formulas and coefficients of determination r2 were presented in fig 9 when investigating the relationships between long term membrane fouling and water quality zeta potential was found exhibiting a strong correlation with terminal scaling layer resistance fig 9a r2 0 898 and the latter would near linearly decrease with the increase of zeta potential slope 1 18 1014 it was concluded that the terminal scaling layer resistance increased with increasing content of carboxyl groups in feed solution in this study the long term membrane fouling was also aggravated with the enhanced combination between humic acid and calcium ions table 2 these results indicated that the enhanced metal noms combination synchronized with the increase of carboxyl groups in feed solution these findings were consistent with the phenomena in a previous study that the carboxyl groups of humic acid could attract metal cations quickly through electrostatic interaction and benefited the precipitation of scaling arkhangelsky et al 2012 during the long term filtration the bulk crystallization deposited on membranes and formed a dense scaling layer which could block up the membrane pores and induce flux decline her et al 2000 dydo et al 2004 therefore it could be easily concluded that oxidation could continuously enhance the long term membrane fouling by the means of increasing the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution fig 9a enhancing the metal noms combination and then enhancing the bulk crystallization fig 7 when the dosage of naclo was limited to less than 0 6 mg mg toc however excessive naclo alleviated the long term membrane fouling to some extent instead of continuously deteriorating it probably because humic acid was partly mineralized when more than 0 6 mg mg toc naclo was added fig 8 and then the metal noms combination was weakened fig 7 besides the measure of zeta potential in feed solution was proven to be an efficient way to evaluate the potential of long term membrane fouling in fig 9b the relationships between long term membrane fouling and the ratio of zeta potential to toc were also investigated but there was no reliable correlation the relationships between short term membrane fouling and water quality were also investigated in present study though zeta potential seemed to be slightly associated with the filtration volume for plateau phase fig 9c r2 0 795 the ratio of zeta potential to toc showed a more significant correlation with short term membrane fouling fig 9d r2 0 955 besides the positive value of the fitting formula in fig 9d indicated that short term membrane fouling could be remarkably enhanced when zeta potential per toc increased slope 218 54 it meant that the degree of short term membrane fouling was positively related to the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid as mentioned in section 3 2 2 the short term membrane fouling degree was also dependent on the particle size of bulk crystallization which could reflect the degree of combination between humic acid and calcium ions in the beginning of filtration therefore the fouling process could be drawn as follow in a short time calcium ions were more likely to adhere to humic acid molecule with higher density of carboxyl groups which was developed under strong oxidation conditions instead of the humic acid molecule with lower density of carboxyl groups which was developed under weak oxidation conditions even though the toc of feed solution was higher under weak oxidation conditions however there still did not exist any obvious flux decline until certain amount of bulk crystallization accumulated on membrane surface and the flux decline appeared earlier if the metal noms combination was stronger and the generation of sufficient crystal nuclei was faster 3 4 elaboration of the mechanisms about the oxidation influenced membrane fouling behaviors in nanofiltration process based on the analysis mentioned above the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in nanofiltration process were described in fig 10 in the feed solution oxidation had at least two different effects on humic acid including the increase of density of carboxyl groups and the mineralization of organic matters both of them were positively associated with the dosage of oxidants therefore the total content of carboxyl groups on humic acid showed a decreasing trend after an initial increase with increasing oxidants in the beginning of filtration calcium ions preferred to combined with the humic acid molecule with higher density of carboxyl groups and then the stronger bulk crystallization was developed favoring the earlier appearance of flux decline in nanofiltration however the mechanisms of long term membrane fouling were slightly different from the short term ones during the long term filtration calcium ions could fully interact with the carboxyl groups of humic acid therefore the long term particle size of bulk crystallization was dependent on the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution it was found decreasing after an initial increase with increasing dosage of oxidants because humic acid was efficiently mineralized under strong oxidation conditions and the long term membrane fouling degree also shared a similar tendency with the size of bulk crystallization because the deposition of bulk crystallization on membranes and formation of dense scaling layer were the direct reasons for long term membrane fouling considering the performance of oxidation influenced nanofiltration process and the inner mechanisms it is suggested that the dosage of oxidants applied before nanofiltration should be strictly controlled otherwise the oxidation strategies in nanofiltration should be changed from pretreatment to posttreatment as far as possible to avoid the enhanced metal noms combination and membrane fouling 3 5 effect of pre oxidation on the absorbance spectra of humic acid although the variation of bulk crystallization size shared similar tendencies with not only short term membrane fouling but also long term membrane fouling in present study table 2 its measure was complicated and failed to predict membrane fouling before filtration the filtration had already finished before the particle size of bulk crystallization for correlating with long term membrane fouling was measured section 3 2 on the other hand zeta potential of feed solution could be a reasonable index to predict terminal membrane scaling resistance but the extra measure of toc was needed for predicting short term membrane fouling and the results could not be obtained in real time section 3 3 given that another operational and fast approach should be developed to predict the short term membrane fouling in nanofiltration process in this section the reliability of applying differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy on predicting membrane fouling was systematically evaluated on the basic of correlation analysis 3 5 1 absorbance spectra differential absorbance spectra and differential log transformed absorbance spectra of humic acid the absorbance of feed solution and reference solution in the beginning of filtration were presented in fig 11 there was a nearly exponential decrease in the absorbance intensity with increasing wavelength in feed solution fig 11a though the difference of absorbance curves could be hardly recognized between different feed solution the changes in spectra of reference solution were conspicuous and followed certain rules with more dosage of naclo fig 11b according to eq 5 the differential absorbance spectra between them could be calculated and it was also found discernible in fig 12 a with a negative peak at the wavelength of about 220 nm meanwhile the intensity of this peak dropped from 0 102 to 0 074 with the increasing dosage of naclo from 0 to 1 9 mg mg toc probably because of the different degree of deprotonation on carboxyl groups on humic acid under different oxidation conditions dryer et al 2008 similar phenomena could be also observed in the differential absorbance spectra between feed solution and reference solution at the end of filtration fig 12b though the absorbance spectra of different solution were also expected to coincide figure s 2 given that it was speculated that the differential absorbance spectroscopy could be a potential approach to evaluate the degree of interaction between humic acid and calcium ions one of the major constituents of gypsum and even the membrane fouling the log transformed absorbance spectra of the feed solution in the beginning of filtration and at the end of it were illustrated in fig 13 a and fig 13b respectively it was showed that the oxidized feed solution had a stronger intensity of log transformed absorbance spectra than the unoxidized feed solution at any time because oxidation could promote the extent of metal binding by humic acid fig 7 by the means of increasing the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid figure s 1 the intensity of log transformed absorbance spectra was also stronger in feed solution at the end of filtration than that in the beginning of filtration probably because the combination between humic acid and calcium ions was continuously enhanced during filtration fig 7 on the other hand the log transformed absorbance spectra decreased near linearly with stable increasing wavelength from 200 to 400 nm though the slopes varied in different band as shown in fig 13a the spectra curve declined rapidly with increasing wavelength in the range of 200 to 230 nm furthermore two inflections were developed at the wavelength of about 240 nm and 270 nm compared with the slopes fitting the curves between 200 and 230 nm the slopes were gentler not only in the 260 280 nm range but also in the 300 400 nm range according to previous studies the slopes fitted the curves of log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 260 to 280 nm was correlated with the reactivity of natural organic matters roccaro et al 2015 while the content of metal noms was also positively associated with the slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 300 to 350 nm gao et al 2015 therefore the differential log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 260 280 nm 280 350 nm 300 350 nm and 350 400 nm would be also taken into consideration when conducting correlation analysis between differential log transformed absorbance spectra with membrane fouling in present study 3 5 2 correlations between differential log transformed absorbance spectra and membrane fouling to evaluate the possibility of applying differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling the correlation analysis between the degree of metal noms combination and the differential log transformed absorbance spectra was conducted previously given that the relationship between δs260 280 values and the size of bulk crystallization in the beginning of filtration was investigated and the results in fig 14 a implied that there exhibited a strong linear correlation between them r2 0 867 therefore the correlation analysis between δs260 280 values and filtration volume for plateau phase which could be considered as the short term membrane fouling in present study was further performed the great correlation coefficient r2 0 852 confirmed the reliability of differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy in predicting short term membrane fouling fig 14b it should be noted that the data utilized in the prediction came from the spectra in feed solution before filtration it meant that a reliable evaluation of short term membrane fouling could be easily obtained by differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy before the operation of membrane technology providing meaningful guidance in advance in supplementary material the research results of a supplementary experiment using actual water as study object further indicated the reliability of applicating differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting short term membrane fouling in practical nanofiltration process however δs260 280 values failed to significantly correlate with the size of bulk crystallization at the end of filtration r2 0 414 fig 14c while there also existed few correlations between δs260 280 and terminal scaling layer resistance the index of long term membrane fouling r2 0 617 fig 14d the reason why differential log transformed absorbance spectra failed to correlate with the size of bulk crystallization at the end of filtration or long term membrane fouling but correlated with short term membrane fouling could be the differential absorbance spectra s feather in independence to concentration of organic compounds yan et al 2013b it was already proved in section 3 3 that the short term membrane fouling was closely related to the density of carboxyl groups on humic acid independent to the concentration of humic acid while the long term membrane fouling was positively associated with the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution related to the concentration of humic acid the differential log transformed absorbance spectra in the range of 280 350 nm 300 350 nm and 350 400 nm were also used to fit the degree of metal noms combination and the short term membrane fouling via linear correlation table s 3 the results demonstrated that none of them could predict short term membrane fouling as efficiently as the δs260 280 values did therefore the differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy in the range of 260 280 nm was proved to be the most efficient way to predict short term membrane fouling 4 conclusions this study aimed to investigate the effects of oxidation on humic acid enhanced gypsum scaling in nanofiltration process and evaluate the reliability of applicating differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy for predicting membrane fouling the main conclusion can be drawn as follow the short term membrane fouling was continuously enhanced by increasing oxidation in nanofiltration process while the long term membrane fouling showed a downward trend after an initial increase these membrane behaviors resulted from the variation of physicochemical properties of feed solution under different oxidation conditions and the different fouling mechanisms during short term nanofiltration and long term nanofiltration in the beginning of filtration calcium ions preferred to combine with the humic acid molecules with higher density of carboxyl groups which were generated under stronger oxidation conditions and the bigger bulk crystallization was developed subsequently even though the humic acid was also more likely to be mineralized during the filtration calcium ions continuously adhered to the residual carboxyl groups on humic acid and then the bulk crystallization kept growing in feed solution eventually the size of bulk crystallization depended on the total content of carboxyl groups in feed solution both of them were found decreasing after an initial increase with increasing dosage of oxidants the terminal fouling layer resistance also shared a similar tendency with them because the sem images showed that the deposition of bulk crystallization on membranes and the formation of dense scaling layer were the direct reasons for the long term membrane fouling furthermore the results of correlation analysis demonstrated that differential log transformed absorbance spectroscopy especially in the wavelength range of 260 to 280 nm was a reliable approach to predict short term membrane fouling in nanofiltration process in present study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
