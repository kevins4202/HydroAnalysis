18270,combined sewer overflows contain a highly variable wide range of contaminants both in particulate and soluble form making conventional water treatment processes unable to offer adequate public health protection in this study an integrated treatment process designed to simultaneously remove typical combined sewer overflow pollutants suspended solids chemical oxygen depends turbidity in conjunction with nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus was developed the removal of particulates as well as dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus was achieved by first adsorbing soluble pollutants on zeolite and powdered activated carbon and subsequently applying filtration carried out by polymer enhanced microsieving laboratory experiments were designed using design of experiment techniques and carried out to assess the effects of the various treatment variables cationic polymer zeolite powder activated carbon and microsieve size in the designed combinations a response surface model was fitted to the experimental dataset in order to capture and describe the non linear relationships between treatment variables and treatment objectives finally an optimization study was carried out using pareto analysis showing that cationic polymer zeolite and powdered activated carbon followed by fine mesh microsieving worked synergistically in the integrated treatment process several optimal process conditions emerged in particular a treatment combination consisting of 1 1 mg l of the cationic polymer 250 mg l of zeolite 5 mg l of powdered activated carbon and a 370 μm mesh size under this condition expected performance would be reductions of 72 56 35 and 75 for turbidity total kjeldahl nitrogen total chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorous respectively the findings presented in this paper demonstrate the possibility of achieving multiple treatment objectives in a single and integrated treatment step hence providing municipalities with viable treatment options where the

and combined sewer overflows csos are reported as one of the main factors affecting the water quality of receiving bodies anne sophie et al 2015 bryan ellis and yu 1995 eganhouse and sherblom 2001 gasperi et al 2008 passerat et al 2011a riechel et al 2016 usepa 2004 consequently developing strategies for cso management has become central in the environmental agenda of municipalities around the world exacerbated by the limitations of combined sewer system css infrastructure and or the limited capacity of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps furthermore the additional flow generated by extreme wet weather events could lead to a bypass of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and untreated wastewater being discharged directly into the environment as a result oxygen depleting matter and pathogens are discharged into the environment together with solids nutrients and other micropollutants including heavy metals and chemicals of emerging concern usepa 2004 for the last two decades stormwater management strategies have been centred around mitigating the cso impacts by reducing runoff volume or peak flow by employing storage facilities and retention treatment basins li et al 2004 however since locations associated with cso discharges are typically not easily accessible and often space limited the design operation and management of these facilities may be complex as a result there is a need to develop new space efficient treatment schemes able to remove a broad spectrum of pollutants in a single and multifunctional train gasperi et al 2008 2010 iannuzzi et al 1997 launay et al 2016 soonthornnonda and christensen 2008 passerat et al 2011 highlighted that sewer sediments were estimated to contribute to about 75 of the solid matter 10 70 of the e coli about 77 attached to the solid matters and 40 80 of the intestinal enterococci that were discharged by overflows therefore effective removal of particulate matters from cso water could immediately lead to improve the performance of disinfection processes by which the inactivation of microorganism occurs chhetri et al 2014 gehr et al 2003 kitis 2004 wojtenko et al 2001 to date a number of studies bridoux et al 1998 delporte et al 1995 ebeling et al 2003 el gendy et al 2008 gasperi et al 2012a plum et al 1998 have examined the performance of physico chemical treatment such as coagulation flocculation on the removal of particulate matter by using polymer as primary coagulant a process entailing the neutralization of negative charge and allows small particles to react with the polymer to form insoluble precipitates before flocculation of the solids commences bolto et al 2001 scherrenberg et al 2006 to achieve advanced nitrogen control the removal of particulate nitrogen is not sufficient as ammonium is mostly present in dissolved form a review paper on the application of zeolite for wastewater treatment wang and peng 2010 reported that natural zeolite is a promising technique for the removal of ammonium due to the low costs and its physico chemical proprieties such as the high cation exchange and sorption capacity liao et al 2015 however its adsorption efficiency may be reduced by the presence of organic matters on the other hand powdered activated carbon pac is the most widely applied adsorption material for the removal of dissolved organics gai and kim 2008 ma et al 2013 scherrenberg et al 2006 seo et al 1997 moreover a synergistic effect of zeolite and activated carbon on the removal of nutrients and organic contaminants has been reported by malekmohammadi 2016 and liao et al 2015 in these works the authors stated that a mixture of carbon and zeolite increases the adsorption efficiency against nutrients and organic pollutants while neither could remove the pollutants if used alone table 1 summarizes information available in the literature on the effectiveness of treatment by cationic polymer pac zeolite and microsieving process when taken individually to remove specific cso pollutants the goal of this study was to develop and assess the performance of an integrated treatment process able to simultaneously remove nutrients and cso pollutants in a multifunctional reactor the main advantage of using a multifunctional reactor is to carry multiple functions at the same time i e coagulation adsorption and filtration and in a single unit this new approach opens the possibility for municipalities to address cso and nutrient pollution with a single capital upgrade more specifically the integrated treatment process relies on multiple treatment agents combined in a single multifunctional process where fine particles such as zeolite and powdered activated carbon first adsorb soluble nutrient and are subsequently removed by polymer enhanced microsieving allowing the removal of both soluble and particulate pollutants in a single treatment step furthermore this work describes an innovative method for the removal of ammonia via a dual mechanism of ammonia capture by zeolite absorption followed by zeolites removal by polymer coagulation and microsieving filtration by polymer coagulation smaller particles of zeolite were incorporated into bigger particles and easily removed by microsieving in order to do so we first investigated the efficiency of the individual treatment agents and then explored the synergies achieved when the chemicals were dosed simultaneously in an integrated treatment process targeting the removal of particulate cso pollutants such as turbidity and chemical oxygen demand as well as dissolved nutrients ammonium and nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of wastewater and analytical measurements primary influent pi was used as a surrogate to establish cso treatment efficiency during bench scale experiments samples were collected manually from the greenway wwtp located in london ontario canada the city of london is characterized by approximately 2750 km km of the sanitary storm and combined sewers greenway wwtp is one of the six wastewater treatment plants with a combined rated capacity of 152 million litres per day and an average daily flow of 117 million litres per day in 2018 city of london corporation 2016 the plant receives wastewater from approximately 9100 ha and services a population of 180 000 equivalent inhabitants with a combination of industrial wastewater residential sewage including the combined sewers from the older parts of the city for each sample the level of turbidity was measured by a hach 2100 turbidimeter following the nephelometric method standard method 2130b turbidity was used as an indicator of removal efficiency for particulate matter since a linear correlation between turbidity and tss exists hannouche et al 2012 ru et al 2013 cod tests were carried out by standard method 5220 d the soluble cod s cod was measured by filtering samples through a 0 45 μm pore size filters and the particulate cod p cod measurement was obtained by subtracting s cod from the total cod t cod tkn was used to quantify the amount of nitrogen contained in organic form and it was determined by digestion and distillation standard method 4500 norgc tp was measured following standard method 4500 p 2 2 chemically enhanced pre treatment the coagulation flocculation process was performed on the collected samples using 1 l of raw wastewater experiments were carried out using the jar test method in 1 l beakers where polymer pac and zeolite were mixed simultaneously natural zeolite particle size of 0 42 mm bulk density 45 50 lbs ft 3 used in this study was obtained from st cloud mining company winston new mexico pac grain size of 10 220 μm total surface area 650 m2 g 1 bulk density 0 51 g ml 1 was purchased from cabot norit americas company marshall usa cationic acrylamide polymer pg 906 was used as coagulant with 10 mole charge purchased from chemtreat company virginia usa the jar test employed the following steps 1 rapid mix at a constant speed of 200 rpm for 1 min to maximize the destabilization of colloidal particles and initiate coagulation 2 slow mix at a constant speed of 20 rpm for 2 min to increase the number of contact events among treating agents and particles and to facilitate the development of large flocs and 3 the last step was the settling stage after the coagulation flocculation process water was filtered through meshes of three different pore sizes 158 350 and 500 μm table 2 summarizes the employed ranges of mesh size the dosage of polymer pac and zeolite at the end of each treatment turbidity s cod p cod tkn and tp were analyzed results were compared with the concentration of pollutants in the collected samples to assess the treatment efficiency in terms of percentage removal 2 3 design of experiments and response surface analysis the box behnken bb doe scheme with four factor and three levels for each factor was selected as experimental design for this study the bb doe is an independent quadratic design in which the combinations of experimental plans are located at the midpoints of edges and at the center of the process space the number of experimental points n is defined by the expression n 2k k 1 c0 where k is the number of factors and c0 is the number of center points ferreira et al 2007 as reported by zolgharnein et al 2013 the bb doe requires fewer combinations of the independent variables i e the treatment agents to estimate a potentially complex response function when compared with the central composite design ccd this is in line with the findings by ferreira et al 2007 who demonstrated that the bb doe is an adequate scheme for response surface modelling rsm and subsequent optimization studies in case of non linear relationships among independent and dependent variables as a matter of fact based on previous studies ghafari et al 2009 liao et al 2015 trinh and kang 2010 wang et al 2011 the relationship between the treatment agents and removal is expected to be non linear in the case of physico chemical processes applied to water treatment therefore a second order model must be used as a surface response to fit the data and identify the optimal treatment conditions as shown in table 2 polymer pac zeolite and mesh size were placed at one of three equally spaced values coded as 1 0 1 the responses were expressed as a second order polynomial equation and a mathematical model was developed according to eq 1 1 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 β 5 x 1 2 β 6 x 2 2 β 7 x 3 2 β 8 x 4 2 β 9 x 1 x 2 β 10 x 1 x 3 β 11 x 1 x 4 β 12 x 2 x 3 β 13 x 2 x 4 β 14 x 3 x 4 where y is the predicted response in terms of pollutant removal β 0 is the constant coefficient x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the independent variables which influence the predicted response y β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are the linear coefficients β 5 β 6 β 7 and β 8 are the quadratic coefficient and β 9 β 10 β 11 β 12 β 13 and β 14 are the cross product coefficients the model equation easily clarifies the interaction effect such as synergism antagonism and addition of the independent parameters the statistical significance of each variable was analyzed by observing the p value p values less than 5 p 0 05 indicates that the variable is considered to be statistically significant the validity of each model was expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 ranged between 0 and 1 a r2 value close to 1 is desirable to ensure a good fit of the quadratic model to the actual data as well as to assure that the rsm correctly explained the interactions between dependent and independent variables based on the experimental results the rsm obtained with the aforementioned procedure were used to optimize the treatment process in the optimization study treatment factors were calculated for feasible combinations of polymer pac and zeolite ranged between 1 and 1 in coded units and then evaluated for the relative dominance status of each pollutant removal objectives the pareto analysis was used to evaluate the entire feasible space of treatment combinations for each model response pollutants removal the pareto frontier was identified by setting two treatment objectives 1 minimization of the amount of chemical used and 2 maximization of the extent of removal for each pollutant the desirable goal was to identify a combination of treatment agents able to maximize pollutant removal while minimizing the amount of chemicals by inspecting the pareto frontier non dominated designs could be easily identified for each of the pollutants considered in this study and compared the experimental results were processed and interpreted by employing minitab statistical software version 17 state college pennsylvania usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the physico chemical characteristics of the wastewater used in this study are shown in table 3 and compared with data obtained from the literature tss data were estimated by correlation with turbidity based on 14 samples analyzed with both methods no general trends was identified from the information available in the literature thus confirming that cso water quality is region specific and largely dictated by the catchment and rainfall characteristics of the geography of concern kafi et al 2008 madoux humery et al 2013 suárez and puertas 2005 since this work focused on the simultaneous control of cso pollutants and nutrient runoffs p and n and because csos water quality is originated from rainwater diluted sewage we considered raw wastewater suitable cso surrogate for our research purposes 3 2 integrated treatment performance table s1 summarizes results obtained during the experimental runs it should be noted that the effect on treatment performance associated with the influent particulate is secondary as the overall solids content of the treatment is dominated by the externally added carbon zeolite particles for the soluble components the removal is mostly associated with absorption mechanisms by carbon and zeolite a statistical test was conducted on the experimental data collected with the bb doe scheme at a significance level of p values 0 05 the latter indicated whether the removal of a given pollutant listed as a column in table 4 was affected by the treatment agent utilized in the study listed as a row in table 4 the full statistical analysis reported in table s2 confirmed the hypothesis that an integrated treatment process able to cope with a wide spectrum of pollutants requires the simultaneous use of all treatment agents and justifies a modeling study to optimize the process while achieving multiple treatment objectives fig 1 shows the tri dimensional plots in the form of the response surface highlighting the trend in performance manifested by the combined process for the case of turbidity and total phosphorus removal the experimental results revealed that by using a cationic polymer 75 of both pollutants could be simultaneously removed leading to a final concentration of 50 ntu and 7 mg l tp respectively in the cso simulated treatment such considerable extent of particulate removal is consistent with findings from previous studies li et al 2003 scherrenberg et al 2006 zahrim et al 2011 and confirms the effectiveness of coagulation and microsieve filtration when used in combination indeed the positive charge of a cationic polymer effectively neutralizes the negative charge of particles allowing floc formation therefore facilitating particle separation by fine sieve microfiltration also during the microsieving process it is possible that polymer facilitated the formation of a thin cake layer on the filter surface which in turn further enhanced particle removal in the case of total phosphorus high level of removal is mainly associated with the combined effect of direct sieving for particulate phosphorus and the sequestration by adsorption of phosphate by zeolite this mechanism is confirmed by the statistically significant effect associated with the product of polymer and zeolite at p value 0 05 the regression analysis returned the following expressions by statistical analysis for the two pollutants considered in this section in coded units t u r b i d i t y 78 22 6 737 p o l y m e r 1 359 z e o l i t e 0 072 p a c 0 340 m e s h 3 98 p o l y m e r 2 1 05 z e o l i t e 2 0 39 p a c 2 0 30 m e s h

691 z e o l i t e p a c 0 075 z e o l i t e m e s h 0 131 p a c m e s h the model equations showed an r2 0 89 and 0 90 for turbidity and tp removal respectively the same analysis was repeated in the case of cod and tkn the statistical analysis confirmed that also for this case all the treatment agents were statistically significant in achieving up to 75 of p cod removal moreover response surface analysis revealed that the two most important factors were polymer and pac the regression equation for p cod removal is proposed in coded unit as follows p c o d 59 30 8 29 p o l y m e r 1 68 z e o l i t e 5 33 p a c 0 72 m e s h 0 14 p o l y m e r 2 0 32 z e o l i t e 2 2 02 p a c 2 8 69 m e s h 2 2 40 p o l y m e r z e o l i t e 1 74 p o l y m e r p a c 6 31 p o l y m e r m e s h 1 62 z e o l i t e p a c 1 99 z e o l i t e m e s h 3 84 p a c m e s h it is interesting to note how the surface plot for p cod removal fig 2a reports an inverse relationship between polymer and pac the p cod removal efficiency increases by adding the highest concentration of polymer and the lowest concentration of pac this could be due to the fact that pac was a facilitating agent for coagulation by providing external coagulation nuclei but only until a critical upper concentration of carbon particle was reached on the other hand the p values analysis highlighted that pac played a decisive role in the removal of s cod the regression equation coded units developed by rsm for s cod removal is proposed as follows s c o d 12 65 0 991 p o l y m e r 1 086 z e o l i t e 3 211 p a c 0 026 m e s h 1

curve plot in fig 2 b confirms that the level of s cod removal increased by increasing the concentration of pac by observing the surface curvature a maximum in the removal of s cod could be observed for an optimal combination of pac and zeolite 250 mg l and 2500 mg l respectively this is in agreement with previous studies liao et al 2015 malekmohammadi 2016 who emphasised that pac and zeolite if used in combination lead to an increase in adsorption efficiency the regression equation for tkn removal is proposed in coded unit as follows t k n 68 759 0 027 p o l y m e r 7 308 z e o l i t e 0 106 p a c 0 638 m e s h 1 794 p o l y m e r 2 4 249 z e o l i t e 2 2 436 p a c 2 2 658 m e s h 2 0 399 p o l y m e r z e o l i t e 0 053 p o l y m e r p a c 1 472 p o l y m e r m e s h 1 135 z e o l i t e p a c 0 301 z e o l i t e m e s h 0 195 p a c m e s h the surface plot reported in fig 3 shows that the highest level of tkn removal 65 and with ammonia removal up to 40 is achieved at high zeolite concentration regardless of the concentrations of the other agents including pac moreover experimental results indicated that no tkn could be removed without the addition of zeolite thus confirming the importance of this treatment agent for nitrogen control and in line with findings from previous studies wang and peng 2010 in table 4 a linear interaction of zeolite and a two way interaction of polymer and mesh size for the removal of tkn are reported this result confirm that ammonia removal occurs via a dual mechanism of ammonia capture by ion exchange on zeoilite and a subsequent step of polymer coagulation and microsieving filtration fig 4 shows the predicted and the observed values for the removal of the five pollutants considered in this study indicating an excellent agreement between model and experimental values the model has also been successfully tested by the leave one out cross validation method with results are reported in supporting information file fig s1 the chart in fig 4 has been divided into three arbitrary regions aimed to classify the various pollutants removal poorly removed 30 removal moderately removed between 30 and 60 and efficiently removed 60 among the considered pollutants only s cod was poorly removed while turbidity tp p cod and tkn all displayed removal in the range of 45 80 3 3 pareto frontier and scenario analysis figs 5 8 report the assessed combinations of treatment agents as well as those falling onto the pareto frontiers when the maximization of removal and the minimization of treatment agents used in the process are simultaneously specified as the treatment objectives moreover these plots provide useful information on the trade offs between the two treatment objectives i e simultaneous minimization of chemical cost and maximization of treatment performance in the following figures the pareto designs non dominated solutions each design consisting of a unique combination of treatment agents are reported in red yellow green and blue for turbidity t cod tkn and tp respectively the dominated solutions sub optimal designs are reported in grey from figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that all the frontier designs for turbidity t cod tp and tkn converge towards the minimum amount of chemicals used to detach themselves when the amount of chemicals increase turbidity t cod and tp follow the same trend suggesting that a combination of designs can be easily selected to effectively remove all these pollutants however by plotting the tp optimal designs on the t cod plot fig 7 it is possible to observe that two sub curves are defined the first one follows the t cod optimal design pareto frontiers while the second one departs from the t cod optimal designs interestingly it was seen that the distance between tp and t cod frontier designs tends to increase when zeolite and mesh size range between 3000 and 5000 mg l and 300 500 μm while it tends to decrease when zeolite concentration is kept between 2500 mg l to 3000 mg l and the mesh size at 200 μm on the other hand as the shape of the tkn pareto frontiers indicates tkn removal is very sensitive to the zeolite concentration with the highest level of removal 72 reported by using the highest concentrations of zeolite 4500 mg l when the zeolite concentration is reduced to 250 mg l the tkn removal drops to 53 observing fig 8 it is also interesting to note that the designs that are optimal for nitrogen removal are sub optimal for all the remaining pollutants as such a universal treatment able to optimally remove all the considered pollutants cannot be advanced however all the designs belonging to the four pareto frontiers tend to converge when the minimum amounts of chemicals are used such point is characterized by the following combination of treatment agents 1 1 mg l of the cationic polymer 250 mg l of zeolite 5 mg l of pac and a 370 μm mesh size under these conditions excellent performance as high as 71 6 of removal in turbidity 55 7 removal in tkn 35 for t cod and 75 for tp are observed since the minimization of chemicals used in cso treatment is a highly desirable goal for public health protection we explored the performance of optimal designs which were simultaneously able to perform with low chemicals usage while also achieving the advanced treatment goals such as a simultaneous maximum removal of turbidity t cod tkn and tp achieving the best performance on each removal b simultaneous maximum removal of t cod tkn and tp and c simultaneous maximum removal of turbidity and tp table 5 shows the three combinations of treatment agents extracted from the pareto frontier designs and in line with the three scenarios indicated above in table s3 the treatment agents have been normalized by the influent pollutant loads to provide useful sizing information for process scale up as a function of the different treatment goals pursued in this study the design o 1 was identified as the best combination of treatment agents for first scenario case a remarkably o 1 belongs to all the four frontiers associated with the removal of each pollutant taken individually when the treatment objective was set to maximize the removal of nutrient and organic pollutants by using the smallest amount of chemicals case b an increase of zeolite dosage is required and the o 2 combination resulted being optimal such design appears to be common for three frontiers i e t cod tkn and tp frontiers finally for the third scenario case c the design o 3 appeared to be optimal an increase of polymer dosage and a reduction of mesh size is required to pursue the simultaneous removal of turbidity and tp it should be noted that o 3 allows to achieve one of the highest removals in turbidity and tp even with a relatively small amount of chemicals 4 conclusions one of the main goals of this study was to investigate the performance of a novel integrated process based on the simultaneous treatment by cationic polymer zeolite and powdered activated carbon followed by microsieving filtration results suggested that the novel integrated treatment process proposed in this study could be exploited to deal with multiple contaminants and the associated impacts in the receiving bodies caused by cso pollution and nutrients discharge in the environment all treatment agents tested in this study i e cationic polymer powdered activated carbon and zeolite have shown synergistic effects when simultaneously dosed prior to microsieving for treating the major cso pollutants cationic polymer played a fundamental role in coagulating zeolites on which ammonia was initially absorbed thus indirectly enabling the removal by a soluble constituent by microsieving filtration as highlighted by response surface analysis while zeolite played a central role in achieving satisfactory removal 50 of dissolved nitrogen in the form of ammonium at the same time low removal of soluble cod by powder activated carbon was observed 15 a regression model able to describe the relationship between treatment agents and cso pollutants removal was developed the model was employed to perform a multi objective optimization of the treatment method and to identify pareto frontiers demonstrating the possibility of pursuing with a single treatment method multiple treatment objectives declaration of competing interest the authors declare

scherrenberg et al 2006 seo et al 1997 moreover a synergistic effect of zeolite and activated carbon on the removal of nutrients and organic contaminants has been reported by malekmohammadi 2016 and liao et al 2015 in these works the authors stated that a mixture of carbon and zeolite increases the adsorption efficiency against nutrients and organic pollutants while neither could remove the pollutants if used alone table 1 summarizes information available in the literature on the effectiveness of treatment by cationic polymer pac zeolite and microsieving process when taken individually to remove specific cso pollutants the goal of this study was to develop and assess the performance of an integrated treatment process able to simultaneously remove nutrients and cso pollutants in a multifunctional reactor the main advantage of using a multifunctional reactor is to carry multiple functions at the same time i e coagulation adsorption and filtration and in a single unit this new approach opens the possibility for municipalities to address cso and nutrient pollution with a single capital upgrade more specifically the integrated treatment process relies on multiple treatment agents combined in a single multifunctional process where fine particles such as zeolite and powdered activated carbon first adsorb soluble nutrient and are subsequently removed by polymer enhanced microsieving allowing the removal of both soluble and particulate pollutants in a single treatment step furthermore this work describes an innovative method for the removal of ammonia via a dual mechanism of ammonia capture by zeolite absorption followed by zeolites removal by polymer coagulation and microsieving filtration by polymer coagulation smaller particles of zeolite were incorporated into bigger particles and easily removed by microsieving in order to do so we first investigated the efficiency of the individual treatment agents and then explored the synergies achieved when the chemicals were dosed simultaneously in an integrated treatment process targeting the removal of particulate cso pollutants such as turbidity and chemical oxygen demand as well as dissolved nutrients ammonium and nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of wastewater and analytical measurements primary influent pi was used as a surrogate to establish cso treatment efficiency during bench scale experiments samples were collected manually from the greenway wwtp located in london ontario canada the city of london is characterized by approximately 2750 km km of the sanitary storm and combined sewers greenway wwtp is one of the six wastewater treatment plants with a combined rated capacity of 152 million litres per day and an average daily flow of 117 million litres per day in 2018 city of london corporation 2016 the plant receives wastewater from approximately 9100 ha and services a population of 180 000 equivalent inhabitants with a combination of industrial wastewater residential sewage including the combined sewers from the older parts of the city for each sample the level of turbidity was measured by a hach 2100 turbidimeter following the nephelometric method standard method 2130b turbidity was used as an indicator of removal efficiency for particulate matter since a linear correlation between turbidity and tss exists hannouche et al 2012 ru et al 2013 cod tests were carried out by standard method 5220 d the soluble cod s cod was measured by filtering samples through a 0 45 μm pore size filters and the particulate cod p cod measurement was obtained by subtracting s cod from the total cod t cod tkn was used to quantify the amount of nitrogen contained in organic form and it was determined by digestion and distillation standard method 4500 norgc tp was measured following standard method 4500 p 2 2 chemically enhanced pre treatment the coagulation flocculation process was performed on the collected samples using 1 l of raw wastewater experiments were carried out using the jar test method in 1 l beakers where polymer pac and zeolite were mixed simultaneously natural zeolite particle size of 0 42 mm bulk density 45 50 lbs ft 3 used in this study was obtained from st cloud mining company winston new mexico pac grain size of 10 220 μm total surface area 650 m2 g 1 bulk density 0 51 g ml 1 was purchased from cabot norit americas company marshall usa cationic acrylamide polymer pg 906 was used as coagulant with 10 mole charge purchased from chemtreat company virginia usa the jar test employed the following steps 1 rapid mix at a constant speed of 200 rpm for 1 min to maximize the destabilization of colloidal particles and initiate coagulation 2 slow mix at a constant speed of 20 rpm for 2 min to increase the number of contact events among treating agents and particles and to facilitate the development of large flocs and 3 the last step was the settling stage after the coagulation flocculation process water was filtered through meshes of three different pore sizes 158 350 and 500 μm table 2 summarizes the employed ranges of mesh size the dosage of polymer pac and zeolite at the end of each treatment turbidity s cod p cod tkn and tp were analyzed results were compared with the concentration of pollutants in the collected samples to assess the treatment efficiency in terms of percentage removal 2 3 design of experiments and response surface analysis the box behnken bb doe scheme with four factor and three levels for each factor was selected as experimental design for this study the bb doe is an independent quadratic design in which the combinations of experimental plans are located at the midpoints of edges and at the center of the process space the number of experimental points n is defined by the expression n 2k k 1 c0 where k is the number of factors and c0 is the number of center points ferreira et al 2007 as reported by zolgharnein et al 2013 the bb doe requires fewer combinations of the independent variables i e the treatment agents to estimate a potentially complex response function when compared with the central composite design ccd this is in line with the findings by ferreira et al 2007 who demonstrated that the bb doe is an adequate scheme for response surface modelling rsm and subsequent optimization studies in case of non linear relationships among independent and dependent variables as a matter of fact based on previous studies ghafari et al 2009 liao et al 2015 trinh and kang 2010 wang et al 2011 the relationship between the treatment agents and removal is expected to be non linear in the case of physico chemical processes applied to water treatment therefore a second order model must be used as a surface response to fit the data and identify the optimal treatment conditions as shown in table 2 polymer pac zeolite and mesh size were placed at one of three equally spaced values coded as 1 0 1 the responses were expressed as a second order polynomial equation and a mathematical model was developed according to eq 1 1 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 β 5 x 1 2 β 6 x 2 2 β 7 x 3 2 β 8 x 4 2 β 9 x 1 x 2 β 10 x 1 x 3 β 11 x 1 x 4 β 12 x 2 x 3 β 13 x 2 x 4 β 14 x 3 x 4 where y is the predicted response in terms of pollutant removal β 0 is the constant coefficient x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the independent variables which influence the predicted response y β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are the linear coefficients β 5 β 6 β 7 and β 8 are the quadratic coefficient and β 9 β 10 β 11 β 12 β 13 and β 14 are the cross product coefficients the model equation easily clarifies the interaction effect such as synergism antagonism and addition of the independent parameters the statistical significance of each variable was analyzed by observing the p value p values less than 5 p 0 05 indicates that the variable is considered to be statistically significant the validity of each model was expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 ranged between 0 and 1 a r2 value close to 1 is desirable to ensure a good fit of the quadratic model to the actual data as well as to assure that the rsm correctly explained the interactions between dependent and independent variables based on the experimental results the rsm obtained with the aforementioned procedure were used to optimize the treatment process in the optimization study treatment factors were calculated for feasible combinations of polymer pac and zeolite ranged between 1 and 1 in coded units and then evaluated for the relative dominance status of each pollutant removal objectives the pareto analysis was used to evaluate the entire feasible space of treatment combinations for each model response pollutants removal the pareto frontier was identified by setting two treatment objectives 1 minimization of the amount of chemical used and 2 maximization of the extent of removal for each pollutant the desirable goal was to identify a combination of treatment agents able to maximize pollutant removal while minimizing the amount of chemicals by inspecting the pareto frontier non dominated designs could be easily identified for each of the pollutants considered in this study and compared the experimental results were processed and interpreted by employing minitab statistical software version 17 state college pennsylvania usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the physico chemical characteristics of the wastewater used in this study are shown in table 3 and compared with data obtained from the literature tss data were estimated by correlation with turbidity based on 14 samples analyzed with both methods no general trends was identified from the information available in the literature thus confirming that cso water quality is region specific and largely dictated by the catchment and rainfall characteristics of the geography of concern kafi et al 2008 madoux humery et al 2013 suárez and puertas 2005 since this work focused on the simultaneous control of cso pollutants and nutrient runoffs p and n and because csos water quality is originated from rainwater diluted sewage we considered raw wastewater suitable cso surrogate for our research purposes 3 2 integrated treatment performance table s1 summarizes results obtained during the experimental runs it should be noted that the effect on treatment performance associated with the influent particulate is secondary as the overall solids content of the treatment is dominated by the externally added carbon zeolite particles for the soluble components the removal is mostly associated with absorption mechanisms by carbon and zeolite a statistical test was conducted on the experimental data collected with the bb doe scheme at a significance level of p values 0 05 the latter indicated whether the removal of a given pollutant listed as a column in table 4 was affected by the treatment agent utilized in the study listed as a row in table 4 the full statistical analysis reported in table s2 confirmed the hypothesis that an integrated treatment process able to cope with a wide spectrum of pollutants requires the simultaneous use of all treatment agents and justifies a modeling study to optimize the process while achieving multiple treatment objectives fig 1 shows the tri dimensional plots in the form of the response surface highlighting the trend in performance manifested by the combined process for the case of turbidity and total phosphorus removal the experimental results revealed that by using a cationic polymer 75 of both pollutants could be simultaneously removed leading to a final concentration of 50 ntu and 7 mg l tp respectively in the cso simulated treatment such considerable extent of particulate removal is consistent with findings from previous studies li et al 2003 scherrenberg et al 2006 zahrim et al 2011 and confirms the effectiveness of coagulation and microsieve filtration when used in combination indeed the positive charge of a cationic polymer effectively neutralizes the negative charge of particles allowing floc formation therefore facilitating particle separation by fine sieve microfiltration also during the microsieving process it is possible that polymer facilitated the formation of a thin cake layer on the filter surface which in turn further enhanced particle removal in the case of total phosphorus high level of removal is mainly associated with the combined effect of direct sieving for particulate phosphorus and the sequestration by adsorption of phosphate by zeolite this mechanism is confirmed by the statistically significant effect associated with the product of polymer and zeolite at p value 0 05 the regression analysis returned the following expressions by statistical analysis for the two pollutants considered in this section in coded units t u r b i d i t y 78 22 6 737 p o l y m e r 1 359 z e o l i t e 0 072 p a c 0 340 m e s h 3 98 p o l y m e r 2 1 05 z e o l i t e 2 0 39 p a c 2 0 30 m e s h

case of cod and tkn the statistical analysis confirmed that also for this case all the treatment agents were statistically significant in achieving up to 75 of p cod removal moreover response surface analysis revealed that the two most important factors were polymer and pac the regression equation for p cod removal is proposed in coded unit as follows p c o d 59 30 8 29 p o l y m e r 1 68 z e o l i t e 5 33 p a c 0 72 m e s h 0 14 p o l y m e r 2 0 32 z e o l i t e 2 2 02 p a c 2 8 69 m e s h 2 2 40 p o l y m e r z e o l i t e 1 74 p o l y m e r p a c 6 31 p o l y m e r m e s h 1 62 z e o l i t e p a c 1 99 z e o l i t e m e s h 3 84 p a c m e s h it is interesting to note how the surface plot for p cod removal fig 2a reports an inverse relationship between polymer and pac the p cod removal efficiency increases by adding the highest concentration of polymer and the lowest concentration of pac this could be due to the fact that pac was a facilitating agent for coagulation by providing external coagulation nuclei but only until a critical upper concentration of carbon particle was reached on the other hand the p values analysis highlighted that pac played a decisive role in the removal of s cod the regression equation coded units developed by rsm for s cod removal is proposed as follows s c o d 12 65 0 991 p o l y m e r 1 086 z e o l i t e 3 211 p a c 0 026 m e s h 1

curve plot in fig 2 b confirms that the level of s cod removal increased by increasing the concentration of pac by observing the surface curvature a maximum in the removal of s cod could be observed for an optimal combination of pac and zeolite 250 mg l and 2500 mg l respectively this is in agreement with previous studies liao et al 2015 malekmohammadi 2016 who emphasised that pac and zeolite if used in combination lead to an increase in adsorption efficiency the regression equation for tkn removal is proposed in coded unit as follows t k n 68 759 0 027 p o l y m e r 7 308 z e o l i t e 0 106 p a c 0 638 m e s h 1 794 p o l y m e r 2 4 249 z e o l i t e 2 2 436 p a c 2 2 658 m e s h 2 0 399 p o l y m e r z e o l i t e 0 053 p o l y m e r p a c 1 472 p o l y m e r m e s h 1 135 z e o l i t e p a c 0 301 z e o l i t e m e s h 0 195 p a c m e s h the surface plot reported in fig 3 shows that the highest level of tkn removal 65 and with ammonia removal up to 40 is achieved at high zeolite concentration regardless of the concentrations of the other agents including pac moreover experimental results indicated that no tkn could be removed without the addition of zeolite thus confirming the importance of this treatment agent for nitrogen control and in line with findings from previous studies wang and peng 2010 in table 4 a linear interaction of zeolite and a two way interaction of polymer and mesh size for the removal of tkn are reported this result confirm that ammonia removal occurs via a dual mechanism of ammonia capture by ion exchange on zeoilite and a subsequent step of polymer coagulation and microsieving filtration fig 4 shows the predicted and the observed values for the removal of the five pollutants considered in this study indicating an excellent agreement between model and experimental values the model has also been successfully tested by the leave one out cross validation method with results are reported in supporting information file fig s1 the chart in fig 4 has been divided into three arbitrary regions aimed to classify the various pollutants removal poorly removed 30 removal moderately removed between 30 and 60 and efficiently removed 60 among the considered pollutants only s cod was poorly removed while turbidity tp p cod and tkn all displayed removal in the range of 45 80 3 3 pareto frontier and scenario analysis figs 5 8 report the assessed combinations of treatment agents as well as those falling onto the pareto frontiers when the maximization of removal and the minimization of treatment agents used in the process are simultaneously specified as the treatment objectives moreover these plots provide useful information on the trade offs between the two treatment objectives i e simultaneous minimization of chemical cost and maximization of treatment performance in the following figures the pareto designs non dominated solutions each design consisting of a unique combination of treatment agents are reported in red yellow green and blue for turbidity t cod tkn and tp respectively the dominated solutions sub optimal designs are reported in grey from figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that all the frontier designs for turbidity t cod tp and tkn converge towards the minimum amount of chemicals used to detach themselves when the amount of chemicals increase turbidity t cod and tp follow the same trend suggesting that a combination of designs can be easily selected to effectively remove all these pollutants however by plotting the tp optimal designs on the t cod plot fig 7 it is possible to observe that two sub curves are defined the first one follows the t cod optimal design pareto frontiers while the second one departs from the t cod optimal designs interestingly it was seen that the distance between tp and t cod frontier designs tends to increase when zeolite and mesh size range between 3000 and 5000 mg l and 300 500 μm while it tends to decrease when zeolite concentration is kept between 2500 mg l to 3000 mg l and the mesh size at 200 μm on the other hand as the shape of the tkn pareto frontiers indicates tkn removal is very sensitive to the zeolite concentration with the highest level of removal 72 reported by using the highest concentrations of zeolite 4500 mg l when the zeolite concentration is reduced to 250 mg l the tkn removal drops to 53 observing fig 8 it is also interesting to note that the designs that are optimal for nitrogen removal are sub optimal for all the remaining pollutants as such a universal treatment able to optimally remove all the considered pollutants cannot be advanced however all the designs belonging to the four pareto frontiers tend to converge when the minimum amounts of chemicals are used such point is characterized by the following combination of treatment agents 1 1 mg l of the cationic polymer 250 mg l of zeolite 5 mg l of pac and a 370 μm mesh size under these conditions excellent performance as high as 71 6 of removal in turbidity 55 7 removal in tkn 35 for t cod and 75 for tp are observed since the minimization of chemicals used in cso treatment is a highly desirable goal for public health protection we explored the performance of optimal designs which were simultaneously able to perform with low chemicals usage while also achieving the advanced treatment goals such as a simultaneous maximum removal of turbidity t cod tkn and tp achieving the best performance on each removal b simultaneous maximum removal of t cod tkn and tp and c simultaneous maximum removal of turbidity and tp table 5 shows the three combinations of treatment agents extracted from the pareto frontier designs and in line with the three scenarios indicated above in table s3 the treatment agents have been normalized by the influent pollutant loads to provide useful sizing information for process scale up as a function of the different treatment goals pursued in this study the design o 1 was identified as the best combination of treatment agents for first scenario case a remarkably o 1 belongs to all the four frontiers associated with the removal of each pollutant taken individually when the treatment objective was set to maximize the removal of nutrient and organic pollutants by using the smallest amount of chemicals case b an increase of zeolite dosage is required and the o 2 combination resulted being optimal such design appears to be common for three frontiers i e t cod tkn and tp frontiers finally for the third scenario case c the design o 3 appeared to be optimal an increase of polymer dosage and a reduction of mesh size is required to pursue the simultaneous removal of turbidity and tp it should be noted that o 3 allows to achieve one of the highest removals in turbidity and tp even with a relatively small amount of chemicals 4 conclusions one of the main goals of this study was to investigate the performance of a novel integrated process based on the simultaneous treatment by cationic polymer zeolite and powdered activated carbon followed by microsieving filtration results suggested that the novel integrated treatment process proposed in this study could be exploited to deal with multiple contaminants and the associated impacts in the receiving bodies caused by cso pollution and nutrients discharge in the environment all treatment agents tested in this study i e cationic polymer powdered activated carbon and zeolite have shown synergistic effects when simultaneously dosed prior to microsieving for treating the major cso pollutants cationic polymer played a fundamental role in coagulating zeolites on which ammonia was initially absorbed thus indirectly enabling the removal by a soluble constituent by microsieving filtration as highlighted by response surface analysis while zeolite played a central role in achieving satisfactory removal 50 of dissolved nitrogen in the form of ammonium at the same time low removal of soluble cod by powder activated carbon was observed 15 a regression model able to describe the relationship between treatment agents and cso pollutants removal was developed the model was employed to perform a multi objective optimization of the treatment method and to identify pareto frontiers demonstrating the possibility of pursuing with a single treatment method multiple treatment objectives declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18271,an environmental water sample fractionation framework was developed based on effects directed analysis eda to detect known and unknown compounds of concern in different waters secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework for characterizing estrogenic compounds in the effluent the effluent was spiked with known estrogenic compounds to validate the framework in a targeted approach and an unspiked sample was also investigated in a non targeted approach the framework separated compounds based on polarity and adsorption using liquid liquid extraction followed by solid phase extraction the targeted and non targeted effluents generated six fractions each which were assessed for estrogenic activity using an in vitro bioassay yeast estrogen screen yes three out of the six fractions in each case along with the raw effluent showed estrogen equivalent concentrations eeqs ranging between 1 0 and 3 0 μg l directed by the assay results these estrogenic fractions were further analyzed using liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for compound identification the developed separation framework coupled with a bioassay aided in identification of both known and unknown compounds producing estrogenic effects in the water sample the approach of fractionation followed by concentration helped isolate and elevate contaminant levels without necessarily concentrating potential matrix effects that could cause interfering cytotoxicity and inhibition in the bioassay the targeted analysis showed consistency between predicted and observed results while the non targeted analysis revealed the presence of three estrogenic compounds in the unspiked effluent di isobutyl phthalate diethyl phthalate and benzophenone that were confirmed with standards the study mainly aimed at development and validation of a simple yet effective eda framework with low cost techniques for water and wastewater toxicity screening and evaluation and the results suggested that the developed framework could be used as a screening tool for isolating and identifying unknown compounds in a complex water sample graphical abstract image 1 keywords effects directed analysis estrogenic compounds recombinant yeast assay chemical separation framework water reuse solid phase extraction 1 introduction the challenges associated with water quality and quantity impact populations around the globe which is initiating a shift of our water resource management towards more sustainable approaches such as water reuse this is demonstrated by water stressed nations like namibia and singapore making potable reuse a central part of their water portfolio to u s based projects like orange county california that have operated a reuse plant for decades and to hampton roads sanitation district that is building the largest network of indirect potable reuse plants to date bott et al 2018 lahnsteiner and lempert 2007 leverenz et al 2011 po et al 2003 there are many challenges that still face potable reuse especially direct potable reuse such as developing water quality standards i e regulations for potable reuse water better understanding of the microbial chemical contaminants associated with reuse operations and developing rapid assessment tools for identifying risk drivers in reuse water among these major challenges tools for detecting and characterizing the known and targeted as well as unknown and non targeted chemicals to define chemical hazards associated with reclaimed waters is of the most urgent need bolong et al 2009 kinney et al 2006 luo et al 2017 stevens garmon et al 2011 among such chemical hazards in reuse water major focus has been on unregulated compounds in municipal and industrial wastewaters including contaminants of emerging concern cecs as well as disinfection byproducts dbps that could impact public health over time states practicing potable and non potable reuse such as california arizona texas and others have prioritized monitoring of cecs by setting state level drinking water notification levels dwnl in the absence of federal maximum contaminant levels a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are natural and synthetic compounds found in municipal and industrial wastewaters as well as surface water resources jarošová et al 2015 they possess structural similarities to endogenous hormones thus interfere with the biological systems causing reproductive disorders lee et al 2003 sifakis et al 2017 they are generated from various sources including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps pesticides textiles plastics and landfill leachates aris et al 2014 caliman and gavrilescu 2009 and are often not efficiently removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants gómez et al 2009 sun et al 2008 as such these chemicals are detected frequently in secondary effluents with an example being bisphenol a bpa that is known to impact aquatic life even at ng l levels giulivo et al 2016 ikezuki et al 2002 thus the detection and removal of edcs from wastewater is a priority for both treated effluent and water reuse systems to ensure the protection of public health and the environment from edcs in response to tox21 vision the application of in vitro bioassays for monitoring emerging contaminants and their transformation products in water and wastewater is a burgeoning field that aids in the assessment of unknown compounds with potential toxic effects chibwe et al 2017 escher et al 2018a in vitro bioassays save both cost and time compared to the in vivo testing methods thus serving as relatively quick and feasible detection tools in screening for both known and unknown toxicological contaminants brack et al 2016 creusot et al 2013 bioassays have been widely used for the detection of edcs in various kinds of waters including surface water ground water drinking water reclaimed water and wastewater fetter et al 2014 grung et al 2007 hecker and hollert 2009 leusch et al 2014 risk based frameworks involving bioassays for toxic compound detection have been demonstrated by the california contaminants of emerging concern panel suggesting that the estrogenic receptor er ɑ and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr assays be used as assessment methods for estrogenic and dioxin like activities in recycled water drewes et al 2018 however one major concern with bioassays is the complexity of samples especially wastewater both influent and effluent reclaimed water that can impact the sensitivity of a bioassay petrovic et al 2008 toušová et al 2018 this poses a potential challenge in identifying the compound s responsible for a sample s toxicity or even their chemical nature in general polar nonpolar etc grung et al 2007 the process of toxic compound identification and quantification has improved over the years with tools like us epa s toxic identification evaluation tie and effects directed analysis eda brack et al 2009 brack and burgess 2011 li et al 2017 tie is suitable for applications such as whole effluent toxicity focusing on overall effects of a sample on an organism using complex in vivo assays that are often costly and time intensive brack and burgess 2011 in contrast eda typically uses an in vitro bioassay with toxicological endpoints e g estrogenicity mutagenicity acute toxicity in combination with fractionation of the water sample hug et al 2015 you and li 2017 these fractionation and concentration techniques provide better resolution and classification of the physical and or chemical nature of the compounds enabling their detection even at very low concentrations creusot et al 2013 grung et al 2007 this has been one of the advantages of eda which makes it more suitable for target suspect and non target analyses as seen in related studies la farré et al 2001 shrivastava et al 2017 there have been a number of studies on fractionation of water for identification of toxic compounds but fewer studies focused on using simple and cost effective methods to achieve a better classification of compounds based on their chemical characteristics a variety of techniques such as reverse phase hplc rp hplc silica gel chromatography spe hplc and gel permeation chromatography hplc high performance thin layer chromatography hptlc have been studied to understand the potential of fractionation in targeted and suspect analyses buchinger et al 2013 fetter et al 2014 muschket et al 2017 nakada et al 2004 thomas et al 2001 both single and multi step separation eda methods have been applied yet these procedures often focus on either polar or non polar constituents not both and require several chromatographic steps that are both time and equipment intensive weiss et al 2009 2011 gómez et al 2009 shrivastava et al 2017 this illustrates the need for rapid separation techniques using common laboratory procedures for eda based methods particularly ones that are capable of generating a widely applicable framework to concurrently screen compounds of different polarity present in a sample as such an ideal framework should be able to identify the presence of toxic compounds their chemical and physical nature be of low cost apply standardized approaches to allow for comparison between labs and samples and be done in a short time period i e days the urgent need for such methods is exemplified through california s water reuse advisory panel and california s goal of using bioassays as a regulatory tool for reuse operations the objectives of this study were to develop an economical quick and widely applicable separation framework based on eda methods for a wide range of targeted or non targeted toxicity screening that also provides information on the physical and chemical nature of the compounds the first objective was to rapidly separate compounds present in a water or wastewater sample into different fractions based on their polarity and sorptive capacity using common laboratory methods the second objective used an eda approach with targeted chemicals to test the separation framework in municipal wastewater third and finally we attempted to validate the method by identifying and quantifying unknown compounds causing an estrogenic response in the bioassay using liquid and gas chromatography the framework can be applied to a wide range of toxicity end points however estrogenicity was selected herein due to its near ubiquitous presence in wastewater effluents 2 methods 2 1 sample collection samples of effluent water were taken from a conventional secondary wastewater treatment plant in ne colorado the samples were collected in baked 550 c for 4 h 1l amber bottles and stored on ice during transportation 1 h to the lab the samples were filter sterilized by filtering with gn metricel 0 45 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane filters hach usa under vacuum at a pressure of 15 psi to remove any suspended solids and then stored at 4 c until extraction and analysis all samples were filtered and extracted within 48 h of sample collection 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 sample preparation targeted and non targeted analyses two separate extractions were carried out on the effluent samples one for targeted analysis ta and another for non targeted analysis nta for ta the effluent water was spiked with two known estrogenic compounds 17β estradiol e2 and 2 4 6 trichlorobiphenyl tcbp the compounds were acquired from sigma aldrich mo usa and were of at least 98 purity spiked concentrations were determined from internal calibration experiments where 9 serial dilutions of each compound from 1000 mg l to 1 ng l in ultrapure di water 18 2 megohm cm were tested in the yes assay to obtain an optimum concentration that induced maximum estrogenic response with minimum cell inhibition this preliminary experiment resulted in 2 μg l of e2 and 5 μg l of tcbp being selected for ta in the effluent sample si fig 1 for nta the effluent was used as is without any spiking 2 2 2 sequential liquid liquid extraction of sample lle the targeted and non targeted secondary effluent samples were simultaneously subjected to a polarity based separation using sequential liquid liquid extraction lle first with a nonpolar solvent to extract highly nonpolar compounds followed by a mid polar organic solvent to separate the mid polar compounds and finally the resulting aqueous sample fig 1 the sequential lle thus generated three fractions nonpolar mid polar and polar the solvents were selected based on their polarity index and their ability to rapidly phase separate from our water sample nonpolar compounds in the first step 50 ml of pentane was added to 500 ml of effluent sample in a kimax 500 ml glass separatory funnel followed by shaking for 2 min and then allowed to settle for another 10 min for phase separation the solvent layer was then collected and dried using sodium sulfate if there was any emulsion formed during the extraction process the solvent fraction was collected and sonicated branson 1200 ultrasonic bath for 30 min the extracted fraction referred to as nonpolar fraction was collected and stored in a 50 ml muffled amber glass bottle and stored at 4 c until further use mid polar compounds in the second step the effluent retrieved from the first extraction approx 500 ml was then extracted with 50 ml of dichloromethane following the same protocol as described for the nonpolar solvent the mid polar solvent layer was collected and dried through sodium sulfate the resultant solvent fraction referred to as mid polar fraction was sonicated if needed collected and stored as described above polar compounds the remaining aqueous phase after the extractions referred to as polar fraction was then concentrated to 100 ml through rotary evaporation buchi rotovapor re 111 switzerland at 100 c under vacuum 15 psi 2 2 3 solid phase extraction spe the resulting lle fraction were then separated further based on adsorption fig 1 different spe columns were selected for each lle fraction for the nonpolar and mid polar fractions a normal phase extraction was performed using mgso4 columns supelclean envi florisil for polar aqueous fraction a reversed phase spe column with graphitized carbon supelclean envi carb was used the columns were mounted on a vacuum manifold where all the three lle fractions were extracted simultaneously under a pressure of 10 15 psi and a solvent sample loading rate of 1 ml min sitterley et al 2018 the columns were pre conditioned with 1 tube volume of 100 methanol followed by equilibration with 1 tube volume of the solvent similar to the ones the fractions were suspended in after equilibration the phases were loaded onto their respective columns at 1 ml min the flow through for each fraction was captured in disposable test tubes fisherbrand borosilicate glass 16 100mm after loading the compounds were eluted with 20 v v methanol in acetonitrile generating three eluate fractions from nonpolar mid polar and polar phases the three eluate fractions along with the three flow through fractions collected during loading were further concentrated to 500 μl each organic fractions were evaporated using a turbovap lv biotage usa system while the polar flow through aqueous was concentrated to 5 ml using buchi rotovapor under vacuum 15 psi for subsequent chemical analysis an aliquot of 100 μl was taken from each fraction into 400 μl microvolume inserts agilent usa in 1 5 ml amber glass gc vials agilent usa and were stored at 20 c for yes the remaining volume of each fraction was re suspended in 4 6 ml of ultrapure water hplc grade fisher chemical and stored at 4 c the procedure described above was followed for both targeted and non targeted effluent samples generating 6 fractions each for targeted analysis ta and non targeted analysis nta procedure shown in fig 1 a third extraction was performed with 500 ml of ultrapure di water which served as control extraction to ensure that the procedure did not introduce anything that could potentially affect analytical and bioassay results an spe concentrate of raw effluent was also prepared by passing 50 ml of the filtered effluent sample through a hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb oasis cartridge waters ma at 1 ml

yeast estrogen screen yes was conducted to detect estrogenic compounds across the six fractions as well as the secondary effluent sample using the protocol developed by routledge et al 1996 with some modifications adapted from recent studies hull et al 2018 parker et al 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2007 briefly a recombinant yeast strain saccharomyces cerevisiae that was engineered with a gene for human estrogen receptor her and its expression plasmids carrying reporter gene lac z the yeast was exposed in triplicates in a 96 well plate for 72 h at 1 1 ratio sample to cells and media to each of the six fractions from the above extractions in 3 dilutions each along with the raw effluent water samples at 5x 1x 0 5x and 0 1x in the presence of estrogenic compounds the lac z gene is activated and releases an enzyme 17β galactosidase that degrades a chromogenic substrate namely chlorophenol red β d galactopyranoside cprg the color change from yellow to red is quantified by measuring absorption

the fractions that showed a positive response greater than 20 relative estrogenic activity in the bioassay were screened using lc ms and gc ms for known and unknown compounds present in the sample while the ta with spiked secondary effluent allowed for a semi controlled experiment to demonstrate the proposed approach the nta with the unspiked effluent allowed for the identification of unknown estrogenic compounds present in the sample the following sections discuss the key findings from the above results that support the hypotheses of the current study 3 1 effects directed analysis using a targeted approach 3 1 1 estrogenic screening the ta fractions resulted in a positive estrogenic activity in yes for 3 of the 6 fractions mid polar eluate mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fig 2 the mid polar eluate showed an eeq of 1 73 μg l 100x while the mid polar flow through showed 2 51 μg l 100x and the nonpolar eluate had 2 15 μg l 100x the spiked effluent showed 1 71 μg l eeq at its original concentration 1x fig 2 however the spe extract of the raw secondary effluent without any spiked compounds resulted in 31 cellular inhibition at 5x concentration due to cytotoxicity which is above the standard method s accepted value 20 likely illustrating why no estrogenicity was seen for that sample with respect to inhibition the mid polar and nonpolar flow through fractions showed very mild 10 cellular inhibition in yeast 10 while the other fractions showed no inhibition at all including the spiked raw water si fig 2 3 1 2 analytical screening of targeted compounds the ta fractions that exhibited estrogenic activity fig 2 were screened for the spiked compounds e2 and tcbp using gc ms e2 was identified in two of the three active fractions mid polar eluate and mid polar flow through and tcbp was identified in mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fractions table 1 the compounds were identified by comparing the retention times of compound peaks from extracted ion chromatograms eics in the samples with those of commercial standards while their mass spectra were confirmed from both nist mass spectral search program v2 0 and commercial standards si fig 4 the fractions that did not induce estrogenic activity were also screened for target compounds but no compound peaks were observed the 3 fractions of the spiked effluent fig 2 that showed highest estrogenic activities in yes are those that contained identified peaks of spiked estrogenic compounds e2 and tcbp these results demonstrate the bioassay s ability in an eda to drive the analytical process by correlating toxicity with those fractions that contained the estrogenic compounds spiking the ta effluent with e2 and tcbp allowed us to predict which fractions would have the highest estrogenic activity based on polarity and adsorption capacity the observations were consistent with these predictions showing positive response in the organic fractions from mid polar and nonpolar phases 17 estradiol with an octanol water partition coefficient log kow between 3 1 and 4 0 and an adsorption coefficient log koc of 2 9 was expected to be partitioned into the mid polar phase during lle and show only partial adsorption during spe casey et al 2005 hansch et al 1995 suzuki et al 2005 this was supported by its rate limiting sorption kinetics as studied by casey et al 2005 which showed that e2 adsorption could be time dependent with lower log koc values when column contact times are less than 1 h the spe contact times in this study were similar with about 45 50 min for each lle fraction which explains e2 s partial adsorption and its almost equal distribution between the eluate and flow through of the mid polar phase table 1 tcbp with a higher partition coefficient log kow of 5 47 was speculated to be seen in fractions towards the non polar end of the spectrum as per fig 2 hansch et al 1995 a nonpolar and hydrophobic compound with a log koc of 4 41 tcbp was expected to show at least partial adsorption in both mid polar and nonpolar lle fractions us environmental protection agency s episuite from the results it was evident that a certain percentage of tcbp did partition from the solvent pentane onto the spe column and into the nonpolar eluate fraction however no such partitioning onto the spe column was observed in the mid polar fraction with tcbp having a higher affinity towards the solvent dichloromethane the compound recovery for e2 was 100 of the spiked concentration which is found to be consistent with other estradiol quantification studies casey et al 2005 layton et al 2002 this indicates the reliability of the framework in recovering compounds at low μg l levels while the concentration factor 5x could be increased as needed to achieve ng l levels this is important for detection of trace level compounds that can induce a toxic response at very low concentrations such as e2 on the other hand tcbp recovery was very low at 3 table 1 however this was consistent with some previous studies on chlorinated biphenyls that have reported significantly low recoveries between 3 and 26 due to binding of these compounds onto the plastic in the well plates of yes cseh et al 1989 layton et al 2002 the high losses of tcbp observed in our study could be at least partially attributed to its possible binding to the plastic surfaces of the materials used such as in the spe cartridges pipette tips and well plates used in yes in addition a significant amount of tcbp could have been adsorbed onto the particulates present in the secondary effluent since the compounds e2 and tcbp were added prior to sample filtration a few ways to improve recovery of compounds such as tcbp could be to collect and process the filter residue to extract compounds that adhere to particulate matter suzuki et al 2009 and to limit the use of plastic labware including yes well plates and pipettes the mid polar and nonpolar flow through fractions showed very low cellular inhibition in yeast 15 acceptable value 20 while the others showed no inhibition in addition no significant cytotoxicity was observed in the fractions of the control extraction with di as parent sample si fig 6 the di extraction results si fig 5 and 6 also indicated that there were no interferences in the experimental procedure that could potentially alter the bioassay response the yeast inhibition shown by the effluent and its fractions was insignificant validating the estrogenic data the control sample di water and its fractions were also assessed using yes and analytical instruments neither estrogenic activity nor cytotoxicity in the yeast was observed in any of the control sample or fractions si fig 5 and 6 the analytical results of these samples did not show any significant compound peaks in the total ion chromatograms these results showed the ability of the developed framework to perform as expected with targeted compounds identified in estrogenic fractions this provides confidence in the method s potential to be used for unknown toxicants in addition the framework aims to provide some insight into the toxicants properties such as its polarity hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and adsorptivity which could be useful in treatability studies 3 2 effects directed analysis using a non targeted approach 3 2 1 estrogenic screening non targeted analysis nta with raw secondary effluent was conducted to identify unknown estrogenic compounds in the sample since the same effluent was used for both ta and nta in this study we expected to see little activity in the polar fractions and higher activity in the nonpolar ones similar to what was observed during the ta as expected the nta fractions showed higher eeqs in 3 of the 6 fractions mid polar eluate mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fig 3 the mid polar eluate showed an eeq of 3 01 μg l while the mid polar flow through was at 1 26 μg l and the nonpolar eluate at 2 94 μg l although the fractions that showed estrogenic activity remained the same in both analyses the ta fractions showed higher estrogenic potency compared to the nta fractions as would be expected from adding estrogenic compounds at low μg l levels the non extracted raw effluent showed 1 06 μg l of eeq 95 rea at its original concentration 1x but the spe concentrate showed an inhibition of 31 si fig 3 suggesting the increased concentration of compounds at 5x was cytotoxic to the yeast however since the same level of inhibition was not seen among the concentrated fractions the cytotoxicity was likely attributed to the matrix effects of other constituents in the secondary effluent this result reinforced a key hypothesis of the study that complex water samples could generate complicated toxicological responses preventing an in depth analysis from a bioassay the spe concentrate used in this study if tested as is for a toxicological endpoint would have produced a mere cytotoxic response that would have failed to communicate the presence of active estrogenic compounds and the 1x effluent sample would have been too complex to identify compounds at lower concentrations without a concentration factor the fractionation followed by concentration helped isolate and elevate the compound levels without proportionally concentrating the matrix effect that may cause cytotoxicity and inhibition of the yeast in yes alternatively other in vitro bioassays which are less sensitive to cytotoxicity and more rapid can be used such as e screen er calux ahr calux and assays based on mammalian cell lines escher et al 2018b jarošová et al 2015 that might have mitigated cytotoxicity exhibited in yes 3 2 2 analytical screening for non targeted compounds the fractions with positive estrogenic response in the secondary effluent fig 3 fractions were screened for unknown estrogenic compounds using lc ms and gc ms the lc ms results specifically for the polar fraction did not result in any putative identifications the gc ms results of mid polar eluate mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fractions were screened for compound peaks with significant intensities and a nist spectral match factor forward reverse greater than 800 the resultant list consisted of 15 compounds which were further screened from the literature for estrogenic activity si table 1 three of the 15 compounds were found to be estrogenic based on published toxicological data and experimental evidence si fig 1 the three identified compounds table 2 were benzophenone bp cas 119 61 9 diethyl phthalate dep cas 84 66 2 and di isobutyl phthalate dibp cas 84 69 5 the estrogenic potency of the 3 identified compounds was verified by conducting a confirmation bioassay with yes the assay was done with compound standards as per the procedure described in section 2 4 with six different concentrations ranging from 0 001 mg l to 100 mg l the results showed positive response with relative effect potencies rep for bp dep and dibp at 0 1 10 3 0 3 10 3 and 0 5 10 3 respectively with minimal cellular inhibition at these concentrations analytical standards of the compounds were used for identification and quantification with the results shown in table 2 and the mass spectra in fig 4 these compounds have been found in wastewaters and surface waters those that receive a treated effluent in numerous studies to date berset and etter holzer 2001 clara et al 2010 oh et al 2006 bp and its derivatives have been reported in effluent fed river samples in the μg l mg l levels with some rivers containing as high as 400 μg l of bp jeon et al 2006 kawaguchi et al 2008 tsui et al 2014 phthalates are widely used in stabilizers lubricants personal care products toys and paints clara et al 2010 oh et al 2006 oh et al 2006 reported the presence of phthalates in secondary effluent impacted source waters with about 1 μg l of dibp and 2 7 μg l of dep the calculated concentrations found in the secondary effluent studied herein table 2 were consistent with those reported in literature suggesting that the fractionation method is applicable to other environmental samples i e drinking water or surface water with varying levels of constituents i e ng l to mg l as mentioned previously an increase in the concentration factor could improve the method s ability in detecting compounds in the ng l range 3 3 quantification and estrogenic contribution of non targeted compounds the calculated concentrations in the fractions were also used to estimate the contribution of each compound to the estrogenic response in the raw secondary effluent table 2 the calibration curves generated for each standard gc ms were used to calculate the compound concentrations in the fractions these data were then used to estimate potential estrogenic activity for each compound as a fraction of the total seen in the secondary effluent based on dose response curves for each chemical si fig 1a b and 1c according to our projections bp would elicit an eeq of 0 1 10 3 μg l at its calculated concentration while dep and dibp would induce 2 6 10 3 μg l and 1 9 10 3 μg l respectively the three compounds together accounted for less than 1 of the raw secondary effluent s eeq concentration which was 1 06 μg l si fig 7 while the rea approach eq 1 simply uses absorbance values relative to the reference compound the eeq approach is more commonly accepted as it normalizes the estrogenic potencies to e2 the discrepancies in the contribution between eeqs and the reas si fig 7 and 8 indicate the presence of other undetected compounds in our lc and gc ms analyses the calculated concentrations show that the nonpolar eluate contains the highest percentage of bp 0 80 μg l dep 5 99 μg l and dibp 3 55 μg l on the other hand mid polar eluate has been identified with only 2 of the 3 compounds bp dep at relatively lower concentrations from this we could expect that the nonpolar eluate fraction would show significantly higher estrogenic potency however both the mid polar eluate and nonpolar eluate showed similar estrogenicity with eeqs of 3 01 μg l and 2 95 μg l respectively this suggests that there could be other unidentified compounds in the mid polar eluate fraction that induced the unaccounted activity alternatively it could be due to the presence of unidentified anti estrogenic compounds in the nonpolar eluate fraction eliciting a masking effect in yes this notion is supported by our initial list of 15 compounds that include some anti estrogenic compounds this hypothesis also considers the fact that the compound peak analysis of the total ion chromatograms tics showed a wide range of compounds present in the nonpolar eluate fraction however since we relied on high spectral match factor for our study some of the compounds on the list although identified as common estrogens anti estrogens were not further investigated for example one suspect compound in the nonpolar eluate was dibutyl phthalate dbp which has been reported previously to elicit anti estrogenic effects bhatia et al 2013 it was observed that the presence of antagonists such as dbp can cause a reduction in the estrogenic activity of the agonists by up to 50 we suspect that the discrepancy seen in the predicted and observed estrogenic responses in the nonpolar eluate in this study in spite of containing the higher concentrations of bp dep and dibp could have been due to possible masking effects by an antagonist like dbp and or other unidentified compounds in the fraction the gc and lc ms was run in a full scan mode for all the samples which also made it challenging to identify other unknown compounds in the effluent that could have been present in low concentrations the framework could be more robust by developing a targeted method that screened for a comprehensive suite of edcs commonly present in wastewater thus increasing the sensitivity of the instrument and method additionally previous studies such as neale et al 2015 showed that the detected chemicals in a complex mixture could account for 80 of estrogenic activity but only 2 of more complex biological effects such as adaptive stress response neale et al 2015 while it is easier to explain a specific endpoint such as estrogenicity which is more sensitive to even low concentrations of natural and synthetic estrogens further research is needed to isolate compounds responsible for overall organism response to a toxic mixture neale et al 2015 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that the proposed two stage water sample fractionation scheme and methods facilitate identification of chemical drivers for targeted toxicity effects and provide insights into the chemical nature of toxicants i e polarity and adsorption behaviors the fractionation followed by concentration helped isolate and elevate the compound levels without proportionally concentrating the matrix effect that may cause cytotoxicity and inhibition of the bioassay for both ta and nta the water sample fractionation and separation coupled with high throughput in vitro bioassay enabled effective identification of both known and unknown chemicals that contributed to estrogenic effects in addition the knowledge of the effect causing compounds chemical nature hydrophobic nonpolar can be used for treatment technology development and optimization for risk reduction and mitigation particularly for potable reuse scenarios the framework with further optimization can provide a cost effective and time saving toxicity

18271,an environmental water sample fractionation framework was developed based on effects directed analysis eda to detect known and unknown compounds of concern in different waters secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework for characterizing estrogenic compounds in the effluent the effluent was spiked with known estrogenic compounds to validate the framework in a targeted approach and an unspiked sample was also investigated in a non targeted approach the framework separated compounds based on polarity and adsorption using liquid liquid extraction followed by solid phase extraction the targeted and non targeted effluents generated six fractions each which were assessed for estrogenic activity using an in vitro bioassay yeast estrogen screen yes three out of the six fractions in each case along with the raw effluent showed estrogen equivalent concentrations eeqs ranging between 1 0 and 3 0 μg l directed by the assay results these estrogenic fractions were further analyzed using liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for compound identification the developed separation framework coupled with a bioassay aided in identification of both known and unknown compounds producing estrogenic effects in the water sample the approach of fractionation followed by concentration helped isolate and elevate contaminant levels without necessarily concentrating potential matrix effects that could cause interfering cytotoxicity and inhibition in the bioassay the targeted analysis showed consistency between predicted and observed results while the non targeted analysis revealed the presence of three estrogenic compounds in the unspiked effluent di isobutyl phthalate diethyl phthalate and benzophenone that were confirmed with standards the study mainly aimed at development and validation of a simple yet effective eda framework with low cost techniques for water and wastewater toxicity screening and evaluation and the results suggested that the developed framework could be used as a screening tool for isolating and identifying unknown compounds in a complex water sample graphical abstract image 1 keywords effects directed analysis estrogenic compounds recombinant yeast assay chemical separation framework water reuse solid phase extraction 1 introduction the challenges associated with water quality and quantity impact populations around the globe which is initiating a shift of our water resource management towards more sustainable approaches such as water reuse this is demonstrated by water stressed nations like namibia and singapore making potable reuse a central part of their water portfolio to u s based projects like orange county california that have operated a reuse plant for decades and to hampton roads sanitation district that is building the largest network of indirect potable reuse plants to date bott et al 2018 lahnsteiner and lempert 2007 leverenz et al 2011 po et al 2003 there are many challenges that still face potable reuse especially direct potable reuse such as developing water quality standards i e regulations for potable reuse water better understanding of the microbial chemical contaminants associated with reuse operations and developing rapid assessment tools for identifying risk drivers in reuse water among these major challenges tools for detecting and characterizing the known and targeted as well as unknown and non targeted chemicals to define chemical hazards associated with reclaimed waters is of the most urgent need bolong et al 2009 kinney et al 2006 luo et al 2017 stevens garmon et al 2011 among such chemical hazards in reuse water major focus has been on unregulated compounds in municipal and industrial wastewaters including contaminants of emerging concern cecs as well as disinfection byproducts dbps that could impact public health over time states practicing potable and non potable reuse such as california arizona texas and others have prioritized monitoring of cecs by setting state level drinking water notification levels dwnl in the absence of federal maximum contaminant levels a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are natural and synthetic compounds found in municipal and industrial wastewaters as well as surface water resources jarošová et al 2015 they possess structural similarities to endogenous hormones thus interfere with the biological systems causing reproductive disorders lee et al 2003 sifakis et al 2017 they are generated from various sources including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps pesticides textiles plastics and landfill leachates aris et al 2014 caliman and gavrilescu 2009 and are often not efficiently removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants gómez et al 2009 sun et al 2008 as such these chemicals are detected frequently in secondary effluents with an example being bisphenol a bpa that is known to impact aquatic life even at ng l levels giulivo et al 2016 ikezuki et al 2002 thus the detection and removal of edcs from wastewater is a priority for both treated effluent and water reuse systems to ensure the protection of public health and the environment from edcs in response to tox21 vision the application of in vitro bioassays for monitoring emerging contaminants and their transformation products in water and wastewater is a burgeoning field that aids in the assessment of unknown compounds with potential toxic effects chibwe et al 2017 escher et al 2018a in vitro bioassays save both cost and time compared to the in vivo testing methods thus serving as relatively quick and feasible detection tools in screening for both known and unknown toxicological contaminants brack et al 2016 creusot et al 2013 bioassays have been widely used for the detection of edcs in various kinds of waters including surface water ground water drinking water reclaimed water and wastewater fetter et al 2014 grung et al 2007 hecker and hollert 2009 leusch et al 2014 risk based frameworks involving bioassays for toxic compound detection have been demonstrated by the california contaminants of emerging concern panel suggesting that the estrogenic receptor er ɑ and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr assays be used as assessment methods for estrogenic and dioxin like activities in recycled water drewes et al 2018 however one major concern with bioassays is the complexity of samples especially wastewater both influent and effluent reclaimed water that can impact the sensitivity of a bioassay petrovic et al 2008 toušová et al 2018 this poses a potential challenge in identifying the compound s responsible for a sample s toxicity or even their chemical nature in general polar nonpolar etc grung et al 2007 the process of toxic compound identification and quantification has improved over the years with tools like us epa s toxic identification evaluation tie and effects directed analysis eda brack et al 2009 brack and burgess 2011 li et al 2017 tie is suitable for applications such as whole effluent toxicity focusing on overall effects of a sample on an organism using complex in vivo assays that are often costly and time intensive brack and burgess 2011 in contrast eda typically uses an in vitro bioassay with toxicological endpoints e g estrogenicity mutagenicity acute toxicity in combination with fractionation of the water sample hug et al 2015 you and li 2017 these fractionation and concentration techniques provide better resolution and classification of the physical and or chemical nature of the compounds enabling their detection even at very low concentrations creusot et al 2013 grung et al 2007 this has been one of the advantages of eda which makes it more suitable for target suspect and non target analyses as seen in related studies la farré et al 2001 shrivastava et al 2017 there have been a number of studies on fractionation of water for identification of toxic compounds but fewer studies focused on using simple and cost effective methods to achieve a better classification of compounds based on their chemical characteristics a variety of techniques such as reverse phase hplc rp hplc silica gel chromatography spe hplc and gel permeation chromatography hplc high performance thin layer chromatography hptlc have been studied to understand the potential of fractionation in targeted and suspect analyses buchinger et al 2013 fetter et al 2014 muschket et al 2017 nakada et al 2004 thomas et al 2001 both single and multi step separation eda methods have been applied yet these procedures often focus on either polar or non polar constituents not both and require several chromatographic steps that are both time and equipment intensive weiss et al 2009 2011 gómez et al 2009 shrivastava et al 2017 this illustrates the need for rapid separation techniques using common laboratory procedures for eda based methods particularly ones that are capable of generating a widely applicable framework to concurrently screen compounds of different polarity present in a sample as such an ideal framework should be able to identify the presence of toxic compounds their chemical and physical nature be of low cost apply standardized approaches to allow for comparison between labs and samples and be done in a short time period i e days the urgent need for such methods is exemplified through california s water reuse advisory panel and california s goal of using bioassays as a regulatory tool for reuse operations the objectives of this study were to develop an economical quick and widely applicable separation framework based on eda methods for a wide range of targeted or non targeted toxicity screening that also provides information on the physical and chemical nature of the compounds the first objective was to rapidly separate compounds present in a water or wastewater sample into different fractions based on their polarity and sorptive capacity using common laboratory methods the second objective used an eda approach with targeted chemicals to test the separation framework in municipal wastewater third and finally we attempted to validate the method by identifying and quantifying unknown compounds causing an estrogenic response in the bioassay using liquid and gas chromatography the framework can be applied to a wide range of toxicity end points however estrogenicity was selected herein due to its near ubiquitous presence in wastewater effluents 2 methods 2 1 sample collection samples of effluent water were taken from a conventional secondary wastewater treatment plant in ne colorado the samples were collected in baked 550 c for 4 h 1l amber bottles and stored on ice during transportation 1 h to the lab the samples were filter sterilized by filtering with gn metricel 0 45 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane filters hach usa under vacuum at a pressure of 15 psi to remove any suspended solids and then stored at 4 c until extraction and analysis all samples were filtered and extracted within 48 h of sample collection 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 sample preparation targeted and non targeted analyses two separate extractions were carried out on the effluent samples one for targeted analysis ta and another for non targeted analysis nta for ta the effluent water was spiked with two known estrogenic compounds 17β estradiol e2 and 2 4 6 trichlorobiphenyl tcbp the compounds were acquired from sigma aldrich mo usa and were of at least 98 purity spiked concentrations were determined from internal calibration experiments where 9 serial dilutions of each compound from 1000 mg l to 1 ng l in ultrapure di water 18 2 megohm cm were tested in the yes assay to obtain an optimum concentration that induced maximum estrogenic response with minimum cell inhibition this preliminary experiment resulted in 2 μg l of e2 and 5 μg l of tcbp being selected for ta in the effluent sample si fig 1 for nta the effluent was used as is without any spiking 2 2 2 sequential liquid liquid extraction of sample lle the targeted and non targeted secondary effluent samples were simultaneously subjected to a polarity based separation using sequential liquid liquid extraction lle first with a nonpolar solvent to extract highly nonpolar compounds followed by a mid polar organic solvent to separate the mid polar compounds and finally the resulting aqueous sample fig 1 the sequential lle thus generated three fractions nonpolar mid polar and polar the solvents were selected based on their polarity index and their ability to rapidly phase separate from our water sample nonpolar compounds in the first step 50 ml of pentane was added to 500 ml of effluent sample in a kimax 500 ml glass separatory funnel followed by shaking for 2 min and then allowed to settle for another 10 min for phase separation the solvent layer was then collected and dried using sodium sulfate if there was any emulsion formed during the extraction process the solvent fraction was collected and sonicated branson 1200 ultrasonic bath for 30 min the extracted fraction referred to as nonpolar fraction was collected and stored in a 50 ml muffled amber glass bottle and stored at 4 c until further use mid polar compounds in the second step the effluent retrieved from the first extraction approx 500 ml was then extracted with 50 ml of dichloromethane following the same protocol as described for the nonpolar solvent the mid polar solvent layer was collected and dried through sodium sulfate the resultant solvent fraction referred to as mid polar fraction was sonicated if needed collected and stored as described above polar compounds the remaining aqueous phase after the extractions referred to as polar fraction was then concentrated to 100 ml through rotary evaporation buchi rotovapor re 111 switzerland at 100 c under vacuum 15 psi 2 2 3 solid phase extraction spe the resulting lle fraction were then separated further based on adsorption fig 1 different spe columns were selected for each lle fraction for the nonpolar and mid polar fractions a normal phase extraction was performed using mgso4 columns supelclean envi florisil for polar aqueous fraction a reversed phase spe column with graphitized carbon supelclean envi carb was used the columns were mounted on a vacuum manifold where all the three lle fractions were extracted simultaneously under a pressure of 10 15 psi and a solvent sample loading rate of 1 ml min sitterley et al 2018 the columns were pre conditioned with 1 tube volume of 100 methanol followed by equilibration with 1 tube volume of the solvent similar to the ones the fractions were suspended in after equilibration the phases were loaded onto their respective columns at 1 ml min the flow through for each fraction was captured in disposable test tubes fisherbrand borosilicate glass 16 100mm after loading the compounds were eluted with 20 v v methanol in acetonitrile generating three eluate fractions from nonpolar mid polar and polar phases the three eluate fractions along with the three flow through fractions collected during loading were further concentrated to 500 μl each organic fractions were evaporated using a turbovap lv biotage usa system while the polar flow through aqueous was concentrated to 5 ml using buchi rotovapor under vacuum 15 psi for subsequent chemical analysis an aliquot of 100 μl was taken from each fraction into 400 μl microvolume inserts agilent usa in 1 5 ml amber glass gc vials agilent usa and were stored at 20 c for yes the remaining volume of each fraction was re suspended in 4 6 ml of ultrapure water hplc grade fisher chemical and stored at 4 c the procedure described above was followed for both targeted and non targeted effluent samples generating 6 fractions each for targeted analysis ta and non targeted analysis nta procedure shown in fig 1 a third extraction was performed with 500 ml of ultrapure di water which served as control extraction to ensure that the procedure did not introduce anything that could potentially affect analytical and bioassay results an spe concentrate of raw effluent was also prepared by passing 50 ml of the filtered effluent sample through a hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb oasis cartridge waters ma at 1 ml

yeast estrogen screen yes was conducted to detect estrogenic compounds across the six fractions as well as the secondary effluent sample using the protocol developed by routledge et al 1996 with some modifications adapted from recent studies hull et al 2018 parker et al 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2007 briefly a recombinant yeast strain saccharomyces cerevisiae that was engineered with a gene for human estrogen receptor her and its expression plasmids carrying reporter gene lac z the yeast was exposed in triplicates in a 96 well plate for 72 h at 1 1 ratio sample to cells and media to each of the six fractions from the above extractions in 3 dilutions each along with the raw effluent water samples at 5x 1x 0 5x and 0 1x in the presence of estrogenic compounds the lac z gene is activated and releases an enzyme 17β galactosidase that degrades a chromogenic substrate namely chlorophenol red β d galactopyranoside cprg the color change from yellow to red is quantified by measuring absorption

i c a l 3 results and discussion the estrogenic and analytical screening results of targeted analysis ta are presented in section 3 1 and of non targeted analysis nta in section 3 2 in both the cases the fractions that showed a positive response greater than 20 relative estrogenic activity in the bioassay were screened using lc ms and gc ms for known and unknown compounds present in the sample while the ta with spiked secondary effluent allowed for a semi controlled experiment to demonstrate the proposed approach the nta with the unspiked effluent allowed for the identification of unknown estrogenic compounds present in the sample the following sections discuss the key findings from the above results that support the hypotheses of the current study 3 1 effects directed analysis using a targeted approach 3 1 1 estrogenic screening the ta fractions resulted in a positive estrogenic activity in yes for 3 of the 6 fractions mid polar eluate mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fig 2 the mid polar eluate showed an eeq of 1 73 μg l 100x while the mid polar flow through showed 2 51 μg l 100x and the nonpolar eluate had 2 15 μg l 100x the spiked effluent showed 1 71 μg l eeq at its original concentration 1x fig 2 however the spe extract of the raw secondary effluent without any spiked compounds resulted in 31 cellular inhibition at 5x concentration due to cytotoxicity which is above the standard method s accepted value 20 likely illustrating why no estrogenicity was seen for that sample with respect to inhibition the mid polar and nonpolar flow through fractions showed very mild 10 cellular inhibition in yeast 10 while the other fractions showed no inhibition at all including the spiked raw water si fig 2 3 1 2 analytical screening of targeted compounds the ta fractions that exhibited estrogenic activity fig 2 were screened for the spiked compounds e2 and tcbp using gc ms e2 was identified in two of the three active fractions mid polar eluate and mid polar flow through and tcbp was identified in mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fractions table 1 the compounds were identified by comparing the retention times of compound peaks from extracted ion chromatograms eics in the samples with those of commercial standards while their mass spectra were confirmed from both nist mass spectral search program v2 0 and commercial standards si fig 4 the fractions that did not induce estrogenic activity were also screened for target compounds but no compound peaks were observed the 3 fractions of the spiked effluent fig 2 that showed highest estrogenic activities in yes are those that contained identified peaks of spiked estrogenic compounds e2 and tcbp these results demonstrate the bioassay s ability in an eda to drive the analytical process by correlating toxicity with those fractions that contained the estrogenic compounds spiking the ta effluent with e2 and tcbp allowed us to predict which fractions would have the highest estrogenic activity based on polarity and adsorption capacity the observations were consistent with these predictions showing positive response in the organic fractions from mid polar and nonpolar phases 17 estradiol with an octanol water partition coefficient log kow between 3 1 and 4 0 and an adsorption coefficient log koc of 2 9 was expected to be partitioned into the mid polar phase during lle and show only partial adsorption during spe casey et al 2005 hansch et al 1995 suzuki et al 2005 this was supported by its rate limiting sorption kinetics as studied by casey et al 2005 which showed that e2 adsorption could be time dependent with lower log koc values when column contact times are less than 1 h the spe contact times in this study were similar with about 45 50 min for each lle fraction which explains e2 s partial adsorption and its almost equal distribution between the eluate and flow through of the mid polar phase table 1 tcbp with a higher partition coefficient log kow of 5 47 was speculated to be seen in fractions towards the non polar end of the spectrum as per fig 2 hansch et al 1995 a nonpolar and hydrophobic compound with a log koc of 4 41 tcbp was expected to show at least partial adsorption in both mid polar and nonpolar lle fractions us environmental protection agency s episuite from the results it was evident that a certain percentage of tcbp did partition from the solvent pentane onto the spe column and into the nonpolar eluate fraction however no such partitioning onto the spe column was observed in the mid polar fraction with tcbp having a higher affinity towards the solvent dichloromethane the compound recovery for e2 was 100 of the spiked concentration which is found to be consistent with other estradiol quantification studies casey et al 2005 layton et al 2002 this indicates the reliability of the framework in recovering compounds at low μg l levels while the concentration factor 5x could be increased as needed to achieve ng l levels this is important for detection of trace level compounds that can induce a toxic response at very low concentrations such as e2 on the other hand tcbp recovery was very low at 3 table 1 however this was consistent with some previous studies on chlorinated biphenyls that have reported significantly low recoveries between 3 and 26 due to binding of these compounds onto the plastic in the well plates of yes cseh et al 1989 layton et al 2002 the high losses of tcbp observed in our study could be at least partially attributed to its possible binding to the plastic surfaces of the materials used such as in the spe cartridges pipette tips and well plates used in yes in addition a significant amount of tcbp could have been adsorbed onto the particulates present in the secondary effluent since the compounds e2 and tcbp were added prior to sample filtration a few ways to improve recovery of compounds such as tcbp could be to collect and process the filter residue to extract compounds that adhere to particulate matter suzuki et al 2009 and to limit the use of plastic labware including yes well plates and pipettes the mid polar and nonpolar flow through fractions showed very low cellular inhibition in yeast 15 acceptable value 20 while the others showed no inhibition in addition no significant cytotoxicity was observed in the fractions of the control extraction with di as parent sample si fig 6 the di extraction results si fig 5 and 6 also indicated that there were no interferences in the experimental procedure that could potentially alter the bioassay response the yeast inhibition shown by the effluent and its fractions was insignificant validating the estrogenic data the control sample di water and its fractions were also assessed using yes and analytical instruments neither estrogenic activity nor cytotoxicity in the yeast was observed in any of the control sample or fractions si fig 5 and 6 the analytical results of these samples did not show any significant compound peaks in the total ion chromatograms these results showed the ability of the developed framework to perform as expected with targeted compounds identified in estrogenic fractions this provides confidence in the method s potential to be used for unknown toxicants in addition the framework aims to provide some insight into the toxicants properties such as its polarity hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and adsorptivity which could be useful in treatability studies 3 2 effects directed analysis using a non targeted approach 3 2 1 estrogenic screening non targeted analysis nta with raw secondary effluent was conducted to identify unknown estrogenic compounds in the sample since the same effluent was used for both ta and nta in this study we expected to see little activity in the polar fractions and higher activity in the nonpolar ones similar to what was observed during the ta as expected the nta fractions showed higher eeqs in 3 of the 6 fractions mid polar eluate mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fig 3 the mid polar eluate showed an eeq of 3 01 μg l while the mid polar flow through was at 1 26 μg l and the nonpolar eluate at 2 94 μg l although the fractions that showed estrogenic activity remained the same in both analyses the ta fractions showed higher estrogenic potency compared to the nta fractions as would be expected from adding estrogenic compounds at low μg l levels the non extracted raw effluent showed 1 06 μg l of eeq 95 rea at its original concentration 1x but the spe concentrate showed an inhibition of 31 si fig 3 suggesting the increased concentration of compounds at 5x was cytotoxic to the yeast however since the same level of inhibition was not seen among the concentrated fractions the cytotoxicity was likely attributed to the matrix effects of other constituents in the secondary effluent this result reinforced a key hypothesis of the study that complex water samples could generate complicated toxicological responses preventing an in depth analysis from a bioassay the spe concentrate used in this study if tested as is for a toxicological endpoint would have produced a mere cytotoxic response that would have failed to communicate the presence of active estrogenic compounds and the 1x effluent sample would have been too complex to identify compounds at lower concentrations without a concentration factor the fractionation followed by concentration helped isolate and elevate the compound levels without proportionally concentrating the matrix effect that may cause cytotoxicity and inhibition of the yeast in yes alternatively other in vitro bioassays which are less sensitive to cytotoxicity and more rapid can be used such as e screen er calux ahr calux and assays based on mammalian cell lines escher et al 2018b jarošová et al 2015 that might have mitigated cytotoxicity exhibited in yes 3 2 2 analytical screening for non targeted compounds the fractions with positive estrogenic response in the secondary effluent fig 3 fractions were screened for unknown estrogenic compounds using lc ms and gc ms the lc ms results specifically for the polar fraction did not result in any putative identifications the gc ms results of mid polar eluate mid polar flow through and nonpolar eluate fractions were screened for compound peaks with significant intensities and a nist spectral match factor forward reverse greater than 800 the resultant list consisted of 15 compounds which were further screened from the literature for estrogenic activity si table 1 three of the 15 compounds were found to be estrogenic based on published toxicological data and experimental evidence si fig 1 the three identified compounds table 2 were benzophenone bp cas 119 61 9 diethyl phthalate dep cas 84 66 2 and di isobutyl phthalate dibp cas 84 69 5 the estrogenic potency of the 3 identified compounds was verified by conducting a confirmation bioassay with yes the assay was done with compound standards as per the procedure described in section 2 4 with six different concentrations ranging from 0 001 mg l to 100 mg l the results showed positive response with relative effect potencies rep for bp dep and dibp at 0 1 10 3 0 3 10 3 and 0 5 10 3 respectively with minimal cellular inhibition at these concentrations analytical standards of the compounds were used for identification and quantification with the results shown in table 2 and the mass spectra in fig 4 these compounds have been found in wastewaters and surface waters those that receive a treated effluent in numerous studies to date berset and etter holzer 2001 clara et al 2010 oh et al 2006 bp and its derivatives have been reported in effluent fed river samples in the μg l mg l levels with some rivers containing as high as 400 μg l of bp jeon et al 2006 kawaguchi et al 2008 tsui et al 2014 phthalates are widely used in stabilizers lubricants personal care products toys and paints clara et al 2010 oh et al 2006 oh et al 2006 reported the presence of phthalates in secondary effluent impacted source waters with about 1 μg l of dibp and 2 7 μg l of dep the calculated concentrations found in the secondary effluent studied herein table 2 were consistent with those reported in literature suggesting that the fractionation method is applicable to other environmental samples i e drinking water or surface water with varying levels of constituents i e ng l to mg l as mentioned previously an increase in the concentration factor could improve the method s ability in detecting compounds in the ng l range 3 3 quantification and estrogenic contribution of non targeted compounds the calculated concentrations in the fractions were also used to estimate the contribution of each compound to the estrogenic response in the raw secondary effluent table 2 the calibration curves generated for each standard gc ms were used to calculate the compound concentrations in the fractions these data were then used to estimate potential estrogenic activity for each compound as a fraction of the total seen in the secondary effluent based on dose response curves for each chemical si fig 1a b and 1c according to our projections bp would elicit an eeq of 0 1 10 3 μg l at its calculated concentration while dep and dibp would induce 2 6 10 3 μg l and 1 9 10 3 μg l respectively the three compounds together accounted for less than 1 of the raw secondary effluent s eeq concentration which was 1 06 μg l si fig 7 while the rea approach eq 1 simply uses absorbance values relative to the reference compound the eeq approach is more commonly accepted as it normalizes the estrogenic potencies to e2 the discrepancies in the contribution between eeqs and the reas si fig 7 and 8 indicate the presence of other undetected compounds in our lc and gc ms analyses the calculated concentrations show that the nonpolar eluate contains the highest percentage of bp 0 80 μg l dep 5 99 μg l and dibp 3 55 μg l on the other hand mid polar eluate has been identified with only 2 of the 3 compounds bp dep at relatively lower concentrations from this we could expect that the nonpolar eluate fraction would show significantly higher estrogenic potency however both the mid polar eluate and nonpolar eluate showed similar estrogenicity with eeqs of 3 01 μg l and 2 95 μg l respectively this suggests that there could be other unidentified compounds in the mid polar eluate fraction that induced the unaccounted activity alternatively it could be due to the presence of unidentified anti estrogenic compounds in the nonpolar eluate fraction eliciting a masking effect in yes this notion is supported by our initial list of 15 compounds that include some anti estrogenic compounds this hypothesis also considers the fact that the compound peak analysis of the total ion chromatograms tics showed a wide range of compounds present in the nonpolar eluate fraction however since we relied on high spectral match factor for our study some of the compounds on the list although identified as common estrogens anti estrogens were not further investigated for example one suspect compound in the nonpolar eluate was dibutyl phthalate dbp which has been reported previously to elicit anti estrogenic effects bhatia et al 2013 it was observed that the presence of antagonists such as dbp can cause a reduction in the estrogenic activity of the agonists by up to 50 we suspect that the discrepancy seen in the predicted and observed estrogenic responses in the nonpolar eluate in this study in spite of containing the higher concentrations of bp dep and dibp could have been due to possible masking effects by an antagonist like dbp and or other unidentified compounds in the fraction the gc and lc ms was run in a full scan mode for all the samples which also made it challenging to identify other unknown compounds in the effluent that could have been present in low concentrations the framework could be more robust by developing a targeted method that screened for a comprehensive suite of edcs commonly present in wastewater thus increasing the sensitivity of the instrument and method additionally previous studies such as neale et al 2015 showed that the detected chemicals in a complex mixture could account for 80 of estrogenic activity but only 2 of more complex biological effects such as adaptive stress response neale et al 2015 while it is easier to explain a specific endpoint such as estrogenicity which is more sensitive to even low concentrations of natural and synthetic estrogens further research is needed to isolate compounds responsible for overall organism response to a toxic mixture neale et al 2015 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that the proposed two stage water sample fractionation scheme and methods facilitate identification of chemical drivers for targeted toxicity effects and provide insights into the chemical nature of toxicants i e polarity and adsorption behaviors the fractionation followed by concentration helped isolate and elevate the compound levels without proportionally concentrating the matrix effect that may cause cytotoxicity and inhibition of the bioassay for both ta and nta the water sample fractionation and separation coupled with high throughput in vitro bioassay enabled effective identification of both known and unknown chemicals that contributed to estrogenic effects in addition the knowledge of the effect causing compounds chemical nature hydrophobic nonpolar can be used for treatment technology development and optimization for risk reduction and mitigation particularly for potable reuse scenarios the framework with further optimization can provide a cost effective and time saving toxicity

consuming food with health promoting properties and free of additives jointly with the lack of time are linked with the rapid development and exponential growth of the fresh cut produce industry the fresh cut products meet the requirements of current consumers because they have almost the same nutritional properties as the fresh products and they are marketed ready to eat artés hernández et al 2013 the large amounts of water used for washing disinfecting and rinsing of products make the fresh cut produce industry one of the major water consumers of the agro food sector although water demand depends on the specific activity of each process plant frequency of water refilling washing tanks product water ratio etc the water consumption can be up to 40 m3 ton 1 of raw product vmm 2006 the absence of a specific pathogen inactivation step in the production process converts these products into an important route of foodborne pathogens transmission holvoet et al 2012 their role as pathogen vehicle has been confirmed by a number of outbreaks caused mainly by e coli 0157 h7 and salmonella spp recently a multistate outbreak linked with raw eaten chopped lettuce in usa got 210 people from 36 states infected 96 people hospitalized and 5 deaths cdc 2018 to avoid the associated risk with pathogens the most common strategy in this industry is the use of a sanitizer agent during the washing step chlorine is the most commonly used due to its easy application low cost and its high germicide potential in a broad spectrum nevertheless its excessive use hyperchlorination generates undesired chlorine by products disinfection by products as trihalomethanes due to the very well known reaction between chlorine and the organic matter om present in the washing water banach et al 2015 consequently the use of chlorine in fresh cut industry has been recently banned in some european countries requiring therefore alternative water disinfection treatments bilek and turantaş 2013 additionally a concern about fresh food chemical contamination has arisen in 2016 the worldwide pesticide consumption was estimated in 480 000 tonnes faostat 2019 and currently it is well known the fate or uptake of pesticides by crops during their growth santarelli et al 2018 christoua et al 2019 in fact residual concentrations of pesticides in the range of μg kg 1 are detected in both vegetables and wash water santarelli et al 2018 therefore when implementing any water treatment in this type of industry the presence and reduction of these pollutants or ps must be considered due to they are a priority challenge in order to protect the health and environment rizzo et al 2019 in this context over the latest years the interest in ozonation as a chorination replacement treatment in food processing industries has increased being recently declared generally recognized as safe gras status for food contact its use has been approved in many countries due to its high biocidal efficacy in a wide antimicrobial spectrum high penetrability and decomposition without leaving residues smetanska et al 2013 the capability of ozone o3 and the advanced oxidation process of o3 h2o2 so called peroxone are known as one of the most efficient tertiary treatments for wastewater disinfection and decontamination margot et al 2013 in literature there are a number of studies reporting the use of ozonation for product and water disinfection in fresh cut industry particularly applied as aqueous ozone for controlling waterborne pathogen populations smetanska et al 2013 miller et al 2013 reported about the application of gaseous ozone in pilot scale for preservation of fruits and vegetables miller et al 2013 and strickland et al 2010 demonstrated the efficiency of aqueous ozone at industrial scale strickland et al 2010 nevertheless the removal of organic microcontaminants omcs especially pesticides has not been widely investigated and little information about its elimination in fresh cut wastewater is available in literature wu et al 2007 demonstrated a 60 90 reduction of methyl parathion cypermethrin parathion and diazinon by ozonation in wash water wu et al 2007 and a recent work reported on the degradation of diazinon cyprodinil and phosmet by electrolyzed oxidizing eo water treatment qi et al 2018 on the other hand peroxone treatment is also a highly efficient process for wastewater treatment however according to our knowledge no information is currently available about the use of o3 h2o2 treatment for water disinfection and decontamination in the food industry therefore the main goal of this study was to assess the efficiency of ozone and peroxone treatment for the simultaneous removal of 6 omcs pesticides and the inactivation of two foodborne pathogens e

detection limit dl of this procedure is 2 cfu ml 1 bacterial regrowth was evaluated for both pathogens after 24 48 and 72 h using the same procedure and no regrowth was observed in any case 2 4 ozonation pilot plant the ozonation pilot plant consists of a column reactor with an inlet o3 diffuser for batch operation with a maximum capacity of 20 l anseros pap pilot plant anseros klaus nonnenmacher gmbh germany fig 1 the reactor is equipped with an oxygen generator anseros sep100 and an ozone generator anseros com ad02 two non dispersive uv analyzers bmt 964 to measure inlet and outlet ozone gas concentration a flow meter for inlet air regulation and an ozone destroyer to remove residual ozone and avoid o3 release to the atmosphere the operational conditions of the ozone pilot plant used in this study was 10 l of total volume of water a constant inlet air flow of 0 06 n m3 h 1 and two different initial ozone production of 0 09 and 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 resulting from the ozone generator working at 10 or 20 power respectively the ozone concentration in solution was measured also by a colorimetric method based on the decolouration reaction between molecular ozone and the cc bond of potassium indigotrisulfonate sigma aldrich clesceri and greenberg 1998 2 5 experimental procedure the ozone production selected in this study was 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 an average value for sfcww disinfection and decontamination considering the range of ozone production commonly employed in this type of industry 0 02 0 4 go3 l 1 h 1 strickland et al 2010 selma et al 2008 the following experimental conditions were investigated i ozonation at natural scfww ph ii ozonation at basic ph 11 iii peroxone at natural scfww ph adding doses of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 and iv peroxone with doses of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 at basic ph 11 furthermore peroxone treatment with doses of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 at a higher o3 generation 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 and natural sfcww ph was also addressed the experimental procedure was as follows sfcww was prepared following the recipe previously described and for basic ph tests a naoh solution 2 m was used water ph was monitored using a ph meter 110 k horiba laqua act and non significant variations 6 25 0 14 and 11 0 04 were observed along the treatment time for any of the conditions tested then omcs and pathogens were directly diluted from stock solutions in sfcww to reach initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 each omc and 106 cfu ml 1 respectively this step added 20 mg l 1 of doc for peroxone tests an initial dose of h2o2 20 mg l 1 was added and when concentration of h2o2 was lower than ca 1 5 mg l 1 additional doses were added to avoid limitations of the reagent during the experiment the h2o2 dose was chosen considering an ozone water mass transfer of 50 and to obtain a molar ratio of 0 6 1 h2o2 o3 which is very close to the optimum for peroxone process 0 5 1 according to the reaction stoichiometry after 10 min of recirculation in the dark for homogenization an initial sample was taken out and immediately the ozone generator was switch on water samples were taken out at regular intervals during 240 min total treatment time and analyzed following the procedure previously described in all samples the residual ozone concentration was immediately removed with n2 for peroxone tests a stock solution of bovine liver catalase at 0 1 g l 1 sigma aldrich usa was added to the samples at 1 50 catalase solution sample to eliminate residual h2o2 nahim granados et al 2018 the ozone consumption of each sample was calculated taking into account the ozone measurements at the sample time inlet outlet and in solution and the ozone consumption of the previous sample roccamante et al 2019 dissolved organic carbon doc at the beginning and at the end of the experiments was determined using a toc analyzer model 5050 shimadzu japon all tests were carried out in duplicate results were highly reproducible showing p value 0 05 therefore omcs degradation and bacterial inactivation kinetic profiles as a function of the treatment time are shown as the average value of two replicates with standard deviation as error bar the kinetic analysis of omcs removal was performed following a pseudo first order kinetic fitting the experimental data according to a log linear decay chick s law 2 6 ecotoxicity evaluation acute ecotoxicity was assessed with the bioluminescence marine bacterium vibrio fischeri and the crustacean daphnia magna samples were analyzed at 100 50 25 12 5 and 6 25 v v dilutions in triplicate the effective concentrations 50 ec50 were calculated by fitting the experimental data to dose response curves when the ec50 did not reach toxicity it was expressed as of toxic effect inhibition or immobilization additionally to classify the sample s ecotoxicity level ec50 in of dilution was converted into toxic units tu calculated as 100 divided by the ec50 when the percentage of toxic effect exposed to 100 v v of samples was below 50 tu was calculated as parts of 50 effect in case of low toxicity 20 toxic effect tu was considered zero the 30 min luminescence inhibition test with v fischeri was carried out according to the manufacturer biofix lumi 10 specifications following the standard iso 11348 3 1998 freitas et al 2017 the toxicity was measured as the percentage of v fischeri bioluminescence inhibition after 30 min exposure the 48 h immobilization bioassays with the water flea d magna was performed following the standard operational procedures of the commercial daphtoxkit f in compliance with standard guidelines oecd guidelines no 202 freitas et al 2017 the toxicity was assessed by determining the immobility of the exposed daphnids for 48 h 3 results 3 1 bacterial inactivation the inactivation profiles of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis in sfcww at natural 6 25 and basic ph 11 by both ozonation o3 and peroxone treatment o3 h2o2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively in all cases detection limit dl 2 cfu ml 1 was reached for both pathogens showing a similar inactivation kinetic order for both pathogens ozonation ph 6 25 ozonation ph 11 peroxone ph 6 25 peroxone ph 11 with treatment times ranged between 2 and 20 min the fastest inactivation was obtained with ozonation treatment at ph 6 25 in this case the concentrations of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis were reduced 5 log in 2 and 4 min respectively results also showed that neither h2o2 addition higher ph nor higher o3 generation 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 determined a faster inactivation kinetic previous studies showed that the h2o2 concentration 20 mg l 1 selected did not generate any viability loss on the two microorganisms target of this study therefore the disinfection results observed can be only attributed to the ozonation peroxone processes nahim granados et al 2018 moreover a remarkable difference on the resistance is observed between both pathogens fig 2 and table 1 s enteritidis showed a higher resistance than e coli o157 h7 in all the operational conditions investigated at the best conditions of this study ozonation at ph 6 25 the kinetic rate of e coli o157 h7 k 2 79 0 00 min 1 was much faster than s enteritidis k 1 47 0 40 min 1 3 2 organic microcontaminants removal to compare the global efficiency of each operational condition the sum of the total omcs investigated was analyzed and results are shown in fig 3 for the first 15 min of treatment results did not show any significant differences reaching 50 of ʃomcs removal after that ozone with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 6 25 and 11 and peroxone treatment with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 11 reached more than 50 of ʃomcs degradation in 30 min with a slightly better performance of ozone treatment with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 11 70 of ʃomcs removal from 30 to 120 min no differences were observed between these operational conditions reaching ca 85 of ʃomcs removal in all cases therefore and similarly to bacterial inactivation results it can be concluded that the best condition for ʃomcs removal from sfcww is the ozone treatment with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at the natural water ph 6 25 in addition results of individual omcs degradation by each ozonation operating condition are shown in fig si1 in all cases two groups of omcs can be differentiated according to their degradation resistance g1 omcs azoxystrobin buprofezin and terbutryn and g2 omcs imidacloprid simazine and thiamethoxam these differences can be attributed to their respective chemical structure and it will be deeply discussed in next section in general a similar trend was observed for both groups of omcs in all operating conditions tested g1 omcs were completely removed reaching in all cases the limit of quantification loq while g2 omcs revealed different rates of degradation depending on such operating conditions 3 3 reagents consumption the profiles of ozone and h2o2 consumptions along the ozonation experiments are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively focusing on the first stage of the process 30 min of treatment ozone consumption was similar at natural and basic ph detecting 19 and 18 mg l 1 respectively in peroxone treatment o3 h2o2 at 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 the consumption of ozone increased at both phs being significantly higher 40 mg l 1 at natural ph regarding h2o2 consumption no significant differences were observed between all peroxone tests at 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 while a slightly higher demand on h2o2 consumption was obtained when ozone generation increased to 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 3 4 ecotoxicity analysis acute toxicity was evaluated before and during sfcww ozonation with the best operating condition found 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 6 25 using d magna and v fischeri as test organisms table 2 toxicity tests showed an increase in acute toxicity during ozonation in both organisms even though crustaceans demonstrated to be more sensitive than the bacterium as 100 of inmobilization was achieved at 30 min whereas the toxic effect in v fisheri was not higher than 50 throughout the experiment particularly for v fisheri the toxicity increased from 0 5 tu at 30 min to 0 9 tu at 90 min of treatment time and later it kept constant in the case of d magna the acute toxicity showed an increasing trend from 2 2 to 4 6 tu at 30 and 240 min respectively according to the toxicity classification system for waste discharged into the aquatic environment proposed by persoone et al 2003 the treated wastewater should be classified as class ii for v fischeri slight acute toxicity whereas for d magna as class iii acute toxicity in addition the potential effect of bromate on v fischeri was investigated due to the absence of this information in literature a toxicity test with 1 5 mg l 1 of bromate concentration was performed and any toxic effect was detected data not shown 4 discussion the strong potential of ozone to degrade organic molecules and to inactivate pathogens in water is very well known in this study the efficiency of ozonation 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at two different water phs was investigated natural sfcww ph 6 25 and basic ph 11 the reaction pathways of this process is also well described in literature and briefly it can be explained by i direct oxidation which is a selective and fast reaction between o3 and targets with electron rich moieties which depends mainly on the water ph and ii indirect oxidation which involves the generation of reactive oxygen species ros mainly oh by several reactions eqs 1 9 explained by the following general mechanism gottschalk et al 2009 i initiation step eqs 1 and 2 where superoxide anion radical o 2 and hydroperoxyl radical h o 2 are generated ii radical chain eqs 3 7 where hydroxyl radicals oh are generated and hydroperoxyl radical h o 2 are regenerated and iii termination step where reactions with matrix constituents om eq 8 or reactions between radicals eq 9 can occur 1 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 k 70 m 1 s 1 2 h o 2 o 2 h pk a 4 8 3 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 k 1 6 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 h o 3 o 3 h pk a 6 2 5 h o 3 o h o 2 k 1 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 6 o h o 3 h o 4 k 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 h o 4 o 2 h o 2 k 2 8 10 4 s 1 8 o m o h o 2 p 9 o h h o 2 o 2 h 2 o k 3 7 10 10 m 1 s 1 the predominant reaction path in ozonation depends on water ph which affects the o3 decomposition kinetics at phs lower than 8 the direct oxidation by o3 seems to be the predominant pathway at phs 8 the o3 decomposition kinetics is accelerated favoring therefore the indirect oxidation of organic compounds mainly by the oh generated beltrán 2003 our results for all targets showed no differences in the removal kinetic rates between both water phs figs 2 and 3 this clearly evidences that in these experimental conditions the direct attack of o3 was enough to guarantee a successful performance of the process additionally to water ph the o3 degradation rate is also affected by other parameters including water temperature alkalinity and presence of doc nevertheless none of these parameters suffered changes throughout our experimental conditions thus the differences on degradation rates between omcs and inactivation profiles of bacteria will depend mainly of their chemical and microbiological structure respectively the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by ozone is mainly based on the progressive oxidation of vital cellular components ending with the cell s death it is well explained that components of cell wall lipoprotein and the lipopolysaccharide layers are the first targets kim et al 1999 it has been estimated that ca 3 108 molecules of ozone are needed to inactivate a cell of e coli khadre et al 2001 in the case of the pathogens under study although both belong to gram negative type bacteria same structured cell wall a slight difference between both strains were observed showing s entetiditis a higher resistance than e coli to be inactivatedbe inactivated this behavior has been previously reported in literature and it was attributed to the higher amount of phospholipids components in salmonella cell membrane that rise up its density and rigidity and therefore increase its resistance against oxidation by ozone compared with e coli alwi and ali 2014 moreover the additional oxidative stress generated by other ros produced during this process must be also considered as responsible of damage it is reported that the regulator of the general stress response rpos the superoxide response regulon soxrs and the trans activator of the response to h2o2 oxyr show an important role in bacterial protection against ozonation patil et al 2011 in a previous study the higher resistance of s enteritidis compared with e coli has been also observed towards another oxidative treatment uva solar process with added h2o2 attributing the upregulation of these regulators as the possible differences between both bacteria nahim granados et al 2018 therefore the bacterial response to oxidative stress may also contribute to explain the observed high resistance few minutes of s enteritidis to ozonation compared with e coli a wide spectrum of results in fresh cut wash water disinfection by ozonation can be found in literature with disinfection results varied from 0 5 to 5 log reduction value of bacteria e coli total coliforms listeria sp etc using aqueous o3 doses ranged from 0 5 to 25 mgo3 l 1 and also different treatment times from a few minutes to 60 90 min smetanska et al 2013 therefore the required ozone dose and treatment time for water disinfection depend on many parameters such as the target microorganism the physic chemical water characteristics and also the mass transfer of ozone from the gas to the liquid phase although in all these case studies the benefit of using this treatment was clearly demonstrated as in our results regarding omcs degradation direct o3 oxidation at ph 6 25 was also the dominant pathway fig 3 the degradation profile of each omc at this operational condition fig si1a showed a faster removal of g1 omcs terbutryn k 6 69 10 3 min 1 buprofezin k 3 04 10 3 min 1 azoxystrobin k 2 85 10 3 min 1 compared with g2 omcs imidacloprid k 3 96 10 4 min 1 simazine k 2 70 10 4 min 1 thiamethoxam k 2 22 10 4 min 1 this kinetic behavior can be explained based on the omc chemical structures discarding any effect based on its speciation due to the fact that all target omcs have a pka value below the water ph except imidacloprid which will be in protonated form table si2 a similar behavior was previously reported for the abatement of a mix of organophosphate esters where two different kinetics rates were also observed for two contaminant groups depending on their chemical structure yuan et al 2015 the degradation mechanism by direct ozone attack is based on an initial electrophilic attack and therefore the presence of electron rich moieties π bonds with delocalized electrons electron rich heteroatoms electron withdrawing groups ewg and electron donating group edg in the omc structures is the key to understand the fast degradation of g1 omcs hübner et al 2013 in particular for g1 omcs terbutryn and buprofezin contains electron rich heteroatoms sulfurs and nitrogens with hydrogen available in α position respect to the heteroatom buprofezin also have a π system benzene ring barletta et al 2003 azoxystrobin contains several electron rich moieties as the acrylate double bond and alcoxybenze groups for g2 omcs the lower kinetic rates observed for the neonicotinoid pesticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam can be explained by the presence of high oxidized groups no2 in their structure which are resistant to ozone and radical oxidation the higher resistance of simazine a triazine g2 omcs respect to terbutryn other triazine g1 omcs is peculiar as both contain a triazine ring this can be due to the absence of sulfur in simazine side chains while it has a ewg group cl that confers less susceptibility to an electrophilic attack chen et al 2008 on the other hand it is well described that the generation of oh by ozone indirect pathway can be increased by addition of h2o2 peroxone process through o3 reaction with the h2o2 conjugate base ho2 eq 10 and 11 nevertheless contrary to what was commonly accepted gottschalk et al 2009 recent studies has been demonstrated that the oh generation yield in the peroxone process is near to 0 5 instead to 1 i e twice o3 molecules are required to generate one oh merenyi et al 2010 fischbacher et al 2013 the proposed mechanistic interpretation for the low yield observed is based on an adduct formation ho5 eq 11 which can decompose through 2 different ways eqs 12 and 13 of which only one yields oh eq 13 15 10 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 11 ho 2 o 3 ho 5 12 ho 5 2 o 2 oh 13 ho 5 ho 2 o 3 14 o 3 o 2 o 15 o h 2 o o h oh it is also important to mention that the equilibrium of eqs 14 and 15 are shifted to the right in complex water matrices as in our case due to the o and oh generated oh in a greater extend quickly react with the water constituents merenyi et al 2010 taking into account these latest findings the potential treatment benefits by h2o2 addition during ozonation may be only based on the faster ozone decomposition into oh and not also on the higher radical yields as accepted until now in the present work the addition of h2o2 doses 20 mg l 1 was also investigated at natural and basic ph however results showed that in all cases the σomcs and bacterial kinetics rates were lower than the obtained for conventional ozone at natural water ph fig 2 and 3 and table 1 this detrimental effect observed was higher at natural ph than basic ph which can be explained due to the reaction between o3 and ho2 present a much lower rate constant at near neutral ph as a consequence of the high pka value 11 8 of h2o2 nothe et al 2009 the lower efficiency of peroxone process observed has been previously reported in literature and can be attributed to several reasons 1 the lower o3 concentration in solution fig si2 in supplementary information which gives rise to lower removal rates of the ozone reactive targets collivignarelli et al 2017 lee et al 2014 2 dual role of h2o2 in combination with o3 since h2o2 may act as scavenger of oh when is in excess in the sample de torres socías et al 2013 and 3 the low o3 stability fast depletion in complex water matrices where the o3 react preferentially with some water constituents over h2o2 resulting in lower oh yields wang et al 2018 in the specific case of sfcww the three reasons explained above can contribute to the lower efficiency observed taking into account the fast ozone depletion in this water matrix 45 mg l 1 of doc high quantity of suspended solids 100 ntu and presence of nitrite ions 0 15 0 03 mg l 1 therefore the fast ozone decrease required a higher ozone concentration in solution in fact this observation was confirmed in our study where the efficiency of the overall process simultaneous removal of omcs and bacteria improved by increasing the inlet of o3 from 0 09 to 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 fig 2 and 3 doc was also monitored and its removal was only observed for the two processes at basic ph where the expected major oxidant substance is oh with removal percentages lower than 20 doc values decreased from an initial value of 45 to 40 mg l 1 11 and 37 5 mg l 1 17 at the end of ozonation and peroxone processes at basic ph respectively these results can be correlated with ozone consumption as it was much higher for all the conditions compared with ozone treatment at natural ph fig 4a these higher ozone consumptions clearly suggest that under these operational conditions the ros generation is the predominant pathway enhancing the doc elimination but not specifically favoring the degradation of the target pollutants bacteria and omcs wastewater ozonation presents some drawbacks one of the most important ones is the formation during the process of toxic by products such as bromate which is a potential human carcinogen regarding water legislation although there is not a specific guideline for its presence in wastewater the parametric value of bromate is already stablished for drinking water quality in a limit value of 10 μg l 1 who 2011 and an environmental quality standard of 50 μg l 1 is recommended in wastewater soltermann et al 2017 rizzo et al 2019 bromate formation during ozonation depends on several factors such as t ph and doc but is mainly linked with the initial bromide concentration and the specific ozone doses applied previous studies have reported that the bromide concentration found in urban wastewater varies between μg l 1 to a few mgl 1 the molar bromate yields after ozonation applying the most usual specific ozone doses for wastewater treatment from 0 4 to 0 6 go3 g 1 doc was found to be in the range of 3 5 therefore considering this yield conversion in the most conservative condition i e 5 the bromate concentration expected in our water matrix with a measured content of bromide of 0 10 0 03 mg l 1 will not be higher than 10 μg l 1 which is below the limits recommended for the environment and similar to the maximum allowed value in drinking water legislations soltermann et al 2017 rizzo et al 2019 nevertheless bromate was measured with ionic chromatography in all experimental conditions tested and it was never detected values above 50 μg l 1 the lod of this technique confirming only the environmental quality standard recommended in wastewater which is the objective of this research in line with the potential toxicity of this process it was observed in the tests with aquatic organisms an increase in the acute toxicity during ozonation 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 6 25 which can be attributed to the possible formation of toxic ozonation by products at this condition nevertheless the commonly expected bromate formation as toxic disinfection by products has been discarded due to toxicity test in v fischeri did not shown any effect and according to literature the ec50 value reported for the crustaceum 179 mg l 1 hutchinson et al 1997 is almost three fold higher than the detected in this study the by products may come from the partial oxidation of the organic matter doc content of 45 mg l 1 being degraded into lower molecular and toxic compounds in the mg l 1 range such as carboxylic acids or aldehydes or unknown omcs intermediates in the μg ng l 1 range these refractory compounds have also been stated as one of the main causes for the toxicity showed by v fischeri and d magna in previous ozonation studies carbajo et al 2015 and park et al 2016 therefore despite that the 85 of ʃomcs were eliminated the toxic effects in both organisms increase in parallel with ʃomcs degradation fig 3 which indicates that the treatment efficiency should be focused also in achieving higher organic matter oxidation the toxicity generated during ozonation process could be also reduced by including a subsequent stage in the treatment line based on biologically activated carbon filter bac or sand filters rizzo et al 2019 finally an economic analysis was performed considering the following assumptions 50 m3 day 1 of water 365 days year 1 of operation 18250 m3 year 1 and a serviceable life of the equipment of 20 years applying a 5 interest rate which leading to a capital recovery factor cfr of 8 the total cost was calculated considering investment cost ic operational costs oc and maintenance costs mc the ic for the ozonation treatment was calculated according to cañizares et al 2009 the annual mc was considered to be 2 5 of the annual ic and the oc was calculated based on the electric consumption of the ozonation plant and an electricity price of 0 155 kw h 1 for the estimation of the electric consumption the figure of merit electrical energy per order eeo eq 16 was used 16 e e o p k w t h 1000 v l log c i c f where p is the rated power t the treatment time 2 h v is the volume of water treated 10 l and ci and cf the initial and final concentration of the target 600 and 90 μg l 1 85 degradation of the ʃomcs the rate power was calculated considering the electric consumption supplied by the manufacturer 7 5 and 18 kwh kg 1 for ozone generation and oxygen concentration respectively and the ozone flow used in our experimental conditions 0 0009 kg h 1 the resultant eeo in our experimental conditions was 5 6 kwh m 3 the calculation of total cost is summarized in table 3 the obtained tc for sfcww ozonation in our best operational condition was 1 16 m 3 of which the breakdown of the relative costs indicate that mc represent the 1 whereas ic 44 and oc 55 have similar contributions to the total cost the cost obtained is in line with the cost estimated by garrett et al 2003 ca 1 2 m 3 for a small or medium sized fresh cut industry 5 conclusions the application of ozonation treatment in agro food wastewater has been proven to be a good option for reducing and keeping bacterial and omcs below the established guidelines and regulations avoiding therefore their further accumulation in the washing water and the probability of pollutants uptake or deposition in the commercialized products from the different operational conditions tested the simplest condition i e ozonation at natural ph leads the higher kinetics rates for both chemical and biological pollutants regarding omcs up to 85 of σomcs quantify in this research were removed from sfcww requiring an o3 consumption of 27 4 mgo3 l 1 and 120 min of treatment time for bacteria 5 log reduction of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis was achieved in less than 10 min with an ozone dose 8 6 mg l 1 finally in spite of ozonation proving to be a feasible process for decontamination and disinfection of sfcww the increase in acute toxicity observed indicates that further studies should be done to reduce the dbps formation and the toxicity generated therefore different research lines should be explored such as shorter treatment times increasing the mineralization efficiency by applying

18272,in this research the capability of ozonation and peroxone treatment for the simultaneous disinfection and decontamination of wash water from the fresh cut industry has been investigated at pilot plant scale 10 l the removal efficiency of six organic microcontaminants omcs four of them priority substances and the inactivation of two foodborne pathogens escherichia coli o157 h7 and salmonella enteritidis in synthetic fresh cut wastewater sfcww has been assessed ozonation and peroxone o3 with 20 mgl 1 of h2o2 process has been investigated under several operational conditions natural sfcww

obtained with ozonation treatment at natural ph omcs degradation was obtained after 120 min of treatment with an ozone dose of 27 4 mgo3 l 1 first order kinetic constant of each omc degradation was obtained and two clear different groups have been identify based on their degradation profiles which have been correlated with their chemical structure g1 omc terbutryn buprofezin azoxystrobin g2 omc imidacloprid simazine thiamethoxam as for bacterial inactivation up to 10 min of treatment time and an ozone dose of 8 6 mgo3 l 1 were required to reach the detection limit 2 cfu ml 1 showing e coli

consuming food with health promoting properties and free of additives jointly with the lack of time are linked with the rapid development and exponential growth of the fresh cut produce industry the fresh cut products meet the requirements of current consumers because they have almost the same nutritional properties as the fresh products and they are marketed ready to eat artés hernández et al 2013 the large amounts of water used for washing disinfecting and rinsing of products make the fresh cut produce industry one of the major water consumers of the agro food sector although water demand depends on the specific activity of each process plant frequency of water refilling washing tanks product water ratio etc the water consumption can be up to 40 m3 ton 1 of raw product vmm 2006 the absence of a specific pathogen inactivation step in the production process converts these products into an important route of foodborne pathogens transmission holvoet et al 2012 their role as pathogen vehicle has been confirmed by a number of outbreaks caused mainly by e coli 0157 h7 and salmonella spp recently a multistate outbreak linked with raw eaten chopped lettuce in usa got 210 people from 36 states infected 96 people hospitalized and 5 deaths cdc 2018 to avoid the associated risk with pathogens the most common strategy in this industry is the use of a sanitizer agent during the washing step chlorine is the most commonly used due to its easy application low cost and its high germicide potential in a broad spectrum nevertheless its excessive use hyperchlorination generates undesired chlorine by products disinfection by products as trihalomethanes due to the very well known reaction between chlorine and the organic matter om present in the washing water banach et al 2015 consequently the use of chlorine in fresh cut industry has been recently banned in some european countries requiring therefore alternative water disinfection treatments bilek and turantaş 2013 additionally a concern about fresh food chemical contamination has arisen in 2016 the worldwide pesticide consumption was estimated in 480 000 tonnes faostat 2019 and currently it is well known the fate or uptake of pesticides by crops during their growth santarelli et al 2018 christoua et al 2019 in fact residual concentrations of pesticides in the range of μg kg 1 are detected in both vegetables and wash water santarelli et al 2018 therefore when implementing any water treatment in this type of industry the presence and reduction of these pollutants or ps must be considered due to they are a priority challenge in order to protect the health and environment rizzo et al 2019 in this context over the latest years the interest in ozonation as a chorination replacement treatment in food processing industries has increased being recently declared generally recognized as safe gras status for food contact its use has been approved in many countries due to its high biocidal efficacy in a wide antimicrobial spectrum high penetrability and decomposition without leaving residues smetanska et al 2013 the capability of ozone o3 and the advanced oxidation process of o3 h2o2 so called peroxone are known as one of the most efficient tertiary treatments for wastewater disinfection and decontamination margot et al 2013 in literature there are a number of studies reporting the use of ozonation for product and water disinfection in fresh cut industry particularly applied as aqueous ozone for controlling waterborne pathogen populations smetanska et al 2013 miller et al 2013 reported about the application of gaseous ozone in pilot scale for preservation of fruits and vegetables miller et al 2013 and strickland et al 2010 demonstrated the efficiency of aqueous ozone at industrial scale strickland et al 2010 nevertheless the removal of organic microcontaminants omcs especially pesticides has not been widely investigated and little information about its elimination in fresh cut wastewater is available in literature wu et al 2007 demonstrated a 60 90 reduction of methyl parathion cypermethrin parathion and diazinon by ozonation in wash water wu et al 2007 and a recent work reported on the degradation of diazinon cyprodinil and phosmet by electrolyzed oxidizing eo water treatment qi et al 2018 on the other hand peroxone treatment is also a highly efficient process for wastewater treatment however according to our knowledge no information is currently available about the use of o3 h2o2 treatment for water disinfection and decontamination in the food industry therefore the main goal of this study was to assess the efficiency of ozone and peroxone treatment for the simultaneous removal of 6 omcs pesticides and the inactivation of two foodborne pathogens e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis in synthetic fresh cut wastewater sfcww at pilot plant scale a comparative analysis of water treatment efficiency in different experimental conditions has been carried out including the effect on neutral or basic water ph the addition of h2o2 and two different ozone productions 0 09 and 0 15 g o3 l 1 h 1 the ecotoxicity was also determined experimentally using vibrio fischeri and daphnia magna as indicator species finally a techno economic analysis was performed to determine the feasibility of ozone as an alternative process to chlorination for fresh cut wash water purification exploiting also its further reuse for other activities like agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic fresh cut wastewater sfcww sfcww was used as water reference to

standard sigma aldrich spain were used thiamethoxam imidacloprid simazine azoxystrobin terbutryn and buprofezin they were selected according to the following criteria i their use for farmers during vegetables cultivation ii their detection in real fresh cut wastewater samples and iii their presence on latest european directives as priority substances ps table si1 in supplementary information stocks solutions of omcs at concentration of 2 5 g l 1 were prepared in methanol honeywell chromasolv and stored at 4 c for further use in the experiments the omcs concentration were quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc agilent equipment series 1260 palo alto ca usa with a diode array detector uv dad the following conditions were developed for the simultaneous detection and

from 90 to 10 water acetonitrile hplc grade panreac spain to 100 acetonitrile and a post run of 1 5 min returning them to the initial conditions in 1 min water samples were prepared filtering 4 5 ml of sample through a 0 2 μm syringe driven filter of nylon millex and then 0 5 ml of acetonitrile was passed through the filter to remove residual adsorbed compounds the chromatographic conditions for the analysis of each omc are summarized in table si2 supplementary information bromate concentration in water samples was determined by an ion chromatograph ic model 850 metrohm switzerland using an extension module 872 for the determination of anions through a gradient analysis in a column metrosep c6 150 4 0 150 mm 4 0 mm id potassium bromate reagent plus sigma aldrich was used as analytical

i lab made with 5 g l 1 of nacl and beef extract panreac spain and 10 g l 1 of peptone panreac spain bacterial suspensions were cultivated for 20 h in a rotary shaking incubator at 37 c and 100 rpm after that the resultant suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 900 g and the bacterial pellets obtained were re suspended in phosphate buffered saline pbs solution yielding a concentration of 109 cfu ml 1 bacterial concentration in samples were enumerated by the standard plate counting method using selective agar mediums salmonella shigella agar scharlau spain and chromocult coliform agar merck kgaa darmstadt germany for s enteritidis and e coli respectively water samples were serially diluted in phosphate buffered saline pbs and volumes of 50 and 500 μl were spread onto each corresponding cultivation agar contained in petri dishes plates after that plates were incubated for 24 and 48 h at 37 c in order to count e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis colonies respectively the detection limit dl of this procedure is 2 cfu ml 1 bacterial regrowth was evaluated for both pathogens after 24 48 and 72 h using the same procedure and no regrowth was observed in any case 2 4 ozonation pilot plant the ozonation pilot plant consists of a column reactor with an inlet o3 diffuser for batch operation with a maximum capacity of 20 l anseros pap pilot plant anseros klaus nonnenmacher gmbh germany fig 1 the reactor is equipped with an oxygen generator anseros sep100 and an ozone generator anseros com ad02 two non dispersive uv analyzers bmt 964 to measure inlet and outlet ozone gas concentration a flow meter for inlet air regulation and an ozone destroyer to remove residual ozone and avoid o3 release to the atmosphere the operational conditions of the ozone pilot plant used in this study was 10 l of total volume of water a constant inlet air flow of 0 06 n m3 h 1 and two different initial ozone production of 0 09 and 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 resulting from the ozone generator working at 10 or 20 power respectively the ozone concentration in solution was measured also by a colorimetric method based on the decolouration reaction between molecular ozone and the cc bond of potassium indigotrisulfonate sigma aldrich clesceri and greenberg 1998 2 5 experimental procedure the ozone production selected in this study was 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 an average value for sfcww disinfection and decontamination considering the range of ozone production commonly employed in this type of industry 0 02 0 4 go3 l 1 h 1 strickland et al 2010 selma et al 2008 the following experimental conditions were investigated i ozonation at natural scfww ph ii ozonation at basic ph 11 iii peroxone at natural scfww ph adding doses of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 and iv peroxone with doses of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 at basic ph 11 furthermore peroxone treatment with doses of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 at a higher o3 generation 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 and natural sfcww ph was also addressed the experimental procedure was as follows sfcww was prepared following the recipe previously described and for basic ph tests a naoh solution 2 m was used water ph was monitored using a ph meter 110 k horiba laqua act and non significant variations 6 25 0 14 and 11 0 04 were observed along the treatment time for any of the conditions tested then omcs and pathogens were directly diluted from stock solutions in sfcww to reach initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 each omc and 106 cfu ml 1 respectively this step added 20 mg l 1 of doc for peroxone tests an initial dose of h2o2 20 mg l 1 was added and when concentration of h2o2 was lower than ca 1 5 mg l 1 additional doses were added to avoid limitations of the reagent during the experiment the h2o2 dose was chosen considering an ozone water mass transfer of 50 and to obtain a molar ratio of 0 6 1 h2o2 o3 which is very close to the optimum for peroxone process 0 5 1 according to the reaction stoichiometry after 10 min of recirculation in the dark for homogenization an initial sample was taken out and immediately the ozone generator was switch on water samples were taken out at regular intervals during 240 min total treatment time and analyzed following the procedure previously described in all samples the residual ozone concentration was immediately removed with n2 for peroxone tests a stock solution of bovine liver catalase at 0 1 g l 1 sigma aldrich usa was added to the samples at 1 50 catalase solution sample to eliminate residual h2o2 nahim granados et al 2018 the ozone consumption of each sample was calculated taking into account the ozone measurements at the sample time inlet outlet and in solution and the ozone consumption of the previous sample roccamante et al 2019 dissolved organic carbon doc at the beginning and at the end of the experiments was determined using a toc analyzer model 5050 shimadzu japon all tests were carried out in duplicate results were highly reproducible showing p value 0 05 therefore omcs degradation and bacterial inactivation kinetic profiles as a function of the treatment time are shown as the average value of two replicates with standard deviation as error bar the kinetic analysis of omcs removal was performed following a pseudo first order kinetic fitting the experimental data according to a log linear decay chick s law 2 6 ecotoxicity evaluation acute ecotoxicity was assessed with the bioluminescence marine bacterium vibrio fischeri and the crustacean daphnia magna samples were analyzed at 100 50 25 12 5 and 6 25 v v dilutions in triplicate the effective concentrations 50 ec50 were calculated by fitting the experimental data to dose response curves when the ec50 did not reach toxicity it was expressed as of toxic effect inhibition or immobilization additionally to classify the sample s ecotoxicity level ec50 in of dilution was converted into toxic units tu calculated as 100 divided by the ec50 when the percentage of toxic effect exposed to 100 v v of samples was below 50 tu was calculated as parts of 50 effect in case of low toxicity 20 toxic effect tu was considered zero the 30 min luminescence inhibition test with v fischeri was carried out according to the manufacturer biofix lumi 10 specifications following the standard iso 11348 3 1998 freitas et al 2017 the toxicity was measured as the percentage of v fischeri bioluminescence inhibition after 30 min exposure the 48 h immobilization bioassays with the water flea d magna was performed following the standard operational procedures of the commercial daphtoxkit f in compliance with standard guidelines oecd guidelines no 202 freitas et al 2017 the toxicity was assessed by determining the immobility of the exposed daphnids for 48 h 3 results 3 1 bacterial inactivation the inactivation profiles of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis in sfcww at natural 6 25 and basic ph 11 by both ozonation o3 and peroxone treatment o3 h2o2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively in all cases detection limit dl 2 cfu ml 1 was reached for both pathogens showing a similar inactivation kinetic order for both pathogens ozonation ph 6 25 ozonation ph 11 peroxone ph 6 25 peroxone ph 11 with treatment times ranged between 2 and 20 min the fastest inactivation was obtained with ozonation treatment at ph 6 25 in this case the concentrations of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis were reduced 5 log in 2 and 4 min respectively results also showed that neither h2o2 addition higher ph nor higher o3 generation 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 determined a faster inactivation kinetic previous studies showed that the h2o2 concentration 20 mg l 1 selected did not generate any viability loss on the two microorganisms target of this study therefore the disinfection results observed can be only attributed to the ozonation peroxone processes nahim granados et al 2018 moreover a remarkable difference on the resistance is observed between both pathogens fig 2 and table 1 s enteritidis showed a higher resistance than e coli o157 h7 in all the operational conditions investigated at the best conditions of this study ozonation at ph 6 25 the kinetic rate of e coli o157 h7 k 2 79 0 00 min 1 was much faster than s enteritidis k 1 47 0 40 min 1 3 2 organic microcontaminants removal to compare the global efficiency of each operational condition the sum of the total omcs investigated was analyzed and results are shown in fig 3 for the first 15 min of treatment results did not show any significant differences reaching 50 of ʃomcs removal after that ozone with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 6 25 and 11 and peroxone treatment with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 11 reached more than 50 of ʃomcs degradation in 30 min with a slightly better performance of ozone treatment with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 11 70 of ʃomcs removal from 30 to 120 min no differences were observed between these operational conditions reaching ca 85 of ʃomcs removal in all cases therefore and similarly to bacterial inactivation results it can be concluded that the best condition for ʃomcs removal from sfcww is the ozone treatment with 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at the natural water ph 6 25 in addition results of individual omcs degradation by each ozonation operating condition are shown in fig si1 in all cases two groups of omcs can be differentiated according to their degradation resistance g1 omcs azoxystrobin buprofezin and terbutryn and g2 omcs imidacloprid simazine and thiamethoxam these differences can be attributed to their respective chemical structure and it will be deeply discussed in next section in general a similar trend was observed for both groups of omcs in all operating conditions tested g1 omcs were completely removed reaching in all cases the limit of quantification loq while g2 omcs revealed different rates of degradation depending on such operating conditions 3 3 reagents consumption the profiles of ozone and h2o2 consumptions along the ozonation experiments are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively focusing on the first stage of the process 30 min of treatment ozone consumption was similar at natural and basic ph detecting 19 and 18 mg l 1 respectively in peroxone treatment o3 h2o2 at 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 the consumption of ozone increased at both phs being significantly higher 40 mg l 1 at natural ph regarding h2o2 consumption no significant differences were observed between all peroxone tests at 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 while a slightly higher demand on h2o2 consumption was obtained when ozone generation increased to 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 3 4 ecotoxicity analysis acute toxicity was evaluated before and during sfcww ozonation with the best operating condition found 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 6 25 using d magna and v fischeri as test organisms table 2 toxicity tests showed an increase in acute toxicity during ozonation in both organisms even though crustaceans demonstrated to be more sensitive than the bacterium as 100 of inmobilization was achieved at 30 min whereas the toxic effect in v fisheri was not higher than 50 throughout the experiment particularly for v fisheri the toxicity increased from 0 5 tu at 30 min to 0 9 tu at 90 min of treatment time and later it kept constant in the case of d magna the acute toxicity showed an increasing trend from 2 2 to 4 6 tu at 30 and 240 min respectively according to the toxicity classification system for waste discharged into the aquatic environment proposed by persoone et al 2003 the treated wastewater should be classified as class ii for v fischeri slight acute toxicity whereas for d magna as class iii acute toxicity in addition the potential effect of bromate on v fischeri was investigated due to the absence of this information in literature a toxicity test with 1 5 mg l 1 of bromate concentration was performed and any toxic effect was detected data not shown 4 discussion the strong potential of ozone to degrade organic molecules and to inactivate pathogens in water is very well known in this study the efficiency of ozonation 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at two different water phs was investigated natural sfcww ph 6 25 and basic ph 11 the reaction pathways of this process is also well described in literature and briefly it can be explained by i direct oxidation which is a selective and fast reaction between o3 and targets with electron rich moieties which depends mainly on the water ph and ii indirect oxidation which involves the generation of reactive oxygen species ros mainly oh by several reactions eqs 1 9 explained by the following general mechanism gottschalk et al 2009 i initiation step eqs 1 and 2 where superoxide anion radical o 2 and hydroperoxyl radical h o 2 are generated ii radical chain eqs 3 7 where hydroxyl radicals oh are generated and hydroperoxyl radical h o 2 are regenerated and iii termination step where reactions with matrix constituents om eq 8 or reactions between radicals eq 9 can occur 1 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 k 70 m 1 s 1 2 h o 2 o 2 h pk a 4 8 3 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 k 1 6 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 h o 3 o 3 h pk a 6 2 5 h o 3 o h o 2 k 1 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 6 o h o 3 h o 4 k 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 h o 4 o 2 h o 2 k 2 8 10 4 s 1 8 o m o h o 2 p 9 o h h o 2 o 2 h 2 o k 3 7 10 10 m 1 s 1 the predominant reaction path in ozonation depends on water ph which affects the o3 decomposition kinetics at phs lower than 8 the direct oxidation by o3 seems to be the predominant pathway at phs 8 the o3 decomposition kinetics is accelerated favoring therefore the indirect oxidation of organic compounds mainly by the oh generated beltrán 2003 our results for all targets showed no differences in the removal kinetic rates between both water phs figs 2 and 3 this clearly evidences that in these experimental conditions the direct attack of o3 was enough to guarantee a successful performance of the process additionally to water ph the o3 degradation rate is also affected by other parameters including water temperature alkalinity and presence of doc nevertheless none of these parameters suffered changes throughout our experimental conditions thus the differences on degradation rates between omcs and inactivation profiles of bacteria will depend mainly of their chemical and microbiological structure respectively the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by ozone is mainly based on the progressive oxidation of vital cellular components ending with the cell s death it is well explained that components of cell wall lipoprotein and the lipopolysaccharide layers are the first targets kim et al 1999 it has been estimated that ca 3 108 molecules of ozone are needed to inactivate a cell of e coli khadre et al 2001 in the case of the pathogens under study although both belong to gram negative type bacteria same structured cell wall a slight difference between both strains were observed showing s entetiditis a higher resistance than e coli to be inactivatedbe inactivated this behavior has been previously reported in literature and it was attributed to the higher amount of phospholipids components in salmonella cell membrane that rise up its density and rigidity and therefore increase its resistance against oxidation by ozone compared with e coli alwi and ali 2014 moreover the additional oxidative stress generated by other ros produced during this process must be also considered as responsible of damage it is reported that the regulator of the general stress response rpos the superoxide response regulon soxrs and the trans activator of the response to h2o2 oxyr show an important role in bacterial protection against ozonation patil et al 2011 in a previous study the higher resistance of s enteritidis compared with e coli has been also observed towards another oxidative treatment uva solar process with added h2o2 attributing the upregulation of these regulators as the possible differences between both bacteria nahim granados et al 2018 therefore the bacterial response to oxidative stress may also contribute to explain the observed high resistance few minutes of s enteritidis to ozonation compared with e coli a wide spectrum of results in fresh cut wash water disinfection by ozonation can be found in literature with disinfection results varied from 0 5 to 5 log reduction value of bacteria e coli total coliforms listeria sp etc using aqueous o3 doses ranged from 0 5 to 25 mgo3 l 1 and also different treatment times from a few minutes to 60 90 min smetanska et al 2013 therefore the required ozone dose and treatment time for water disinfection depend on many parameters such as the target microorganism the physic chemical water characteristics and also the mass transfer of ozone from the gas to the liquid phase although in all these case studies the benefit of using this treatment was clearly demonstrated as in our results regarding omcs degradation direct o3 oxidation at ph 6 25 was also the dominant pathway fig 3 the degradation profile of each omc at this operational condition fig si1a showed a faster removal of g1 omcs terbutryn k 6 69 10 3 min 1 buprofezin k 3 04 10 3 min 1 azoxystrobin k 2 85 10 3 min 1 compared with g2 omcs imidacloprid k 3 96 10 4 min 1 simazine k 2 70 10 4 min 1 thiamethoxam k 2 22 10 4 min 1 this kinetic behavior can be explained based on the omc chemical structures discarding any effect based on its speciation due to the fact that all target omcs have a pka value below the water ph except imidacloprid which will be in protonated form table si2 a similar behavior was previously reported for the abatement of a mix of organophosphate esters where two different kinetics rates were also observed for two contaminant groups depending on their chemical structure yuan et al 2015 the degradation mechanism by direct ozone attack is based on an initial electrophilic attack and therefore the presence of electron rich moieties π bonds with delocalized electrons electron rich heteroatoms electron withdrawing groups ewg and electron donating group edg in the omc structures is the key to understand the fast degradation of g1 omcs hübner et al 2013 in particular for g1 omcs terbutryn and buprofezin contains electron rich heteroatoms sulfurs and nitrogens with hydrogen available in α position respect to the heteroatom buprofezin also have a π system benzene ring barletta et al 2003 azoxystrobin contains several electron rich moieties as the acrylate double bond and alcoxybenze groups for g2 omcs the lower kinetic rates observed for the neonicotinoid pesticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam can be explained by the presence of high oxidized groups no2 in their structure which are resistant to ozone and radical oxidation the higher resistance of simazine a triazine g2 omcs respect to terbutryn other triazine g1 omcs is peculiar as both contain a triazine ring this can be due to the absence of sulfur in simazine side chains while it has a ewg group cl that confers less susceptibility to an electrophilic attack chen et al 2008 on the other hand it is well described that the generation of oh by ozone indirect pathway can be increased by addition of h2o2 peroxone process through o3 reaction with the h2o2 conjugate base ho2 eq 10 and 11 nevertheless contrary to what was commonly accepted gottschalk et al 2009 recent studies has been demonstrated that the oh generation yield in the peroxone process is near to 0 5 instead to 1 i e twice o3 molecules are required to generate one oh merenyi et al 2010 fischbacher et al 2013 the proposed mechanistic interpretation for the low yield observed is based on an adduct formation ho5 eq 11 which can decompose through 2 different ways eqs 12 and 13 of which only one yields oh eq 13 15 10 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 11 ho 2 o 3 ho 5 12 ho 5 2 o 2 oh 13 ho 5 ho 2 o 3 14 o 3 o 2 o 15 o h 2 o o h oh it is also important to mention that the equilibrium of eqs 14 and 15 are shifted to the right in complex water matrices as in our case due to the o and oh generated oh in a greater extend quickly react with the water constituents merenyi et al 2010 taking into account these latest findings the potential treatment benefits by h2o2 addition during ozonation may be only based on the faster ozone decomposition into oh and not also on the higher radical yields as accepted until now in the present work the addition of h2o2 doses 20 mg l 1 was also investigated at natural and basic ph however results showed that in all cases the σomcs and bacterial kinetics rates were lower than the obtained for conventional ozone at natural water ph fig 2 and 3 and table 1 this detrimental effect observed was higher at natural ph than basic ph which can be explained due to the reaction between o3 and ho2 present a much lower rate constant at near neutral ph as a consequence of the high pka value 11 8 of h2o2 nothe et al 2009 the lower efficiency of peroxone process observed has been previously reported in literature and can be attributed to several reasons 1 the lower o3 concentration in solution fig si2 in supplementary information which gives rise to lower removal rates of the ozone reactive targets collivignarelli et al 2017 lee et al 2014 2 dual role of h2o2 in combination with o3 since h2o2 may act as scavenger of oh when is in excess in the sample de torres socías et al 2013 and 3 the low o3 stability fast depletion in complex water matrices where the o3 react preferentially with some water constituents over h2o2 resulting in lower oh yields wang et al 2018 in the specific case of sfcww the three reasons explained above can contribute to the lower efficiency observed taking into account the fast ozone depletion in this water matrix 45 mg l 1 of doc high quantity of suspended solids 100 ntu and presence of nitrite ions 0 15 0 03 mg l 1 therefore the fast ozone decrease required a higher ozone concentration in solution in fact this observation was confirmed in our study where the efficiency of the overall process simultaneous removal of omcs and bacteria improved by increasing the inlet of o3 from 0 09 to 0 15 go3 l 1 h 1 fig 2 and 3 doc was also monitored and its removal was only observed for the two processes at basic ph where the expected major oxidant substance is oh with removal percentages lower than 20 doc values decreased from an initial value of 45 to 40 mg l 1 11 and 37 5 mg l 1 17 at the end of ozonation and peroxone processes at basic ph respectively these results can be correlated with ozone consumption as it was much higher for all the conditions compared with ozone treatment at natural ph fig 4a these higher ozone consumptions clearly suggest that under these operational conditions the ros generation is the predominant pathway enhancing the doc elimination but not specifically favoring the degradation of the target pollutants bacteria and omcs wastewater ozonation presents some drawbacks one of the most important ones is the formation during the process of toxic by products such as bromate which is a potential human carcinogen regarding water legislation although there is not a specific guideline for its presence in wastewater the parametric value of bromate is already stablished for drinking water quality in a limit value of 10 μg l 1 who 2011 and an environmental quality standard of 50 μg l 1 is recommended in wastewater soltermann et al 2017 rizzo et al 2019 bromate formation during ozonation depends on several factors such as t ph and doc but is mainly linked with the initial bromide concentration and the specific ozone doses applied previous studies have reported that the bromide concentration found in urban wastewater varies between μg l 1 to a few mgl 1 the molar bromate yields after ozonation applying the most usual specific ozone doses for wastewater treatment from 0 4 to 0 6 go3 g 1 doc was found to be in the range of 3 5 therefore considering this yield conversion in the most conservative condition i e 5 the bromate concentration expected in our water matrix with a measured content of bromide of 0 10 0 03 mg l 1 will not be higher than 10 μg l 1 which is below the limits recommended for the environment and similar to the maximum allowed value in drinking water legislations soltermann et al 2017 rizzo et al 2019 nevertheless bromate was measured with ionic chromatography in all experimental conditions tested and it was never detected values above 50 μg l 1 the lod of this technique confirming only the environmental quality standard recommended in wastewater which is the objective of this research in line with the potential toxicity of this process it was observed in the tests with aquatic organisms an increase in the acute toxicity during ozonation 0 09 go3 l 1 h 1 at ph 6 25 which can be attributed to the possible formation of toxic ozonation by products at this condition nevertheless the commonly expected bromate formation as toxic disinfection by products has been discarded due to toxicity test in v fischeri did not shown any effect and according to literature the ec50 value reported for the crustaceum 179 mg l 1 hutchinson et al 1997 is almost three fold higher than the detected in this study the by products may come from the partial oxidation of the organic matter doc content of 45 mg l 1 being degraded into lower molecular and toxic compounds in the mg l 1 range such as carboxylic acids or aldehydes or unknown omcs intermediates in the μg ng l 1 range these refractory compounds have also been stated as one of the main causes for the toxicity showed by v fischeri and d magna in previous ozonation studies carbajo et al 2015 and park et al 2016 therefore despite that the 85 of ʃomcs were eliminated the toxic effects in both organisms increase in parallel with ʃomcs degradation fig 3 which indicates that the treatment efficiency should be focused also in achieving higher organic matter oxidation the toxicity generated during ozonation process could be also reduced by including a subsequent stage in the treatment line based on biologically activated carbon filter bac or sand filters rizzo et al 2019 finally an economic analysis was performed considering the following assumptions 50 m3 day 1 of water 365 days year 1 of operation 18250 m3 year 1 and a serviceable life of the equipment of 20 years applying a 5 interest rate which leading to a capital recovery factor cfr of 8 the total cost was calculated considering investment cost ic operational costs oc and maintenance costs mc the ic for the ozonation treatment was calculated according to cañizares et al 2009 the annual mc was considered to be 2 5 of the annual ic and the oc was calculated based on the electric consumption of the ozonation plant and an electricity price of 0 155 kw h 1 for the estimation of the electric consumption the figure of merit electrical energy per order eeo eq 16 was used 16 e e o p k w t h 1000 v l log c i c f where p is the rated power t the treatment time 2 h v is the volume of water treated 10 l and ci and cf the initial and final concentration of the target 600 and 90 μg l 1 85 degradation of the ʃomcs the rate power was calculated considering the electric consumption supplied by the manufacturer 7 5 and 18 kwh kg 1 for ozone generation and oxygen concentration respectively and the ozone flow used in our experimental conditions 0 0009 kg h 1 the resultant eeo in our experimental conditions was 5 6 kwh m 3 the calculation of total cost is summarized in table 3 the obtained tc for sfcww ozonation in our best operational condition was 1 16 m 3 of which the breakdown of the relative costs indicate that mc represent the 1 whereas ic 44 and oc 55 have similar contributions to the total cost the cost obtained is in line with the cost estimated by garrett et al 2003 ca 1 2 m 3 for a small or medium sized fresh cut industry 5 conclusions the application of ozonation treatment in agro food wastewater has been proven to be a good option for reducing and keeping bacterial and omcs below the established guidelines and regulations avoiding therefore their further accumulation in the washing water and the probability of pollutants uptake or deposition in the commercialized products from the different operational conditions tested the simplest condition i e ozonation at natural ph leads the higher kinetics rates for both chemical and biological pollutants regarding omcs up to 85 of σomcs quantify in this research were removed from sfcww requiring an o3 consumption of 27 4 mgo3 l 1 and 120 min of treatment time for bacteria 5 log reduction of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis was achieved in less than 10 min with an ozone dose 8 6 mg l 1 finally in spite of ozonation proving to be a feasible process for decontamination and disinfection of sfcww the increase in acute toxicity observed indicates that further studies should be done to reduce the dbps formation and the toxicity generated therefore different research lines should be explored such as shorter treatment times increasing the mineralization efficiency by applying more aggressive operational conditions or the combination of the ozonation process with a pre treatment stage to reduce omcs or a post treatment stage to reduce acute toxicity declaration of competing

18273,wanted and unwanted surface attached growth of bacteria is ubiquitous in natural and engineered settings normally attachment of planktonic cells to media surfaces initiates biofilm formation and fundamentally regulates biofilm assembly processes here culturing biofilm with planktonic sludge as source community we found distinct succession profiles of biofilm communities sourced from the size

relative importance of environmental selection increased with increasing floc size of the source sludge whereas homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift followed opposite trends phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens indicated that species interactions were intensive in biofilm microbiota developed from large sized flocs 120 μm as evidenced by the low modularity and harmonic

planktonic community in biofilm formation however the biofilm niches differ fundamentally from planktonic counterparts attributable to the differential population density spatial constraints nutrient access and species species interactions yan et al 2017 thus deciphering dynamics of planktonic and biofilm communities and their interplays in biofilm formation could provide a complete understanding of biofilm related processes recent attempts have improved our understanding of biofilm and planktonic cells in terms of biodiversity and community structure in both natural and engineered ecosystems biswas and turner 2012 liu et al 2018 niederdorfer et al 2016 however previous studies have left knowledge gaps regarding the forces that structuring biofilm community composition which are central issues in microbial ecology stegen et al 2012 the composition and structure of microbial communities are regulated by complicated and dynamic ecological mechanisms widder et al 2016 such as stochastic and deterministic processes zhou and ning 2017 to date only few studies elucidated the mechanisms shaping biofilm communities in natural environments the dynamic of these two processes in structuring bio cake community in an mbr has been revealed in a very recent study xu et al 2019 nonetheless the ecological drivers of microbial community in biofilm based processes for wastewater treatment remain largely unknown likely due to either the heterogeneity of planktonic community or the ever changing wastewater characteristics and instability of operating conditions in wastewater treatment plants identification of the ecological processes underpinning the biofilm community assembly can greatly aid in improving our understanding of the microbial ecology in biofilm based systems for a given biofilm based system biofilm attached on carrier surface is largely affected by the characteristics of source community i e planktonic sludge flocs previous studies have demonstrated that different sized sludge harbored the distinct micro environments e g do orp and ph by using the microelectrode approach han et al 2012 li and bishop 2004 potentially as local conditions the source community could play roles in bacterial assembly of biofilm microbiota besemer et al 2012 curtis and sloan 2004 xu et al 2019 we recently found the floc size dependence of pathogens in activated sludge zhang et al 2019b in addition different sized flocs may possess divergent thermodynamic interactions thus showing different dispersal and adhesion behaviors shen et al 2015 overall the floc size of source sludge is an important factor determining biofilm community assembly nonetheless bacterial assembly of biofilm community from planktonic sludge with different floc sizes has not yet been elucidated previously statistical analyses such as the null model have been applied to determine deterministic and stochastic processes guiding the microbial assembly patterns of sludge related microbial communities ju and zhang 2015 li eacute bana et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 biofilm microbiomes in natural and drinking water distribution systems besemer et al 2012 graham et al 2017 stegen et al 2012 vignola et al 2018 recently ecological network analysis has been developed to decipher co occurrence patterns of taxa and their putative interactions in microbial communities barberan et al 2012 deng et al 2012 2016 ju et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 in particular on the basis of the network topological features such analysis could enable identification of the keystone species crucial for maintaining microbiota structure and function deng et al 2012 using these approaches we believe that assembly patterns of biofilm communities and the roles of keystone taxa in biofilm succession can be greatly illuminated in practice the sludge sizes in mbrs are always smaller than those in conventional activated sludge fenu et al 2010 henriques et al 2005 this work could help understand the differential biofilm community assembly and distinct keystone sessile populations in the case of integrating biofilm with these two representative processes from an ecological perspective these knowledges are crucial to better manipulate and optimize the functioning of the biofilm related processes for wastewater treatment if the community assembly is governed by a deterministic process this work aimed to reveal the bacterial assembly mechanisms of biofilm community during biofilm succession focusing on the effect of floc size here we cultivated biofilm on model carriers e g round coverslips using different sized sludge flocs as source communities biofilm architecture microbial diversity and structure were assessed during biofilm development several statistical approaches based on null models were applied to unravel the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic factors in determining biofilm communities furthermore phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analyses were performed to interpret the interplay patterns and ecological roles of co occurring species driving biofilm succession derived from the different sized flocs overall this work is expected to advance our understanding of microbial ecology and shed light on the optimization of biofilm based systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 particle size fractionation of activated sludge the inoculated sludge flocs were collected from a full scale anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a a o mbr located in guangzhou china with a total design capacity of 100 000 m3 day the particle size distribution of activated sludge was determined prior to particle size fractionation the mean floc size was ca 50 μm which was similar to that of a full scale mbr 40 50 μm reported previously but much lower than that of conventional activated sludge ca 200 μm fenu et al 2010 as presented in fig s1 a majority of the sludge flocs had a size range 25 120 μm while a minority of them was smaller than 25 μm or larger than 120 μm therefore we chose 120 μm and 25 μm sieves to separate the sludge flocs into three representative fractions by a wet sieving method 25 μm 25 120 μm and 120 μm for representation of the small sized medium sized and large sized flocs respectively accordingly the biofilm developed from large sized medium sized and small sized flocs is hereinafter referred to as large sized biofilm medium sized biofilm and small sized biofilm respectively 2 2 biofilm biomass and eps quantification given the differential response of different sized bioaggregates to hydrodynamic conditions biofilm formation was performed under static state for explicitly testing floc size dependence in this work before biofilm formation test of the three different sized sludge the sludge samples were pre cultivated in 100 ml sterilized lb medium contained in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks a 24 well polystyrene microtiter plate with round coverslip on the bottom were used to culture biofilms as previously described izano et al 2008 briefly 100 μl of the cultivated sludge solutions od adjusted to 0 5 at 600 nm were evenly added onto the round coverslip afterwards 900 μl of lb growth medium was gently introduced in the plate the biofilm cultivation was lasted for 72 h at 30 c without agitation following incubation the round coverslips were washed three times with sterile deionized water for loosely attached cells removal the washed coverslips were air dried and stained with 125 μl of 1 crystal violet cv solution for 15 min stained coverslips were washed three times with deionized water for excess stain removal the amount of biofilm biomass was quantified by sufficiently solubilizing the biofilms for 15 min with 500 μl of 33 acetic acid and then determining the absorbance of the cv solution at 595 nm polysaccharides and proteins in the eps was determined according to the dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 methods respectively all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 3 visualization of the biofilms using fluorescence microscopy a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit 7012 molecular probes invitrogen carlsbad ca usa containing the fluorescent nucleic acid stains syto 9 and pi was used to stain the live and dead cells in the environmental samples during the staining process the biofilm samples on round coverslips were mixed with a mixture of the syto 9 and pi stains 1 1 and then were incubated in the dark for 15 min at 25 c the stained biomass samples were observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope mf31 mshot guangzhou guangdong china a minimum of 10 fields was taken for each sample to calculate the ratio of live dead cells which was determined by the ratio of green red fluorescence areas using imagej software 2 4 dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing at 0 h i e before biofilm formation one sludge sample of each size was collected n 3 and afterwards triplicate biofilm samples were taken from each size n 3 3 4 resulting in a total of 39 biomass samples for dna extraction and subsequent analysis of microbial communities the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa was used to extract microbial dna according to manufacturer s instructions the final dna concentration and purity were evaluated using a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and dna quality was assessed by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified with 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa pcr reactions were conducted following a previous study xu et al 2019 afterwards 2 agarose gel was used to extract the resulting pcr products then the pcr products were further purified by the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa and quantified by quantifluor st promega usa following the manufacturer s protocols amplicons were then used for high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq pe300 platform at the shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd processing of sequencing data was performed according to our previous work xu et al 2019 the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession prjna529301 2 5 network construction using the rmt based approach the pmens of the biofilm communities sourced from different sized sludge were constructed on a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena deng et al 2012 firstly the relative abundance of sequence numbers was used to obtain the pearson correlation matrices which were then converted into similarity matrices subsequently an appropriate threshold value st for defining the network structure was determined using the rmt based network approach deng et al 2012 then by retaining all the nodes whose abundance similarity values higher than the determined threshold an adjacency matrix encoding the connection strength between each pair of otus was obtained in pmens a module in the network is a group of otus that are highly connected among themselves but had much fewer connections with otus outside the group deng et al 2012 the greedy modularity optimization which has been proved as a more robust approach over other methods e g short random walks leading eigenvector of the community matrix simulated annealing approach for obtaining the highest modularity value and identifying the submodular structure of mens deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 therefore in this work the greedy modularity optimization was applied to detect modules of mens for network comparison corresponding random networks of all pmens were established using the maslov sneppen method maslov and sneppen 2002 and keeping the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewiring all of the edge positions in the pmens the significance between the pmens and their corresponding random networks were determined by a standard z test the small world coefficient σ was applied to describe the small world property of the networks i e the degree of clustering and shortness of paths between nodes telesford et al 2011 gephi 0 9 2 software webatlas paris france was used for network visualization bastian et al 2009 2 6 statistical analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analyses nmds were conducted based on the bray curtis distance with the r vegan package two nonparametric multivariate statistical tests i e a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices adonis and an analysis of similarity anosim were conducted to determine the differences in the biofilm community structures with the r vegan package the null model test was conducted according to previous literature chase et al 2011 the significance of the differences in microbial communities from null model expectations was evaluated by the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp in addition selection strength ss was used to quantify the relative importance of niche based deterministic processes in structuring community composition according to zhou et al 2014 in brief ss can be assessed as follows ss j obs j exp j obs j obs and j exp indicate the observed jaccard s similarity and average null expected jaccard s similarity respectively furthermore a phylogenetic beta diversity framework was adopted to quantify the relative influence of environmental selection homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation and ecological drift on biofilm community assemblage stegen et al 2013 2015 the function mantel correlog in r vegan package was conducted to check the relationship between phylogenetic similarity and edge correlation strength briefly pearson correlation coefficients between otus in relative abundance were grouped into bins the mantel test with 999 randomizations was used to determine the correlation between phylogenetic distance and pearson correlation coefficients within each bin then mantel s r values were plotted against the median of each pearson coefficient bin 2 7 shot gun metagenome sequencing the size fractionated sludge samples were further analyzed by shot gun metagenome sequencing details could be found in our previous work zhang et al 2019b in addition quorum sensing qs analysis can be found elsewhere hong et al 2016 by searching keywords including accessory gene regulator quorum sensing and autoinducer about qs on uniprotkb a local qs database was set up the groups including autoinducer transportor regulator decomposer autoinducer receptor repressor activator effector autoinducer producer and unclear were annotated to qs all the metagenome sequencing data have been deposited into ncbi short read achieve sra under the accession number srp189682 3 results 3 1 biomass profiles of the biofilm succession sourced from different sized flocs as presented in fig 1 the od595 readings showed that the biofilm growth progressed firstly and then dropped down with the increase of incubation time regardless of planktonic floc size the peak biomass of large sized biofilm 24 h od595 3 77 0 35 was significantly higher p 0 001 than that of medium sized 24 h od595 2 63 0 32 and small sized biofilm 12 h od595 2 98 0 24 these results indicated that the large sized sludge possessed the highest biofilm formation potential the bioaggregates can associate certain amount of nutrients inside the aggregates for the biofilm to develop further the bigger the aggregates sizes the more nutrients will be brought with resulting in the largest peak biomass of the large sized biofilm fig 1 however no significant difference was observed between the peak biomass of medium sized and small sized biofilm which was likely attributable to the fact that the peak of biofilm biomass will increase significantly only when the initial floc size reaches a high threshold qs activity was likely the most pronounced within the large sized floc followed by the small sized and finally the medium sized biofilm according to qs related genes annotation of size fractionated sludge communities fig s2 the abundances of qs related genes in the size fractionated sludge communities were in accordance with the peak biomasses of their corresponding biofilm indicating that qs related genes in the initial floc play stimulative roles in biofilm biomass accumulation fluorescent examination for the biofilm architecture showed much smaller aggregates of small sized biofilm as compared with those of large sized and medium sized biofilms during the initial biofilm development 2 h of incubation fig 2 afterwards the bacterial cells attached to the coverslips and formed large aggregates the microcolonies within small sized biofilm reached their maximum size with a complex architecture at 12 h whereas the cluster size of the large sized and medium sized biofilms peaked at 24 h fig 2 of note the large sized biofilm cells were always embedded in larger clusters relative to the medium sized and small sized biofilm cells which was generally in accordance with the cv staining results the results of dead live cell ratios showed that the biofilm microbiota had low viability in the initial phase 2 h of incubation fig 2 likely because of low bacterial viability of the source sludge in addition the viability of the initial medium sized biofilm was the highest followed by the initial small sized biofilm and finally the initial large sized biofilm afterwards the dead live cell ratios in the three groups of biofilms experienced a gradual increase and subsequent decrease independent of the initial floc size fig 2 which coincided with the tendencies of biofilm biomass production these observations suggested bacterial viability of biofilm cells was highly correlated with their growth phase 3 2 distinct bacterial diversity patterns of the biofilm succession a total of 1 732 036 high quality filtered sequences for 39 biofilm samples were achieved by illumina high throughput sequencing normalization of the sequence number was performed by randomly extracting 18 340 sequences from each sample for comparison at the same sequencing depth the good s coverages for all the biofilm samples were higher than 99 5 indicating that the majority of bacterial diversity in each sample had been captured table s1 as shown in fig s3 the initial biofilm communities i e biofilm after 2 h of colonization had markedly lower microbial diversities e g observed species and shannon diversity as compared with their source communities and thus displayed significant enhancement with an increase in incubation time within 12 h regardless of the source of sludge flocs afterwards their bacterial diversities showed slightly and statistically insignificant decrement other alpha diversity indices demonstrated similar trends for the three groups of biofilms table s1 as for microbial compositions the dominant genera average abundance 1 0 which were affiliated with proteobacteria and firmicutes were found to be similar but vary in abundance among the biofilm microbiomes table s2 for instance lactococcus was the most abundant genus in the large sized average 51 8 and medium sized average 50 3 biofilm communities whereas the small sized counterpart average 25 8 was mostly dominated by acinetobacter table s2 in addition the bubble plot of the top 15 genera displayed differential dynamics of these dominant populations during biofilm development fig 3 to further describe the bacterial community dynamics of these biofilm microbiomes nmds based analysis on the bray curtis dissimilarity was performed as shown in fig 4 the 39 biofilm samples could be clustered into three groups and showing a clear separation according to the floc size of inoculated sludge furthermore multivariate analysis including adonis and analysis of similarity anosim revealed significant differences adonis f 14 089 p 0 001 anosim r 0 564 p 0 001 among these three groups of biofilm microbiomes table s3 according to the nmds plot the dissimilarity between large sized and small sized biofilms was the most pronounced followed by that between medium sized and small sized biofilms and that between large sized and medium sized biofilms these observations were supported by the highest anosim r value of 0 821 table s3 large sized biofilms vs small sized biofilms and by the lowest anosim r value of 0 255 large sized biofilms vs medium sized biofilms it should be noted that the medium sized and large sized biofilms were very close to each other at the beginning while afterwards the medium sized biofilm started to move towards the small sized biofilm fig 4 3 3 deterministic vs stochastic processes in guiding biofilm community assembly to explore the deterministic vs stochastic processes on the biofilm assembly patterns during bacterial biofilm succession null model analysis of the beta diversity tests introduced by chase and myers 2011 were conducted as shown in table 1 all the observed similarities were significantly distinguishable from the random null expectations for all the biofilm communities during biofilm development p 0 01 suggesting that deterministic processes played dominant roles in biofilm community assembly furthermore the observed jaccard s similarities of the biofilm communities during biofilm succession were markedly greater than the expected similarities for stochastically assembled communities table s4 according to principles of microbial ecology chase 2007 zhang et al 2016 we further found that abiotic environmental filtering where local abiotic environmental conditions select against certain species to form local communities rather than biotic interactions played a major role in structuring biofilm communities to further quantify the relative importance of deterministic vs stochastic processes in shaping the biofilm community structure the selection strength ss i e the proportion of the divergence between the observed similarity for each pairwise comparison and the null expected similarity divided by the observed similarity was calculated according to the calculated ss fig s4 table s4 the deterministic processes contributes more than 85 of the community dynamics in the three groups of biofilms throughout their growth which was in line with the findings derived from the null model test permdisp above in particular the large sized and small sized biofilm communities displayed similar assembly patterns i e highest determinism at the initial attachment 2 h of incubation and then slight decrement with biofilm development whereas the proportion of deterministic processes in controlling the medium sized biofilm communities became the largest after 8 h of incubation overall the process of biofilm community assembly was determinism dominated and dynamic of the four ecological processes structuring phylogenetic beta diversity of biofilm assemblages environmental selection was primary in all three biofilm communities explaining 80 8 74 4 and 61 5 for large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm assemblage turnover respectively during biofilm succession fig 5 dispersal limitation was absent in all three biofilm community assemblages suggesting that microbes were not dispersal limited in such small scale ecosystems homogenizing dispersal which indicates a very high rate of dispersal among communities accounted for 19 2 23 1 and 34 6 in large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm community succession in addition ecological drift which represented random changes of community structure resulting from the inherent stochastic processes of birth death and reproduction contributed 2 6 and 3 8 in medium sized and small sized biofilm community assemblages whereas this ecological role was not observed in large sized biofilm microbiota these findings suggested the increases of determinism in biofilm community assembly with increasing floc size of the inoculated sludge 3 4 network topology features of the biofilm microbiomes three rmt based networks were constructed to reveal ecological associations of co occurring taxa in the succession of biofilm microbiota inoculated with different sized sludge fig 6 in terms of the topological parameters of these networks such as the clustering coefficients harmonic geodesic distance and modularity were significantly higher than those of the corresponding random networks moreover the small world coefficients σ of the networks were higher than 1 table 2 strongly suggesting that the pmens in biofilm communities possessed small world and modular structures regardless of the initial floc size wu et al 2016 zhou et al 2010 the constructed bacterial networks consisted of 167 nodes linked by 434 edges 164 nodes linked by 404 edges and 185 nodes linked by 527 edges for the large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm microbiomes respectively table 2 intriguingly positive interactions were pervasively observed in the ecological networks contributing to 88 7 94 6 and 89 6 of the species species associations in the large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm microbiomes respectively indicating ubiquitous presence of cooperative behaviors such as cross feeding and syntrophic mutualistic interactions in biofilm development raes and bork 2008 in addition the mantel test showed that both negative and positive interplay were not correlated with phylogenetic relatedness in all three pmens fig s5 implying that phylogenetic relatedness played a negligible role in species interactions during biofilm succession the large sized biofilm community network displayed the highest average connectivity avgk and the shortest harmonic geodesic distance hd suggesting that network interactions were likely much more intense in large sized biofilm microbiota additionally the large sized biofilm network possessed a lowest modularity whereas the modularity of the medium sized and small sized biofilm networks were at similar levels further two parameters within module connectivity zi and connectivity among modules pi were used to decipher topological roles of bacterial otus in the biofilm networks ecologically peripherals represent specialists while module hubs and connectors represent generalists and network hubs are indicators of supergeneralists olesen et al 2007 the z p plot of these networks fig s6 shows that the majority of the nodes in both networks were peripherals with most of their edges within their modules no supergeneralists were observed in all networks two module hubs otu70 and 258 2 module hubs otu499 and 652 and 2 connectors otu37 and 284 which can be considered keystone taxa that drive the biofilm succession were identified in the large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm communities respectively table s5 although no keystone taxa were shared in the biofilm networks at the otu level otu258 and otu652 were affiliated with the genus morganella moreover most of the keystone taxa i e five out of six in the three biofilm networks were affiliated with the family enterobacteriaceae indicating central roles of enterobacteriaceae members in biofilm microbial ecology the remaining keystone otu in small sized biofilm network belonged to the genus acinetobacter furthermore stronger keystone taxa extracellular protein polysaccharide relationships were observed in the biofilm networks fig s7 suggesting the important role of biopolymers in biofilm community development of note bacterial interactions between the keystone taxa and their neighboring species were predominantly positive in the large sized 94 4 positive interaction and medium sized 100 positive interaction biofilm ecological networks without exception whereas the small sized biofilm microbiota were co regulated by positive and negative interactions 47 1 positive interaction of note all these keystone taxa accounted for very low abundance table s6 average 0 03 0 85 implying that some low abundant species played paramount roles in shaping the biofilm community structures 4 discussion 4 1 dependence of biofilm community assembly on the size nature of sludge flocs in this work markedly lower bacterial diversities of the initial biofilm communities than those of inoculated sludge flocs supported the important roles of selection in biofilm formation fig s3 intriguingly the variation trends of determinism were exactly opposite to those of biofilm bacterial diversities further supporting the important roles of environmental selection in biofilm community assemblies zhang et al 2019c similarly in both natural e g stream and engineered e g granular sludge environmental ecosystems biofilm communities were not the result of stochastic dispersal from the source communities but mainly shaped by the local conditions besemer et al 2012 graham et al 2017 li eacute bana et al 2019 in the pmens of these biofilm microbiomes most of keystone species belonged to the family enterobacteriaceae members of the enterobacteriaceae are facultative anaerobes dj 1992 wust et al 2011 which can adapt to the oxygen limited microenvironments in biofilm aggregates additionally most members from this family could ferment polysaccharides kumar and das 2001 which coincided with the significant keystone taxa biopolymer correlations fig s7 moreover most enterobacteriaceae members possess many flagella brenner and iii 2015 which can facilitate their colonization and formation of bacterial biofilms another keystone taxon acinetobacter has been reported as a primary colonizer and bridging species in biofilm aggregate development katharios lanwermeyer et al 2014 liebana et al 2016 weissbrodt et al 2012 in particular acinetobacter sp is hydrophobic and produces eps ding et al 2015 which are decisive properties for biofilm formation very recently cheng et al found that acinetobacter was a core genus responsible for biofilm formation in anaerobic mbrs cheng et al 2019 overall these keystone taxa showed strong habitat filtering characteristics which was in accordance with the bacterial assemblies strongly influenced by local environmental conditions e g redox potential the availability of substrate and resources it should be noted that culturing the biofilm under static state can to a certain extent be considered as a selecting pressure for deterministic community assembly which was partially supported by increased determinism in biofilm community assembly under low flux i e analogous to static state as compared to high flux xu et al 2019 although deterministic processes were the main drivers floc sizes of the source sludge could regulate the relative importance of determinism to a large extent in biofilm community assemblies less abundant species are likely more susceptible to ecological drift since a small drop in their abundance could lead to species extinction nemergut et al 2013 the lowest abundance of keystone species identified in the small sized biofilm network likely contributed to the highest stochasticity among the biofilm microbiomes table s6 of note many pioneer species e g the keystone enterobacteriaceae form surface substances or appendages that endow them adhesive capability for unselectively attaching to subsequent species duguid and old 1980 which were likely responsible for increased stochasticity with biofilm succession regardless of the inoculated sludge size meanwhile it is reasonable to deduce that species presented in small sized flocs were more susceptible to biofilm formation by this random adhesive force as compared with those in large sized flocs this provided an additional explanation for higher stochasticity in biofilm community assembly sourced from smaller flocs than larger flocs 4 2 ecological insights into bacterial interactions in the biofilm microbiota it has been demonstrated that keystone taxa exert their influence on microbial communities through strong microbial interactions to maintain the structures and functions of ecosystems deng et al 2016 herren and mcmahon 2018 positive interactions among species could increase the yield of microbial biomass evidenced by previous works d onofrio et al 2010 foster and bell 2012 the dominantly positive interactions between the keystone taxa and their neighbors in the large sized biofilm microbiomes were likely responsible for their highest biofilm formation potential these positive interactions structuring keystone populations in the large sized and medium sized biofilm microbiomes were associated with the occurrence of pervasive mutualism or commensalism following the essence of black queen hypothesis morris et al 2012 i some microbes can help other bacteria survive by improving the local conditions for instance the aerobic heterotrophs acinetobacter consume oxygen providing local anaerobic conditions for facultative anaerobic morganella otu111 vs otu258 in module 2 in the large sized biofilm ecological network ii metabolic commensalism e g one species utilizes a metabolite produced by others the keystone taxon citrobacter otu652 produce and excrete amino acids which could be used as substrates by their neighbors morganella otu323 in module 1 of the medium sized biofilm community network pares et al 1974 in particular positive correlations were pervasive in phylogenetically similar otus e g keystone morganella otus and acinetobacter otus in the large sized and medium sized biofilm ecological networks respectively this is usually attributed to niche overlap as microbes similar in phylogeny are likely to behave similarly in niche adaptation tringe et al 2005 further phylogenetically related species tend to present stronger positive interplays when interactions are regulated by phenotype matching nuismer and harmon 2015 however positive interactions between closely related otus might be induced by false cross assignment since taxon assignment is often inaccurate at lower taxonomic levels faust and raes 2012 in contrast negative interactions were more pronounced in the counterpart of the small sized biofilm community which were associated with competitions for spatial niches and resources under conditions of restricted resource availability potentially the smallest cluster in the small sized biofilm architecture harbored the lowest available spatial niches winkler et al 2013 xavie et al 2007 resulting in the fiercest competition for ecological niches moreover negative correlations were well exemplified by competitions for substrates and oxygen between heterotrophs e g keystone enterobacter otu37 and acinetobacter otu277 in module 1 of the small sized biofilm ecological network and or by differential niche adaptation between distinct otus in addition some members of enterobacter could secrete various antibiotics cytotoxins davin regli and pages 2015 causing negative interactions in the ecological network taken together the distinct interaction patterns between the keystone taxa and their neighbors led to distinguished community diversities and structures in biofilm sourced from different sized sludges in the pmens of microbial communities the modules could be considered as functional units luo et al 2006 also modules can be interpreted as microbial niches eiler et al 2012 thus the increase in network modularity of biofilm communities with decreasing floc size of the source sludge might indicate a greater extent of niche differentiation which is suggestive of weaker interactions among microbial populations in small sized biofilm similarly an increased niche differentiation could lead to weak interactions among soil microbial populations faust and raes 2012 the results of avgk and hd also confirmed weaker interplays in small sized biofilm community the weakest direct e g biological interactions or indirect e g shared ecological niches microbial interactions was consistent with the most pronounced stochasticity in the small sized biofilm community assembly barberan et al 2012 4 3 implications and research needs from an engineering perspective our results have great implications to the design and operation of biological wastewater treatment the keystone species structuring biofilm community could be inherently predicted and helping in manipulating biological wastewater treatment processes with decreasing floc size of the source community stochastic processes e g ecological drift played an increasingly important role in biofilm community assembly resulting in weakened prediction power in the core keystone populations thus it can be expected that stochastic processes are more pronounced in the biofilm formation in mbrs because of the low size of flocs than those in conventional activated sludge processes in this work the biofilm formation experiment was performed in well controlled conditions i e under static state in order to explicitly investigate the effect of the initial floc size and to exclude interference of other factors however in practice biofilm attached on the carriers are operated in a constantly moving state in biofilm based systems e g ifas process which is definitely affected by hydraulic and mass transfer efficiency in addition previous studies have verified that biofilm assembly processes are considerably controlled by hydrodynamic conditions and operational parameters li et al 2015 xu et al 2019 therefore bacterial succession and assembly in biofilm based process for wastewater treatment should take these multiple factors into consideration furthermore environmental filtering and dispersal dynamics may affect biofilm community assembly differentially depending on scales battin et al 2016 as such assembly processes of biofilm community in full scale systems warrant further investigation note also that round glass coverslips were employed as model carriers to support biofilm growth in this work more recently zhang et al 2019a found that carrier materials could play important roles in driving the primary succession of biofilm community assembly zhang et al 2019a future work focusing on biofilm assembly on different carrier materials would allow us to explore the underlying mechanisms for the distinct microbial behaviors and help select suitable biofilm carrier for superior performance in biofilm wastewater treatment processes however the established approach in this work provided a framework for determining biofilm assemblage drivers in biofilm based systems and the obtained results highlighted the importance of planktonic aggregate characteristics in biofilm assemblage 5 conclusion the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows 1 deterministic process was found to dominate biofilm community assembly and the increased determinism was accompanied by decreased bacterial diversity during biofilm succession 2 biofilm community assemblies were largely regulated by floc sizes of their source sludges the relative importance of deterministic process driving bacterial assembly of biofilm metacommunity decreased with decreasing floc sizes of the planktonic community 3 co occurring species interactions of biofilm ecological network were greatly impacted by the source sludge sizes the large sized biofilm community network harbored low modularity low harmonic geodesic distance and high average degree

18273,wanted and unwanted surface attached growth of bacteria is ubiquitous in natural and engineered settings normally attachment of planktonic cells to media surfaces initiates biofilm formation and fundamentally regulates biofilm assembly processes here culturing biofilm with planktonic sludge as source community we found distinct succession profiles of biofilm communities sourced from the size fractionated sludge flocs 25 25 120 120 μm null model analyses revealed that deterministic process dominated in biofilm community assemblies but decreased with decreasing floc size additionally the relative importance of environmental selection increased with increasing floc size of the source sludge whereas homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift followed opposite trends phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens indicated that species interactions were intensive in biofilm microbiota developed from large sized flocs 120 μm as evidenced by the low modularity and harmonic geodesic distance and the high average degree intriguingly the keystone taxa in these biofilm ecological networks were controlled by distinct interaction patterns but all showed strong habitat characteristics e g facultative anaerobic motile hydrophobic and involved in extracellular polymeric substance metabolism corroborating the crucial roles of environmental filtering in structuring biofilm community taken together our findings highlight the role of planktonic floc properties in biofilm community assembly and advance our understanding of microbial ecology in biofilm based systems

sessile states flemming and wingender 2010 extracellular polymeric substances eps provide mechanical stability for the biofilm and enable the microbial community to resist environmental stresses costerton et al 1995 flemming and wingender 2010 due to a wide range of advantages for the sessile mode of microorganisms biofilm based processes have been widely applied for wastewater treatment

ifass the adhesion of planktonic cells to media surfaces is the initial step for biofilm formation donlan and costerton 2002 flemming and wingender 2010 wood et al 2011 underlining important roles of planktonic community in biofilm formation however the biofilm niches differ fundamentally from planktonic counterparts attributable to the differential population density spatial constraints nutrient access and species species interactions yan et al 2017 thus deciphering dynamics of planktonic and biofilm communities and their interplays in biofilm formation could provide a complete understanding of biofilm related processes recent attempts have improved our understanding of biofilm and planktonic cells in terms of biodiversity and community structure in both natural and engineered ecosystems biswas and turner 2012 liu et al 2018 niederdorfer et al 2016 however previous studies have left knowledge gaps regarding the forces that structuring biofilm community composition which are central issues in microbial ecology stegen et al 2012 the composition and structure of microbial communities are regulated by complicated and dynamic ecological mechanisms widder et al 2016 such as stochastic and deterministic processes zhou and ning 2017 to date only few studies elucidated the mechanisms shaping biofilm communities in natural environments the dynamic of these two processes in structuring bio cake community in an mbr has been revealed in a very recent study xu et al 2019 nonetheless the ecological drivers of microbial community in biofilm based processes for wastewater treatment remain largely unknown likely due to either the heterogeneity of planktonic community or the ever changing wastewater characteristics and instability of operating conditions in wastewater treatment plants identification of the ecological processes underpinning the biofilm community assembly can greatly aid in improving our understanding of the microbial ecology in biofilm based systems for a given biofilm based system biofilm attached on carrier surface is largely affected by the characteristics of source community i e planktonic sludge flocs previous studies have demonstrated that different sized sludge harbored the distinct micro environments e g do orp and ph by using the microelectrode approach han et al 2012 li and bishop 2004 potentially as local conditions the source community could play roles in bacterial assembly of biofilm microbiota besemer et al 2012 curtis and sloan 2004 xu et al 2019 we recently found the floc size dependence of pathogens in activated sludge zhang et al 2019b in addition different sized flocs may possess divergent thermodynamic interactions thus showing different dispersal and adhesion behaviors shen et al 2015 overall the floc size of source sludge is an important factor determining biofilm community assembly nonetheless bacterial assembly of biofilm community from planktonic sludge with different floc sizes has not yet been elucidated previously statistical analyses such as the null model have been applied to determine deterministic and stochastic processes guiding the microbial assembly patterns of sludge related microbial communities ju and zhang 2015 li eacute bana et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 biofilm microbiomes in natural and drinking water distribution systems besemer et al 2012 graham et al 2017 stegen et al 2012 vignola et al 2018 recently ecological network analysis has been developed to decipher co occurrence patterns of taxa and their putative interactions in microbial communities barberan et al 2012 deng et al 2012 2016 ju et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 in particular on the basis of the network topological features such analysis could enable identification of the keystone species crucial for maintaining microbiota structure and function deng et al 2012 using these approaches we believe that assembly patterns of biofilm communities and the roles of keystone taxa in biofilm succession can be greatly illuminated in practice the sludge sizes in mbrs are always smaller than those in conventional activated sludge fenu et al 2010 henriques et al 2005 this work could help understand the differential biofilm community assembly and distinct keystone sessile populations in the case of integrating biofilm with these two representative processes from an ecological perspective these knowledges are crucial to better manipulate and optimize the functioning of the biofilm related processes for wastewater treatment if the community assembly is governed by a deterministic process this work aimed to reveal the bacterial assembly mechanisms of biofilm community during biofilm succession focusing on the effect of floc size here we cultivated biofilm on model carriers e g round coverslips using different sized sludge flocs as source communities biofilm architecture microbial diversity and structure were assessed during biofilm development several statistical approaches based on null models were applied to unravel the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic factors in determining biofilm communities furthermore phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analyses were performed to interpret the interplay patterns and ecological roles of co occurring species driving biofilm succession derived from the different sized flocs overall this work is expected to advance our understanding of microbial ecology and shed light on the optimization of biofilm based systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 particle size fractionation of activated sludge the inoculated sludge flocs were collected from a full scale anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a a o mbr located in guangzhou china with a total design capacity of 100 000 m3 day the particle size distribution of activated sludge was determined prior to particle size fractionation the mean floc size was ca 50 μm which was similar to that of a full scale mbr 40 50 μm reported previously but much lower than that of conventional activated sludge ca 200 μm fenu et al 2010 as presented in fig s1 a majority of the sludge flocs had a size range 25 120 μm while a minority of them was smaller than 25 μm or larger than 120 μm therefore we chose 120 μm and 25 μm sieves to separate the sludge flocs into three representative fractions by a wet sieving method 25 μm 25 120 μm and 120 μm for representation of the small sized medium sized and large sized flocs respectively accordingly the biofilm developed from large sized medium sized and small sized flocs is hereinafter referred to as large sized biofilm medium sized biofilm and small sized biofilm respectively 2 2 biofilm biomass and eps quantification given the differential response of different sized bioaggregates to hydrodynamic conditions biofilm formation was performed under static state for explicitly testing floc size dependence in this work before biofilm formation test of the three different sized sludge the sludge samples were pre cultivated in 100 ml sterilized lb medium contained in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks a 24 well polystyrene microtiter plate with round coverslip on the bottom were used to culture biofilms as previously described izano et al 2008 briefly 100 μl of the cultivated sludge solutions od adjusted to 0 5 at 600 nm were evenly added onto the round coverslip afterwards 900 μl of lb growth medium was gently introduced in the plate the biofilm cultivation was lasted for 72 h at 30 c without agitation following incubation the round coverslips were washed three times with sterile deionized water for loosely attached cells removal the washed coverslips were air dried and stained with 125 μl of 1 crystal violet cv solution for 15 min stained coverslips were washed three times with deionized water for excess stain removal the amount of biofilm biomass was quantified by sufficiently solubilizing the biofilms for 15 min with 500 μl of 33 acetic acid and then determining the absorbance of the cv solution at 595 nm polysaccharides and proteins in the eps was determined according to the dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 methods respectively all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 3 visualization of the biofilms using fluorescence microscopy a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit 7012 molecular probes invitrogen carlsbad ca usa containing the fluorescent nucleic acid stains syto 9 and pi was used to stain the live and dead cells in the environmental samples during the staining process the biofilm samples on round coverslips were mixed with a mixture of the syto 9 and pi stains 1 1 and then were incubated in the dark for 15 min at 25 c the stained biomass samples were observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope mf31 mshot guangzhou guangdong china a minimum of 10 fields was taken for each sample to calculate the ratio of live dead cells which was determined by the ratio of green red fluorescence areas using imagej software 2 4 dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing at 0 h i e before biofilm formation one sludge sample of each size was collected n 3 and afterwards triplicate biofilm samples were taken from each size n 3 3 4 resulting in a total of 39 biomass samples for dna extraction and subsequent analysis of microbial communities the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa was used to extract microbial dna according to manufacturer s instructions the final dna concentration and purity were evaluated using a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and dna quality was assessed by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified with 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa pcr reactions were conducted following a previous study xu et al 2019 afterwards 2 agarose gel was used to extract the resulting pcr products then the pcr products were further purified by the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa and quantified by quantifluor st promega usa following the manufacturer s protocols amplicons were then used for high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq pe300 platform at the shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd processing of sequencing data was performed according to our previous work xu et al 2019 the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession prjna529301 2 5 network construction using the rmt based approach the pmens of the biofilm communities sourced from different sized sludge were constructed on a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena deng et al 2012 firstly the relative abundance of sequence numbers was used to obtain the pearson correlation matrices which were then converted into similarity matrices subsequently an appropriate threshold value st for defining the network structure was determined using the rmt based network approach deng et al 2012 then by retaining all the nodes whose abundance similarity values higher than the determined threshold an adjacency matrix encoding the connection strength between each pair of otus was obtained in pmens a module in the network is a group of otus that are highly connected among themselves but had much fewer connections with otus outside the group deng et al 2012 the greedy modularity optimization which has been proved as a more robust approach over other methods e g short random walks leading eigenvector of the community matrix simulated annealing approach for obtaining the highest modularity value and identifying the submodular structure of mens deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 therefore in this work the greedy modularity optimization was applied to detect modules of mens for network comparison corresponding random networks of all pmens were established using the maslov sneppen method maslov and sneppen 2002 and keeping the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewiring all of the edge positions in the pmens the significance between the pmens and their corresponding random networks were determined by a standard z test the small world coefficient σ was applied to describe the small world property of the networks i e the degree of clustering and shortness of paths between nodes telesford et al 2011 gephi 0 9 2 software webatlas paris france was used for network visualization bastian et al 2009 2 6 statistical analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analyses nmds were conducted based on the bray curtis distance with the r vegan package two nonparametric multivariate statistical tests i e a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices adonis and an analysis of similarity anosim were conducted to determine the differences in the biofilm community structures with the r vegan package the null model test was conducted according to previous literature chase et al 2011 the significance of the differences in microbial communities from null model expectations was evaluated by the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp in addition selection strength ss was used to quantify the relative importance of niche based deterministic processes in structuring community composition according to zhou et al 2014 in brief ss can be assessed as follows ss j obs j exp j obs j obs and j exp indicate the observed jaccard s similarity and average null expected jaccard s similarity respectively furthermore a phylogenetic beta diversity framework was adopted to quantify the relative influence of environmental selection homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation and ecological drift on biofilm community assemblage stegen et al 2013 2015 the function mantel correlog in r vegan package was conducted to check the relationship between phylogenetic similarity and edge correlation strength briefly pearson correlation coefficients between otus in relative abundance were grouped into bins the mantel test with 999 randomizations was used to determine the correlation between phylogenetic distance and pearson correlation coefficients within each bin then mantel s r values were plotted against the median of each pearson coefficient bin 2 7 shot gun metagenome sequencing the size fractionated sludge samples were further analyzed by shot gun metagenome sequencing details could be found in our previous work zhang et al 2019b in addition quorum sensing qs analysis can be found elsewhere hong et al 2016 by searching keywords including accessory gene regulator quorum sensing and autoinducer about qs on uniprotkb a local qs database was set up the groups including autoinducer transportor regulator decomposer autoinducer receptor repressor activator effector autoinducer producer and unclear were annotated to qs all the metagenome sequencing data have been deposited into ncbi short read achieve sra under the accession number srp189682 3 results 3 1 biomass profiles of the biofilm succession sourced from different sized flocs as presented in fig 1 the od595 readings showed that the biofilm growth progressed firstly and then dropped down with the increase of incubation time regardless of planktonic floc size the peak biomass of large sized biofilm 24 h od595 3 77 0 35 was significantly higher p 0 001 than that of medium sized 24 h od595 2 63 0 32 and small sized biofilm 12 h od595 2 98 0 24 these results indicated that the large sized sludge possessed the highest biofilm formation potential the bioaggregates can associate certain amount of nutrients inside the aggregates for the biofilm to develop further the bigger the aggregates sizes the more nutrients will be brought with resulting in the largest peak biomass of the large sized biofilm fig 1 however no significant difference was observed between the peak biomass of medium sized and small sized biofilm which was likely attributable to the fact that the peak of biofilm biomass will increase significantly only when the initial floc size reaches a high threshold qs activity was likely the most pronounced within the large sized floc followed by the small sized and finally the medium sized biofilm according to qs related genes annotation of size fractionated sludge communities fig s2 the abundances of qs related genes in the size fractionated sludge communities were in accordance with the peak biomasses of their corresponding biofilm indicating that qs related genes in the initial floc play stimulative roles in biofilm biomass accumulation fluorescent examination for the biofilm architecture showed much smaller aggregates of small sized biofilm as compared with those of large sized and medium sized biofilms during the initial biofilm development 2 h of incubation fig 2 afterwards the bacterial cells attached to the coverslips and formed large aggregates the microcolonies within small sized biofilm reached their maximum size with a complex architecture at 12 h whereas the cluster size of the large sized and medium sized biofilms peaked at 24 h fig 2 of note the large sized biofilm cells were always embedded in larger clusters relative to the medium sized and small sized biofilm cells which was generally in accordance with the cv staining results the results of dead live cell ratios showed that the biofilm microbiota had low viability in the initial phase 2 h of incubation fig 2 likely because of low bacterial viability of the source sludge in addition the viability of the initial medium sized biofilm was the highest followed by the initial small sized biofilm and finally the initial large sized biofilm afterwards the dead live cell ratios in the three groups of biofilms experienced a gradual increase and subsequent decrease independent of the initial floc size fig 2 which coincided with the tendencies of biofilm biomass production these observations suggested bacterial viability of biofilm cells was highly correlated with their growth phase 3 2 distinct bacterial diversity patterns of the biofilm succession a total of 1 732 036 high quality filtered sequences for 39 biofilm samples were achieved by illumina high throughput sequencing normalization of the sequence number was performed by randomly extracting 18 340 sequences from each sample for comparison at the same sequencing depth the good s coverages for all the biofilm samples were higher than 99 5 indicating that the majority of bacterial diversity in each sample had been captured table s1 as shown in fig s3 the initial biofilm communities i e biofilm after 2 h of colonization had markedly lower microbial diversities e g observed species and shannon diversity as compared with their source communities and thus displayed significant enhancement with an increase in incubation time within 12 h regardless of the source of sludge flocs afterwards their bacterial diversities showed slightly and statistically insignificant decrement other alpha diversity indices demonstrated similar trends for the three groups of biofilms table s1 as for microbial compositions the dominant genera average abundance 1 0 which were affiliated with proteobacteria and firmicutes were found to be similar but vary in abundance among the biofilm microbiomes table s2 for instance lactococcus was the most abundant genus in the large sized average 51 8 and medium sized average 50 3 biofilm communities whereas the small sized counterpart average 25 8 was mostly dominated by acinetobacter table s2 in addition the bubble plot of the top 15 genera displayed differential dynamics of these dominant populations during biofilm development fig 3 to further describe the bacterial community dynamics of these biofilm microbiomes nmds based analysis on the bray curtis dissimilarity was performed as shown in fig 4 the 39 biofilm samples could be clustered into three groups and showing a clear separation according to the floc size of inoculated sludge furthermore multivariate analysis including adonis and analysis of similarity anosim revealed significant differences adonis f 14 089 p 0 001 anosim r 0 564 p 0 001 among these three groups of biofilm microbiomes table s3 according to the nmds plot the dissimilarity between large sized and small sized biofilms was the most pronounced followed by that between medium sized and small sized biofilms and that between large sized and medium sized biofilms these observations were supported by the highest anosim r value of 0 821 table s3 large sized biofilms vs small sized biofilms and by the lowest anosim r value of 0 255 large sized biofilms vs medium sized biofilms it should be noted that the medium sized and large sized biofilms were very close to each other at the beginning while afterwards the medium sized biofilm started to move towards the small sized biofilm fig 4 3 3 deterministic vs stochastic processes in guiding biofilm community assembly to explore the deterministic vs stochastic processes on the biofilm assembly patterns during bacterial biofilm succession null model analysis of the beta diversity tests introduced by chase and myers 2011 were conducted as shown in table 1 all the observed similarities were significantly distinguishable from the random null expectations for all the biofilm communities during biofilm development p 0 01 suggesting that deterministic processes played dominant roles in biofilm community assembly furthermore the observed jaccard s similarities of the biofilm communities during biofilm succession were markedly greater than the expected similarities for stochastically assembled communities table s4 according to principles of microbial ecology chase 2007 zhang et al 2016 we further found that abiotic environmental filtering where local abiotic environmental conditions select against certain species to form local communities rather than biotic interactions played a major role in structuring biofilm communities to further quantify the relative importance of deterministic vs stochastic processes in shaping the biofilm community structure the selection strength ss i e the proportion of the divergence between the observed similarity for each pairwise comparison and the null expected similarity divided by the observed similarity was calculated according to the calculated ss fig s4 table s4 the deterministic processes contributes more than 85 of the community dynamics in the three groups of biofilms throughout their growth which was in line with the findings derived from the null model test permdisp above in particular the large sized and small sized biofilm communities displayed similar assembly patterns i e highest determinism at the initial attachment 2 h of incubation and then slight decrement with biofilm development whereas the proportion of deterministic processes in controlling the medium sized biofilm communities became the largest after 8 h of incubation overall the process of biofilm community assembly was determinism dominated and dynamic of the four ecological processes structuring phylogenetic beta diversity of biofilm assemblages environmental selection was primary in all three biofilm communities explaining 80 8 74 4 and 61 5 for large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm assemblage turnover respectively during biofilm succession fig 5 dispersal limitation was absent in all three biofilm community assemblages suggesting that microbes were not dispersal limited in such small scale ecosystems homogenizing dispersal which indicates a very high rate of dispersal among communities accounted for 19 2 23 1 and 34 6 in large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm community succession in addition ecological drift which represented random changes of community structure resulting from the inherent stochastic processes of birth death and reproduction contributed 2 6 and 3 8 in medium sized and small sized biofilm community assemblages whereas this ecological role was not observed in large sized biofilm microbiota these findings suggested the increases of determinism in biofilm community assembly with increasing floc size of the inoculated sludge 3 4 network topology features of the biofilm microbiomes three rmt based networks were constructed to reveal ecological associations of co occurring taxa in the succession of biofilm microbiota inoculated with different sized sludge fig 6 in terms of the topological parameters of these networks such as the clustering coefficients harmonic geodesic distance and modularity were significantly higher than those of the corresponding random networks moreover the small world coefficients σ of the networks were higher than 1 table 2 strongly suggesting that the pmens in biofilm communities possessed small world and modular structures regardless of the initial floc size wu et al 2016 zhou et al 2010 the constructed bacterial networks consisted of 167 nodes linked by 434 edges 164 nodes linked by 404 edges and 185 nodes linked by 527 edges for the large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm microbiomes respectively table 2 intriguingly positive interactions were pervasively observed in the ecological networks contributing to 88 7 94 6 and 89 6 of the species species associations in the large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm microbiomes respectively indicating ubiquitous presence of cooperative behaviors such as cross feeding and syntrophic mutualistic interactions in biofilm development raes and bork 2008 in addition the mantel test showed that both negative and positive interplay were not correlated with phylogenetic relatedness in all three pmens fig s5 implying that phylogenetic relatedness played a negligible role in species interactions during biofilm succession the large sized biofilm community network displayed the highest average connectivity avgk and the shortest harmonic geodesic distance hd suggesting that network interactions were likely much more intense in large sized biofilm microbiota additionally the large sized biofilm network possessed a lowest modularity whereas the modularity of the medium sized and small sized biofilm networks were at similar levels further two parameters within module connectivity zi and connectivity among modules pi were used to decipher topological roles of bacterial otus in the biofilm networks ecologically peripherals represent specialists while module hubs and connectors represent generalists and network hubs are indicators of supergeneralists olesen et al 2007 the z p plot of these networks fig s6 shows that the majority of the nodes in both networks were peripherals with most of their edges within their modules no supergeneralists were observed in all networks two module hubs otu70 and 258 2 module hubs otu499 and 652 and 2 connectors otu37 and 284 which can be considered keystone taxa that drive the biofilm succession were identified in the large sized medium sized and small sized biofilm communities respectively table s5 although no keystone taxa were shared in the biofilm networks at the otu level otu258 and otu652 were affiliated with the genus morganella moreover most of the keystone taxa i e five out of six in the three biofilm networks were affiliated with the family enterobacteriaceae indicating central roles of enterobacteriaceae members in biofilm microbial ecology the remaining keystone otu in small sized biofilm network belonged to the genus acinetobacter furthermore stronger keystone taxa extracellular protein polysaccharide relationships were observed in the biofilm networks fig s7 suggesting the important role of biopolymers in biofilm community development of note bacterial interactions between the keystone taxa and their neighboring species were predominantly positive in the large sized 94 4 positive interaction and medium sized 100 positive interaction biofilm ecological networks without exception whereas the small sized biofilm microbiota were co regulated by positive and negative interactions 47 1 positive interaction of note all these keystone taxa accounted for very low abundance table s6 average 0 03 0 85 implying that some low abundant species played paramount roles in shaping the biofilm community structures 4 discussion 4 1 dependence of biofilm community assembly on the size nature of sludge flocs in this work markedly lower bacterial diversities of the initial biofilm communities than those of inoculated sludge flocs supported the important roles of selection in biofilm formation fig s3 intriguingly the variation trends of determinism were exactly opposite to those of biofilm bacterial diversities further supporting the important roles of environmental selection in biofilm community assemblies zhang et al 2019c similarly in both natural e g stream and engineered e g granular sludge environmental ecosystems biofilm communities were not the result of stochastic dispersal from the source communities but mainly shaped by the local conditions besemer et al 2012 graham et al 2017 li eacute bana et al 2019 in the pmens of these biofilm microbiomes most of keystone species belonged to the family enterobacteriaceae members of the enterobacteriaceae are facultative anaerobes dj 1992 wust et al 2011 which can adapt to the oxygen limited microenvironments in biofilm aggregates additionally most members from this family could ferment polysaccharides kumar and das 2001 which coincided with the significant keystone taxa biopolymer correlations fig s7 moreover most enterobacteriaceae members possess many flagella brenner and iii 2015 which can facilitate their colonization and formation of bacterial biofilms another keystone taxon acinetobacter has been reported as a primary colonizer and bridging species in biofilm aggregate development katharios lanwermeyer et al 2014 liebana et al 2016 weissbrodt et al 2012 in particular acinetobacter sp is hydrophobic and produces eps ding et al 2015 which are decisive properties for biofilm formation very recently cheng et al found that acinetobacter was a core genus responsible for biofilm formation in anaerobic mbrs cheng et al 2019 overall these keystone taxa showed strong habitat filtering characteristics which was in accordance with the bacterial assemblies strongly influenced by local environmental conditions e g redox potential the availability of substrate and resources it should be noted that culturing the biofilm under static state can to a certain extent be considered as a selecting pressure for deterministic community assembly which was partially supported by increased determinism in biofilm community assembly under low flux i e analogous to static state as compared to high flux xu et al 2019 although deterministic processes were the main drivers floc sizes of the source sludge could regulate the relative importance of determinism to a large extent in biofilm community assemblies less abundant species are likely more susceptible to ecological drift since a small drop in their abundance could lead to species extinction nemergut et al 2013 the lowest abundance of keystone species identified in the small sized biofilm network likely contributed to the highest stochasticity among the biofilm microbiomes table s6 of note many pioneer species e g the keystone enterobacteriaceae form surface substances or appendages that endow them adhesive capability for unselectively attaching to subsequent species duguid and old 1980 which were likely responsible for increased stochasticity with biofilm succession regardless of the inoculated sludge size meanwhile it is reasonable to deduce that species presented in small sized flocs were more susceptible to biofilm formation by this random adhesive force as compared with those in large sized flocs this provided an additional explanation for higher stochasticity in biofilm community assembly sourced from smaller flocs than larger flocs 4 2 ecological insights into bacterial interactions in the biofilm microbiota it has been demonstrated that keystone taxa exert their influence on microbial communities through strong microbial interactions to maintain the structures and functions of ecosystems deng et al 2016 herren and mcmahon 2018 positive interactions among species could increase the yield of microbial biomass evidenced by previous works d onofrio et al 2010 foster and bell 2012 the dominantly positive interactions between the keystone taxa and their neighbors in the large sized biofilm microbiomes were likely responsible for their highest biofilm formation potential these positive interactions structuring keystone populations in the large sized and medium sized biofilm microbiomes were associated with the occurrence of pervasive mutualism or commensalism following the essence of black queen hypothesis morris et al 2012 i some microbes can help other bacteria survive by improving the local conditions for instance the aerobic heterotrophs acinetobacter consume oxygen providing local anaerobic conditions for facultative anaerobic morganella otu111 vs otu258 in module 2 in the large sized biofilm ecological network ii metabolic commensalism e g one species utilizes a metabolite produced by others the keystone taxon citrobacter otu652 produce and excrete amino acids which could be used as substrates by their neighbors morganella otu323 in module 1 of the medium sized biofilm community network pares et al 1974 in particular positive correlations were pervasive in phylogenetically similar otus e g keystone morganella otus and acinetobacter otus in the large sized and medium sized biofilm ecological networks respectively this is usually attributed to niche overlap as microbes similar in phylogeny are likely to behave similarly in niche adaptation tringe et al 2005 further phylogenetically related species tend to present stronger positive interplays when interactions are regulated by phenotype matching nuismer and harmon 2015 however positive interactions between closely related otus might be induced by false cross assignment since taxon assignment is often inaccurate at lower taxonomic levels faust and raes 2012 in contrast negative interactions were more pronounced in the counterpart of the small sized biofilm community which were associated with competitions for spatial niches and resources under conditions of restricted resource availability potentially the smallest cluster in the small sized biofilm architecture harbored the lowest available spatial niches winkler et al 2013 xavie et al 2007 resulting in the fiercest competition for ecological niches moreover negative correlations were well exemplified by competitions for substrates and oxygen between heterotrophs e g keystone enterobacter otu37 and acinetobacter otu277 in module 1 of the small sized biofilm ecological network and or by differential niche adaptation between distinct otus in addition some members of enterobacter could secrete various antibiotics cytotoxins davin regli and pages 2015 causing negative interactions in the ecological network taken together the distinct interaction patterns between the keystone taxa and their neighbors led to distinguished community diversities and structures in biofilm sourced from different sized sludges in the pmens of microbial communities the modules could be considered as functional units luo et al 2006 also modules can be interpreted as microbial niches eiler et al 2012 thus the increase in network modularity of biofilm communities with decreasing floc size of the source sludge might indicate a greater extent of niche differentiation which is suggestive of weaker interactions among microbial populations in small sized biofilm similarly an increased niche differentiation could lead to weak interactions among soil microbial populations faust and raes 2012 the results of avgk and hd also confirmed weaker interplays in small sized biofilm community the weakest direct e g biological interactions or indirect e g shared ecological niches microbial interactions was consistent with the most pronounced stochasticity in the small sized biofilm community assembly barberan et al 2012 4 3 implications and research needs from an engineering perspective our results have great implications to the design and operation of biological wastewater treatment the keystone species structuring biofilm community could be inherently predicted and helping in manipulating biological wastewater treatment processes with decreasing floc size of the source community stochastic processes e g ecological drift played an increasingly important role in biofilm community assembly resulting in weakened prediction power in the core keystone populations thus it can be expected that stochastic processes are more pronounced in the biofilm formation in mbrs because of the low size of flocs than those in conventional activated sludge processes in this work the biofilm formation experiment was performed in well controlled conditions i e under static state in order to explicitly investigate the effect of the initial floc size and to exclude interference of other factors however in practice biofilm attached on the carriers are operated in a constantly moving state in biofilm based systems e g ifas process which is definitely affected by hydraulic and mass transfer efficiency in addition previous studies have verified that biofilm assembly processes are considerably controlled by hydrodynamic conditions and operational parameters li et al 2015 xu et al 2019 therefore bacterial succession and assembly in biofilm based process for wastewater treatment should take these multiple factors into consideration furthermore environmental filtering and dispersal dynamics may affect biofilm community assembly differentially depending on scales battin et al 2016 as such assembly processes of biofilm community in full scale systems warrant further investigation note also that round glass coverslips were employed as model carriers to support biofilm growth in this work more recently zhang et al 2019a found that carrier materials could play important roles in driving the primary succession of biofilm community assembly zhang et al 2019a future work focusing on biofilm assembly on different carrier materials would allow us to explore the underlying mechanisms for the distinct microbial behaviors and help select suitable biofilm carrier for superior performance in biofilm wastewater treatment processes however the established approach in this work provided a framework for determining biofilm assemblage drivers in biofilm based systems and the obtained results highlighted the importance of planktonic aggregate characteristics in biofilm assemblage 5 conclusion the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows 1 deterministic process was found to dominate biofilm community assembly and the increased determinism was accompanied by decreased bacterial diversity during biofilm succession 2 biofilm community assemblies were largely regulated by floc sizes of their source sludges the relative importance of deterministic process driving bacterial assembly of biofilm metacommunity decreased with decreasing floc sizes of the planktonic community 3 co occurring species interactions of biofilm ecological network were greatly impacted by the source sludge sizes the large sized biofilm community network harbored low modularity low harmonic geodesic distance and high average degree

18274,this study investigated the chemical and genetic mechanisms of anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge was with cao2 addition at ambient temperature the microbial community structures key microorganisms functional profiles and related carbohydrate active enzymes were further revealed according to metagenomic sequencing combining with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results showed that the prolonged period of alkaline condition generated from cao2 contributed significantly to the continuous destruction of was and the oxidative environment caused by cao2 further enhanced flocs dissolution this synergistic effect also significantly changed the microbial community oxidation contributed more than the alkaline condition to the decline of microbial diversity while the effect of alkaline condition was greater than that of oxidation in the change of microbial community structure the key enhanced genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis pathways with cao2 addition were highlighted three kinds of high abundance acetyl coa carboxylase genes and eleven kinds of synthetase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase genes promoted by cao2 were distributed throughout each branch of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 moreover carbohydrate binding modules cbms and glycoside hydrolases ghs were the top two carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes improved by cao2 addition cao2 can also effectively promote the function of lysozyme and the metabolism of several monosaccharides this work provides a deep insight into the advantage of cao2 in promoting sludge solubilization and acidification at the genetic levels thus expanding the application of cao2 in sludge treatment and resource recovery graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic fermentation waste activated sludge was calcium peroxide cao2 metagenomic carbohydrate active enzymes ambient temperature 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the by product from biological wastewater treatment process which is an complex heterogeneous substance consisting of organic residues bacterial cells inorganic particles heavy metals colloids etc anjum et al 2016 the amount of was is expected to increase continuously due to the increase in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china it is predicted that about 43 million tons of was 80 moisture content will be generated in 2020 yan 2017 anaerobic digestion ad is an effective stabilization treatment process for was which can produce renewable resource such as short chain fatty acids scfas and energy such as methane scfas can be used as external carbon sources for polyhydroxyalkanoates phas biosynthesis as well as for denitrification to achieve satisfactory biological nutrient removal efficiency ji and chen 2010 scfas are also potential treasures with multifaceted applications in the synthesis of biofuels and bioproducts fasahati and liu 2014 it is well known that hydrolysis was the rate limiting step in ad process due to the complex floc structure of was thus various pretreatment methods chemical thermal mechanical electrochemical biological and so on have been conducted to enhance sludge hydrolysis before digestion anjum et al 2016 carrere et al 2010 zhen et al 2017 in recent years there has been an increasing interest in the addition of cao2 when treating was during ad process li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 wang and li 2016 xu et al 2018 fermenting was with cao2 addition is a preferable technology for scfas accumulation and sludge reduction li et al 2015 several researchers have identified that cao2 can effectively destruct the extracellular polymeric substances eps and cell walls therefore enhancing the hydrolysis of protein and polysaccharide with higher scfas production li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 in addition cao2 can also help to degrade micropollutants adsorbed on was zhang et al 2015a zheng et al 2019 our recent research ping et al 2018 found that significant improvement in scfas production was achieved with cao2 addition during anaerobic fermentation process of was at ambient temperature this provides an energy saving technology for was treatment and resource recovery therefore it is of interest to further explore the chemical and microbial mechanisms of anaerobic fermentation process at ambient temperature with cao2 addition so as to provide a scientific basis for optimizing this process when dissolved in water cao2 can be slowly hydrolysed to release h2o2 and ca oh 2 controllably via the reactions shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 cao2 2h2o h2o2 ca oh 2 2 2cao2 2h2o o2 2ca oh 2 as one of the commonly alkaline agents ca oh 2 has been used for was fermentation at different temperatures li et al 2014a su et al 2013 and the highest scfas yield was observed at 35 c li et al 2014a h2o2 is a strong chemical oxidant that can destroy the cell walls of microorganism which leads to the release of cytoplasm and improves the solubility of sludge wang et al 2009 in addition naoh was the most commonly used agent for alkaline sludge treatment yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b the type of alkaline agents impacts significantly on was hydrolysis and acidification li et al 2011 demonstrated that the use of ca oh 2 had almost the same effect on scfas production and sludge volatile suspended solids vss reduction as that of naoh but su et al 2013 reported that scfas production with the addition of ca oh 2 was lower than that with naoh addition during the anaerobic fermentation of was in the sludge anaerobic digester as cao2 releases ca oh 2 slowly the alkaline habitat is different from that with the addition of ca oh 2 directly this should be further clarified microbial communities play a central role in organic carbon degradation and energy transfer in ad process determining the function of microorganisms in a complex community is one of the great challenges 16s rrna gene and other marker gene sequencing have been previously applied to investigate the microbial community structure in ad system when treating with cao2 li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 xu et al 2018 however it is reported that traditional approaches based on 16s rrna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization are not able to completely reveal the whole microbial community structure due to the extremely high complexity and overwhelming genetic diversities in ad sludge guo et al 2015 the development of metagenomics allows the identification of genes and functional enzymes participating in related activities cai et al 2018 guo et al 2015 which can provide new insights into the mechanism of scfas biosynthesis process with cao2 addition kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions and kegg pathway database contains graphical representations of metabolism membrane transport signal transduction and cell cycle kanehisa and goto 2000 carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes participate in many important biological processes including cell wall synthesis signalling and energy production during anaerobic fermentation and cazymes database is the most comprehensive repository of cazymes which provides rich sets of curated information about all groups of cazymes cantarel et al 2009 however so far little effort has been dedicated to analyse the functional traits of scfas biosynthesis pathway and cazymes during anaerobic fermentation particularly the association between chemical treatments and scfas related functions remains obscure to the best of our knowledge the key genes and enzymes which were enhanced by cao2 addition for scfas production are still unknown therefore in order to well understand the acidification mechanism during anaerobic fermentation at ambient temperature with cao2 addition it is necessary to comprehensively investigate the roles of cao2 and its hydrolysates h2o2 and ca oh 2 during the hydrolysis and acidogenic stages at the genetic and functional levels this study is a continuation of the previous work aiming to further elucidate the chemical and biological mechanisms for enhancing scfas production during anaerobic fermentation at ambient temperature of was with cao2 addition in order to dissect the chemical mechanism cao2 hydrolysates such as h2o2 and ca oh 2 were added equivalently to cao2 addition during the anaerobic fermentation of was in order to reveal the genetic mechanism the microbial community structures key microorganisms functional profiles and related cazymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were further explored specifically the key enhanced genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis pathways with cao2 addition were highlighted the metagenomic sequencing combining with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was applied for microbial community analysis at both taxonomic and genetic levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of the was the was was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank in a sewage treatment plant in shanghai china a 1 mm 1 mm screen was used to filter the sludge and then the was was concentrated by settling for about 24 h at 4 c the main

39 7 3 8 mg l 2 2 chemicals cao2 80 and ca oh 2 95 were purchased from fisher massachusetts usa naoh 96 and liquid h2o2 a r 30 w w were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china 2 3 experimental procedure glass serum bottles 600 ml containing 450 ml of was were used for batch anaerobic fermentation tests all bottles were purged with nitrogen gas for oxygen removal after the addition of was in order to identify the effect of cao2 hydrolysates ca oh 2 and h2o2 were added separately and naoh was added to further determine the effect of ph the doses of ca oh 2 0 05 g g vss and naoh 0 09 g g vss were obtained in preliminary experiments based on the same initial ph value created by 0 2 g cao2 g vss according to the stoichiometric relationship shown in eq 1 0 2 g cao2 g vss would release 0 096 g h2o2 g vss therefore cao2 0 2 g g vss h2o2 0 096 g g vss ca oh 2 0 05 g g vss and naoh 0 09 g g vss were added to the sludge respectively in four sets of test the control tests were performed without addition of any chemical agent the bottles were then immediately capped with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 200 rpm at ambient temperature 20 1 c sludge and gas samples were collected at 1 3 5 7 10 13 16 20 d the sludge samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min after which the supernatant was used for chemical analysis in addition sludge samples taken on day 1 were conducted for eps analysis the eps which contains slime eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from the sludge were extracted following the procedures utilized by niu et al 2013 sludge samples taken on day 10 were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to discard the supernatant and then subjected to microbial analysis all fermentation tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods tcod scod tss vss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2012 the ph was determined using a cyberscan510 ph meter eutech singapore the

between species and functions was performed by perl script 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates on the performance of anaerobic fermentation the ph in anaerobic fermentation is a crucial factor affecting the digestion performance although the initial ph was same around 9 5 with the addition of cao2 ca oh 2 or naoh the duration of alkaline condition was significantly different with the addition of ca oh 2 and naoh ph quickly dropped from 9 5 to 7 9 and 7 2 respectively on the first day fig 1 c naoh can be easily dissolved in water with the solubility of 113 g at 25 c while ca oh 2 has a lower solubility of 0 16 g at 25 c su et al 2013 the ph in cao2 addition test was above 8 0 within the first 5 days and then slowly recovered to neutral in 11 days fig 1 c cao2 was slightly soluble in water where it continued to release h2o2 and ca oh 2 during dissolution lu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the ph variation indicates that oh along with reactive oxygen species ros such as oh o2 could be slowly and continuously released during fermentation of was zhang et al 2015a 2018 zheng et al 2019 ros are highly reactive molecules and will damage cell structures such as dna rna and cell membrane birben et al 2012 continuous oxidative stress with membrane damage can eventually lead to cell lysis demple 1991 both alkaline and oxidative condition could enhance the solubilization of sludge flocs as a result scod and tscfas production increased continuously during the fermentation process 20 days with cao2 addition fig 1 a and b which was in accordance with our previous research ping et al 2018 however the variation trend was different with addition of cao2 hydrolysates with the addition of naoh or ca oh 2 the scod and tscfas continued to increase within the initial 3 5 days and then decreased due to ch4 production it can be seen from fig 1 d that the ch4 accumulation was the highest with naoh addition followed by ca oh 2 addition whereas it was inhibited with the addition of cao2 this is because appropriate alkaline pretreatment could increase ch4 accumulation zhang et al 2015b however methanogenesis was significantly inhibited by cao2 p 0 05 since the higher ph for a longer time li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 there were only slight increases in scod and tscfas production with the addition of h2o2 compared with the control test this may because the excessive disproportionation and decomposition loss of liquid h2o2 northup and cassidy 2008 xue et al 2016 in addition high concentration of h2o2 would function as a disinfectant and lead to a negative impact on microbial activity li et al 2014b compared with liquid h2o2 the h2o2 liberated from cao2 can be auto regulated by the slow dissolution rate northup and cassidy 2008 therefore maintaining continuous oxidation for sludge solubilization it can be seen from fig s2 that the orp in cao2 tests was relatively higher than that in h2o2 tests after 1 day digestion due to the longer period of alkaline and oxidative environment generated by the contemporary generation of ca oh 2 and h2o2 with cao2 addition the concentrations of scod and tscfas produced in the cao2 addition test were about 4 2 fold and 3 4 fold higher than those produced in sole alkaline or oxidative treatment tests on day 20 in addition the proportion of acetic acid greatly increased with cao2 addition fig s3 which was consistent with the study of li et al 2015 who proved that cao2 was conducive to the transformation of other scfas to acetic acid the fractions of doc polysaccharides and proteins in eps were further studied for each test on the first day as shown in fig 2 the fraction of these organic compounds in s eps were significantly promoted in cao2 addition tests compared to those in other chemical addition tests indicating a faster solubilization of sludge flocs and the following release of polysaccharides and proteins fig 2 b and c fig s4 the release of organic compounds from tb eps to s eps with the addition of ca oh 2 was slightly higher than that in the naoh addition tests and the fraction of those organic matters in s eps under the above two alkaline conditions was higher than that in the h2o2 addition tests which was in accordance with the scod and tscfas results in addition compared with the control test the fractions of doc increased by 17 3 and 1 6 respectively with the addition of ca oh 2 and h2o2 fig 2 a however the fraction of doc in s eps increased by 30 6 with the addition of cao2 compared with the control tests which was higher than the sum of the increments caused by ca oh 2 and h2o2 indicating a synergism of prolonged and contemporary basicity and oxidation effects on sludge solubilization generated by cao2 the lowest orp values with cao2 addition after 3 days digestion also revealed that sludge flocs were being more hydrolysed to simple monomers than the other tests fig s2 lee 2008 overall the prolonged period of alkaline condition generated by cao2 contributed significantly in continuous destruction of was and the oxidative environment caused by cao2 further enhanced flocs dissolution during hydrolysis step this synergistic effect may change the microbial community significantly which was confirmed by the following microbial community analysis 3 2 microbial community analysis 3 2 1 microbial diversity and microbe co existence network analysis the shannon index is one of the most commonly used indices for quantitatively accessing microbial diversity a larger shannon index shows higher diversity of the microbial community fig 3 a compares the shannon index of sludge samples taken on day 10 with the addition of cao2 and its hydrolysates the shannon index was the highest in the control tests indicating the best diversity while it declined regardless of the chemical treatments with the addition of ca oh 2 and naoh the shannon index decreased from 5 57 in the control test to 5 46 and 5 48 respectively it means that the alkaline condition would slightly reduce the microbial diversity with the drop percentage of 2 0 and 1 6 respectively however the influence was still significant p 0 0026 p 0 0056 liu et al 2016 also found that alkali pretreatment resulted in the extinction of some species the shannon index in the tests with h2o2 addition was 5 30 with the drop percentage of 4 8 compared with the control suggesting that the effect of oxidation on microbial diversity was stronger than that of the alkaline condition p 9 13 10 5 h2o2 was reported to be an effective biocide which can kill a portion of microorganisms by reacting with bacterial cell membranes and dna in aqueous solution simons et al 2012 the microbial diversity was the lowest 5 14 with cao2 addition with the drop percentage of 7 7 compared with the control tests p 1 46 10 5 this should be resulted from the combination of oxidative and alkaline conditions produced by cao2 and the oxidation contributed more than the alkaline condition in the reduction of microbial diversity to highlight the similarity and difference among sludge samples the microbe co existence network was constructed on otus level a network with 5 sample nodes and 1486 otu nodes was gained of all samples fig 3 b it can be seen from the distance between sample nodes that cao2 test was far from the others indicating a significant difference of microbial community caused by cao2 p 4 9 10 5 it was also apparent that the sample nodes in ca oh 2 and naoh tests were the closest revealing a high similarity of microbe composition between them and significant differences were also observed with the control tests p 4 04 10 5 p 3 64 10 5 the sample node of h2o2 tests was much closer to that of the control test than the other conditions suggesting a slighter influence of transient oxidation generated by h2o2 on microbe composition p 0 0051 therefore although h2o2 may kill a portion of microbes the habitat of microorganisms was not changed too much consequently the effect of alkaline condition was greater than that of oxidation in the change of microbial community structure by the addition of cao2 3 2 2 microbial composition bacterial communities determined at different taxonomic level were further investigated by comparing microbial populations and the main groups 2 at phylum class and order levels were presented in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the relative abundances of firmicutes bacteroidetes and saccharibacteria were all increased to a certain extent on phylum level after treatment with cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh they are important microorganisms in degrading various organic compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins to produce scfas guo et al 2015 regueiro et al 2012 and can be enriched at a rapid multiplication rate in a growth environment where soluble organic matter concentration is high kabisch et al 2014 comparing the increments of these three microorganisms under different chemical treatments cao2 was the most effective chemical in enhancing their relative abundances compared with the control test the total increment was 24 5 with the addition of cao2 followed by ca oh 2 addition tests 15 3 and naoh addition tests 9 1 and the increment was the lowest with the addition of h2o2 5 3 this sequence is consistent with the sequence of organic concentration shown in figs 1 and 2 as a result of the enrichment in high scod by chemical treatments the abundance of firmicutes bacteroidetes and saccharibacteria were greatly enriched leading to distinct tscfas accumulation further analysis revealed that clostridia was the most enriched class in firmicutes phylum fig 4 b and clostridiales was the most enriched order affiliated to clostridia class fig 4 c the relative abundance of clostridiales in the control cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh tests were 0 86 15 98 2 75 4 32 and 3 69 respectively in bacteroidetes phylum bacteroidia and bacteroidales were the main enriched microbial populations at class and order levels respectively the relatively abundance of them were improved by 1 7 4 5 times with cao2 addition compared with those in its hydrolysate addition tests clostridiales and bacteroidales are well known for their capacity to hydrolyse a wide range of substrates and performing in the acidogenic process to produce scfas guo et al 2015 regueiro et al 2012 vanwonterghem et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 a proteobacteria was also one of the main microorganisms in all samples which included betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria on class level fig 4 b distinct relative abundances of proteobacteria were observed with different chemical treatments it was decreased from 39 9 in the control to 31 3 with the addition of cao2 however the relative abundances of proteobacteria kept constant with ca oh 2 and naoh addition while it was increased to 46 8 with the addition of h2o2 that was because neutral ph was preferred in the growth condition of proteobacteria brenner et al 2005 it is reported that proteobacteria is one of the important consumers of scfas such as acetate propionate butyrate etc ariesyady et al 2007 the decrease in relative abundance of proteobacteria was also one of the reasons that more tscfas could accumulate in cao2 addition test furthermore the correlations among ph value the average ph during the first 10 days shannon index and microbial communities of all samples were determined in order to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on microorganisms the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated on phylum level for the relative abundance of top 20 phyla fig 5 gracilibacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae verrucomicrobia acidobacteria and spirochaetae also showed negative correlations with ph value according to their growth conditions brenner et al 2005 besides proteobacteria meanwhile bacteroidetes firmicutes and saccharibacteria correlated positively to ph which were the main acidogenic microorganisms aforementioned this confirmed that the higher tscfas production was mainly due to the prolonged alkaline time with the addition of cao2 there is a negative correlation between shannon index and ph value fig 5 confirming that the decrease of shannon index was synergistic effects of high ph value and strong oxidative condition significant negative correlations to shannon index were shown for firmicutes and saccharibacteria indicating that they became dominant populations with the lower microbial diversity in cao2 addition test 3 3 metagenomic analysis 3 3 1 functional classification and metabolic pathway in the metabolism category the gene hits of amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in cao2 tests was most abundant compared with other treatment test fig s5 they were important paths for hydrolysis and scfas production during ad process huang et al 2018 therefore hydrolysis and scfas related pathways such as amino acid metabolism citrate cycle fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation as well as glycolysis were also greatly enhanced with cao2 addition fig s6 in this study the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis ko00061 with different chemical treatments was further analysed it was found that 22 nodes including 26 kinds of homologous genes were annotated in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway fig s7 and the relative abundance of genes belonging to this pathway was significantly different in each studied metagenome the kegg orthology ko number and the description of homologous genes are shown in table s3 it is known that synthetase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase are all important enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis process in addition to biosynthesizing fatty acid lpxc fabz was also a kind of hydrolases acting on c n and lyases acting on c o heath and rock 1996 which can effectively hydrolyse macromolecular substances during anaerobic fermentation what s more mch was a hydrolase acting on ester bonds as can be seen from fig s8 the relative abundances of these hydrolases were significantly enhanced with cao2 addition compared with other treatment tests p 0 05 table s4 in addition other hydrolysis enzymes such as lysozyme and protease were also promoted by cao2 fig s9 fig s10 which was in accordance with the scod concentrations in the previous section the genes fas fabh faby corresponded to critical synthetases involving in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism they were also a part of acyltransferases which play important roles in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway james et al 1992 yanqiu et al 2012 it was found that fabk fabv fab2 and desa2 were all oxidoreductases and fabk and fabv acted on the ch ch group of donors with nad or nadp as acceptor marrakchi et al 2003 tucci and martin 2007 while fab2 and desa2 were acted on paired donors with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen kachroo et al 2007 in addition acsl was an acyl coa synthetase and also involved in cell growth and death the relative abundances of all the above genes were the highest with the addition of cao2 moreover of the 20 genes only fas1 fabl and acsbg showed significant decrease with cao2 addition fig s8 acetyl coa carboxylase ec 6 4 1 2 was a very important node in ko00061 which corresponds to six homologous genes acca accb accc accd bcca accd6 among them the relative abundances of acca accb and accc were at a high level and they were higher in cao2 addition tests than in other tests fig 6 p 0 05 suggesting cao2 can effectively promote these acetyl coa carboxylase genes the relative abundance of accd was slightly reduced with all chemical treatments but it was also higher with cao2 addition than with cao2 hydrolysates treatment it was reported that acca accb accc and accd participated in carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism and lipid metabolism in metabolic modules and acca and accd can generate c c bond while accc can generate c c and c h bond in connection modules bilder et al 2006 as for bcca and accd6 their relative abundances were significantly decreased after chemical treatments and lower values were observed in cao2 addition and h2o2 addition tests it can be deduced that these two genes were sensitive to oxidative conditions however the relative abundance of bcca and accd6 were at lower level compared with other acetyl coa carboxylase thus their contributions were relatively lower than the others krivoruchko et al 2015 reported that major substrates such as carbohydrates proteins and fats were degraded by a common metabolic pathway by acetyl coa and it is also a precursor substance of fatty acid production in addition as shown in the ko00061 pathway acetyl coa carboxylase was one of the most important nodes which connected with other pathways such as citrate cycle pyruvate metabolism and β alanine metabolism overall these results suggest that cao2 can effectively improve the relative abundance of acca accb accc while lighten the decrease in accd thus promoting the production of scfas and its related metabolic pathways focusing on the ko00061 pathway it was observed that the ratios of enhanced genes compared to the control were 53 8 23 1 26 9 and 30 8 with the addition of cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh respectively specific genes were listed in table s5 in the cao2 addition test the relative abundance of 14 genes table s5 were the highest compared with those in other tests the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 was redrawn based on the above analysis fig 7 the nodes with yellow background represent genes promoted greatly with cao2 addition it can be obviously seen from fig 7 that the genes promoted by cao2 distributed in each branch of this pathway which may be due to the prevalent number of acidogenic microorganisms aforementioned the oxidative stress caused by cao2 could lead cells to counteract the oxidant effects and restore the redox balance by activation or silencing of genes encoding defensive enzymes transcription factors and structural proteins birben et al 2012 it will also induce dna alteration and expression of several genes involved in signal transduction by upregulation of redox sensitive transcription factors birben et al 2012 cabiscol et al 2000 in summary a great majority of fatty acid synthase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase was enhanced by cao2 in ko00061 pathway thereby promoting the hydrolysis and the following degradation processes this explains the superiority of cao2 treatment during ad process in the functional traits at genetic level 3 3 2 carbohydrate active enzymes the sludge samples exhibited distinct functional profiles when encoding the sequencing dataset to carbohydrate active enzymes glycoside hydrolases ghs glycosyl transferases gts polysaccharide lyases pls carbohydrate esterases ces and carbohydrate binding modules cbms were included in the cazymes database as shown in fig s11 significant improvement was observed for cbms and ghs in cao2 addition tests p 0 05 thus detailed analysis was conducted on the enzymes of these two families cbms are known to potentiate the activity of many enzyme activities by targeting to and promoting a prolonged interaction with the substrate cantarel et al 2009 among the top 9 functional enzyme families based on their abundance cao2 can significantly promote 7 kinds of them compared to cao2 hydrolysates p 0 05 which were cbm44 cbm50 cbm32 cbm40 cbm48 cbm9 and cbm67 table 1 the cbm44 of clostridium thermocellum enzyme has been demonstrated to bind cellulose and xyloglucan equally well shabir et al 2006 while cbm32 was found to bind lacnac β d galactosyl 1 4 β d n acetylglucosamine with n acetylglucosaminidase from clostridium perfingens cbm50 was attached to various enzymes from families gh18 gh19 gh23 gh24 gh25 and gh73 which were enzymes cleaving either chitin or peptidoglycan takayuki et al 2008 it was also found in a multitude of other enzymes targeting the petidoglycan such as peptidases and amidases cbm40 was recognized at the n terminus and the β propeller of gh33 sialidases ibrahim et al 2004 cbm48 has glycogen binding function which appended to gh13 modules it was also found in the beta subunit glycogen binding of amp activated protein kinases ampk cbm9 was known as cellulose binding domain family which was only found in xylanases zui et al 2013 disclosed that there was l rhamnose binding activity of the cbm67 ghs include glycosidases and transglycosidases which respond for hydrolysis or transglycosylation of glycosidic bonds gh coding genes present in the vast majority of genomes corresponding to almost half of the enzymes classified in cazymes which has vital importance for biotechnological application cantarel et al 2009 it was similar with cbms family that 7 kinds of functional enzyme families were greatly enhanced by cao2 compared to cao2 hydrolysates among the top 9 ghs families p 0 05 table 1 gh24 gh19 and gh73 were all related to lysozyme which was also known as cytosolic enzyme or n acetyl serotonin hydrolase the insoluble mucopolysaccharide in the cell wall can be transformed to soluble glycopeptide by destroying the β 1 4 glycosidic bond between n acetylmuramic acid and n acetyl with lysozyme therefore the intracellular substances can be released due to cell lysis this result suggests that cao2 can effectively promote the function of lysozyme with cell lysis and intracellular substances release which was more benefit in cell disintegration and carbohydrate hydrolysis in addition gh74 includes endoglucanase oligoxyloglucan reducing end specific cellobiohydrolase and xyloglucanase gh109 was α n acetylgalactosaminidase which display an unusual mechanism involving nad liu et al 2007 hydrolases were included in gh13 and gh33 stam et al 2006 they can hydrolyse glucoside bonds and destroy cell structure which are indispensable functional enzymes in the carbohydrate metabolism of microorganisms different environmental conditions may cause different physiological responses of microorganisms the synergistic effect caused by cao2 resulting in change of cellular metabolism and up regulation of associated enzymes the promotion of these ghs by cao2 further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing microbial metabolism compared to other chemical treatments based on the correspondence between microorganisms and functional traits microbial contribution to a particular function can be performed according to correlation analysis the microbial contribution analysis phylum level for the top 9 cbms and ghs was shown in fig 8 distinct dominant phylum was observed in different functional enzymes as shown in fig 8 a the contribution of bacteroidetes was dominant in cbm44 cbm32 cbm40 cbm66 cbm9 cbm67 and cbm37 whereas proteobacteria has the biggest contribution in cbm50 and cbm48 further analysis for the differences in microbial contribution under different chemical treatments reveals that the contribution of bacteroidetes in cao2 tests was the highest among cbm44 cbm50 cbm32 cbm40 cbm66 cbm9 cbm67 81 1 32 3 66 4 44 4 51 5 47 6 58 2 respectively compared with the control and other treatment tests this confirmed that cao2 significantly increased the relative abundance of bacteroidetes thus increasing the contribution of functional enzymes related to it in addition the contributions of firmicutes in cbm32 were 2 81 3 69 2 58 3 0 and 2 73 in the control cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh tests respectively and they were 2 12 6 63 2 42 2 40 and 2 77 in cbm48 firmicutes was also one of the important acidifying microorganisms which has been significantly promoted by cao2 however the dominant microorganisms in ghs functional enzymes were different from the cbms family fig 8 b besides bacteroidetes and proteobacteria chlorobi also has great contributions in gh74 and gh33 these results provide genetic evidence of cazymes microbial microbiome function in the anaerobic fermentation with different chemical treatments at ambient temperature 4 conclusions during the anaerobic fermentation process of was with the addition of cao2 at ambient temperature the prolonged period of alkaline condition generated from cao2 contributed significantly to the continuous destruction of was and the oxidative environment caused by cao2 further enhanced flocs dissolution during the hydrolysis stage oxidation contributed more than the alkaline condition in the decline of microbial diversity while the effect of alkaline condition was greater than that of oxidation in the change of microbial community structure 3 kinds of high abundance acetyl coa carboxylase genes and 11 kinds of synthetase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase genes promoted by cao2 were distributed throughout all branches of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 cbms and ghs were the top two cazymes improved by cao2 addition cao2 can effectively promote the function of lysozyme and the metabolism of xyloglucan chitin peptidoglycan galactose lactose rhamnose dextran important acidifying microorganisms bacteroidetes and firmicutes which were significantly promoted by cao2 contributed greatly in the enhanced cbms and

18274,this study investigated the chemical and genetic mechanisms of anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge was with cao2 addition at ambient temperature the microbial community structures key microorganisms functional profiles and related carbohydrate active enzymes were further revealed according to metagenomic sequencing combining with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results showed that the prolonged period of alkaline condition generated from cao2 contributed significantly to the continuous destruction of was and the oxidative environment caused by cao2 further enhanced flocs dissolution this synergistic effect also significantly changed the microbial community oxidation contributed more than the alkaline condition to the decline of microbial diversity while the effect of alkaline condition was greater than that of oxidation in the change of microbial community structure the key enhanced genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis pathways with cao2 addition were highlighted three kinds of high abundance acetyl coa carboxylase genes and eleven kinds of synthetase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase genes promoted by cao2 were distributed throughout each branch of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 moreover carbohydrate binding modules cbms and glycoside hydrolases ghs were the top two carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes improved by cao2 addition cao2 can also effectively promote the function of lysozyme and the metabolism of several monosaccharides this work provides a deep insight into the advantage of cao2 in promoting sludge solubilization and acidification at the genetic levels thus expanding the application of cao2 in sludge treatment and resource recovery graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic fermentation waste activated sludge was calcium peroxide cao2 metagenomic carbohydrate active enzymes ambient temperature 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the by product from biological wastewater treatment process which is an complex heterogeneous substance consisting of organic residues bacterial cells inorganic particles heavy metals colloids etc anjum et al 2016 the amount of was is expected to increase continuously due to the increase in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china it is predicted that about 43 million tons of was 80 moisture content will be generated in 2020 yan 2017 anaerobic digestion ad is an effective stabilization treatment process for was which can produce renewable resource such as short chain fatty acids scfas and energy such as methane scfas can be used as external carbon sources for polyhydroxyalkanoates phas biosynthesis as well as for denitrification to achieve satisfactory biological nutrient removal efficiency ji and chen 2010 scfas are also potential treasures with multifaceted applications in the synthesis of biofuels and bioproducts fasahati and liu 2014 it is well known that hydrolysis was the rate limiting step in ad process due to the complex floc structure of was thus various pretreatment methods chemical thermal mechanical electrochemical biological and so on have been conducted to enhance sludge hydrolysis before digestion anjum et al 2016 carrere et al 2010 zhen et al 2017 in recent years there has been an increasing interest in the addition of cao2 when treating was during ad process li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 wang and li 2016 xu et al 2018 fermenting was with cao2 addition is a preferable technology for scfas accumulation and sludge reduction li et al 2015 several researchers have identified that cao2 can effectively destruct the extracellular polymeric substances eps and cell walls therefore enhancing the hydrolysis of protein and polysaccharide with higher scfas production li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 in addition cao2 can also help to degrade micropollutants adsorbed on was zhang et al 2015a zheng et al 2019 our recent research ping et al 2018 found that significant improvement in scfas production was achieved with cao2 addition during anaerobic fermentation process of was at ambient temperature this provides an energy saving technology for was treatment and resource recovery therefore it is of interest to further explore the chemical and microbial mechanisms of anaerobic fermentation process at ambient temperature with cao2 addition so as to provide a scientific basis for optimizing this process when dissolved in water cao2 can be slowly hydrolysed to release h2o2 and ca oh 2 controllably via the reactions shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 cao2 2h2o h2o2 ca oh 2 2 2cao2 2h2o o2 2ca oh 2 as one of the commonly alkaline agents ca oh 2 has been used for was fermentation at different temperatures li et al 2014a su et al 2013 and the highest scfas yield was observed at 35 c li et al 2014a h2o2 is a strong chemical oxidant that can destroy the cell walls of microorganism which leads to the release of cytoplasm and improves the solubility of sludge wang et al 2009 in addition naoh was the most commonly used agent for alkaline sludge treatment yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b the type of alkaline agents impacts significantly on was hydrolysis and acidification li et al 2011 demonstrated that the use of ca oh 2 had almost the same effect on scfas production and sludge volatile suspended solids vss reduction as that of naoh but su et al 2013 reported that scfas production with the addition of ca oh 2 was lower than that with naoh addition during the anaerobic fermentation of was in the sludge anaerobic digester as cao2 releases ca oh 2 slowly the alkaline habitat is different from that with the addition of ca oh 2 directly this should be further clarified microbial communities play a central role in organic carbon degradation and energy transfer in ad process determining the function of microorganisms in a complex community is one of the great challenges 16s rrna gene and other marker gene sequencing have been previously applied to investigate the microbial community structure in ad system when treating with cao2 li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 xu et al 2018 however it is reported that traditional approaches based on 16s rrna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization are not able to completely reveal the whole microbial community structure due to the extremely high complexity and overwhelming genetic diversities in ad sludge guo et al 2015 the development of metagenomics allows the identification of genes and functional enzymes participating in related activities cai et al 2018 guo et al 2015 which can provide new insights into the mechanism of scfas biosynthesis process with cao2 addition kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions and kegg pathway database contains graphical representations of metabolism membrane transport signal transduction and cell cycle kanehisa and goto 2000 carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes participate in many important biological processes including cell wall synthesis signalling and energy production during anaerobic fermentation and cazymes database is the most comprehensive repository of cazymes which provides rich sets of curated information about all groups of cazymes cantarel et al 2009 however so far little effort has been dedicated to analyse the functional traits of scfas biosynthesis pathway and cazymes during anaerobic fermentation particularly the association between chemical treatments and scfas related functions remains obscure to the best of our knowledge the key genes and enzymes which were enhanced by cao2 addition for scfas production are still unknown therefore in order to well understand the acidification mechanism during anaerobic fermentation at ambient temperature with cao2 addition it is necessary to comprehensively investigate the roles of cao2 and its hydrolysates h2o2 and ca oh 2 during the hydrolysis and acidogenic stages at the genetic and functional levels this study is a continuation of the previous work aiming to further elucidate the chemical and biological mechanisms for enhancing scfas production during anaerobic fermentation at ambient temperature of was with cao2 addition in order to dissect the chemical mechanism cao2 hydrolysates such as h2o2 and ca oh 2 were added equivalently to cao2 addition during the anaerobic fermentation of was in order to reveal the genetic mechanism the microbial community structures key microorganisms functional profiles and related cazymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were further explored specifically the key enhanced genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis pathways with cao2 addition were highlighted the metagenomic sequencing combining with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was applied for microbial community analysis at both taxonomic and genetic levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of the was the was was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank in a sewage treatment plant in shanghai china a 1 mm 1 mm screen was used to filter the sludge and then the was was concentrated by settling for about 24 h at 4 c the main

experimental procedure glass serum bottles 600 ml containing 450 ml of was were used for batch anaerobic fermentation tests all bottles were purged with nitrogen gas for oxygen removal after the addition of was in order to identify the effect of cao2 hydrolysates ca oh 2 and h2o2 were added separately and naoh was added to further determine the effect of ph the doses of ca oh 2 0 05 g g vss and naoh 0 09 g g vss were obtained in preliminary experiments based on the same initial ph value created by 0 2 g cao2 g vss according to the stoichiometric relationship shown in eq 1 0 2 g cao2 g vss would release 0 096 g h2o2 g vss therefore cao2 0 2 g g vss h2o2 0 096 g g vss ca oh 2 0 05 g g vss and naoh 0 09 g g vss were added to the sludge respectively in four sets of test the control tests were performed without addition of any chemical agent the bottles were then immediately capped with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 200 rpm at ambient temperature 20 1 c sludge

crucial factor affecting the digestion performance although the initial ph was same around 9 5 with the addition of cao2 ca oh 2 or naoh the duration of alkaline condition was significantly different with the addition of ca oh 2 and naoh ph quickly dropped from 9 5 to 7 9 and 7 2 respectively on the first day fig 1 c naoh can be easily dissolved in water with the solubility of 113 g at 25 c while ca oh 2 has a lower solubility of 0 16 g at 25 c su et al 2013 the ph in cao2 addition test was above 8 0 within the first 5 days and then slowly recovered to neutral in 11 days fig 1 c cao2 was slightly soluble in water where it continued to release h2o2 and ca oh 2 during dissolution lu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the ph variation indicates that oh along with reactive oxygen species ros such as oh o2 could be slowly and continuously released during fermentation of was zhang et al 2015a 2018 zheng et al 2019 ros are highly reactive molecules and will damage cell structures such as dna rna and cell membrane birben et al 2012 continuous oxidative stress with membrane damage can eventually lead to cell lysis demple 1991 both alkaline and oxidative condition could enhance the solubilization of sludge flocs as a result scod and tscfas production increased continuously during the fermentation process 20 days with cao2 addition fig 1 a and b which was in accordance with our previous research ping et al 2018 however the variation trend was different with addition of cao2 hydrolysates with the addition of naoh or ca oh 2 the scod and tscfas continued to increase within the initial 3 5 days and then decreased due to ch4 production it can be seen from fig 1 d that the ch4 accumulation was the highest with naoh addition followed by ca oh 2 addition whereas it was inhibited with the addition of cao2 this is because appropriate alkaline pretreatment could increase ch4 accumulation zhang et al 2015b however methanogenesis was significantly inhibited by cao2 p 0 05 since the higher ph for a longer time li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 there were only slight increases in scod and tscfas production with the addition of h2o2 compared with the control test this may because the excessive disproportionation and decomposition loss of liquid h2o2 northup and cassidy 2008 xue et al 2016 in addition high concentration of h2o2 would function as a disinfectant and lead to a negative impact on microbial activity li et al 2014b compared with liquid h2o2 the h2o2 liberated from cao2 can be auto regulated by the slow dissolution rate northup and cassidy 2008 therefore maintaining continuous oxidation for sludge solubilization it can be seen from fig s2 that the orp in cao2 tests was relatively higher than that in h2o2 tests after 1 day digestion due to the longer period of alkaline and oxidative environment generated by the contemporary generation of ca oh 2 and h2o2 with cao2 addition the concentrations of scod and tscfas produced in the cao2 addition test were about 4 2 fold and 3 4 fold higher than those produced in sole alkaline or oxidative treatment tests on day 20 in addition the proportion of acetic acid greatly increased with cao2 addition fig s3 which was consistent with the study of li et al 2015 who proved that cao2 was conducive to the transformation of other scfas to acetic acid the fractions of doc polysaccharides and proteins in eps were further studied for each test on the first day as shown in fig 2 the fraction of these organic compounds in s eps were significantly promoted in cao2 addition tests compared to those in other chemical addition tests indicating a faster solubilization of sludge flocs and the following release of polysaccharides and proteins fig 2 b and c fig s4 the release of organic compounds from tb eps to s eps with the addition of ca oh 2 was slightly higher than that in the naoh addition tests and the fraction of those organic matters in s eps under the above two alkaline conditions was higher than that in the h2o2 addition tests which was in accordance with the scod and tscfas results in addition compared with the control test the fractions of doc increased by 17 3 and 1 6 respectively with the addition of ca oh 2 and h2o2 fig 2 a however the fraction of doc in s eps increased by 30 6 with the addition of cao2 compared with the control tests which was higher than the sum of the increments caused by ca oh 2 and h2o2 indicating a synergism of prolonged and contemporary basicity and oxidation effects on sludge solubilization generated by cao2 the lowest orp values with cao2 addition after 3 days digestion also revealed that sludge flocs were being more hydrolysed to simple monomers than the other tests fig s2 lee 2008 overall the prolonged period of alkaline condition generated by cao2 contributed significantly in continuous destruction of was and the oxidative environment caused by cao2 further enhanced flocs dissolution during hydrolysis step this synergistic effect may change the microbial community significantly which was confirmed by the following microbial community analysis 3 2 microbial community analysis 3 2 1 microbial diversity and microbe co existence network analysis the shannon index is one of the most commonly used indices for quantitatively accessing microbial diversity a larger shannon index shows higher diversity of the microbial community fig 3 a compares the shannon index of sludge samples taken on day 10 with the addition of cao2 and its hydrolysates the shannon index was the highest in the control tests indicating the best diversity while it declined regardless of the chemical treatments with the addition of ca oh 2 and naoh the shannon index decreased from 5 57 in the control test to 5 46 and 5 48 respectively it means that the alkaline condition would slightly reduce the microbial diversity with the drop percentage of 2 0 and 1 6 respectively however the influence was still significant p 0 0026 p 0 0056 liu et al 2016 also found that alkali pretreatment resulted in the extinction of some species the shannon index in the tests with h2o2 addition was 5 30 with the drop percentage of 4 8 compared with the control suggesting that the effect of oxidation on microbial diversity was stronger than that of the alkaline condition p 9 13 10 5 h2o2 was reported to be an effective biocide which can kill a portion of microorganisms by reacting with bacterial cell membranes and dna in aqueous solution simons et al 2012 the microbial diversity was the lowest 5 14 with cao2 addition with the drop percentage of 7 7 compared with the control tests p 1 46 10 5 this should be resulted from the combination of oxidative and alkaline conditions produced by cao2 and the oxidation contributed more than the alkaline condition in the reduction of microbial diversity to highlight the similarity and difference among sludge samples the microbe co existence network was constructed on otus level a network with 5 sample nodes and 1486 otu nodes was gained of all samples fig 3 b it can be seen from the distance between sample nodes that cao2 test was far from the others indicating a significant difference of microbial community caused by cao2 p 4 9 10 5 it was also apparent that the sample nodes in ca oh 2 and naoh tests were the closest revealing a high similarity of microbe composition between them and significant differences were also observed with the control tests p 4 04 10 5 p 3 64 10 5 the sample node of h2o2 tests was much closer to that of the control test than the other conditions suggesting a slighter influence of transient oxidation generated by h2o2 on microbe composition p 0 0051 therefore although h2o2 may kill a portion of microbes the habitat of microorganisms was not changed too much consequently the effect of alkaline condition was greater than that of oxidation in the change of microbial community structure by the addition of cao2 3 2 2 microbial composition bacterial communities determined at different taxonomic level were further investigated by comparing microbial populations and the main groups 2 at phylum class and order levels were presented in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the relative abundances of firmicutes bacteroidetes and saccharibacteria were all increased to a certain extent on phylum level after treatment with cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh they are important microorganisms in degrading various organic compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins to produce scfas guo et al 2015 regueiro et al 2012 and can be enriched at a rapid multiplication rate in a growth environment where soluble organic matter concentration is high kabisch et al 2014 comparing the increments of these three microorganisms under different chemical treatments cao2 was the most effective chemical in enhancing their relative abundances compared with the control test the total increment was 24 5 with the addition of cao2 followed by ca oh 2 addition tests 15 3 and naoh addition tests 9 1 and the increment was the lowest with the addition of h2o2 5 3 this sequence is consistent with the sequence of organic concentration shown in figs 1 and 2 as a result of the enrichment in high scod by chemical treatments the abundance of firmicutes bacteroidetes and saccharibacteria were greatly enriched leading to distinct tscfas accumulation further analysis revealed that clostridia was the most enriched class in firmicutes phylum fig 4 b and clostridiales was the most enriched order affiliated to clostridia class fig 4 c the relative abundance of clostridiales in the control cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh tests were 0 86 15 98 2 75 4 32 and 3 69 respectively in bacteroidetes phylum bacteroidia and bacteroidales were the main enriched microbial populations at class and order levels respectively the relatively abundance of them were improved by 1 7 4 5 times with cao2 addition compared with those in its hydrolysate addition tests clostridiales and bacteroidales are well known for their capacity to hydrolyse a wide range of substrates and performing in the acidogenic process to produce scfas guo et al 2015 regueiro et al 2012 vanwonterghem et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 a proteobacteria was also one of the main microorganisms in all samples which included betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria on class level fig 4 b distinct relative abundances of proteobacteria were observed with different chemical treatments it was decreased from 39 9 in the control to 31 3 with the addition of cao2 however the relative abundances of proteobacteria kept constant with ca oh 2 and naoh addition while it was increased to 46 8 with the addition of h2o2 that was because neutral ph was preferred in the growth condition of proteobacteria brenner et al 2005 it is reported that proteobacteria is one of the important consumers of scfas such as acetate propionate butyrate etc ariesyady et al 2007 the decrease in relative abundance of proteobacteria was also one of the reasons that more tscfas could accumulate in cao2 addition test furthermore the correlations among ph value the average ph during the first 10 days shannon index and microbial communities of all samples were determined in order to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on microorganisms the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated on phylum level for the relative abundance of top 20 phyla fig 5 gracilibacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae verrucomicrobia acidobacteria and spirochaetae also showed negative correlations with ph value according to their growth conditions brenner et al 2005 besides proteobacteria meanwhile bacteroidetes firmicutes and saccharibacteria correlated positively to ph which were the main acidogenic microorganisms aforementioned this confirmed that the higher tscfas production was mainly due to the prolonged alkaline time with the addition of cao2 there is a negative correlation between shannon index and ph value fig 5 confirming that the decrease of shannon index was synergistic effects of high ph value and strong oxidative condition significant negative correlations to shannon index were shown for firmicutes and saccharibacteria indicating that they became dominant populations with the lower microbial diversity in cao2 addition test 3 3 metagenomic analysis 3 3 1 functional classification and metabolic pathway in the metabolism category the gene hits of amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in cao2 tests was most abundant compared with other treatment test fig s5 they were important paths for hydrolysis and scfas production during ad process huang et al 2018 therefore hydrolysis and scfas related pathways such as amino acid metabolism citrate cycle fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation as well as glycolysis were also greatly enhanced with cao2 addition fig s6 in this study the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis ko00061 with different chemical treatments was further analysed it was found that 22 nodes including 26 kinds of homologous genes were annotated in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway fig s7 and the relative abundance of genes belonging to this pathway was significantly different in each studied metagenome the kegg orthology ko number and the description of homologous genes are shown in table s3 it is known that synthetase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase are all important enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis process in addition to biosynthesizing fatty acid lpxc fabz was also a kind of hydrolases acting on c n and lyases acting on c o heath and rock 1996 which can effectively hydrolyse macromolecular substances during anaerobic fermentation what s more mch was a hydrolase acting on ester bonds as can be seen from fig s8 the relative abundances of these hydrolases were significantly enhanced with cao2 addition compared with other treatment tests p 0 05 table s4 in addition other hydrolysis enzymes such as lysozyme and protease were also promoted by cao2 fig s9 fig s10 which was in accordance with the scod concentrations in the previous section the genes fas fabh faby corresponded to critical synthetases involving in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism they were also a part of acyltransferases which play important roles in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway james et al 1992 yanqiu et al 2012 it was found that fabk fabv fab2 and desa2 were all oxidoreductases and fabk and fabv acted on the ch ch group of donors with nad or nadp as acceptor marrakchi et al 2003 tucci and martin 2007 while fab2 and desa2 were acted on paired donors with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen kachroo et al 2007 in addition acsl was an acyl coa synthetase and also involved in cell growth and death the relative abundances of all the above genes were the highest with the addition of cao2 moreover of the 20 genes only fas1 fabl and acsbg showed significant decrease with cao2 addition fig s8 acetyl coa carboxylase ec 6 4 1 2 was a very important node in ko00061 which corresponds to six homologous genes acca accb accc accd bcca accd6 among them the relative abundances of acca accb and accc were at a high level and they were higher in cao2 addition tests than in other tests fig 6 p 0 05 suggesting cao2 can effectively promote these acetyl coa carboxylase genes the relative abundance of accd was slightly reduced with all chemical treatments but it was also higher with cao2 addition than with cao2 hydrolysates treatment it was reported that acca accb accc and accd participated in carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism and lipid metabolism in metabolic modules and acca and accd can generate c c bond while accc can generate c c and c h bond in connection modules bilder et al 2006 as for bcca and accd6 their relative abundances were significantly decreased after chemical treatments and lower values were observed in cao2 addition and h2o2 addition tests it can be deduced that these two genes were sensitive to oxidative conditions however the relative abundance of bcca and accd6 were at lower level compared with other acetyl coa carboxylase thus their contributions were relatively lower than the others krivoruchko et al 2015 reported that major substrates such as carbohydrates proteins and fats were degraded by a common metabolic pathway by acetyl coa and it is also a precursor substance of fatty acid production in addition as shown in the ko00061 pathway acetyl coa carboxylase was one of the most important nodes which connected with other pathways such as citrate cycle pyruvate metabolism and β alanine metabolism overall these results suggest that cao2 can effectively improve the relative abundance of acca accb accc while lighten the decrease in accd thus promoting the production of scfas and its related metabolic pathways focusing on the ko00061 pathway it was observed that the ratios of enhanced genes compared to the control were 53 8 23 1 26 9 and 30 8 with the addition of cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh respectively specific genes were listed in table s5 in the cao2 addition test the relative abundance of 14 genes table s5 were the highest compared with those in other tests the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 was redrawn based on the above analysis fig 7 the nodes with yellow background represent genes promoted greatly with cao2 addition it can be obviously seen from fig 7 that the genes promoted by cao2 distributed in each branch of this pathway which may be due to the prevalent number of acidogenic microorganisms aforementioned the oxidative stress caused by cao2 could lead cells to counteract the oxidant effects and restore the redox balance by activation or silencing of genes encoding defensive enzymes transcription factors and structural proteins birben et al 2012 it will also induce dna alteration and expression of several genes involved in signal transduction by upregulation of redox sensitive transcription factors birben et al 2012 cabiscol et al 2000 in summary a great majority of fatty acid synthase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase was enhanced by cao2 in ko00061 pathway thereby promoting the hydrolysis and the following degradation processes this explains the superiority of cao2 treatment during ad process in the functional traits at genetic level 3 3 2 carbohydrate active enzymes the sludge samples exhibited distinct functional profiles when encoding the sequencing dataset to carbohydrate active enzymes glycoside hydrolases ghs glycosyl transferases gts polysaccharide lyases pls carbohydrate esterases ces and carbohydrate binding modules cbms were included in the cazymes database as shown in fig s11 significant improvement was observed for cbms and ghs in cao2 addition tests p 0 05 thus detailed analysis was conducted on the enzymes of these two families cbms are known to potentiate the activity of many enzyme activities by targeting to and promoting a prolonged interaction with the substrate cantarel et al 2009 among the top 9 functional enzyme families based on their abundance cao2 can significantly promote 7 kinds of them compared to cao2 hydrolysates p 0 05 which were cbm44 cbm50 cbm32 cbm40 cbm48 cbm9 and cbm67 table 1 the cbm44 of clostridium thermocellum enzyme has been demonstrated to bind cellulose and xyloglucan equally well shabir et al 2006 while cbm32 was found to bind lacnac β d galactosyl 1 4 β d n acetylglucosamine with n acetylglucosaminidase from clostridium perfingens cbm50 was attached to various enzymes from families gh18 gh19 gh23 gh24 gh25 and gh73 which were enzymes cleaving either chitin or peptidoglycan takayuki et al 2008 it was also found in a multitude of other enzymes targeting the petidoglycan such as peptidases and amidases cbm40 was recognized at the n terminus and the β propeller of gh33 sialidases ibrahim et al 2004 cbm48 has glycogen binding function which appended to gh13 modules it was also found in the beta subunit glycogen binding of amp activated protein kinases ampk cbm9 was known as cellulose binding domain family which was only found in xylanases zui et al 2013 disclosed that there was l rhamnose binding activity of the cbm67 ghs include glycosidases and transglycosidases which respond for hydrolysis or transglycosylation of glycosidic bonds gh coding genes present in the vast majority of genomes corresponding to almost half of the enzymes classified in cazymes which has vital importance for biotechnological application cantarel et al 2009 it was similar with cbms family that 7 kinds of functional enzyme families were greatly enhanced by cao2 compared to cao2 hydrolysates among the top 9 ghs families p 0 05 table 1 gh24 gh19 and gh73 were all related to lysozyme which was also known as cytosolic enzyme or n acetyl serotonin hydrolase the insoluble mucopolysaccharide in the cell wall can be transformed to soluble glycopeptide by destroying the β 1 4 glycosidic bond between n acetylmuramic acid and n acetyl with lysozyme therefore the intracellular substances can be released due to cell lysis this result suggests that cao2 can effectively promote the function of lysozyme with cell lysis and intracellular substances release which was more benefit in cell disintegration and carbohydrate hydrolysis in addition gh74 includes endoglucanase oligoxyloglucan reducing end specific cellobiohydrolase and xyloglucanase gh109 was α n acetylgalactosaminidase which display an unusual mechanism involving nad liu et al 2007 hydrolases were included in gh13 and gh33 stam et al 2006 they can hydrolyse glucoside bonds and destroy cell structure which are indispensable functional enzymes in the carbohydrate metabolism of microorganisms different environmental conditions may cause different physiological responses of microorganisms the synergistic effect caused by cao2 resulting in change of cellular metabolism and up regulation of associated enzymes the promotion of these ghs by cao2 further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing microbial metabolism compared to other chemical treatments based on the correspondence between microorganisms and functional traits microbial contribution to a particular function can be performed according to correlation analysis the microbial contribution analysis phylum level for the top 9 cbms and ghs was shown in fig 8 distinct dominant phylum was observed in different functional enzymes as shown in fig 8 a the contribution of bacteroidetes was dominant in cbm44 cbm32 cbm40 cbm66 cbm9 cbm67 and cbm37 whereas proteobacteria has the biggest contribution in cbm50 and cbm48 further analysis for the differences in microbial contribution under different chemical treatments reveals that the contribution of bacteroidetes in cao2 tests was the highest among cbm44 cbm50 cbm32 cbm40 cbm66 cbm9 cbm67 81 1 32 3 66 4 44 4 51 5 47 6 58 2 respectively compared with the control and other treatment tests this confirmed that cao2 significantly increased the relative abundance of bacteroidetes thus increasing the contribution of functional enzymes related to it in addition the contributions of firmicutes in cbm32 were 2 81 3 69 2 58 3 0 and 2 73 in the control cao2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and naoh tests respectively and they were 2 12 6 63 2 42 2 40 and 2 77 in cbm48 firmicutes was also one of the important acidifying microorganisms which has been significantly promoted by cao2 however the dominant microorganisms in ghs functional enzymes were different from the cbms family fig 8 b besides bacteroidetes and proteobacteria chlorobi also has great contributions in gh74 and gh33 these results provide genetic evidence of cazymes microbial microbiome function in the anaerobic fermentation with different chemical treatments at ambient temperature 4 conclusions during the anaerobic fermentation process of was with the addition of cao2 at ambient temperature the prolonged period of alkaline condition generated from cao2 contributed significantly to the continuous destruction of was and the oxidative environment caused by cao2 further enhanced flocs dissolution during the hydrolysis stage oxidation contributed more than the alkaline condition in the decline of microbial diversity while the effect of alkaline condition was greater than that of oxidation in the change of microbial community structure 3 kinds of high abundance acetyl coa carboxylase genes and 11 kinds of synthetase hydrolase lyase and oxidoreductase genes promoted by cao2 were distributed throughout all branches of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ko00061 cbms and ghs were the top two cazymes improved by cao2 addition cao2 can effectively promote the function of lysozyme and the metabolism of xyloglucan chitin peptidoglycan galactose lactose rhamnose dextran important acidifying microorganisms bacteroidetes and firmicutes which were significantly promoted by cao2 contributed greatly in the enhanced cbms and
