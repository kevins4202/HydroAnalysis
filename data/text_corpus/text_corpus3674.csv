18370,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are critical for maintaining sustainable development in modern societies wherein microbial populations residing in activated sludge as are responsible for the removal of pollutants from wastewater the biodegradability biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand b c ratio of influent as a measure of the degree of available energy and toxicity to microorganisms in as has been hypothesized to drive as microbial community assembly however the validity of this hypothesis has not been tested in full scale wwtps in this study we assessed the pollutant removal loads the microbial community diversity the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic assembly processes and bio interactions within the communities by analyzing 195 as samples comprising nearly 5 000 000 16s rrna sequences our results indicate that the effects of b c ratio on pollutant removal loads can be perfectly reflected through biological properties implying that b c ratio determined wwtps performance through affecting microbial community very low and or very high b c ratios result in low microbial diversity strong stochastic processes and large complex networks leading to low pollutant removal load of treatment a b c ratio of around 0 5 was optimal for system stability and efficiency based on the results of this study the authors propose using the b c ratio as an indispensable index to assess system performance and to provide an indicator of an impending process upset before function deteriorates significantly this study provides a specific measure that can be used to evaluate strategies for process optimization and operation of wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plants wwtps biodegradability microbial

and removing carbon and nutrients gentile et al 2007 wang et al 2011 as such they are an important application area of biotechnology wagner and loy 2002 and critical to maintaining sustainable development so a better understanding of how to maintain the stable function of wwtps when environmental conditions are so dynamic due to constantly changing wastewater influent is crucial it is widely accepted that activated sludge as microbial communities are responsible for most of the nutrient removal wagner and loy 2002 and that the diversity structure and composition of these communities determine wwtp performance briones and raskin 2003 falk et al 2009 griffin and wells 2017 miura et al 2007 wagner and loy 2002 however the underlying mechanisms are still regarded as a black box understanding microbial community assembly mechanisms is a promising way to help uncover key parameters in regulating system performance in wwtps microbial assembly is believed to be simultaneously influenced by deterministic processes such as selection imposed by environmental filtering or and biotic interactions and stochastic processes such as dispersal limitation birth death events or drift caruso et al 2011 dumbrell et al 2010 langenheder and szekely 2011 myers and harms 2011 ofiteru et al 2010 stegen et al 2012 to date in both natural and engineered ecosystems there has been considerable debate about the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes on microbial community assembly griffin and wells 2017 for instance some studies ju and zhang 2015 valentin vargas et al 2012 showed that deterministic factors had a bigger impact on community assembly in wwtps whereas others ofiteru et al 2010 showed that stochastic processes such as random immigration were the dominant force this inconsistency could be due to variations in the degree of influence of stochastic and deterministic processes on as microbial assemblage from different environmental conditions at the wwtps studies microbial communities in wwtps are affected by many factors chen et al 2017 pholchan et al 2010 wang et al 2012 xia et al 2014 including influent characteristics operational parameters process configuration and environmental conditions influent characteristics has been shown to be the most important factor shaping the microbial community structure and composition chen et al 2017 ibarbalz et al 2013 2016 furthermore microbial communities from industrial and municipal wwtps were different ibarbalz et al 2013 because each had distinct influent components and organic loading which resulted in differing bacterial growth and metabolism nielsen et al 2010 because not all of the organic matters can be broken down by microorganisms through biodegradation biodegradability can be used to represent the level of available nutrients and toxicity of influent mangkoedihardjo 2006 and it is much easier to measure than wastewater composition a number of methods have been established to estimate wastewater biodegradability among which the ratio of biological oxygen demand bod to chemical oxygen demand cod referred to as b c ratio hereafter is one of the most well adopted surrogates amat et al 2009 many investigations have demonstrated that the b c ratio significantly affects wwtp system performance a lower b c ratio is suggestive of insufficient food and the presence of poorly biodegradable substances that may be toxic to microbes and inhibit microbial activity mangkoedihardjo 2006 mohan et al 2005 samudro and mangkoedihardjo 2010 resulting in a high cod in the effluent inadequate denitrification bolzonella et al 2001 de lucas et al 2005 deterioration of bio phosphate removal mulkerrins et al 2004 ra et al 2000 tong and chen 2007 and even system breakdown mangkoedihardjo 2006 it is likely that biodegradability ju et al 2014 and food availability xia et al 2016 could affect microbial interactions because various species populations interact with each other through the flow of energy matter and information montoya et al 2006 however the effects of influent biodegradability on the microbial community remain unclear in this study high throughput 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was used to obtain comprehensive microbial community information to address the following questions 1 does biodegradability of wastewater affect system performance of wwtps 2 do microbial community properties vary with biodegradability 3 what are the possible links between microbial community properties and system performance our work identified a previously undocumented dimension of the effects of wastewater biodegradability on microbial assembly and interactions and built a conceptual model which offers insights into links between the best microbial community properties and best wwtp performance overall these findings provide the basis for improving the efficiency and functional stability of wwtps from a new dimension and represent an important step forward in achieving better reactor design operation and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling a total of 195 as samples were collected from 58 full scale wwtps located in 15 cities of china using a uniform sampling protocol as shown below briefly each wwtp was sampled only once and the whole survey was finished in the summer of 2014 as samples were taken from inlet middle and outlet of the aeration phase respectively in each wwtp and most of these three samples were about 5 m apart details of the 58 wwtps including pollutant concentration in influent and effluent activated sludge properties and design and operational parameters are listed in supplementary table s1 all as samples were briefly settled on site and then immediately transported to the laboratory on ice a 2 ml aliquot of activated sludge sample was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min and the pellets were stored at 80 c until dna was extracted another 100 ml aliquot of as was centrifuged and supernatants were used to measure common chemical parameters including ammonia nitrite nitrate total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and cod temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and conductivity of activated sludge were measured in situ the pollutant concentrations of influents and effluents ammonia nitrite nitrate tn tp bod and cod of wwtps were directly obtained from the wwtp staffs other information about the wwtps including geographic coordinates age of plant hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt volume of aeration tanks proportion of industrial wastewater and the recycling ratio were either obtained from the wwtps or from online sources 2 2 dna extraction illumina sequencing and data processing microbial genomic dna was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa dna quality was assessed by an nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop inc wilmington de and quantified using picogreen on a fluo star optima bmg labtech jena germany dna samples were amplified with a set of primers targeting the variable region 4 v4 of the 16s rrna gene by applying an effective and robust two step pcr as previously described wu et al 2015 the forward primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and the reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were utilized for the first step pcr reagents and program parameters for pcr amplification can be seen in supplementary table s2 and table s3 after first step amplification the triplicate first step pcr products were pooled together and purified using 75 μl agencourt ampure xp beads beckman usa to remove primer dimers and other contaminants purified pcr products were recovered in 50 μl water and 15 μl were used as template the second round pcr using the same reaction buffer as above but with barcode primers and the same amplification protocol except for 15 cycles after the second step amplification pcr products from triplicate reactions were pooled and quantified by picogreen subsequently 200 ng of dna from each sample were combined and loaded to 1 agarose gel the amplicon band was removed and the target genes were extracted using a minelute gel extraction kit qiagen sciences germantown md usa to remove agarose finally the mixture was loaded into a miseq reagent cartridge illumina san diego ca usa and sequenced 2 250 bp paired end kit at the university of oklahoma norman ok usa raw sequences are available from the ncbi sequence read archive with accession number prjna509305 raw sequences were processed using a sequencing analysis pipeline that was built on the galaxy platform http www ou edu ieg tools data analysis pipeline briefly raw sequencing data were separated based on sample barcodes quality trimming was done using btrim kong 2011 forward and reverse reads were merged into full length sequences by flash magoc and salzberg 2011 sequences were removed if they were too short or contained ambiguous bases the operational taxonomic units otus were classified using uparse at the 97 similarity level with singletons removed to compare the 211 samples at the same sequencing depth normalization of the sequence number was conducted by extracting 25 600 sequences randomly from each sample for all the following analyses the taxonomic assignment was conducted by rdp classifier wang et al 2007 with a minimal 50 confidence estimate for the downstream analysis 2 3 data analyses shannon index h evenness and estimated richness in the pool chao2 were used to evaluate microbial taxonomic diversity null model was used to explore the relative influence of deterministic and stochastic processes on microbial assembly here we only considered the influence of selection dispersal and drift speciation was ignored because it has little influence within communities stegen et al 2013 analysis was performed in r following the method developed by stegen et al 2012 2013 2015 the related processes included homogeneous selection variable selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and undominated stegen et al 2015 the item undominated was used to refer to the scenario in which neither dispersal nor selection was the primary cause about calculation there are two steps to estimate the relative influences of each ecological processes first the difference between observed between community version of the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd and the mean of the null distribution was measured in units of standard deviation to estimate the influences of selection second the deviation between observed bray curtis distance and a null distribution of bray curtis values was standardized to estimate the influences of drift and limitation more details of the calculation can be found in the reference stegen et al 2015 microbial association networks were constructed to reveal possible interactions between microbes based on the random matrix theory rmt algorithm by using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline menap http www ou edu ieg tools data analysis pipeline for each network only otus detected in more than 66 7 of the samples were used for network construction to remove poorly represented otus and reduce network complexity then 100 corresponding random networks were generated each having the same network size and average number of links for each network the z test was used to test differences in indices between the constructed networks and random networks to characterize modularity properties each network was separated into modules by the fast greedy modularity optimization each module in the network considered a subset of species from similar ecological niches zhou et al 2011 and may perform similar functions luo et al 2006a 2006b newman 2006 a modularity value was used to measure how well a network can be separated into modules deng et al 2012 and is a fundamental characteristic of biological networks dethlefsen et al 2008 other crucial parameters usually used to describe the topological properties of network are as follows average clustering coefficient and average connectivity can be used to indicate the complexity of the network deng et al 2012 and average geodesic distance efficiency is a measure of the efficiency of information or mass transport within a network deng et al 2012 gephi 0 9 1 was used for visualization of network nodes and connectivity 3 results 3 1 overview of influent biodegradability and its impacts on system performance a total of 195 samples were collected from 58 wwtps located in 15 cities the influent b c ratio and pollutant removal loads were calculated for each wwtp we defined pollutant removal load as the estimated amount of pollutant removed per unit of biomass equation 1 equation 1 pollutant removal load g r o s s o f p o l l u t a n t r e m o v a l t o t a l b i o m a s s p o l l u t a n t i n i n f l u e n t g m 3 p o l l u t a n t i n e f f l u e n t g m 3 i n f l u e n t f l o w r a t e m 3 d a e r a t i o n t a n k v o l u m e m 3 r e a c t o r b i o m a s s g m 3 overall a high pollutant removal load was observed when b c ratios ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 the highest bod and tp removal loads were observed when the b c ratio was 0 55 and 0 49 fig 1 a similarly cod nh4 and tn removal load also showed significant parabolic distributions with b c ratios fig s1 and a high removal load of these pollutants was observed when the b c ratio was between 0 4 and 0 6 the optimal b c ratio for cod nh4 and tn removal was between 0 48 and 0 53 in comparison the pollutant removal load was very low when the b c ratio was below 0 3 or above 0 6 fig 1a and fig s1 these results suggest that biodegradability of wastewater has strong effects on wwtp performance the wwtps were divided into five groups based on their b c ratios below 0 3 group a 18 samples between 0 3 and 0 4 group b 24 samples between 0 4 and 0 5 group c 65 samples between 0 5 and 0 6 group d 61 samples and above 0 6 group e 27 samples fisher lsd results indicated that group a had the significantly lowest removal loads while group d had the highest table s4 more than two thirds of the samples 126 in total were from wwtps with b c ratios between 0 4 and 0 6 fig 1b indicating efficient pollutant removal conditions 3 2 impacts of b c ratio on microbial community diversity and composition given that the efficiency and stability of wwtps largely depends on the as microbial community it is important to investigate the differences in biological properties at different b c ratios to avoid bias during comparisons among different b c ratio groups all groups were resampled to the same number of samples based on the smallest group size that is 18 samples were randomly extracted from each group for downstream biological analyses studies have shown that system stability and function depend on not only species richness but also evenness or composition of the microbial community griffiths and philippot 2013 wittebolle et al 2009 here chao 2 pielou evenness j and shannon index h were adopted the average value of chao2 for each group was generated from 1000 random resamplings j and h indices were generated in a similar manner anova results indicated that all three indices were significantly different among the b c ratio groups p 0 001 interestingly biodegradability of influent exhibited a curvilinear relationship with shannon s diversity index h rather than a simple linear relationship fig 2 initially h index increased gradually with increasing b c ratio and a maximum h index was observed when the average b c ratio was 0 53 group d however h index dropped when the b c ratio exceeded 0 6 the same trend could be seen for relationship of the b c ratio to richness and evenness j fig s2 which demonstrates that there is a relationship between the b c ratio and biodiversity in as dissimilarity test showed that microbial community composition among groups had significant difference tables s5 and s6 notably actinobacteria had the largest proportion of the population in group d compared with other groups fig s3 as actinobacteria is proposed to be important bacteria for phosphorus removal wagner et al 1994 it may enhance biological phosphorus removal at b c ratios around 0 5 and this observation is supported by the tp removal efficiencies observed in this study fig 1a 3 3 impact of b c ratio on the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes since the b c ratio had significant effects on microbial diversity and composition the forces involved in determining microbial community composition and structure were subsequently investigated by using the null model developed by stegen et al 2013 given that group a contained 18 samples coming from 6 wwtps 5 wwtps but 6 treatment systems treated as 6 wwtps 18 samples from 6 wwtps were randomly selected each time for group b e to calculate the relative contributions of different assembly processes in detail results of group b and e were generated from all possible permutations and combinations and results of group c and d were derived from 1000 permutations because of too much possibility results of each permutation for each group can be found in table s7 in agreement with our hypothesis these two assembly processes occurred simultaneously and their relative influence changed under different operating conditions fig 3 with increasing b c ratio deterministic processes tended to predominate despite the decrease was observed when the b c ratio was over 0 6 fig 3 remarkably this trend of deterministic processes was highly consistent with that of alpha diversity it is worth noting that stochastic processes could explain as much as 60 of assembly process when the b c ratio was below 0 3 by comparing against midas database microbial database for activated sludge which give abundance information of individual genera to allow an assessment of immigration on population structure mcilroy et al 2015 we found that immigrated taxa may become key members of the as microbial community for example p simplicispira which is reported to be more predominant in influent rather than activated sludge mcilroy et al 2015 was the most abundant and frequent genus detected in group a its high abundance in group a may arise from continuous influent into wwtps ofiteru et al 2010 and it ability to metabolize fatty acids sugars and proteins mcilroy et al 2015 3 4 impacts of b c ratio on bacterial interactions as one of the deterministic processes biological interactions were proposed as major drivers during microbial assembly ju and zhang 2015 identifying the interactions occurring among microorganisms and keystone species is essential for better understanding microbial community diversity and functions hallam and mccutcheon 2015 ren et al 2015 we thus examined microbial interactions by employing mena network analysis the same thresholds st was applied for each of the group 0 86 to allow for comparisons among the groups table 1 networks were constructed based on b c ratios and all five of these networks exhibited scale free characteristics as indicated by power law r 2 s larger than 0 8 in addition significant differences between these five networks and their corresponding random networks with identical network sizes and average numbers of links were observed table 1 suggesting that the network structures were non random surprisingly it seems that b c ratios played a decisive role in microbial interactions because the networks were substantially different in terms of network composition among the five groups for example the average geodesic distance average clustering coefficient and modularity as well as many other network parameters of these pmens were significantly different table 1 specifically microbes with a b c ratio of around 0 5 group d tended to form many but small modules fig 4 with a large modularity smaller clustering coefficient and a shorter average geodesic distance table 1 in contrast microbial interactions in groups a and e tended to form several large complex modules indicating that the microbial communities in these groups contained fewer functional groups compared with the communities in group d also there were less connections among modules in groups d than in those of other groups however instead of the tight links among modules observed in group a connectivity among modules in group e was looser fig 4 a majority of the links in all groups were positive ranging from 69 12 to 80 94 fig 5 indicating that most species tended to co occur rather than co exclude the proportion of positive links between species reached a maximum when the b c ratio was around 0 5 this may indicate that a b c ratio of 0 5 could promote microbial co occurrence which benefits to microbial survival moreover the trend of negative interactions supported our hypothesis that the decrease in diversity under conditions of high b c ratio results from competition in order to identify putative keystone taxa critical to maintaining the community structure and function olesen et al 2007 nodes were classified into four categories based on their within module zi and among module connectivity pi deng et al 2016 peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs see definitions in fig 6 legend a majority of nodes in each network were peripherals with most of their links inside their own modules fig 6 network hubs were not identified in all groups multiple nodes were classified as module hubs in groups a and e but only one module hub was detected in group d fig 6 this implies that the communities in groups a and e employ active and important keystone species that transfer information or produce intermediate metabolites in order to maintain such large and complex module structures as such these modules and or networks may fall apart if these putative keystone species disappear albert et al 2000 power et al 1996 in contrast module structures in group d did not have an excessive reliance on particular species but rather groups of species had similar roles and importance interestingly pi values of all nodes in group d were zero indicating that nodes from different modules in this group had no connectivity at all connectors were only detected in networks from group e compared with networks from group a these connectors may play a role in communication among modules 4 discussion 4 1 the optimal b c ratio for efficient system performance the pollutant removal loads in the wwtps were at an optimum when the b c ratio was near 0 5 further properties of the microbial community with this b c ratio group d implied that conditions favored system stability and efficiency table s8 this demonstrates the utility of the b c ratio as a proxy to evaluate actual performance of the wwtps in wwtps microbial community have been considered playing determinant roles in achieving process stability and efficiency briones and raskin 2003 falk et al 2009 and our study was the first to uncover the underlying mechanisms to obtain a deeper understanding of such microbial community properties their biological significance and possible links with system functions we integrated favorable microbial community characteristics with desirable wwtp performance a conceptual model was then built to improve current knowledge on fundamental ecological principles in water engineered systems fig 7 4 2 links between microbial community diversity and system performance overall microbial communities with an optimal b c ratio exhibited the highest biodiversity including richness evenness and shannon s diversity the least influence from stochastic processes the highest modularity value highest average geodesic efficiency and smallest clustering coefficient compared to those with lower or higher b c ratios the high diversity at the optimal b c ratio is possibly because the microbial communities benefited from ideal nutrient availability and environmental conditions which may support a larger number of bacteria and thus more taxa in comparison when the b c ratio is lower than the optimum microbial communities have less available nutrients and a higher concentration of toxic substances resulting in an adverse effect on diversity in contrast when the b c ratio was higher there was likely increased competition and dominant taxa contributed to the decline of richness and evenness this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the relative abundance of otu 27 coming from paludibacter increased three times from group d 0 75 to group e 2 35 fig s4 and became the most abundant bacteria in group e it has been shown that the evenness of a microbial community can promote system functions that allow the community to be resistant to environmental stress wittebolle et al 2009 in addition highly diverse communities containing many unique members within different trophic groups are functionally redundant which is also important in maintaining system function and stability in response to disturbance briones and raskin 2003 fernandez et al 2000 valentin vargas et al 2012 therefore microbial communities at the optimal b c ratio which have a larger number of species at an even distribution have a better chance at maintaining a stable community structure and function in the face of changing environmental conditions i e ph substrate and temperature changes etc loreau et al 2001 4 3 links between microbial assembly and system performance null model results suggested that deterministic processes had more of an influence on microbial assembly when pollutant removal load was high whereas stochastic processes dominated when influent biodegradability was lower than 0 5 these results agreed with recent study which demonstrated that reactors had better performance with dominant deterministic assembly zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that influents are an important source of new microbes for the activated sludge system mclellan et al 2010 and continuous seeding with influent wastewater microorganisms can cause shifts in the bioreactor microbial communities seib et al 2016 in addition the vigorous and continuous mixing the as likely disturbs the microbial community and increases the probability of microbial immigration from the influent consequently community functional changes may occur as species with a given trait are replaced by other species with different traits which may not be as beneficial to the wwtp system as such influent immigration is expected to play a major role in the stochastic process because of these potential deleterious effects an extremely low b c ratio should be considered a warning sign of an unstable system in contrast microbial communities with an optimal b c ratio of 0 5 had the ability to resist interference from influent microorganisms and were able to maintained stability of treatment system 4 4 links between microbial interactions and system performance networks from communities with lower and higher biodegradability a b c ratio or less or more than 0 5 had more complex but fewer modules whereas those from communities with optimal biodegradability conditions a b c ratio around 0 5 had smaller but more numerous modules based on the network parameters of each group microbial communities with optimal b c ratios likely had multiple functions and accomplished parallel processing which allowed a more efficient removal of pollutants and system performance there are several possible reasons why groups with lower and higher b c ratios had more complex networks than those of groups with an optimal b c ratio firstly nutrient availability is probably an important driver henzi et al 2009 when biodegradable sources are scarce a wide range of microorganisms need to cooperate to consume the relatively undesirable available carbon sources in order to enhance food availability seo et al 2009 for example flavobacterium sp which is capable of metabolizing high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was prevalent and abundant in group a kanaly and harayama 2000 in addition microbes may need tighter connections to resist the harsh environmental conditions in these systems another possible reason is the greater influence of stochastic processes in community assembly these communities face greater disturbance from microbial immigration and other stochastic effects and the accumulation of these types of disturbances affects small highly integrated modules more than larger less integrated modules ravasz et al 2002 when food was plentiful and the living environment was moderate less toxic food limitation was no longer an important driver henzi et al 2009 and associations among modules decreased dramatically under these conditions microbes likely do not need to resist as many external disturbances and thus are less likely to form complex modules and tight connectivity instead there is less interaction and dependency between microbes allowing the microbes to function more efficiently since they did not need to rely on other community members to obtain required nutrients the short average geodesic distance and high geodesic efficiency under this condition supports this point nevertheless a high b c ratio could cause excessive growth of some bacteria in as and some species may become dominant through competition these dominant species could consume a large amount of a given resource like food oxygen or other necessary elements resulting in more complex network modules because of negative interactions between species environmental filtering could also contribute to this scenario shi et al 2016 an undesirable environment may promote the development of niches populated by adaptive and or dominant taxa which would concurrently yield decreased richness greater interactions greater co variations and overall result in more complex networks but the underlying mechanisms that how high b c ratio affected microbial communities still need further research interestingly a decreased average clustering coefficient was accompanied by increased richness of each group r 0 965 p 0 008 fig s5 indicating that as the community became richer the networks became less clustered and members had fewer connections with their neighbors but the underlying reasons need to be revealed in the future 5 conclusions the importance of the microbial communities associated with as in wwtps in pollutant removal load and functional stability has been long recognized but the links between microbiological properties and system performance are not well known evident impacts of influent biodegradability on system performance and on multiple properties of the as microbial community were observed in our study both the α diversity and proportion of deterministic processes involved in microbial community assembly showed a curvilinear relationship with the b c ratio and the indices related to these biological properties reached a maximum at a b c ratio of 0 5 the functional redundancy of communities resulting from the higher α diversity and less influence of microorganisms in the influent with more deterministic processes involved in microbial community assembly favored functional stability of the system the topological properties of the observed networks in the different b c ratio groups were distinctly different the network for the samples with optimal biodegradability conditions b c ratio of 0 5 had simple but more numerous modules more positive links between species and fewer keystone species all of which were beneficial to system efficiency and stability in contrast networks for samples with b c ratios higher or lower than the optimum had more complex modules fewer positive links and more keystone species which result in less stable systems as expected the highest pollutant removal load was observed when the b c ratio was around 0 5 accordingly b c ratio is proposed to be used as an indispensable index to assess system performance and as an indicator of an impending process upset before function deteriorates significantly

mangkoedihardjo 2010 resulting in a high cod in the effluent inadequate denitrification bolzonella et al 2001 de lucas et al 2005 deterioration of bio phosphate removal mulkerrins et al 2004 ra et al 2000 tong and chen 2007 and even system breakdown mangkoedihardjo 2006 it is likely that biodegradability ju et al 2014 and food availability xia et al 2016 could affect microbial interactions because various species populations interact with each other through the flow of energy matter and information montoya et al 2006 however the effects of influent biodegradability on the microbial community remain unclear in this study high throughput 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was used to obtain comprehensive microbial community information to address the following questions 1 does biodegradability of wastewater affect system performance of wwtps 2 do microbial community properties vary with biodegradability 3 what are the possible links between microbial community properties and system performance our work identified a previously undocumented dimension of the effects of wastewater biodegradability on microbial assembly and interactions and built a conceptual model which offers insights into links between the best microbial community properties and best wwtp performance overall these findings provide the basis for improving the efficiency and functional stability of wwtps from a new dimension and represent an important step forward in achieving better reactor design operation and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling a total of 195 as samples were collected from 58 full scale wwtps located in 15 cities of china using a uniform sampling protocol as shown below briefly each wwtp was sampled only once and the whole survey was finished in the summer of 2014 as samples were taken from inlet middle and outlet of the aeration phase respectively in each wwtp and most of these three samples were about 5 m apart details of the 58 wwtps including pollutant concentration in influent and effluent activated sludge properties and design and operational parameters are listed in supplementary table s1 all as samples were briefly settled on site and then immediately transported to the laboratory on ice a 2 ml aliquot of activated sludge sample was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min and the pellets were stored at 80 c until dna was extracted another 100 ml aliquot of as was centrifuged and supernatants were used to measure common chemical parameters including ammonia nitrite nitrate total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and cod temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and conductivity of activated sludge were measured in situ the pollutant concentrations of influents and effluents ammonia nitrite nitrate tn tp bod and cod of wwtps were directly obtained from the wwtp staffs other information about the wwtps including geographic coordinates age of plant hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt volume of aeration tanks proportion of industrial wastewater and the recycling ratio were either obtained from the wwtps or from online sources 2 2 dna extraction illumina sequencing and data processing microbial genomic dna was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa dna quality was assessed by an nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop inc wilmington de and quantified using picogreen on a fluo star optima bmg labtech jena germany dna samples were amplified with a set of primers targeting the variable region 4 v4 of the 16s rrna gene by applying an effective and robust two step pcr as previously described wu et al 2015 the forward primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and the reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were utilized for the first step pcr reagents and program parameters for pcr amplification can be seen in supplementary table s2 and table s3 after first step amplification the triplicate first step pcr products were pooled together and purified using 75 μl agencourt ampure xp beads beckman usa to remove primer dimers and other contaminants purified pcr products were recovered in 50 μl water and 15 μl were used as template the second round pcr using the same reaction buffer as above but with barcode primers and the same amplification protocol except for 15 cycles after the second step amplification pcr products from triplicate reactions were pooled and quantified by picogreen subsequently 200 ng of dna from each sample were combined and loaded to 1 agarose gel the amplicon band was removed and the target genes were extracted using a minelute gel extraction kit qiagen sciences germantown md usa to remove agarose finally the mixture was loaded into a miseq reagent cartridge illumina san diego ca usa and sequenced 2 250 bp paired end kit at the university of oklahoma norman ok usa raw sequences are available from the ncbi sequence read archive with accession number prjna509305 raw sequences were processed using a sequencing analysis pipeline that was built on the galaxy platform http www ou edu ieg tools data analysis pipeline briefly raw sequencing data were separated based on sample barcodes quality trimming was done using btrim kong 2011 forward and reverse reads were merged into full length sequences by flash magoc and salzberg 2011 sequences were removed if they were too short or contained ambiguous bases the operational taxonomic units otus were classified using uparse at the 97 similarity level with singletons removed to compare the 211 samples at the same sequencing depth normalization of the sequence number was conducted by extracting 25 600 sequences randomly from each sample for all the following analyses the taxonomic assignment was conducted by rdp classifier wang et al 2007 with a minimal 50 confidence estimate for the downstream analysis 2 3 data analyses shannon index h evenness and estimated richness in the pool chao2 were used to evaluate microbial taxonomic diversity null model was used to explore the relative influence of deterministic and stochastic processes on microbial assembly here we only considered the influence of selection dispersal and drift speciation was ignored because it has little influence within communities stegen et al 2013 analysis was performed in r following the method developed by stegen et al 2012 2013 2015 the related processes included homogeneous selection variable selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and undominated stegen et al 2015 the item undominated was used to refer to the scenario in which neither dispersal nor selection was the primary cause about calculation there are two steps to estimate the relative influences of each ecological processes first the difference between observed between community version of the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd and the mean of the null distribution was measured in units of standard deviation to estimate the influences of selection second the deviation between observed bray curtis distance and a null distribution of bray curtis values was standardized to estimate the influences of drift and limitation more details of the calculation can be found in the reference stegen et al 2015 microbial association networks were constructed to reveal possible interactions between microbes based on the random matrix theory rmt algorithm by using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline menap http www ou edu ieg tools data analysis pipeline for each network only otus detected in more than 66 7 of the samples were used for network construction to remove poorly represented otus and reduce network complexity then 100 corresponding random networks were generated each having the same network size and average number of links for each network the z test was used to test differences in indices between the constructed networks and random networks to characterize modularity properties each network was separated into modules by the fast greedy modularity optimization each module in the network considered a subset of species from similar ecological niches zhou et al 2011 and may perform similar functions luo et al 2006a 2006b newman 2006 a modularity value was used to measure how well a network can be separated into modules deng et al 2012 and is a fundamental characteristic of biological networks dethlefsen et al 2008 other crucial parameters usually used to describe the topological properties of network are as follows average clustering coefficient and average connectivity can be used to indicate the complexity of the network deng et al 2012 and average geodesic distance efficiency is a measure of the efficiency of information or mass transport within a network deng et al 2012 gephi 0 9 1 was used for visualization of network nodes and connectivity 3 results 3 1 overview of influent biodegradability and its impacts on system performance a total of 195 samples were collected from 58 wwtps located in 15 cities the influent b c ratio and pollutant removal loads were calculated for each wwtp we defined pollutant removal load as the estimated amount of pollutant removed per unit of biomass equation 1 equation 1 pollutant removal load g r o s s o f p o l l u t a n t r e m o v a l t o t a l b i o m a s s p o l l u t a n t i n i n f l u e n t g m 3 p o l l u t a n t i n e f f l u e n t g m 3 i n f l u e n t f l o w r a t e m 3 d a e r a t i o n t a n k v o l u m e m 3 r e a c t o r b i o m a s s g m 3 overall a high pollutant removal load was observed when b c ratios ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 the highest bod and tp removal loads were observed when the b c ratio was 0 55 and 0 49 fig 1 a similarly cod nh4 and tn removal load also showed significant parabolic distributions with b c ratios fig s1 and a high removal load of these pollutants was observed when the b c ratio was between 0 4 and 0 6 the optimal b c ratio for cod nh4 and tn removal was between 0 48 and 0 53 in comparison the pollutant removal load was very low when the b c ratio was below 0 3 or above 0 6 fig 1a and fig s1 these results suggest that biodegradability of wastewater has strong effects on wwtp performance the wwtps were divided into five groups based on their b c ratios below 0 3 group a 18 samples between 0 3 and 0 4 group b 24 samples between 0 4 and 0 5 group c 65 samples between 0 5 and 0 6 group d 61 samples and above 0 6 group e 27 samples fisher lsd results indicated that group a had the significantly lowest removal loads while group d had the highest table s4 more than two thirds of the samples 126 in total were from wwtps with b c ratios between 0 4 and 0 6 fig 1b indicating efficient pollutant removal conditions 3 2 impacts of b c ratio on microbial community diversity and composition given that the efficiency and stability of wwtps largely depends on the as microbial community it is important to investigate the differences in biological properties at different b c ratios to avoid bias during comparisons among different b c ratio groups all groups were resampled to the same number of samples based on the smallest group size that is 18 samples were randomly extracted from each group for downstream biological analyses studies have shown that system stability and function depend on not only species richness but also evenness or composition of the microbial community griffiths and philippot 2013 wittebolle et al 2009 here chao 2 pielou evenness j and shannon index h were adopted the average value of chao2 for each group was generated from 1000 random resamplings j and h indices were generated in a similar manner anova results indicated that all three indices were significantly different among the b c ratio groups p 0 001 interestingly biodegradability of influent exhibited a curvilinear relationship with shannon s diversity index h rather than a simple linear relationship fig 2 initially h index increased gradually with increasing b c ratio and a maximum h index was observed when the average b c ratio was 0 53 group d however h index dropped when the b c ratio exceeded 0 6 the same trend could be seen for relationship of the b c ratio to richness and evenness j fig s2 which demonstrates that there is a relationship between the b c ratio and biodiversity in as dissimilarity test showed that microbial community composition among groups had significant difference tables s5 and s6 notably actinobacteria had the largest proportion of the population in group d compared with other groups fig s3 as actinobacteria is proposed to be important bacteria for phosphorus removal wagner et al 1994 it may enhance biological phosphorus removal at b c ratios around 0 5 and this observation is supported by the tp removal efficiencies observed in this study fig 1a 3 3 impact of b c ratio on the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes since the b c ratio had significant effects on microbial diversity and composition the forces involved in determining microbial community composition and structure were subsequently investigated by using the null model developed by stegen et al 2013 given that group a contained 18 samples coming from 6 wwtps 5 wwtps but 6 treatment systems treated as 6 wwtps 18 samples from 6 wwtps were randomly selected each time for group b e to calculate the relative contributions of different assembly processes in detail results of group b and e were generated from all possible permutations and combinations and results of group c and d were derived from 1000 permutations because of too much possibility results of each permutation for each group can be found in table s7 in agreement with our hypothesis these two assembly processes occurred simultaneously and their relative influence changed under different operating conditions fig 3 with increasing b c ratio deterministic processes tended to predominate despite the decrease was observed when the b c ratio was over 0 6 fig 3 remarkably this trend of deterministic processes was highly consistent with that of alpha diversity it is worth noting that stochastic processes could explain as much as 60 of assembly process when the b c ratio was below 0 3 by comparing against midas database microbial database for activated sludge which give abundance information of individual genera to allow an assessment of immigration on population structure mcilroy et al 2015 we found that immigrated taxa may become key members of the as microbial community for example p simplicispira which is reported to be more predominant in influent rather than activated sludge mcilroy et al 2015 was the most abundant and frequent genus detected in group a its high abundance in group a may arise from continuous influent into wwtps ofiteru et al 2010 and it ability to metabolize fatty acids sugars and proteins mcilroy et al 2015 3 4 impacts of b c ratio on bacterial interactions as one of the deterministic processes biological interactions were proposed as major drivers during microbial assembly ju and zhang 2015 identifying the interactions occurring among microorganisms and keystone species is essential for better understanding microbial community diversity and functions hallam and mccutcheon 2015 ren et al 2015 we thus examined microbial interactions by employing mena network analysis the same thresholds st was applied for each of the group 0 86 to allow for comparisons among the groups table 1 networks were constructed based on b c ratios and all five of these networks exhibited scale free characteristics as indicated by power law r 2 s larger than 0 8 in addition significant differences between these five networks and their corresponding random networks with identical network sizes and average numbers of links were observed table 1 suggesting that the network structures were non random surprisingly it seems that b c ratios played a decisive role in microbial interactions because the networks were substantially different in terms of network composition among the five groups for example the average geodesic distance average clustering coefficient and modularity as well as many other network parameters of these pmens were significantly different table 1 specifically microbes with a b c ratio of around 0 5 group d tended to form many but small modules fig 4 with a large modularity smaller clustering coefficient and a shorter average geodesic distance table 1 in contrast microbial interactions in groups a and e tended to form several large complex modules indicating that the microbial communities in these groups contained fewer functional groups compared with the communities in group d also there were less connections among modules in groups d than in those of other groups however instead of the tight links among modules observed in group a connectivity among modules in group e was looser fig 4 a majority of the links in all groups were positive ranging from 69 12 to 80 94 fig 5 indicating that most species tended to co occur rather than co exclude the proportion of positive links between species reached a maximum when the b c ratio was around 0 5 this may indicate that a b c ratio of 0 5 could promote microbial co occurrence which benefits to microbial survival moreover the trend of negative interactions supported our hypothesis that the decrease in diversity under conditions of high b c ratio results from competition in order to identify putative keystone taxa critical to maintaining the community structure and function olesen et al 2007 nodes were classified into four categories based on their within module zi and among module connectivity pi deng et al 2016 peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs see definitions in fig 6 legend a majority of nodes in each network were peripherals with most of their links inside their own modules fig 6 network hubs were not identified in all groups multiple nodes were classified as module hubs in groups a and e but only one module hub was detected in group d fig 6 this implies that the communities in groups a and e employ active and important keystone species that transfer information or produce intermediate metabolites in order to maintain such large and complex module structures as such these modules and or networks may fall apart if these putative keystone species disappear albert et al 2000 power et al 1996 in contrast module structures in group d did not have an excessive reliance on particular species but rather groups of species had similar roles and importance interestingly pi values of all nodes in group d were zero indicating that nodes from different modules in this group had no connectivity at all connectors were only detected in networks from group e compared with networks from group a these connectors may play a role in communication among modules 4 discussion 4 1 the optimal b c ratio for efficient system performance the pollutant removal loads in the wwtps were at an optimum when the b c ratio was near 0 5 further properties of the microbial community with this b c ratio group d implied that conditions favored system stability and efficiency table s8 this demonstrates the utility of the b c ratio as a proxy to evaluate actual performance of the wwtps in wwtps microbial community have been considered playing determinant roles in achieving process stability and efficiency briones and raskin 2003 falk et al 2009 and our study was the first to uncover the underlying mechanisms to obtain a deeper understanding of such microbial community properties their biological significance and possible links with system functions we integrated favorable microbial community characteristics with desirable wwtp performance a conceptual model was then built to improve current knowledge on fundamental ecological principles in water engineered systems fig 7 4 2 links between microbial community diversity and system performance overall microbial communities with an optimal b c ratio exhibited the highest biodiversity including richness evenness and shannon s diversity the least influence from stochastic processes the highest modularity value highest average geodesic efficiency and smallest clustering coefficient compared to those with lower or higher b c ratios the high diversity at the optimal b c ratio is possibly because the microbial communities benefited from ideal nutrient availability and environmental conditions which may support a larger number of bacteria and thus more taxa in comparison when the b c ratio is lower than the optimum microbial communities have less available nutrients and a higher concentration of toxic substances resulting in an adverse effect on diversity in contrast when the b c ratio was higher there was likely increased competition and dominant taxa contributed to the decline of richness and evenness this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the relative abundance of otu 27 coming from paludibacter increased three times from group d 0 75 to group e 2 35 fig s4 and became the most abundant bacteria in group e it has been shown that the evenness of a microbial community can promote system functions that allow the community to be resistant to environmental stress wittebolle et al 2009 in addition highly diverse communities containing many unique members within different trophic groups are functionally redundant which is also important in maintaining system function and stability in response to disturbance briones and raskin 2003 fernandez et al 2000 valentin vargas et al 2012 therefore microbial communities at the optimal b c ratio which have a larger number of species at an even distribution have a better chance at maintaining a stable community structure and function in the face of changing environmental conditions i e ph substrate and temperature changes etc loreau et al 2001 4 3 links between microbial assembly and system performance null model results suggested that deterministic processes had more of an influence on microbial assembly when pollutant removal load was high whereas stochastic processes dominated when influent biodegradability was lower than 0 5 these results agreed with recent study which demonstrated that reactors had better performance with dominant deterministic assembly zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that influents are an important source of new microbes for the activated sludge system mclellan et al 2010 and continuous seeding with influent wastewater microorganisms can cause shifts in the bioreactor microbial communities seib et al 2016 in addition the vigorous and continuous mixing the as likely disturbs the microbial community and increases the probability of microbial immigration from the influent consequently community functional changes may occur as species with a given trait are replaced by other species with different traits which may not be as beneficial to the wwtp system as such influent immigration is expected to play a major role in the stochastic process because of these potential deleterious effects an extremely low b c ratio should be considered a warning sign of an unstable system in contrast microbial communities with an optimal b c ratio of 0 5 had the ability to resist interference from influent microorganisms and were able to maintained stability of treatment system 4 4 links between microbial interactions and system performance networks from communities with lower and higher biodegradability a b c ratio or less or more than 0 5 had more complex but fewer modules whereas those from communities with optimal biodegradability conditions a b c ratio around 0 5 had smaller but more numerous modules based on the network parameters of each group microbial communities with optimal b c ratios likely had multiple functions and accomplished parallel processing which allowed a more efficient removal of pollutants and system performance there are several possible reasons why groups with lower and higher b c ratios had more complex networks than those of groups with an optimal b c ratio firstly nutrient availability is probably an important driver henzi et al 2009 when biodegradable sources are scarce a wide range of microorganisms need to cooperate to consume the relatively undesirable available carbon sources in order to enhance food availability seo et al 2009 for example flavobacterium sp which is capable of metabolizing high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was prevalent and abundant in group a kanaly and harayama 2000 in addition microbes may need tighter connections to resist the harsh environmental conditions in these systems another possible reason is the greater influence of stochastic processes in community assembly these communities face greater disturbance from microbial immigration and other stochastic effects and the accumulation of these types of disturbances affects small highly integrated modules more than larger less integrated modules ravasz et al 2002 when food was plentiful and the living environment was moderate less toxic food limitation was no longer an important driver henzi et al 2009 and associations among modules decreased dramatically under these conditions microbes likely do not need to resist as many external disturbances and thus are less likely to form complex modules and tight connectivity instead there is less interaction and dependency between microbes allowing the microbes to function more efficiently since they did not need to rely on other community members to obtain required nutrients the short average geodesic distance and high geodesic efficiency under this condition supports this point nevertheless a high b c ratio could cause excessive growth of some bacteria in as and some species may become dominant through competition these dominant species could consume a large amount of a given resource like food oxygen or other necessary elements resulting in more complex network modules because of negative interactions between species environmental filtering could also contribute to this scenario shi et al 2016 an undesirable environment may promote the development of niches populated by adaptive and or dominant taxa which would concurrently yield decreased richness greater interactions greater co variations and overall result in more complex networks but the underlying mechanisms that how high b c ratio affected microbial communities still need further research interestingly a decreased average clustering coefficient was accompanied by increased richness of each group r 0 965 p 0 008 fig s5 indicating that as the community became richer the networks became less clustered and members had fewer connections with their neighbors but the underlying reasons need to be revealed in the future 5 conclusions the importance of the microbial communities associated with as in wwtps in pollutant removal load and functional stability has been long recognized but the links between microbiological properties and system performance are not well known evident impacts of influent biodegradability on system performance and on multiple properties of the as microbial community were observed in our study both the α diversity and proportion of deterministic processes involved in microbial community assembly showed a curvilinear relationship with the b c ratio and the indices related to these biological properties reached a maximum at a b c ratio of 0 5 the functional redundancy of communities resulting from the higher α diversity and less influence of microorganisms in the influent with more deterministic processes involved in microbial community assembly favored functional stability of the system the topological properties of the observed networks in the different b c ratio groups were distinctly different the network for the samples with optimal biodegradability conditions b c ratio of 0 5 had simple but more numerous modules more positive links between species and fewer keystone species all of which were beneficial to system efficiency and stability in contrast networks for samples with b c ratios higher or lower than the optimum had more complex modules fewer positive links and more keystone species which result in less stable systems as expected the highest pollutant removal load was observed when the b c ratio was around 0 5 accordingly b c ratio is proposed to be used as an indispensable index to assess system performance and as an indicator of an impending process upset before function deteriorates significantly

18371,this study presents a novel periodate oxidation system mediated by manganese oxides for the rapid removal of aqueous contaminants the catalytic activation of periodate on manganese oxides was demonstrated as an efficient advanced oxidation system for degradation of sulfanilamide the reactivity of manganese oxides with different mn valence followed the order of mno2 mn3o4 mn2o3 all of which showed extraordinary reusability during repeated activation of periodate sulfanilamide was rapidly degraded along with stoichiometric transformation of io4 to io3 and both processes exhibited good linear correlations with the dosage of manganese oxides while the degradation of sulfanilamide in the mno2 io4 system was accelerated at lower solution ph it was only slightly affected by ionic strength water anions and humic acid in contrast to the homogeneous system of mn2 io4 sulfanilamide degradation was not influenced in oxic and anoxic environment it was evidenced by quenching studies and epr tests that both singlet oxygen 1o2 and iodate radicals io3 were generated when the metastable mn iv o io3 interacted with sulfanilamide the xps spectra of mn 2p and o 1s before and after reactions indicated that the catalytic activation of periodate on mno2 was not in company with the redox cycling of mn iv species graphical abstract image 1 keywords periodate diverse manganese oxides mno2 sulfanilamide singlet oxygen 1 introduction during the past two decades wide detection of antibiotic pharmaceuticals in wastewater and natural water bodies has raised concerns about their adverse effects on water security and ecological systems liu et al 2018 carvalho and santos 2016 although the environmental pollution caused by antibiotics is normally in low concentrations at the level of ng l or μg l they are also likely to pose a threat to the body metabolism in a long term contact with living beings kümmerer 2009a b a clear evidence is that the resistant genes against antibiotics are frequently found along with the occurrence of antibiotic pollution gao et al 2018 hamiwe et al 2019 sulfonamides are broad spectrum antibiotics and are popularly used as prescription medicines and agricultural herbicides till now sulfonamides have been frequently detected in purified wastewater and natural water bodies carvalho and santos 2016 yan et al 2018 due to the high consumption and poor biodegradation in sewage treatment plants sulfonamides can easily escape and enter aquatic environments fekadu et al 2019 dinh et al investigated the occurrence of sulfonamides in wastewater bodies in france and found that the concentration level could reach as high as 1 4 μg l in seine river tuc dinh et al 2011 since sulfonamides are the most detected antibiotics the development of its effective treatment has become an emerging and important task for environmental protection advanced oxidation processes aops have been preferentially considered for degradation of refractory organic pollutants for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation normally the successful implement of advanced oxidation processes requires the conjunction of oxidants i e h2o2 persulfate salts ozone with their activation catalysts as oxidants themselves are not active enough to directly destruct organic compounds reactive species with much stronger oxidizing capacity should be generated via proper activation oh et al 2016 rahim pouran et al 2014 for example h2o2 and persulfate activated by transition metal catalysts to produce hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 have been shown to be efficient for the degradation of most organic contaminants tsitonaki et al 2010 bokare and choi 2014 therefore intensive efforts have been devoted to exploring the application of various oxidants and improving their activation techniques periodate io4 1 60 v is typically used to selectively oxidize c2 c3 carbonyl groups and introduce aldehydes for cellulose modification sirvio et al 2011 very recently activated periodate has exhibited great potential for destruction of refractory pollutants periodate itself without activation possesses very limited oxidizing capacity to independently degrade organic contaminants therefore alternative activation processes are added including uv irradiation freezing alkaline and also reactive catalysts cao et al 2010 choi et al 2018a li et al 2016 bokare and choi 2015 several reactive species including oh o 3p io3 io4 and non radical species such as o3 and h2o2 were reported to be generated via photoactivation gözmen et al 2009 besides bokare and choi found that alkali is capable of activating periodate to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 under both anoxic and oxic conditions bokare and choi 2015 in their study pharmaceutical e g cimetidine and ranitidine rather than phenolic contaminants e g bisphenol a and 4 chlorophenol could be selectively degraded in kio4 koh system without uv irradiation li et al observed the effective degradation of ao7 in the reaction system containing iodine doped granular activated carbon i gac and periodate li et al 2017 although periodate is potentially an efficient and selective oxidant for water contaminants destruction there are still very limited approaches for its activation and it is necessary to have specific equipment and external energy consumption in many cases transition metals have been frequently used as aop catalysts to generate reactive radicals for example fe ii coupled with h2o2 well known as fenton reagent is extensively applied for pre treatment or post treatment of refractory wastewater pignatello et al 2006 cobalt initiates peroxymonsulfate activation to form sulfate radicals anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 similarly the combination of periodate with transition metals in some cases also provides a potential option for periodate functional oxidation shah et al 2016 specially the mn ii catalyzed indicator reaction with periodate has been investigated to determine the concentration of some transition metals including mn ii ru iii rh iii os iv and ir iv or some specific organic compounds vlessidis and evmiridis 2009 in addition to non metallic catalysts lee et al employed the bimetallic nfe0 ni and nfe0 cu nanoparticles as a periodate activator and found that ni or cu was the key component to activate io4 for contaminants degradation lee et al 2014 however the conjunction of periodate with heterogeneous metal oxides for wastewater treatment is rarely studied and the related mechanism remains further exploration manganese oxides have been widely used as catalyst or adsorbent for water decontamination with advantages of low cost and environmental compatibility they have shown promising performances for the catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate for organic pollutants degradation saputra et al 2013a 2013b the present study investigates the use of diverse manganese oxides at different mn valence states as heterogeneous catalysts to activate periodate for the degradation of aquatic sulfanilamide which is an important raw material or intermediate for sulfonamides production the effect of some key reaction parameters the redox transformation of manganese species the main reactive radicals and the catalyst reusability were studied to reveal the working mechanism of this novel oxidation system the system integrating manganese oxides with periodate is expected to provide an alternative strategy for oxidative removal of aqueous antibiotic contaminants and the findings in the present study will broaden the mechanistic insight into this new process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfanilamide and naclo4 were obtained from aladdin of analytical grade methanol and acetonitrile in hplc grade were

with 1 ml sodium thiosulfate to terminate the reaction and then filtered through 0 22 μm syringe membrane filter for high performance liquid chromatography analysis to evaluate the stability of the catalysts the used catalysts were washed with deionized ethanol and water by the centrifuge then dried at 70 c for 12 h since small amount of particle loss was unavoidable during recycling and washing processes several parallel experiments were conducted in each run to maintain the sufficient catalyst dose for the next run to explore the effect of oxygen to the mno2 periodate system the reactions were carried out under anoxic environment to exclude the role of oxygen generally deoxygenated water purged with n2 for 90 min was used and nitrogen gas was continually purged throughout the whole reaction concentrations of residual sulfanilamide periodate and iodate were qualified using a rigol l 3000 hplc equipped with a compass c18 column 5 μm 4 6 250 mm the detection wavelengths of sulfanilamide were 266 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and water at a ratio of 55 45 v v for sulfanilamide periodate and iodate were detected at 218 nm with a mobile phase consisting of 0 1 phosphate acid solution and acetonitrile at a volume ratio of 60 40 the concentration of leached mn ions was detected using an icp oes agilent 5110 the reactive oxidizing intermediates that generated from periodate activation were detected by jes fa200 epr spectrometer using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo or 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as the radical catcher 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of manganese oxides xrd analysis was used to elucidate the crystalline features of as prepared manganese oxides with different mn valence in fig 1 a the diffraction peaks occurred at 12 65 18 05 22 26 25 41 28 48 37 57 41 95 59 94 65 44 68 54 and 69 70 which can be matched with the crystal planes of 100 110 111 200 201 003 113 214 005 501 and 333 of cryptomelane type mno2 jcpds no 12 0706 a 9 84 å annealing treatment of mno2 particles at 550 c for 5 h generated a different xrd pattern spectrum b shown in fig 1b with peaks observed at ca 23 1 32 9 37 9 55 2 65 7 and they corresponded to the crystal planes of 211 222 400 440 and 622 of mn2o3 jcpds no 31 0825 a 9 406 å respectively in addition after annealed at 950 c for 2 h mno2 was further transformed to mn3o4 with the xrd spectrum c fig 1c the spectrum c could be indexed to the hausmannite mn3o4 jcpds no 01 1127 a 5 75 å with the peaks at ca 18 1 28 9 32 4 36 2 58 6 59 9 corresponding to the 101 112 103 211 321 224 planes of mn3o4 the xrd results confirmed that mno2 was formed through the hydrothermal precipitation between kmno4 and mnso4 and mn2o3 and mn3o4 were prepared via further calcination of mno2 at different annealing temperatures the morphology observation of mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 was conducted by sem as shown in fig 2 a and fig s1a individual mno2 was grown into nanorods and aggregated like a micro scaled sea urchin forming hierarchical nano micro structures the sem images of mn2o3 exhibit mixture phases of nanorods and nanosheets fig 2b and fig s1b the crystal form of nanosheet was obtained via the conversion of mno2 nanorods during the annealing treatment at 550 c however this transformation was not thoroughly proceeded because of the temperature limitation as the calcination temperature went up to 950 c mno2 nanorods were completely converted to well defined mn3o4 nanosheets with a diameter of hundreds of nanometers fig 2c and fig s1c apparently the particle size of the three catalysts followed an order of mn3o4 mn2o3 mno2 in addition the elemental composition of the three catalysts was further analyzed by eds as shown in fig s2 and table s1 in supporting material the ratios between elemental o and mn were nearly 2 0 1 46 and 1 27 for mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 catalysts respectively which were consistent with their chemical formula and xrd results 3 2 catalytic periodate activation and reusability of catalysts fig 3 a shows the curves of sulfanilamide degradation by activated periodate in presence or absence of different mn oxides control experiments with either periodate or mn oxides alone were unable to directly remove sulfanilamide in comparison the sulfanilamide degradation could only rapidly proceed in the coexistence of manganese oxides and periodate as shown in fig 3a although complete removal of sulfanilamide could be reached with different manganese oxides the coupling of mno2 with io4 showed the highest efficiency for the degradation of sulfanilamide the catalytic activity of different manganese oxides for the activation of periodate followed an order of mno2 mn3o4 mn2o3 according to sulfanilamide degradation profiles on the one hand mno2 might possess more reactive sites for periodate activation than mn3o4 and mn2o3 because of its smaller particle size on the other hand mn3 on mn2o3 surface tended to disproportionate in oxide water interface might influence its catalytic stability in other words mno2 with higher valence state mn iv was more efficient for periodate activation than mn2o3 and mn3o4 with lower valence states mn ii mn iii indicating that mn species might not have simply acted as the electron donor the similar clue could be found that nanosized zero valent iron a strong reductant was unable to activate periodate for 4 chlorophenol degradation but only reduce it to iodate lee et al 2014 to evaluate the reusability of mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 for the catalytic periodate activation cycling tests were further conducted with recycled mn catalysts intriguingly as shown in fig 3b the removal efficiency of sulfanilamide was completely unchanged after three times reuse of mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 respectively with simple process of centrifugation and drying meanwhile the leaching of mn ions during periodate activation mostly maintained at a low level fig s3a and less than 50 μg l mn ions were leached after each run in the mno2 periodate system fig s3b the low level mn leaching and good reusability indicated that the manganese oxide materials could maintain excellent stability without any deactivation during the periodate oxidation of sulfanilamide this result was different from that obtained in systems driven by mn species redox in which the conversion of original mn species would more or less decelerate the pollutant degradation rates during repeated applications saputra et al 2012 2013b other than metallic catalysts li et al also reported that dried granular activated carbon could repeatedly activate periodate for ao7 degradation without any deactivation however detailed mechanisms of this excellent reusability are still unclear and the direct transformation of periodate to reactive oxidizing intermediate without redox cycling of catalytic manganese species cannot be excluded 3 3 effect of catalyst dosage and initial ph to exhibit the best performance of tested catalysts and its high potential for practical application the influential factors including catalyst dose and solution ph were further examined as shown in fig 4 the increment of manganese oxides accelerated the degradation rate of sulfanilamide with its dosage changing from 0 1 g l 1 to 0 4 g l 1 apparently mno2 exhibited a higher reactivity than mn2o3 and mn3o4 with the same catalyst dosage the sulfanilamide degradation behaviors with different manganese oxides could be well fitted by pseudo first order reaction model in which the fitted curve checks fairly well with experimental dots the calculated rate constant k presented a linear relationship with catalyst dosage for mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 fig 4d these results indicated that the periodate oxidation of sulfanilamide on mnox was highly dependent on the number of active sites provided by manganese catalysts the solution ph is an influential parameter since it affects the species of periodate as well as pollutants du et al 2019b fig 5 a shows the degradation rate constant of sulfanilamide at various initial ph in the presence of three different manganese oxides in general the removal efficiency of sulfanilamide decreased obviously with ph increase from 3 0 to 9 0 with main decline occurring mostly across ph 3 7 the results indicated that acidic conditions favored periodate activation there are two typical trends regarding the ph effect on the periodate oxidation as reported previously in most cases the pollutant degradation by periodate was accelerated at lower ph especially in strong acidic conditions li et al 2017 lee et al 2014 bendjama et al 2018 choi et al 2018b however on the other side uv induced activation of periodate was also reported to be optimized at near neutral ph for dye degradation lee and yoon 2004 ghodbane and hamdaoui 2016 the obtained controversial effect of ph could be linked to the species of sulfanilamide and periodate it is known that the pk a of sulfanilamide is 10 65 therefore sulfanilamide was mostly presented in form of molecular compound across ph 3 10 meanwhile the periodate species changes with ph variation where io4 dominates at ph lower than 8 and the dimerized h2i2o10 4 is dominant at ph 8 this species variation of periodate was highly related with its oxidation potential which would decrease from 1 6 ev to 0 7 ev with increasing ph across acidic to alkaline conditions fatiadi 1974 besides the ph pzc of manganese oxides were detected to be in range of 4 5 fig s4 manganese oxides would be negatively charged when the solution ph ph pzc thus the solid surface would carry more negative charge at higher ph leading to stronger repulsion between catalysts and periodate anions in short the periodate oxidation of sulfanilamide with manganese oxides is better to be carried out under acid and neutral conditions given that leached mn2 was also an effective activator for periodate du et al 2019b the role of homogeneous degradation of sulfanilamide under different ph conditions was further explored specifically concentrations of leached mn solutions at different ph values were detected in the mno2 periodate system as depicted in fig s5 more mn ions leached with the increase of ph from 3 to 8 and then slightly decreased at ph 9 the highest concentration of leached mn ions was detected to be 47 5 μg l at ph 4 to investigate the role of homogeneous reaction in the mno2 periodate system as high as 50 μg l mn2 was used to activate periodate in the absence of mno2 to maximize the homogeneous degradation the results shown in fig s6 indicated that the removal of sulfanilamide was significant at initial ph 4 8 but inconspicuous at ph 3 and ph 9 in the mn2 io4 system a maximum rate of 20 of sulfanilamide could be degraded at ph 4 after 60 min reaction this result suggested that homogeneous reaction only accounted for a small portion for the degradation of sulfanilamide actually the heterogeneous reaction on mno2 surface was fast enough so that the homogeneous reaction induced by leached mn ions made a less contribution to the degradation of sulfanilamide for instance sulfanilamide could be rapidly degraded at ph 3 in the system of mno2 periodate but negligible removal of sulfanilamide could be observed in homogeneous solution under the same condition indicating that the homogeneous reaction played a minor role during the mno2 induced periodate activation in summary the sulfanilamide degradation in the mno2 periodate system was mainly a heterogeneous process 3 4 effect of ionic strength water anions and humic acid the catalytic sites could combine with periodate via either electrostatic or covalent bonding in general the electrostatic adherence will be weakened with increase of ionic strength whereas the covalent bonding is less sensitive to the variation of ionic strength stumm 1992 as shown in fig 5b the sulfanilamide degradation was slightly affected in the presence of 0 05 mol l naclo4 but after that little changed was observed with further increase of ionic strength this phenomena was also frequently monitored during the heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate by transition metal oxides zhang et al 2013 the increase of solution ionic strength would weaken the electrostatic adherence by compressing the thickness of the electric double layer on oxide surface the above results implied that periodate bonded with the surface mn iv mainly via a strong covalent interaction and electrostatic bonding contributed a minor role to the reaction rate that is the surface mn iv sites is more likely to coordinate with the uncharged o of periodate and facilitate its activation water anions including nitrate chloride bicarbonate and phosphate are common influential factors for advanced oxidation processes to avoid the change of ph induced by bicarbonate and phosphate the solution initial ph was adjusted to 5 4 again after the addition of water anions as presented in fig 5c the removal rate of sulfanilamide by mno2 periodate was not much influenced in the presence of 2 0 mmol l nitrate chloride and phosphate anions but slightly suppressed by bicarbonate ions the result obtained for phosphate was inconsistent with our previous study in which phosphate exhibited significant inhibition to the mn2 periodate system for bisphenol a degradation du et al 2019b phosphate might exert a stronger complexation with aqueous mn2 ions than the heterogeneous mn iv oxides because of its frail coordination capacity huang et al 2017 moreover the role of bicarbonate on transition metals and advanced oxidations involves complicated processes and have shown controversial results feng et al 2016 ma and graham 2000 the slight inhibition of bicarbonate here could be due to its radical scavenging role as reported previously ma and graham 2000 the hco3 and co3 radical might be produced by reaction of the possible oxidizing species and bicarbonate in the mno2 periodate system eqs 1 and 2 the negligible effect of cl and no3 indicated that they were inert enough to be oxidized by mno2 periodate as depicted in eq 3 and eq 4 otherwise the generation of chlorine radicals or nitrate radicals would consume reactive oxidizing species of periodate activation to some extent yuan et al 2011 machulek et al 2007 more importantly it should be noted that non involvement of cl and no3 also reduces the risk of generation of more toxic intermediates 2 io4 hco3 h2o io3 hco3 2oh 3 hco3 co3 h 4 io4 cl h2o io3 cl 2oh 5 io4 no3 h2o io3 no3 2oh the influence of humic acid ha on the removal of sulfanilamide in the mno2 periodate system is depicted in fig 5d the results indicated that the presence of ha could inhibit the depletion rate of sulfanilamide and this inhibition was slightly enhanced with increasing ha concentration from 2 mg l to 50 mg l however it was noticed that this inhibition was unable to stop the complete removal of sulfanilamide with 60 min reaction this result was in disagreement with that obtained in the systems of mn2 periodate du et al 2019b and alkaline periodate bokare and choi 2015 in which ha acted a promotive role during the generation of singlet oxygen in fact ha was also report to be a target compound during the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants for example ha could be effectively degraded by nico2o4 activated peroxymonosulfate in which 1o2 was detected as the dominant active oxidizing intermediate tian et al 2018 moreover ha might adsorb onto the oxide surface occupying the active site of reactive manganese site therefore the presence of ha would interfere or compete with sulfanilamide to be degraded in some extent it is also suggested that the mno2 periodate system worked in a different pathway from the homogeneous systems where ha acted as a promoter or electron transfer mediator bokare and choi 2015 du et al 2019b in summary these results indicated that ionic strength water anions and humic acid could take limited effect on the mno2 catalyzed activation of periodate as a further evidence the mno2 periodate system also exhibited high effectiveness for sulfanilamide destruction in sewage water compared to that proceeded in pure water fig s7 in supporting material 3 5 possible oxidizing species and catalytic mechanism periodate is a versatile oxidant capable of producing multiple reactive oxidizing species via proper activation hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygens 1o2 and iodate radicals io3 were frequently reported to be plausible oxidizing species involved in the periodate oxidation systems bokare and choi 2015 choi et al 2018b chia et al 2004 except for iodate radicals the other three species are well known to oxidize organic pollutants at high reaction rates and can be identified via radical quenching tests to identify radicals responsible for sulfanilamide degradation the effect of various radical scavengers was evaluated ethanol is a typical oh quencher while benzoquinone bq k bq o2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 is usually used to scavenge o2 the results as shown in fig 6 a indicated that ethanol and benzoquinone fully failed to capture any reactive oxidizing species even in high concentration the oxidation by 1o2 was evaluated using sodium azide nan3 k nan3 1o2 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 as the exclusive inhibitor mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 because nan3 rapidly reacted with singlet oxygen the sulfanilamide removal in the mno2 periodate system was significantly suppressed with a noticeable slower degradation rate the above results suggested that there was no contribution from oh and o2 and 1o2 possibly made a dominant role during the oxidation of sulfanilamide the epr spectra of reactive oxidizing species were further monitored using temp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents not surprisingly periodate or mno2 alone did not trigger any characteristic peaks in the presence of either temp or dmpo conversely when temp was applied to capture 1o2 there appeared a 1 1 1 triplet epr signal of tempol in case of both mno2 and periodate applied regardless of the presence of sulfanilamide fig 6b given that tempol is a paramagnetic reaction intermediate between temp and 1o2 the presence of tempol clearly demonstrates the existence of singlet oxygen consistent with the radical quenching tests neither dmpo oh nor dmpo o2 with hyperfine splittings of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 1 1 respectively was detected in the mno2 periodate system fig 6c instead the exclusive spectrum of dmpox with hyperfine splittings of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 as shown in fig 6c was discovered after 2 min and 5 min reactions andrew et al 2003 as found by bilski et al dmpo can be directly oxidized by 1o2 via single electron transfer bilski et al 1996 therefore the occurrence of dmpox here might be a byproduct of 1o2 oxidation it was proposed that the production of 1o2 could be initiated by o2 recombination which was generated in the coexistence of periodate and oxygen hamdaoui and merouani 2017 additionally molecular oxygen was also proven as an indispensable driving force during bisphenol a degradation by mn2 activated periodate du et al 2019b to validate the role of dissolved oxygen the reaction was conducted in deoxygenated solution with continues nitrogen gas purging the sulfanilamide degradation efficiency was not altered under either anoxic or aerobic condition in the present study fig 6d in addition the esr single of tempol and dmpox that captured in the mno2 periodate system was totally not hindered under nitrogen exposure conditions fig s8 this further indicated that dissolved oxygen and superoxide radicals were not a necessary for 1o2 generation when periodate was activated on mno2 besides this also proved that the activation of periodate mediated by mno2 was a heterogeneous process because the efficient activation of periodate by mn2 requires the involvement of dissolved oxygen du et al 2019b except for 1o2 the contribution of other pathways to sulfanilamide oxidation cannot be fully excluded yet although nan3 slowed the sulfanilamide removal it was also observed that nan3 only offered a limited inhibition since the overall removal rate of sulfanilamide still reached 95 within 60 min reaction meanwhile increasing concentrations of nan3 from 0 1 mmol l to 0 2 mmol l did not further improve the inhibition efficiency of sulfanilamide degradation fig s9 considering the high dosage of nan3 it could be speculated that the residual sulfanilamide degradation was attributed to other oxidizing powers such as io3 furthermore it s worth noting that the time profile degradation of sulfanilamide followed the pseudo zero order kinetics in the presence of nan3 the fitting lines shown in fig s9 this result suggested that the sulfanilamide degradation after deducting the contribution of 1o2 was a surface catalytic process relying on the amount of surface active sites of mno2 irrespective of pollutant concentration it was in agreement with the results obtained above that the overall k obs exhibited a good linear correlation with mno2 dosage fig 4d based on this kinetic study it is suspected that periodate was likely to develop a metastable complex with manganese in form of mn iv o io3 this complex could be steadily formed given that the initial addition of periodate was much higher than that of sulfanilamide the metastable mn iv o io3 complex not only further break up to generate 1o2 but also was able to directly oxidize sulfanilamide during which surface bound io3 was possibly formed as they interacted the share of 1o2 and io3 would change with ph variation the inhibition efficiency of nan3 at different initial ph predicted that the sulfanilamide degradation by io3 would maintain similar across ph range of 4 0 9 0 fig s10 however because the overall sulfanilamide degradation declined with increasing initial ph fig 5a it can be reasonably inferred that the contribution from 1o2 was bigger in acidic solution and smaller in alkaline environment to explore the conversion mechanism of periodate the periodate decomposition behavior was analyzed with different initial concentration of sulfanilamide and mno2 as influencing variables in the absence of sulfanilamide a small fraction nearly 20 of io4 was decomposed within first 5 min and remained stable during the rest reaction time fig s11 interestingly the presence of sulfanilamide would remarkably strengthen the reduction of io4 and this trend continued with increased addition of sulfanilamide fig 7 a and fig s11 unsurprisingly same enhancement of io4 decomposition was also discovered while increasing the initial dosage of mno2 figs 7b and s5 consistent with the feature of surface catalytic activation moreover it was noticed that the io4 decomposition rate and the generation of io3 after 60 min reaction exhibited a positive linear relationship with initial mno2 dosage and sulfanilamide concentration fig 7a and b respectively these experimental phenomenon clearly implied that the interaction with mn iv o io3 would trigger io4 activation as well as sulfanilamide degradation this reaction was similar to an enzymatic process thus well fitted by pseudo zero order dynamic model however in the absence of sulfanilamide a small portion of io4 was also activated to produce 1o2 involving in sulfanilamide degradation fig s12 furthermore it was noticed that the stoichiometric reduction of io4 was accompanied with the formation of io3 and the total molarity of iodine reached good balance in all tested samples by adding io4 and io3 together fig s11 and fig s12 the entire transformation from io4 to io3 rather than more reductive iodine speices such as iodide would avoid the formation of hypoiodous acid hoi which is the main cause for the conversion of oxidizing organics to toxic iodinated byproducts to further explore the catalytic mechanism fresh and used mno2 was analyzed by xps to reveal the change of valence states of surface elements as shown in fig 8 a the mn 2p spectra with binding energies of 653 2 ev and 642 08 ev corresponding to mn iv were basically the same before and after the reaction this implied that the mn core is internal and stable during the catalytic activation of periodate the o 1s signal with fitting peaks at 530 and 532 8 ev assigned to mn o and oh slightly decreased from 55 44 to 51 24 after the reaction fig 8b similar to the cuo peroxymonosulfate system zhang et al 2013 the oxide was likely to be encased in a large number of hydroxyl groups the formed hydroxide can be consumed to facilitate electron exchange on the oxide water interface thus a plausible mechanism based on all the results above for mno2 meidated periodate activation is proposed as depicted in fig 9 first dissociative h2o adhere to mno2 with complexation between mno2 and surface oh groups second io4 bonded with mn iv oh and replaced oh to form mn iv o io3 third the metastable mn iv o io3 was initiated to decompose as interacted with sulfanilamide to generate of io3 and mn iv o finally the latter formed mn iv o further combined with the oxygen atom of the bonded oh to produce 1o2 under the attack of 1o2 io3 sulfanilamide was then directly oxidized to degradation intermediates 6 mn iv oh io4 mn iv o io3 oh 7 mn iv o io3 mn iv o io3 8 mn iv o 2oh mn iv 1o2 h2o 9 1o2 io3 org org ox because 1o2 selectively oxidize organics the degradation of diverse pollutants was evaluated to further understand the effectiveness of the mno2 periodate process fig s13 shows that acid orange ii and sulfamethoxazole were rapidly and completely degraded whereas only 84 of p nitrophenol was removed after 60 min reaction this result is consistent with the previous literature that 1o2 was less effective for phenolic compounds bokare and choi 2015 therefore the mno2 periodate system could be a potential choice for selective destruction of antibiotic pollutants 4 conclusions in summary a new advanced oxidation process was developed by activating periodate using manganese oxides for the degradation of sulfanilamide among diverse manganese oxides mno2 showed the highest catalytic efficiency for periodate activation which was exclusively converted to iodate via a heterogeneous process under the condition of 0 2 g l manganese oxides and 1 0 mm periodate without ph adjustment 10 mg l sulfanilamide was completely removed after 5 min at fastest and no efficiency loss was noticed after 3 runs of reaction notably the sulfanilamide degradation rate and periodate reduction were linearly enhanced by increasing mno2 dosage but significantly suppressed at higher initial ph however the variation of ionic strength water anions and humic acid could insignificantly influence the reaction as inferred from the radical quenching epr characterization and also anoxic tests 1o2 and surface bound io3 were discovered to be the prominent active oxidizing species periodate would complex with mn iv oh to form metastable mn iv o io3 with replacement of oh then mn iv o io3 was further activated immediately while interacting with sulfanilamide generating 1o2 and io3 for the oxidation of sulfanilamide this study of periodate activation catalyzed on manganese oxides will be of

18371,this study presents a novel periodate oxidation system mediated by manganese oxides for the rapid removal of aqueous contaminants the catalytic activation of periodate on manganese oxides was demonstrated as an efficient advanced oxidation system for degradation of sulfanilamide the reactivity of manganese oxides with different mn valence followed the order of mno2 mn3o4 mn2o3 all of which showed extraordinary reusability during repeated activation of periodate sulfanilamide was rapidly degraded along with stoichiometric transformation of io4 to io3 and both processes exhibited good linear correlations with the dosage of manganese oxides while the degradation of sulfanilamide in the mno2 io4 system was accelerated at lower solution ph it was only slightly affected by ionic strength water anions and humic acid in contrast to the homogeneous system of mn2 io4 sulfanilamide degradation was not influenced in oxic and anoxic environment it was evidenced by quenching studies and epr tests that both singlet oxygen 1o2 and iodate radicals io3 were generated when the metastable mn iv o io3 interacted with sulfanilamide the xps spectra of mn 2p and o 1s before and after reactions indicated that the catalytic activation of periodate on mno2 was not in company with the redox cycling of mn iv species graphical abstract image 1 keywords periodate diverse manganese oxides mno2 sulfanilamide singlet oxygen 1 introduction during the past two decades wide detection of antibiotic pharmaceuticals in wastewater and natural water bodies has raised concerns about their adverse effects on water security and ecological systems liu et al 2018 carvalho and santos 2016 although the environmental pollution caused by antibiotics is normally in low concentrations at the level of ng

frequently found along with the occurrence of antibiotic pollution gao et al 2018 hamiwe et al 2019 sulfonamides are broad spectrum antibiotics and are popularly used as prescription medicines and agricultural herbicides till now sulfonamides have been frequently detected in purified wastewater and natural water bodies carvalho and santos 2016 yan et al 2018 due to the high consumption and poor biodegradation in sewage treatment plants sulfonamides can easily escape and enter aquatic environments fekadu et al 2019 dinh et al investigated the occurrence of sulfonamides in wastewater bodies in france and found that the concentration level could reach as high as 1 4 μg l in seine river tuc dinh et al 2011 since sulfonamides are the most detected antibiotics the development of its effective treatment has become an emerging and important task for environmental protection advanced oxidation processes aops have been preferentially considered for degradation of refractory organic pollutants for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation normally the successful implement of advanced oxidation processes requires the conjunction of oxidants i e h2o2 persulfate salts ozone with their activation catalysts as oxidants themselves are not active enough to directly destruct organic compounds reactive species with much stronger oxidizing capacity should be generated via proper activation oh et al 2016 rahim pouran et al 2014 for example h2o2 and persulfate activated by transition metal catalysts to produce hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 have been shown to be efficient for the degradation of most organic contaminants tsitonaki et al 2010 bokare and choi 2014 therefore intensive efforts have been devoted to exploring the application of various oxidants and improving their activation techniques periodate io4 1 60 v is typically used to selectively oxidize c2 c3 carbonyl groups and introduce aldehydes for cellulose modification sirvio et al 2011 very recently activated periodate has exhibited great potential for destruction of refractory pollutants periodate itself without activation possesses very limited oxidizing capacity to independently degrade organic contaminants therefore alternative activation processes are added including uv irradiation freezing alkaline and also reactive catalysts cao et al 2010 choi et al 2018a li et al 2016 bokare and choi 2015 several reactive species including oh o 3p io3 io4 and non radical species such as o3 and h2o2 were reported to be generated via photoactivation gözmen et al 2009 besides bokare and choi found that alkali is capable of activating periodate to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 under both anoxic and oxic conditions bokare and choi 2015 in their study pharmaceutical e g cimetidine and ranitidine rather than phenolic contaminants e g bisphenol a and 4 chlorophenol could be selectively degraded in kio4 koh system without uv irradiation li et al observed the effective degradation of ao7 in the reaction system containing iodine doped granular activated carbon i gac and periodate li et al 2017 although periodate is potentially an efficient and selective oxidant for water contaminants destruction there are still very limited approaches for its activation and it is necessary to have specific equipment and external energy consumption in many cases transition metals have been frequently used as aop catalysts to generate reactive radicals for example fe ii coupled with h2o2 well known as fenton reagent is extensively applied for pre treatment or post treatment of refractory wastewater pignatello et al 2006 cobalt initiates peroxymonsulfate activation to form sulfate radicals anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 similarly the combination of periodate with transition metals in some cases also provides a potential option for periodate functional oxidation shah et al 2016 specially the mn ii catalyzed indicator reaction with periodate has been investigated to determine the concentration of some transition metals including mn ii ru iii rh iii os iv and ir iv or some specific organic compounds vlessidis and evmiridis 2009 in addition to non metallic catalysts lee et al employed the bimetallic nfe0 ni and nfe0 cu nanoparticles as a periodate activator and found that ni or cu was the key component to activate io4 for contaminants degradation lee et al 2014 however the conjunction of periodate with heterogeneous metal oxides for wastewater treatment is rarely studied and the related mechanism remains further exploration manganese oxides have been widely used as catalyst or adsorbent for water decontamination with advantages of low cost and environmental compatibility they have shown promising performances for the catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate for organic pollutants degradation saputra et al 2013a 2013b the present study investigates the use of diverse manganese oxides at different mn valence states as heterogeneous catalysts to activate periodate for the degradation of aquatic sulfanilamide which is an important raw material or intermediate for sulfonamides production the effect of some key reaction parameters the redox transformation of manganese species the main reactive radicals and the catalyst reusability were studied to reveal the working mechanism of this novel oxidation system the system integrating manganese oxides with periodate is expected to provide an alternative strategy for oxidative removal of aqueous antibiotic contaminants and the findings in the present study will broaden the mechanistic insight into this new process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfanilamide and naclo4 were obtained from aladdin of analytical grade methanol and acetonitrile in hplc grade were

solution 1 6 mol l 1 at the temperature of 90 c was slowly added into the kmno4 solution using a separation funnel the mixed solution was continuously stirred with a glass rod after the reaction the supernatant was layered and poured to remove the unreacted kmno4 the solids were vacuum filtered repeatedly washed with ultra pure water until the conductivity of the filtrate was lower than 0 2 ms cm

manganese oxides powder was measured via acid base titration following the steps adopted previously du et al 2019a 2 3 oxidation procedure and analysis the experiments were conducted at ambient temperature 20 2 c in 250 ml glass flask with magnetic stirring the reaction system contains 100 ml solution with desired initial concentration of sulfanilamide an aliquot of stock solution of periodate and mno2 or other catalysts were sequentially injected to initiate the degradation reaction at specific time intervals 1 ml sample was collected from the reaction system immediately mixed with 1 ml sodium thiosulfate to terminate the reaction and then filtered through 0 22 μm syringe membrane filter for high performance liquid chromatography analysis to evaluate the stability of the catalysts the used catalysts were washed with deionized ethanol and water by the centrifuge then dried at 70 c for 12 h since small amount of particle loss was unavoidable during recycling and washing processes several parallel experiments were conducted in each run to maintain the sufficient catalyst dose for the next run to explore the effect of oxygen to the mno2 periodate system the reactions were carried out under anoxic environment to exclude the role of oxygen generally deoxygenated water purged with n2 for 90 min was used and nitrogen gas was continually purged throughout the whole reaction concentrations of residual sulfanilamide periodate and iodate were qualified using a rigol l 3000 hplc equipped with a compass c18 column 5 μm 4 6 250 mm the detection wavelengths of sulfanilamide were 266 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and water at a ratio of 55 45 v v for sulfanilamide periodate and iodate were detected at 218 nm with a mobile phase consisting of

generated from periodate activation were detected by jes fa200 epr spectrometer using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo or 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as the radical catcher 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of manganese oxides xrd analysis was used to elucidate the crystalline features of as prepared manganese oxides with different mn valence in fig 1 a the diffraction peaks occurred at 12 65 18 05 22 26 25 41 28 48 37 57 41 95 59 94 65 44 68 54 and 69 70 which can be matched with the crystal planes of 100 110 111 200 201 003 113 214 005 501 and 333 of cryptomelane type mno2 jcpds no 12 0706 a 9 84 å annealing treatment of mno2 particles at 550 c for 5 h generated a different xrd pattern spectrum b shown in fig 1b with peaks observed at ca 23 1 32 9 37 9 55 2 65 7 and they corresponded to the crystal planes of 211 222 400 440 and 622 of mn2o3 jcpds no 31 0825 a 9 406 å respectively in addition after annealed at 950 c for 2 h mno2 was further transformed to mn3o4 with the xrd spectrum c fig 1c the spectrum c could be indexed to the hausmannite mn3o4 jcpds no 01 1127 a 5 75 å with the peaks at ca 18 1 28 9 32 4 36 2 58 6 59 9 corresponding to the 101 112 103 211 321 224 planes of mn3o4 the xrd results confirmed that mno2 was formed through the hydrothermal precipitation between kmno4 and mnso4 and mn2o3 and mn3o4 were prepared via further calcination of mno2 at different annealing temperatures the morphology observation of mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 was conducted by sem as shown in fig 2 a and fig s1a individual mno2 was grown into nanorods and aggregated like a micro scaled sea urchin forming hierarchical nano micro structures the sem images of mn2o3 exhibit mixture phases of nanorods and nanosheets fig 2b and fig s1b the crystal form of nanosheet was obtained via the conversion of mno2 nanorods during the annealing treatment at 550 c however this transformation was not thoroughly proceeded because of the temperature limitation as the calcination temperature went up to 950 c mno2 nanorods were completely converted to well defined mn3o4 nanosheets with a diameter of hundreds of nanometers fig 2c and fig s1c apparently the particle size of the three catalysts followed an order of mn3o4 mn2o3 mno2 in addition the elemental composition of the three catalysts was further analyzed by eds as shown in fig s2 and table s1 in supporting material the ratios between elemental o and mn were nearly 2 0 1 46 and 1 27 for mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 catalysts respectively which were consistent with their chemical formula and xrd results 3 2 catalytic periodate activation and reusability of catalysts fig 3 a shows the curves of sulfanilamide degradation by activated periodate in presence or absence of different mn oxides control experiments with either periodate or mn oxides alone were unable to directly remove sulfanilamide in comparison the sulfanilamide degradation could only rapidly proceed in the coexistence of manganese oxides and periodate as shown in fig 3a although complete removal of sulfanilamide could be reached with different manganese oxides the coupling of mno2 with io4 showed the highest efficiency for the degradation of sulfanilamide the catalytic activity of different manganese oxides for the activation of periodate followed an order of mno2 mn3o4 mn2o3 according to sulfanilamide degradation profiles on the one hand mno2 might possess more reactive sites for periodate activation than mn3o4 and mn2o3 because of its smaller particle size on the other hand mn3 on mn2o3 surface tended to disproportionate in oxide water interface might influence its catalytic stability in other words mno2 with higher valence state mn iv was more efficient for periodate activation than mn2o3 and mn3o4 with lower valence states mn ii mn iii indicating that mn species might not have simply acted as the electron donor the similar clue could be found that nanosized zero valent iron a strong reductant was unable to activate periodate for 4 chlorophenol degradation but only reduce it to iodate lee et al 2014 to evaluate the reusability of mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 for the catalytic periodate activation cycling tests were further conducted with recycled mn catalysts intriguingly as shown in fig 3b the removal efficiency of sulfanilamide was completely unchanged after three times reuse of mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 respectively with simple process of centrifugation and drying meanwhile the leaching of mn ions during periodate activation mostly maintained at a low level fig s3a and less than 50 μg l mn ions were leached after each run in the mno2 periodate system fig s3b the low level mn leaching and good reusability indicated that the manganese oxide materials could maintain excellent stability without any deactivation during the periodate oxidation of sulfanilamide this result was different from that obtained in systems driven by mn species redox in which the conversion of original mn species would more or less decelerate the pollutant degradation rates during repeated applications saputra et al 2012 2013b other than metallic catalysts li et al also reported that dried granular activated carbon could repeatedly activate periodate for ao7 degradation without any deactivation however detailed mechanisms of this excellent reusability are still unclear and the direct transformation of periodate to reactive oxidizing intermediate without redox cycling of catalytic manganese species cannot be excluded 3 3 effect of catalyst dosage and initial ph to exhibit the best performance of tested catalysts and its high potential for practical application the influential factors including catalyst dose and solution ph were further examined as shown in fig 4 the increment of manganese oxides accelerated the degradation rate of sulfanilamide with its dosage changing from 0 1 g l 1 to 0 4 g l 1 apparently mno2 exhibited a higher reactivity than mn2o3 and mn3o4 with the same catalyst dosage the sulfanilamide degradation behaviors with different manganese oxides could be well fitted by pseudo first order reaction model in which the fitted curve checks fairly well with experimental dots the calculated rate constant k presented a linear relationship with catalyst dosage for mno2 mn2o3 and mn3o4 fig 4d these results indicated that the periodate oxidation of sulfanilamide on mnox was highly dependent on the number of active sites provided by manganese catalysts the solution ph is an influential parameter since it affects the species of periodate as well as pollutants du et al 2019b fig 5 a shows the degradation rate constant of sulfanilamide at various initial ph in the presence of three different manganese oxides in general the removal efficiency of sulfanilamide decreased obviously with ph increase from 3 0 to 9 0 with main decline occurring mostly across ph 3 7 the results indicated that acidic conditions favored periodate activation there are two typical trends regarding the ph effect on the periodate oxidation as reported previously in most cases the pollutant degradation by periodate was accelerated at lower ph especially in strong acidic conditions li et al 2017 lee et al 2014 bendjama et al 2018 choi et al 2018b however on the other side uv induced activation of periodate was also reported to be optimized at near neutral ph for dye degradation lee and yoon 2004 ghodbane and hamdaoui 2016 the obtained controversial effect of ph could be linked to the species of sulfanilamide and periodate it is known that the pk a of sulfanilamide is 10 65 therefore sulfanilamide was mostly presented in form of molecular compound across ph 3 10 meanwhile the periodate species changes with ph variation where io4 dominates at ph lower than 8 and the dimerized h2i2o10 4 is dominant at ph 8 this species variation of periodate was highly related with its oxidation potential which would decrease from 1 6 ev to 0 7 ev with increasing ph across acidic to alkaline conditions fatiadi 1974 besides the ph pzc of manganese oxides were detected to be in range of 4 5 fig s4 manganese oxides would be negatively charged when the solution ph ph pzc thus the solid surface would carry more negative charge at higher ph leading to stronger repulsion between catalysts and periodate anions in short the periodate oxidation of sulfanilamide with manganese oxides is better to be carried out under acid and neutral conditions given that leached mn2 was also an effective activator for periodate du et al 2019b the role of homogeneous degradation of sulfanilamide under different ph conditions was further explored specifically concentrations of leached mn solutions at different ph values were detected in the mno2 periodate system as depicted in fig s5 more mn ions leached with the increase of ph from 3 to 8 and then slightly decreased at ph 9 the highest concentration of leached mn ions was detected to be 47 5 μg l at ph 4 to investigate the role of homogeneous reaction in the mno2 periodate system as high as 50 μg l mn2 was used to activate periodate in the absence of mno2 to maximize the homogeneous degradation the results shown in fig s6 indicated that the removal of sulfanilamide was significant at initial ph 4 8 but inconspicuous at ph 3 and ph 9 in the mn2 io4 system a maximum rate of 20 of sulfanilamide could be degraded at ph 4 after 60 min reaction this result suggested that homogeneous reaction only accounted for a small portion for the degradation of sulfanilamide actually the heterogeneous reaction on mno2 surface was fast enough so that the homogeneous reaction induced by leached mn ions made a less contribution to the degradation of sulfanilamide for instance sulfanilamide could be rapidly degraded at ph 3 in the system of mno2 periodate but negligible removal of sulfanilamide could be observed in homogeneous solution under the same condition indicating that the homogeneous reaction played a minor role during the mno2 induced periodate activation in summary the sulfanilamide degradation in the mno2 periodate system was mainly a heterogeneous process 3 4 effect of ionic strength water anions and humic acid the catalytic sites could combine with periodate via either electrostatic or covalent bonding in general the electrostatic adherence will be weakened with increase of ionic strength whereas the covalent bonding is less sensitive to the variation of ionic strength stumm 1992 as shown in fig 5b the sulfanilamide degradation was slightly affected in the presence of 0 05 mol l naclo4 but after that little changed was observed with further increase of ionic strength this phenomena was also frequently monitored during the heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate by transition metal oxides zhang et al 2013 the increase of solution ionic strength would weaken the electrostatic adherence by compressing the thickness of the electric double layer on oxide surface the above results implied that periodate bonded with the surface mn iv mainly via a strong covalent interaction and electrostatic bonding contributed a minor role to the reaction rate that is the surface mn iv sites is more likely to coordinate with the uncharged o of periodate and facilitate its activation water anions including nitrate chloride bicarbonate and phosphate are common influential factors for advanced oxidation processes to avoid the change of ph induced by bicarbonate and phosphate the solution initial ph was adjusted to 5 4 again after the addition of water anions as presented in fig 5c the removal rate of sulfanilamide by mno2 periodate was not much influenced in the presence of 2 0 mmol l nitrate chloride and phosphate anions but slightly suppressed by bicarbonate ions the result obtained for phosphate was inconsistent with our previous study in which phosphate exhibited significant inhibition to the mn2 periodate system for bisphenol a degradation du et al 2019b phosphate might exert a stronger complexation with aqueous mn2 ions than the heterogeneous mn iv oxides because of its frail coordination capacity huang et al 2017 moreover the role of bicarbonate on transition metals and advanced oxidations involves complicated processes and have shown controversial results feng et al 2016 ma and graham 2000 the slight inhibition of bicarbonate here could be due to its radical scavenging role as reported previously ma and graham 2000 the hco3 and co3 radical might be produced by reaction of the possible oxidizing species and bicarbonate in the mno2 periodate system eqs 1 and 2 the negligible effect of cl and no3 indicated that they were inert enough to be oxidized by mno2 periodate as depicted in eq 3 and eq 4 otherwise the generation of chlorine radicals or nitrate radicals would consume reactive oxidizing species of periodate activation to some extent yuan et al 2011 machulek et al 2007 more importantly it should be noted that non involvement of cl and no3 also reduces the risk of generation of more toxic intermediates 2 io4 hco3 h2o io3 hco3 2oh 3 hco3 co3 h 4 io4 cl h2o io3 cl 2oh 5 io4 no3 h2o io3 no3 2oh the influence of humic acid ha on the removal of sulfanilamide in the mno2 periodate system is depicted in fig 5d the results indicated that the presence of ha could inhibit the depletion rate of sulfanilamide and this inhibition was slightly enhanced with increasing ha concentration from 2 mg l to 50 mg l however it was noticed that this inhibition was unable to stop the complete removal of sulfanilamide with 60 min reaction this result was in disagreement with that obtained in the systems of mn2 periodate du et al 2019b and alkaline periodate bokare and choi 2015 in which ha acted a promotive role during the generation of singlet oxygen in fact ha was also report to be a target compound during the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants for example ha could be effectively degraded by nico2o4 activated peroxymonosulfate in which 1o2 was detected as the dominant active oxidizing intermediate tian et al 2018 moreover ha might adsorb onto the oxide surface occupying the active site of reactive manganese site therefore the presence of ha would interfere or compete with sulfanilamide to be degraded in some extent it is also suggested that the mno2 periodate system worked in a different pathway from the homogeneous systems where ha acted as a promoter or electron transfer mediator bokare and choi 2015 du et al 2019b in summary these results indicated that ionic strength water anions and humic acid could take limited effect on the mno2 catalyzed activation of periodate as a further evidence the mno2 periodate system also exhibited high effectiveness for sulfanilamide destruction in sewage water compared to that proceeded in pure water fig s7 in supporting material 3 5 possible oxidizing species and catalytic mechanism periodate is a versatile oxidant capable of producing multiple reactive oxidizing species via proper activation hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygens 1o2 and iodate radicals io3 were frequently reported to be plausible oxidizing species involved in the periodate oxidation systems bokare and choi 2015 choi et al 2018b chia et al 2004 except for iodate radicals the other three species are well known to oxidize organic pollutants at high reaction rates and can be identified via radical quenching tests to identify radicals responsible for sulfanilamide degradation the effect of various radical scavengers was evaluated ethanol is a typical oh quencher while benzoquinone bq k bq o2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 is usually used to scavenge o2 the results as shown in fig 6 a indicated that ethanol and benzoquinone fully failed to capture any reactive oxidizing species even in high concentration the oxidation by 1o2 was evaluated using sodium azide nan3 k nan3 1o2 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 as the exclusive inhibitor mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 because nan3 rapidly reacted with singlet oxygen the sulfanilamide removal in the mno2 periodate system was significantly suppressed with a noticeable slower degradation rate the above results suggested that there was no contribution from oh and o2 and 1o2 possibly made a dominant role during the oxidation of sulfanilamide the epr spectra of reactive oxidizing species were further monitored using temp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents not surprisingly periodate or mno2 alone did not trigger any characteristic peaks in the presence of either temp or dmpo conversely when temp was applied to capture 1o2 there appeared a 1 1 1 triplet epr signal of tempol in case of both mno2 and periodate applied regardless of the presence of sulfanilamide fig 6b given that tempol is a paramagnetic reaction intermediate between temp and 1o2 the presence of tempol clearly demonstrates the existence of singlet oxygen consistent with the radical quenching tests neither dmpo oh nor dmpo o2 with hyperfine splittings of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 1 1 respectively was detected in the mno2 periodate system fig 6c instead the exclusive spectrum of dmpox with hyperfine splittings of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 as shown in fig 6c was discovered after 2 min and 5 min reactions andrew et al 2003 as found by bilski et al dmpo can be directly oxidized by 1o2 via single electron transfer bilski et al 1996 therefore the occurrence of dmpox here might be a byproduct of 1o2 oxidation it was proposed that the production of 1o2 could be initiated by o2 recombination which was generated in the coexistence of periodate and oxygen hamdaoui and merouani 2017 additionally molecular oxygen was also proven as an indispensable driving force during bisphenol a degradation by mn2 activated periodate du et al 2019b to validate the role of dissolved oxygen the reaction was conducted in deoxygenated solution with continues nitrogen gas purging the sulfanilamide degradation efficiency was not altered under either anoxic or aerobic condition in the present study fig 6d in addition the esr single of tempol and dmpox that captured in the mno2 periodate system was totally not hindered under nitrogen exposure conditions fig s8 this further indicated that dissolved oxygen and superoxide radicals were not a necessary for 1o2 generation when periodate was activated on mno2 besides this also proved that the activation of periodate mediated by mno2 was a heterogeneous process because the efficient activation of periodate by mn2 requires the involvement of dissolved oxygen du et al 2019b except for 1o2 the contribution of other pathways to sulfanilamide oxidation cannot be fully excluded yet although nan3 slowed the sulfanilamide removal it was also observed that nan3 only offered a limited inhibition since the overall removal rate of sulfanilamide still reached 95 within 60 min reaction meanwhile increasing concentrations of nan3 from 0 1 mmol l to 0 2 mmol l did not further improve the inhibition efficiency of sulfanilamide degradation fig s9 considering the high dosage of nan3 it could be speculated that the residual sulfanilamide degradation was attributed to other oxidizing powers such as io3 furthermore it s worth noting that the time profile degradation of sulfanilamide followed the pseudo zero order kinetics in the presence of nan3 the fitting lines shown in fig s9 this result suggested that the sulfanilamide degradation after deducting the contribution of 1o2 was a surface catalytic process relying on the amount of surface active sites of mno2 irrespective of pollutant concentration it was in agreement with the results obtained above that the overall k obs exhibited a good linear correlation with mno2 dosage fig 4d based on this kinetic study it is suspected that periodate was likely to develop a metastable complex with manganese in form of mn iv o io3 this complex could be steadily formed given that the initial addition of periodate was much higher than that of sulfanilamide the metastable mn iv o io3 complex not only further break up to generate 1o2 but also was able to directly oxidize sulfanilamide during which surface bound io3 was possibly formed as they interacted the share of 1o2 and io3 would change with ph variation the inhibition efficiency of nan3 at different initial ph predicted that the sulfanilamide degradation by io3 would maintain similar across ph range of 4 0 9 0 fig s10 however because the overall sulfanilamide degradation declined with increasing initial ph fig 5a it can be reasonably inferred that the contribution from 1o2 was bigger in acidic solution and smaller in alkaline environment to explore the conversion mechanism of periodate the periodate decomposition behavior was analyzed with different initial concentration of sulfanilamide and mno2 as influencing variables in the absence of sulfanilamide a small fraction nearly 20 of io4 was decomposed within first 5 min and remained stable during the rest reaction time fig s11 interestingly the presence of sulfanilamide would remarkably strengthen the reduction of io4 and this trend continued with increased addition of sulfanilamide fig 7 a and fig s11 unsurprisingly same enhancement of io4 decomposition was also discovered while increasing the initial dosage of mno2 figs 7b and s5 consistent with the feature of surface catalytic activation moreover it was noticed that the io4 decomposition rate and the generation of io3 after 60 min reaction exhibited a positive linear relationship with initial mno2 dosage and sulfanilamide concentration fig 7a and b respectively these experimental phenomenon clearly implied that the interaction with mn iv o io3 would trigger io4 activation as well as sulfanilamide degradation this reaction was similar to an enzymatic process thus well fitted by pseudo zero order dynamic model however in the absence of sulfanilamide a small portion of io4 was also activated to produce 1o2 involving in sulfanilamide degradation fig s12 furthermore it was noticed that the stoichiometric reduction of io4 was accompanied with the formation of io3 and the total molarity of iodine reached good balance in all tested samples by adding io4 and io3 together fig s11 and fig s12 the entire transformation from io4 to io3 rather than more reductive iodine speices such as iodide would avoid the formation of hypoiodous acid hoi which is the main cause for the conversion of oxidizing organics to toxic iodinated byproducts to further explore the catalytic mechanism fresh and used mno2 was analyzed by xps to reveal the change of valence states of surface elements as shown in fig 8 a the mn 2p spectra with binding energies of 653 2 ev and 642 08 ev corresponding to mn iv were basically the same before and after the reaction this implied that the mn core is internal and stable during the catalytic activation of periodate the o 1s signal with fitting peaks at 530 and 532 8 ev assigned to mn o and oh slightly decreased from 55 44 to 51 24 after the reaction fig 8b similar to the cuo peroxymonosulfate system zhang et al 2013 the oxide was likely to be encased in a large number of hydroxyl groups the formed hydroxide can be consumed to facilitate electron exchange on the oxide water interface thus a plausible mechanism based on all the results above for mno2 meidated periodate activation is proposed as depicted in fig 9 first dissociative h2o adhere to mno2 with complexation between mno2 and surface oh groups second io4 bonded with mn iv oh and replaced oh to form mn iv o io3 third the metastable mn iv o io3 was initiated to decompose as interacted with sulfanilamide to generate of io3 and mn iv o finally the latter formed mn iv o further combined with the oxygen atom of the bonded oh to produce 1o2 under the attack of 1o2 io3 sulfanilamide was then directly oxidized to degradation intermediates 6 mn iv oh io4 mn iv o io3 oh 7 mn iv o io3 mn iv o io3 8 mn iv o 2oh mn iv 1o2 h2o 9 1o2 io3 org org ox because 1o2 selectively oxidize organics the degradation of diverse pollutants was evaluated to further understand the effectiveness of the mno2 periodate process fig s13 shows that acid orange ii and sulfamethoxazole were rapidly and completely degraded whereas only 84 of p nitrophenol was removed after 60 min reaction this result is consistent with the previous literature that 1o2 was less effective for phenolic compounds bokare and choi 2015 therefore the mno2 periodate system could be a potential choice for selective destruction of antibiotic pollutants 4 conclusions in summary a new advanced oxidation process was developed by activating periodate using manganese oxides for the degradation of sulfanilamide among diverse manganese oxides mno2 showed the highest catalytic efficiency for periodate activation which was exclusively converted to iodate via a heterogeneous process under the condition of 0 2 g l manganese oxides and 1 0 mm periodate without ph adjustment 10 mg l sulfanilamide was completely removed after 5 min at fastest and no efficiency loss was noticed after 3 runs of reaction notably the sulfanilamide degradation rate and periodate reduction were linearly enhanced by increasing mno2 dosage but significantly suppressed at higher initial ph however the variation of ionic strength water anions and humic acid could insignificantly influence the reaction as inferred from the radical quenching epr characterization and also anoxic tests 1o2 and surface bound io3 were discovered to be the prominent active oxidizing species periodate would complex with mn iv oh to form metastable mn iv o io3 with replacement of oh then mn iv o io3 was further activated immediately while interacting with sulfanilamide generating 1o2 and io3 for the oxidation of sulfanilamide this study of periodate activation catalyzed on manganese oxides will be of

cocktail effect pharmaceuticals biochemical responses 1 introduction aquatic biota is chronically exposed to multiple exogenous substances many of these compounds are suspected to impact living organisms and human health and their combination in complex mixtures could exacerbate their harmful effects delfosse et al 2015 among them pharmaceuticals have recently emerged as pollutants of high concern in the aquatic environment where they are commonly introduced as complex mixtures via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents desbiolles et al 2018 gros et al 2007 many of the past studies on aquatic organisms have focused on toxicity assessment of single pharmaceuticals for review see blaise et al 2006 crane et al 2006 fent et al 2006 godoy et al 2015 most of the bioassays currently used investigate short time exposure 72 h or 96 h at concentrations in the mg l range i e well above those found in the aquatic environment desbiolles et al 2018 since the concentrations of each pharmaceutical in receiving waters and effluents are low their potential toxic effects on aquatic organisms and even on humans have been often neglected until recent years nonetheless it has been demonstrated that combined low concentrations of pharmaceuticals having similar biological activities could lead to additive or synergistic effects that could be ecotoxicologically relevant brain et

various biological parameters of the two selected model organisms photosynthetic pigments and flavonoids are good indicators of plant health croft and chen 2018 however sampling for phytometabolites bioassays are usually done at the end of exposure experiments with destructive techniques we hypothesized that a daily monitoring of those metabolites will be more accurate for early detection of effect of pharmaceutical exposure using a non destructive analytical equipment moreover since in animal models pharmaceutical exposure may act on physiological and behavioral features an integrative analysis of pharmaceutical exposure may need to include the study of many endpoints from biochemical to populational levels bearing in mind to fit tightly to environmental realistic conditions our work aimed to investigate how far a panel of tests covering molecular to macroscopic level using two biological models could improve the capability to detect a potential effect of selected pharmaceuticals furthermore crossed effects between chemical pollution and climate change were noticed on community structure and ecosystem functioning dossena et al 2012 thus to question potential cross effects of pollution and climate change experiments have been carried out at the classic breeding temperature 19 5 c and at a higher temperature of 23 c indeed it could be hypothesized that temperature rising affects the sensitiveness of organisms to pollutants and reversely chemical exposure may decrease the thermal tolerance of organisms therefore the crossed effects of these stressors must be investigated as it could entrain a decreased in the fitness of wild populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals carbamazepine cbz and acridine 9 carboxylic acid 9 caa were provided by sigma aldrich saint quentin fallavier france and oxcarbazepine oxcbz by vwr international france fontenay sous bois france and were available as powders purity 97 the stock solutions of each compound were prepared in ultrapure water direct q 5uv millipore at concentrations of 100 40 and 20 mg l for cbz oxcbz and 9 caa respectively after stirring 2 day long in the dark and at 25 c the solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c for 2 months thus enabling the ecotoxicological tests on chronic exposure the stability of the compounds under these conditions was checked by hplc monitoring test solutions of 600 27 and 900 ng l were prepared for cbz oxcbz and 9 caa respectively and a mixture of them at the same latter concentrations was also prepared this range of concentrations was chosen based on concentrations found in treated municipal effluents ferrari et al 2003 gros et al 2012 kaiser et al 2014 2 2 plant bioassay using phytometabolites duckweeds lemna minor l were collected from a freshwater basin of the botanic garden in saint jérôme campus aix marseille university france the population was cultivated in a modified 10 hoagland solution sigma aldrich in glass beakers beakers with duckweeds at 100 confluence were then put in a phytotron mlr 351h sanyo with a 11 13 h day night cycle with 60 of humidity and light intensity of 20 μmol m2 s at 15 c to lower algal proliferation for 17 days each condition of exposure to pharmaceuticals and their mixture was done in 5 replicates in 40 ml glass dishes and compared with a control containing only the culture solution duckweeds were maintained in the same solution during all the experiment time phytometabolites were monitored with a non destructive measurement equipment multiplex force a orsay france using fluorescence technology with multiple excitations to measure constitutive and induced flavonols anthocyanins chlorophylls and a chlorophyll to flavonoid ratio referred to as nitrogen balance index nbi as previously described by ellili et al 2017 for each condition the duckweed fronds were in contact with the measurement cell of the multiplex to ensure that the focal distance was the same for all samples and measurements were done in triplicate per 40 ml glass dishes 2 3 animal bioassays the clonal population of hydra circumcincta arises from a polyp given by the laboratoire interdisciplinaire des environnements continentaux lorraine university metz france culture maintenance procedure was adapted from that developed by trottier et al 1997 briefly tes buffer ph 7 n tris hydroxymethyl methyl 2aminoethanesulfonic acid merck chimie sas fontenay sous bois france was used as culture media and the polyps were fed every three days with 24 h hatched artemia sp nauplii the polyp culture was raised at a constant temperature of 19 5 0 1 c with a 12 12 h light dark cycle 2 3 1 chronic toxicity test all pharmaceutical solutions were diluted in tes buffer experiments were carried out on six sterile multi well polystyrene microplates healthy non budding h circumcincta polyps of similar size were randomly collected among a population of more than 1000 polyps under a stereomicroscope for each condition 12 polyps per well were filled with 8 ml of test solutions and tests were done in triplicate the multi well microplates were covered to prevent evaporation and placed into a thermo regulated incubator at 19 5 0 1 c or 23 0 1 c under a 12 12 h light dark cycle for two weeks animals were fed the day before the beginning of the experiment and then each three days day 3 6 9 and 12 with about 10 artemia sp larvae per polyp capacity to catch and ingest prey was recorded for each well the media was renewed after a 4 h feeding period daily morphology was monitored and the number of buds and new polyps was counted to determine the asexual reproduction at the end of the two week exposure period the media was carefully removed and the living polyps were rapidly frozen and kept at 80 c until oxidative stress measurements criteria used to classify the intensity of toxic effects based on experimental endpoints i e morphological changes budding and reproductive hydra rates were the following 1 non toxic 0 20 effect 2 moderately toxic 21 40 effect 3 toxic 41 60 effect 4 highly toxic 61 80 effect and 5 extremely toxic 81 100 arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 2 3 2 asexual reproduction evaluation of budding and reproductive hydra rates the budding rate ktot considering the number of attached buds and new polyps i e separate buds was calculated according to the following formula ktot ln n tot ln n d in which n is the number of polyps at the beginning of the experiment and n tot the sum of the number of attached buds and the number of polyps detached buds and initial polyps after d days of exposure according to de jong et al 2016 the reproductive hydra rate rhr during the two week exposure to pharmaceuticals was calculated according to the following formula rhr n n n x 100 with n number of hydra polyps after d days of exposure and n number of hydra polyps at the beginning of the experiment according to arkhipchuk et al 2006 2 3 3 morphological changes reflecting increasing toxicity the hereby morphological stage nomenclature used was previously described de jong et al 2016 pachura bouchet et al 2006 classically five morphological stages are reported a stage normal hydra sp polyps exhibit an extended body and tentacles b stage first sign of intoxication appearance of bulbs at tips of tentacles c stage second sign of intoxication shortened tentacles and body early phase d stage shortened tentacles and body late phase e stage or tulip stage tentacles and body drastically shortened this last intoxication stage leads to the animal death by disintegration f stage stages b to d are reversible and are considered as sub lethal endpoints while e and f stages are irreversible and considered as lethal endpoints 2 3 4 biomarkers of oxidative stress the disturbance of the oxidative balance equilibrium was evaluated in h circumcincta polyps exposed to chronic 14 days pharmaceutical concentrations by measuring the total antioxidant capacity aoc kit cayman chemical bertin pharma france and the lipid peroxidation by means of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay tbars assay kit cayman chemical bertin pharma the aoc with the pharmaceuticals was compared with that of trolox a water soluble tocopherol analogue and was quantified as molar trolox equivalents in the tbars assay the quantification of the malondialdehyde mda was performed by colorimetry following its controlled reaction with thiobarbituric acid 2 4 data analysis data from phytometabolite monitoring were expressed as ratios all values of each group on h circumcincta were expressed as mean s e m standard error of the mean at the end of the exposures the time pharmaceutical and temperature interactions for the hydra bioassays were analyzed by the three way anova followed by tukey test for paired comparisons when the use of parametric tests was not possible the comparisons between conditions for the duckweed and hydra bioassays were done with the kruskall wallis test followed if needed by the post hoc dunn test 3 results 3 1 plant bioassay using phytometabolites three of the monitored indices were considered one for chlorophylls i e part of the primary metabolites one for phenolic compounds i e part of the secondary metabolites and finally one corresponding to a nitrogen balance index nbi proxy of the allocation of n and c resources in the plant each index was monitored on l minor for 17 days of exposure to the pharmaceuticals 3 1 1 index of chlorophylls variations of chlorophyll indexes during the exposure to each pharmaceutical compound tested separately at environmental concentration as well as to the mixture are presented in fig 1 a no significant effects of cbz or 9 caa were observed on chlorophyll contents in l minor compared to control however duckweeds exposed to oxcbz at 27 ng l had a chlorophyll index constantly significantly higher than the control along the experiment finally no significant effects were detected on the chlorophyll index in l minor exposed to the mixture as compared to control 3 1 2 index of phenolic compounds no significant differences were detected for the index of phenolic compounds of duckweeds when exposed to each pharmaceutical cbz oxcbz 9 caa separately and to the mixture as compared to control ones fig 1b but considerable data fluctuations were noticed 3 1 3 nbi ratio no significant effects on the nbi ratio were observed over time at the environmental concentration of cbz fig 1c exposure to oxcbz significantly increased the nbi ratios as compared to control ones along the exposure period except at days 11 and 17 fig 1c these results showed an increase in the pool of nitrogen compounds compared to the pool of carbon compounds when l minor was exposed to oxcbz for 9 caa the nbi ratios were significantly higher compared to the control at days 2 5 9 11 14 and 17 for l minor exposed to the pharmaceutical mixture the nbi ratios were always significantly higher than control ones from the first day of experiment fig 1c consequently the ecotoxicity on nbi ratio was expressed continuously when the 3 compounds were combined 3 2 animal bioassay 3 2 1 asexual reproduction and feeding behavior a significant decrease of the budding rate ktot was recorded at 19 5 c in polyps exposed to cbz at day 6 and in those exposed to the mixture at days 6 and 9 fig 2 a at 23 c ktot was significantly lower from day 9 in polyps exposed to cbz and oxcbz a significantly lower ktot was also observed in polyps exposed to the mixture at days 7 12 and 14 fig 2b moreover a significant effect of the temperature on the ktot values was observed at day 3 f9 59 9 839 p 0 0001 the ktot values of each group of exposed polyps at 23 c were significantly increased as compared with those obtained at 19 5 c at 19 5 c ktot mean is 0 006 and at 23 c ktot mean is 0 066 fig 2a and b at the end of the experiment on day 14 a significant effect of the temperature on the budding rate was observed the ktot values obtained at 23 c were lower than those obtained at 19 5 c f1 1 77 002 p 0 0001 and a significant effect of the exposure to pharmaceuticals was also noticed f1 4 9 415 p 0 0001 however statistical analyses did not show any interactions between the effects of temperature and pharmaceuticals on ktot f1 4 1 623 p 0 169 at 19 5 c the reproductive rate rhr was significantly lower in polyps exposed to cbz than controls from day 9 to day 14 moreover a significantly lower rhr was also observed in polyps exposed to the mixture from day 12 fig 2c at 23 c a significantly lower rhr was observed in polyps exposed to cbz oxcbz and the mixture from day 12 to the end of the exposure fig 2d significant interactions were detected between temperature and pharmaceutical on the effects on rhr f1 4 6 946 p 0 0001 whatever the conditions no alteration of the feeding behavior was observed during the 2 week exposure as all living polyps were still able to catch and ingest their prey 3 2 2 morphological changes reflecting intoxication at 19 5 c significant morphological changes appeared at the very first day of mixture exposure only 34 7 of exposed polyps showed normal morphology a stage while b and c stages represented 48 6 and 16 7 respectively fig 3 a significant morphological changes were still observable at days 2 3 and 4 in polyps exposed to the mixture at day 4 d stages appeared in the population exposed to the mixture 4 6 and in polyps exposed to cbz 2 8 while a stages represented 46 2 and 56 3 respectively from day 5 8 all the polyps exhibited normal morphology then at day 9 some polyps exhibited b stages but the percentage of injured polyps were significantly higher only in those exposed to oxcbz where b stages represented 17 6 finally from day 10 to the end of the two week exposure none of the exposed polyps exhibited signs of impaired morphology at 23 c significant morphological changes were recorded only from day 12 where the percentage of b stages was significantly higher than in controls for all exposure conditions and represented 10 8 15 9 of the exposed population fig 3b at day 14 c stages appeared in oxcbz and mixture exposed polyps and their percentage was significantly higher than in controls b stages were still present for all exposure conditions but as b stages also appeared in control group no significant morphological changes were lasting compared to controls 3 2 3 biomarkers of oxidative stress at 19 5 c an overall significant difference f9 29 87 04 p 0 0001 two way anova in the total antioxidant capacity aoc was observed a 2 week exposure to oxcbz induced a significant two fold increase in the aoc compared to controls fig 4 a concerning the lipid peroxidation lpo an overall significant difference f9 29 68 70 p 0 0001 two way anova was detected at 19 5 c indeed compared to controls the lpo was significantly higher in polyps exposed to cbz and to 9 caa and significantly lower in those exposed to the mixture whereas no significant differences were observed in those exposed to oxcbz fig 4b at 23 c there were no significant differences in the aoc values between control and exposed groups fig 4a however a significant increase in lpo level was observed in polyps exposed to cbz and 9 caa and a significant decrease in polyps exposed to oxcbz compared with controls fig 4b the data showed a significant effect of the temperature since differences were observed between control groups f1 4 540 55 p 0 0001 for aoc and f1 4 124 55 p 0 0001 for lpo indeed in control groups it was observed a significant lower aoc levels at 23 c than 19 5 c while the lpo level was higher at 23 c than at 19 5 c same significant variations according to temperature were observed in exposed polyps aoc values were lower at 23 c than at 19 5 c while except for oxcbz lpo values were higher at 23 c than at 19 5 c fig 4a and b moreover three way anova results have shown an interaction between the effects of both temperature and pharmaceuticals on aoc f1 4 31 445 p 0 0001 and on lpo level f1 4 7 147 p 0 001 4 discussion the aim of this study was to determine the potential ecotoxicological effects of cbz oxcbz 9 caa and their mixture at environmental levels and for exposure times above 7 days as required by chronic experiments no general trends in model organism responses to pharmaceutical exposure were identified since biochemical responses were diverse however mixture effect was mostly different than the effects of pharmaceuticals taken individually thus confirming research needs on mixture of pharmaceuticals and not only on single pharmaceutical exposure which is far away from environmental conditions desbiolles et al 2018 moreover time of exposure is a key element in the detection of chronic ecotoxicological effect in this study thanks to the model organisms used to the multi parameters monitored and to the non destructive approach experimenting long time of exposure was feasible in this attempt reduced acute toxicity but significant chronic effects were evidenced for exposure to pharmaceuticals added at environmental concentrations levels 4 1 chronic effects of cbz oxcbz and 9 caa on lemna minor a stimulating effect on the chlorophyll index of duckweeds exposed to oxcbz at 27 ng l was observed with constantly significantly higher values than the control ones large variations of the index of phenolic compounds in duckweeds exposed to each pharmaceutical were obtained and precluded any general conclusion by comparing the exposure to the mixture and to each pharmaceutical taken separately the effects resulting from the mixture on the nbi ratio were lower than the sum of the effects generated by each compound indeed the mixture exposure resulted in an infra additive effect or an antagonism therefore the nbi ratio was the most sensitive indicator in duckweeds to mixture exposure showing a cocktail effect of the pharmaceuticals literature about ecotoxicity of cbz on l minor is scarce however an ec50 of 25 5 mg l for cbz was already determined by cleuvers 2003 after 7 days in 2015 the concentration of chlorophylls in l minor exposed to various synthetic chemical compounds including some pharmaceutical products have been monitored fekete kertész et al 2015 this approach was destructive by harvesting duckweeds after 7 days of exposure and performing spectrophotometric assays from the extracts the authors demonstrated that duckweeds are less sensitive to a pharmaceutical i e diclofenac than to pesticides in our study the use of a non destructive measuring equipment to determine indices of phytometabolites allowed to put forward early effects on the metabolism of l minor from the lowest concentrations used however the great variability of responses between replicates and over time did not allow to identify a particular trend in the plant response to pharmaceutical exposure otherwise l minor is recognized as a pollutant tolerant plant species used in phytoremediation to metabolize some pharmaceuticals farrell 2012 matamoros et al 2012 reinhold et al 2010 consequently more research is needed due to the limited number of studies on the effects of cbz on this plant species and their discordant results matamoros et al 2012 hypothesize that the difference in results between studies could be due to different initial concentrations of pharmaceuticals and in the density of plant biomass l minor may also have a defined photoperiodism dependent on its circadian clock as it has been reported for another duckweed species hillman 1970 some xenobiotics may also cause a phase shift in the circadian rhythm as demonstrated in lemna gibba kondo 1989 phenolic compound synthesis in plants is controlled by the circadian rhythm lattanzio 2013 which results in a regulatory effect of the biosynthetic pathway via its key enzymes among the many functions of phenolic compounds they play a preponderant role in the response to plant stress cheynier et al 2013 the variability of the metabolic responses in l minor in our work may correspond to multiple responses at the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to the absence of a clear signal related to cbz and by product exposure given that these phytometabolites cannot be easily used as early biomarkers of the pharmaceutical effects further studies including more complex mixtures containing chemicals having different usage purpose pharmaceuticals pesticides industrial detergent should be explored before renouncing to this nondestructive approach for ecotoxicity assessment 4 2 chronic effects of cbz oxcbz and 9 caa on hydra circumcincta according to maruyama and sugiyama 1979 two factors determine the growth rate of a hydra population how frequently mature polyps produce buds and how rapidly newly formed buds mature to start producing their own buds the time for bud to form a fully developed new hydra is dependent of both feeding rate and temperature stiven 1962 in our study the feeding rate was constant each three days the polyps were equally fed and whatever the exposure conditions in the present experiments all polyps were still able to catch and ingest their prey therefore significant differences in the budding rates between control group and exposed ones could only be attributed to exposure conditions hence at day 3 the velocity at which polyps produced new buds at 23 c as compared to those maintained at 19 5 c can be attributed to the increase of temperature leading to a higher metabolism at 19 5 c the lower budding rate observed at day 6 in polyps exposed to cbz and at days 6 and 9 in polyps exposed to the mixture could explain in part the lower rhr observed at the following days for the same pharmaceutical exposure however as after day 9 no more differences in budding rate were observed it could be hypothesized that the decrease of rhr could also be explained by the action of cbz and pharmaceutical mixture on the highly molecular conserved signaling pathways involved in the development for example pharmacological approaches have demonstrated the importance of the fgfr fibroblast growth factor receptor notch membrane receptor signaling in bud development because when the fgfr or notch pathways are inhibited buds develop well but never detach from the parent see galliot 2012 for review therefore if cbz and the pharmaceutical mixture acted on such pathways it could retard the bud detachment i e lower rhr observed at days 12 and 14 but not necessarily slow the budding development ktot at 23 c and from day 7 significant differences in budding rates of exposed polyps were more frequently observed than at 19 5 c indeed in polyps exposed to cbz oxcbz but also the mixture the budding rate ktot was lower this latter result is consistent with a lower observed rhr from day 12 at this temperature thus it seems that the increase of temperature affected the sensitiveness of exposed organisms to cbz oxcbz and the mixture leading to decreases of both ktot and rhr at the end of the exposure finally maybe the decrease of reproductive rates rhr at both temperatures and after long term exposure to low concentration of pharmaceuticals especially to the mixture could lead to possible deleterious effects on the fitness of chronically exposed wild populations at 19 5 c from the first to the fourth day of mixture exposure morphological changes revealed effects that can be ranged from moderately toxic to highly toxic according to the nomenclature of wang 1990 and arkhipchuk et al 2006 then from day 5 to the end of exposure time two weeks a return to a normal morphology was observed these observations suggest an early setting up of efficient defense mechanisms at 23 c it seemed that the increase in metabolism activity suggested by an elevated ktot at day 3 may protect from intoxication at the beginning of exposure interestingly at 23 c morphological signs of intoxication appeared at day 12 and persisted at day 14 in polyps exposed to oxcbz and the mixture it could be hypothesized that the energetic allocation to survive to thermal stress may protect the polyp from intoxication for a while however the set up defense mechanisms could not be maintained to preserve homeostasis for a long time this hypothesis supports the apparition of b stages in controls and an increasing sensitiveness of polyps exposed to oxcbz and the mixture at day 14 at the end of the two week exposure morphological changes did not allow to classify the effects according a toxicity scale arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 as less than 20 of the exposed population showed toxicity signs interestingly at the end of the 2 week exposure at 23 c even if morphological alterations did not reach 20 and did not allow to classify the effects according a toxicity scale arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 they were greater than 10 in polyps exposed to the low pharmaceutical concentrations used in this study these results showed that h circumcincta is a sensitive species that could be used for detection of early intoxication signs and therefore be a good candidate for utilization in regulatory framework for the determination of classical ecotoxicological endpoints no observable effect concentration noec lowest observed effect concentration loec maximum acceptable threshold concentration matc noec x loec 1 2 and especially ec10 an alternative endpoint recommended by several authors instead of the three other above mentioned warne and van dam 2008 the sensitiveness of h circumcincta to pharmaceuticals was already supported by quinn et al 2009 regarding the biomarkers of the oxidative stress in h attenuata it has been previously shown that after a 48 h exposure to cbz at 20 c the inducible threshold concentrations matc for heme oxidase and glutathione s transferase activities are 0 03 μm and 0 2 μm cbz respectively equivalent to 7 and 47 mg l respectively quinn et al 2004 however these concentrations are considerably higher than the environmental levels of tens to hundreds ng l tested here separately and in mixture our results indicated that at 19 5 c the exposition at realistic pharmaceutical environmental concentrations of cbz and 9 caa did not induce the antioxidant defense systems which in turns lead to a membrane lipid peroxidation in contrast as the antioxidant defense systems were induced in polyps exposed to oxcbz no lipid peroxidation was measured in those polyps this can be explained by the fact that low doses of cbz and 9 caa induce membrane lipid peroxidation that is not counteracted by the antioxidative systems in polyps exposed to oxcbz the induction of antioxidative system seemed to have prevented lipid peroxidation the exposure to mixture seemed to have no impact on the oxidative balance parameters no induced oxidative defense mechanisms and low lipid peroxidation it can be hypothesized an unknown agonist antagonist synergistic effect of the combination of the three molecules on the oxidative balance these results indicated that hydra species is a sensitive model to detect the effects of low concentration of pharmaceuticals on cellular membrane lipid peroxidation at higher concentrations it has been reported that hydra may reduce the toxic effect of pharmaceuticals mixture by metabolizing the toxicants quinn et al 2009 hence hydra were found to possess glutathione s transferase activity stenersen et al 1987 an enzyme that plays an important role during phase ii biotransformation in the detoxification and metabolism of xenobiotics and endogen compounds hoarau et al 2004 the fact that the increase of temperature led to significantly lower levels of aoc in all groups of h circumcincta is consistent with the observations of dash and phillips 2012 which have reported that h vulgaris responds to thermal stress by regulating its catalase mrna transcription another enzyme involved in the regulation of the oxidative balance in their study these authors have investigated the effects of acute thermal stresses heat shocks on levels of hvcatalase mrna they have observed a decrease in hvcatalase mrna level in hydra groups exposed to 30 c or 37 c for 6 h as compared to control groups maintained at 18 c our thermal exposure condition 3 5 c for 14 days led to similar results as we observed a lower level of aoc in controls and groups exposed to pharmaceuticals moreover the anova results showing significant interactions between pharmaceutical and temperature argue in favor of an increased hydra sensitiveness to pharmaceuticals when temperature rises thus it could be hypothesized that hydra species are able to regulate mrna antioxidative enzyme levels according to surrounding temperature as proposed by dash and phillips 2012 it would be expected that exposure to increased temperatures for long duration would impair the transcriptional machinery of the cell thereby negatively affecting transcription of mrna of antioxidative enzymes and thus decreasing the total antioxidative capacity this decrease in aoc could in turns lead to an increase in cellular membrane lipid peroxidation in summary at the end of the two week pharmaceutical exposure none of the biological endpoints allowed to classify the effects according to a toxicity scale arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 as less than 20 of the exposed population showed toxicity signs however altogether the significant variations of biological parameters studied led to the same conclusions 1 long term exposure to low pharmaceuticals in mixture had deleterious effects on h circumcincta polyps and especially decreased reproductive rates suggesting possible harmful effects on the fitness of wild populations chronically exposed 2 temperature rising also seemed to have harmful effects on the studied biological endpoints when the temperature rising was combined with exposure to very low doses of pharmaceuticals in mixture the effects seemed to be more pronounced on some of the biological endpoints i e altered morphology in a context of global warming climate change it is possible that the toxic effects of mixtures in non target aquatic organisms will be higher 5 conclusion our results confirmed the necessity of identifying sensitive organisms belonging to different trophic levels to better assess ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals and their mixture especially at environmental levels and facing global changes although some variations of phytometabolite composition were noticed under exposure with the selected pharmaceuticals no specific trend could be identified the involvement of complex interactions between the pharmaceuticals and the plant metabolic pathways may induce time dependent effects which may also be connected with the circadian cycle of the duckweed further investigations are needed especially considering the activities of key enzymes which may give more contrasting results hydra circumcincta appears as an appropriate sensitive model for ecotoxicological studies aiming at investigating long term effect of complex environmental mixtures future steps could involve a screening of other biological endpoints and the use of experimental designs allowing to study more complex environmental mixtures and crossed effects between chemical

18372,in order to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the presence of low level of pharmaceuticals in waters chronic ecotoxicity of carbamazepine cbz oxcarbazepine oxcbz and acridine 9 carboxylic acid 9 caa and their mixture was investigated using two species from different trophic levels innovative approaches were developed by monitoring i phytometabolites in the duckweed lemna minor l and ii alterations at the population cellular and molecular levels on the cnidarian hydra circumcincta schulze 1914 to assess the effects of 14 day chronic exposure on h circumcincta the approach was conducted at 19 5 c the optimal growth temperature and at 23 c to simulate global warming impact in l minor results showed alterations of the nitrogen balance and the chlorophyll indices for oxcbz and 9 caa separately at environmental concentrations and for the mixture of the three studied products however phenolic compound index deeply varied depending on pharmaceuticals and time of exposure with no specific trend in h circumcincta effects on morphology reproduction and lipid peroxidation were observed at low level of cbz oxcbz impacted the total antioxidant capacity of h circumcincta whereas exposure to 9 caa affected all parameters except the reproduction rate finally 14 day exposure to the mixture of the three products also slowed the reproduction rate and altered the morphology of this cnidarian higher damages were detected when experiments were conducted at a temperature 3 5 c above the optimum for hydra growth suggesting the relevance of taking into account possible ecotoxicological consequences of global warming our results confirmed the necessity of selecting sensitive organisms at different trophic levels to better assess ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals and their mixture especially at environmental levels and facing global changes graphical abstract image 1 keywords chronic exposure sensitive aquatic organisms low concentrations cocktail effect pharmaceuticals biochemical responses 1 introduction aquatic biota is chronically exposed to multiple exogenous substances many of these compounds are suspected to impact living organisms and human health and their combination in complex mixtures could exacerbate their harmful effects delfosse et al 2015 among them pharmaceuticals have recently emerged as pollutants of high concern in the aquatic environment where they are commonly introduced as complex mixtures via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents desbiolles et al 2018 gros et al 2007 many of the past studies on aquatic organisms have focused on toxicity assessment of single pharmaceuticals for review see blaise et al 2006 crane et al 2006 fent et al 2006 godoy et al 2015 most of the bioassays currently used investigate short time exposure 72 h or 96 h at concentrations in the mg l range i e well above those found in the aquatic environment desbiolles et al 2018 since the concentrations of each pharmaceutical in receiving waters and effluents are low their potential toxic effects on aquatic organisms and even on humans have been often neglected until recent years nonetheless it has been demonstrated that combined low concentrations of pharmaceuticals having similar biological activities could lead to additive or synergistic effects that could be ecotoxicologically relevant brain et al 2004 gros et al 2007 kolpin et al 2002 however data about chronic ecotoxicity of mixture of compounds at low concentrations are still poorly illustrated pharmaceuticals are degraded with highly variable efficiencies at the outlet of wwtp ranging from upper than 80 abatement for ibuprofen to less than 20 for carbamazepine miège et al 2009 owing to its low abatement in conventional wwtp the present study focuses on the anticonvulsant carbamazepine cbz together with two of its by products namely oxcarbazepine oxcbz and acridine 9 carboxylic acid 9 caa typical concentrations of cbz oxcbz and 9 caa range from tens to several hundreds of ng l in receiving natural waters ferrari et al 2003 gros et al 2012 kaiser et al 2014 the ecotoxicity of cbz is poorly documented especially its possible effects on aquatic macrophytes such as lemna minor cleuvers 2003 while some interesting data are available on the freshwater cnidarian hydra attenuata a synonym species of h circumcincta quinn et al 2004 2008a 2008b 2009 in this latter species little effect was observed after short exposure 96 h to a mixture of 11 pharmaceuticals including cbz present at concentrations levels found in a treated municipal effluent as commonly admitted in ecotoxicological researches a battery of several representative aquatic organisms belonging to different biological groups and to different trophic

fast growing macrophyte lemna minor l 1753 ziegler et al 2016 and the freshwater carnivorous cnidarian hydra circumcincta schulze 1914 quinn et al 2008a to address the issue of toxic effects of chemicals at low levels in mixtures we aimed at testing effects of chronic exposure time higher than 7 days exposures to cbz oxcbz 9 caa and their mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations on various biological parameters of the two selected model organisms photosynthetic pigments and flavonoids are good indicators of plant health croft and chen 2018 however sampling for phytometabolites bioassays are usually done at the end of exposure experiments with destructive techniques we hypothesized that a daily monitoring of those metabolites will be more accurate for early detection of effect of pharmaceutical exposure using a non destructive analytical equipment moreover since in animal models pharmaceutical exposure may act on physiological and behavioral features an integrative analysis of pharmaceutical exposure may need to include the study of many endpoints from biochemical to populational levels bearing in mind to fit tightly to environmental realistic conditions our work aimed to investigate how far a panel of tests covering molecular to macroscopic level using two biological models could improve the capability to detect a potential effect of selected pharmaceuticals furthermore crossed effects between chemical pollution and climate change were noticed on community structure and ecosystem functioning dossena et al 2012 thus to question potential cross effects of pollution and climate change experiments have been carried out at the classic breeding temperature 19 5 c and at a higher temperature of 23 c indeed it could be hypothesized that temperature rising affects the sensitiveness of organisms to pollutants and reversely chemical exposure may decrease the thermal tolerance of organisms therefore the crossed effects of these stressors must be investigated as it could entrain a decreased in the fitness of wild populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals carbamazepine cbz and acridine 9 carboxylic acid 9 caa were provided by sigma aldrich saint quentin fallavier france and oxcarbazepine oxcbz by vwr international france fontenay sous bois france and were available as powders purity 97 the stock solutions of each compound were prepared in ultrapure water direct q 5uv millipore at concentrations of 100 40 and 20 mg l for cbz oxcbz and 9 caa respectively after stirring 2 day long in the dark and at 25 c the solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c for 2 months thus enabling the ecotoxicological tests on chronic exposure the stability of the compounds under these conditions was checked by hplc monitoring test solutions of 600 27 and 900 ng l were prepared for cbz oxcbz and 9 caa respectively and a mixture of them at the same latter concentrations was also prepared this range of concentrations was chosen based on concentrations found in treated municipal effluents ferrari et al 2003 gros et al 2012 kaiser et al 2014 2 2 plant bioassay using phytometabolites duckweeds lemna minor l were collected from a freshwater basin of the botanic garden in saint jérôme campus aix marseille university france the population was cultivated in a modified 10 hoagland solution sigma aldrich in glass beakers beakers with duckweeds at 100 confluence were then put in a phytotron mlr 351h sanyo with a 11 13 h day night cycle with 60 of humidity and light intensity of 20 μmol m2 s at 15 c to lower algal proliferation for 17 days each condition of exposure to pharmaceuticals and their mixture was done in 5 replicates in 40 ml glass dishes and compared with a control containing only the culture solution duckweeds were maintained in the same solution during all the experiment time phytometabolites were monitored with a non destructive measurement equipment multiplex force a orsay france using fluorescence technology with multiple excitations to measure constitutive and induced flavonols anthocyanins chlorophylls and a chlorophyll to flavonoid ratio referred to as nitrogen balance index nbi as previously described by ellili et al 2017 for each condition the duckweed fronds were in contact with the measurement cell of the multiplex to ensure that the focal distance was the same for all samples and measurements were done in triplicate per 40 ml glass dishes 2 3 animal bioassays the clonal population of hydra circumcincta arises from a polyp given by the laboratoire interdisciplinaire des environnements continentaux lorraine university metz france culture maintenance procedure was adapted from that developed by trottier et al 1997 briefly tes buffer ph 7 n tris hydroxymethyl methyl 2aminoethanesulfonic acid merck chimie sas fontenay sous bois france was used as culture media and the polyps were fed every three days with 24 h hatched artemia sp nauplii the polyp culture was raised at a constant temperature of 19 5 0 1 c with a 12 12 h light dark cycle 2 3 1 chronic toxicity test all pharmaceutical solutions were diluted in tes buffer experiments were carried out on six sterile multi well polystyrene microplates healthy non budding h circumcincta polyps of similar size were randomly collected among a population of more than 1000 polyps under a stereomicroscope for each condition 12 polyps per well were filled with 8 ml of test solutions and tests were done in triplicate the multi well microplates were covered to prevent evaporation and placed into a thermo regulated incubator at 19 5 0 1 c or 23 0 1 c under a 12 12 h light dark cycle for two weeks animals were fed the day before the beginning of the experiment and then each three days day 3 6 9 and 12 with about 10 artemia sp larvae per polyp capacity to catch and ingest prey was recorded for each well the media was renewed after a 4 h feeding period daily morphology was monitored and the number of buds and new polyps was counted to determine the asexual reproduction at the end of the two week exposure period the media was carefully removed and the living polyps were rapidly frozen and kept at 80 c until oxidative stress measurements criteria used to classify the intensity of toxic effects based on experimental endpoints i e morphological changes budding and reproductive hydra rates were the following 1 non toxic 0 20 effect 2 moderately toxic 21 40 effect 3 toxic 41 60 effect 4 highly toxic 61 80 effect and 5 extremely toxic 81 100 arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 2 3 2 asexual reproduction evaluation of budding and reproductive hydra rates the budding rate ktot considering the number of attached buds and new polyps i e separate buds was calculated according to the following formula ktot ln n tot ln n d in which n is the number of polyps at the beginning of the experiment and n tot the sum of the number of attached buds and the number of polyps detached buds and initial polyps after d days of exposure according to de jong et al 2016 the reproductive hydra rate rhr during the two week exposure to pharmaceuticals was calculated according to the following formula rhr n n n x 100 with n number of hydra polyps after d days of exposure and n number of hydra polyps at the beginning of the experiment according to arkhipchuk et al 2006 2 3 3 morphological changes reflecting increasing toxicity the hereby morphological stage nomenclature used was previously described de jong et al 2016 pachura bouchet et al 2006 classically five morphological stages are reported a stage normal hydra sp polyps exhibit an extended body and tentacles b stage first sign of intoxication appearance of bulbs at tips of tentacles c stage second sign of intoxication shortened tentacles and body early phase d stage shortened tentacles and body late phase e stage or tulip stage tentacles and body drastically shortened this last intoxication stage leads to the animal death by disintegration f stage stages b to d are reversible and are considered as sub lethal endpoints while e and f stages are irreversible and considered as lethal endpoints 2 3 4 biomarkers of oxidative stress the disturbance of the oxidative balance equilibrium was evaluated in h circumcincta polyps exposed to chronic 14 days pharmaceutical concentrations by measuring the total antioxidant capacity aoc kit cayman chemical bertin pharma france and the lipid peroxidation by means of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay tbars assay kit cayman chemical bertin pharma the aoc with the pharmaceuticals was compared with that of trolox a water soluble tocopherol analogue and was quantified as molar trolox equivalents in the tbars assay the quantification of the malondialdehyde mda was performed by colorimetry following its controlled reaction with thiobarbituric acid 2 4 data analysis data from phytometabolite monitoring were expressed as ratios all values of each group on h circumcincta were expressed as mean s e m standard error of the mean at the end of the exposures the time pharmaceutical and temperature interactions for the hydra bioassays were analyzed by the three way anova followed by tukey test for paired comparisons when the use of parametric tests was not possible the comparisons between conditions for the duckweed and hydra bioassays were done with the kruskall wallis test followed if needed by the post hoc dunn test 3 results 3 1 plant bioassay using phytometabolites three of the monitored indices were considered one for chlorophylls i e part of the primary metabolites one for phenolic compounds i e part of the secondary metabolites and finally one corresponding to a nitrogen balance index nbi proxy of the allocation of n and c resources in the plant each index was monitored on l minor for 17 days of exposure to the pharmaceuticals 3 1 1 index of chlorophylls variations of chlorophyll indexes during the exposure to each pharmaceutical compound tested separately at environmental concentration as well as to the mixture are presented in fig 1 a no significant effects of cbz or 9 caa were observed on chlorophyll contents in l minor compared to control however duckweeds exposed to oxcbz at 27 ng l had a chlorophyll index constantly significantly higher than the control along the experiment finally no significant effects were detected on the chlorophyll index in l minor exposed to the mixture as compared to control 3 1 2 index of phenolic compounds no significant differences were detected for the index of phenolic compounds of duckweeds when exposed to each pharmaceutical cbz oxcbz 9 caa separately and to the mixture as compared to control ones fig 1b but considerable data fluctuations were noticed 3 1 3 nbi ratio no significant effects on the nbi ratio were observed over time at the environmental concentration of cbz fig 1c exposure to oxcbz significantly increased the nbi ratios as compared to control ones along the exposure period except at days 11 and 17 fig 1c these results showed an increase in the pool of nitrogen compounds compared to the pool of carbon compounds when l minor was exposed to oxcbz for 9 caa the nbi ratios were significantly higher compared to the control at days 2 5 9 11 14 and 17 for l minor exposed to the pharmaceutical mixture the nbi ratios were always significantly higher than control ones from the first day of experiment fig 1c consequently the ecotoxicity on nbi ratio was expressed continuously when the 3 compounds were combined 3 2 animal bioassay 3 2 1 asexual reproduction and feeding behavior a significant decrease of the budding rate ktot was recorded at 19 5 c in polyps exposed to cbz at day 6 and in those exposed to the mixture at days 6 and 9 fig 2 a at 23 c ktot was significantly lower from day 9 in polyps exposed to cbz and oxcbz a significantly lower ktot was also observed in polyps exposed to the mixture at days 7 12 and 14 fig 2b moreover a significant effect of the temperature on the ktot values was observed at day 3 f9 59 9 839 p 0 0001 the ktot values of each group of exposed polyps at 23 c were significantly increased as compared with those obtained at 19 5 c at 19 5 c ktot mean is 0 006 and at 23 c ktot mean is 0 066 fig 2a and b at the end of the experiment on day 14 a significant effect of the temperature on the budding rate was observed the ktot values obtained at 23 c were lower than those obtained at 19 5 c f1 1 77 002 p 0 0001 and a significant effect of the exposure to pharmaceuticals was also noticed f1 4 9 415 p 0 0001 however statistical analyses did not show any interactions between the effects of temperature and pharmaceuticals on ktot f1 4 1 623 p 0 169 at 19 5 c the reproductive rate rhr was significantly lower in polyps exposed to cbz than controls from day 9 to day 14 moreover a significantly lower rhr was also observed in polyps exposed to the mixture from day 12 fig 2c at 23 c a significantly lower rhr was observed in polyps exposed to cbz oxcbz and the mixture from day 12 to the end of the exposure fig 2d significant interactions were detected between temperature and pharmaceutical on the effects on rhr f1 4 6 946 p 0 0001 whatever the conditions no alteration of the feeding behavior was observed during the 2 week exposure as all living polyps were still able to catch and ingest their prey 3 2 2 morphological changes reflecting intoxication at 19 5 c significant morphological changes appeared at the very first day of mixture exposure only 34 7 of exposed polyps showed normal morphology a stage while b and c stages represented 48 6 and 16 7 respectively fig 3 a significant morphological changes were still observable at days 2 3 and 4 in polyps exposed to the mixture at day 4 d stages appeared in the population exposed to the mixture 4 6 and in polyps exposed to cbz 2 8 while a stages represented 46 2 and 56 3 respectively from day 5 8 all the polyps exhibited normal morphology then at day 9 some polyps exhibited b stages but the percentage of injured polyps were significantly higher only in those exposed to oxcbz where b stages represented 17 6 finally from day 10 to the end of the two week exposure none of the exposed polyps exhibited signs of impaired morphology at 23 c significant morphological changes were recorded only from day 12 where the percentage of b stages was significantly higher than in controls for all exposure conditions and represented 10 8 15 9 of the exposed population fig 3b at day 14 c stages appeared in oxcbz and mixture exposed polyps and their percentage was significantly higher than in controls b stages were still present for all exposure conditions but as b stages also appeared in control group no significant morphological changes were lasting compared to controls 3 2 3 biomarkers of oxidative stress at 19 5 c an overall significant difference f9 29 87 04 p 0 0001 two way anova in the total antioxidant capacity aoc was observed a 2 week exposure to oxcbz induced a significant two fold increase in the aoc compared to controls fig 4 a concerning the lipid peroxidation lpo an overall significant difference f9 29 68 70 p 0 0001 two way anova was detected at 19 5 c indeed compared to controls the lpo was significantly higher in polyps exposed to cbz and to 9 caa and significantly lower in those exposed to the mixture whereas no significant differences were observed in those exposed to oxcbz fig 4b at 23 c there were no significant differences in the aoc values between control and exposed groups fig 4a however a significant increase in lpo level was observed in polyps exposed to cbz and 9 caa and a significant decrease in polyps exposed to oxcbz compared with controls fig 4b the data showed a significant effect of the temperature since differences were observed between control groups f1 4 540 55 p 0 0001 for aoc and f1 4 124 55 p 0 0001 for lpo indeed in control groups it was observed a significant lower aoc levels at 23 c than 19 5 c while the lpo level was higher at 23 c than at 19 5 c same significant variations according to temperature were observed in exposed polyps aoc values were lower at 23 c than at 19 5 c while except for oxcbz lpo values were higher at 23 c than at 19 5 c fig 4a and b moreover three way anova results have shown an interaction between the effects of both temperature and pharmaceuticals on aoc f1 4 31 445 p 0 0001 and on lpo level f1 4 7 147 p 0 001 4 discussion the aim of this study was to determine the potential ecotoxicological effects of cbz oxcbz 9 caa and their mixture at environmental levels and for exposure times above 7 days as required by chronic experiments no general trends in model organism responses to pharmaceutical exposure were identified since biochemical responses were diverse however mixture effect was mostly different than the effects of pharmaceuticals taken individually thus confirming research needs on mixture of pharmaceuticals and not only on single pharmaceutical exposure which is far away from environmental conditions desbiolles et al 2018 moreover time of exposure is a key element in the detection of chronic ecotoxicological effect in this study thanks to the model organisms used to the multi parameters monitored and to the non destructive approach experimenting long time of exposure was feasible in this attempt reduced acute toxicity but significant chronic effects were evidenced for exposure to pharmaceuticals added at environmental concentrations levels 4 1 chronic effects of cbz oxcbz and 9 caa on lemna minor a stimulating effect on the chlorophyll index of duckweeds exposed to oxcbz at 27 ng l was observed with constantly significantly higher values than the control ones large variations of the index of phenolic compounds in duckweeds exposed to each pharmaceutical were obtained and precluded any general conclusion by comparing the exposure to the mixture and to each pharmaceutical taken separately the effects resulting from the mixture on the nbi ratio were lower than the sum of the effects generated by each compound indeed the mixture exposure resulted in an infra additive effect or an antagonism therefore the nbi ratio was the most sensitive indicator in duckweeds to mixture exposure showing a cocktail effect of the pharmaceuticals literature about ecotoxicity of cbz on l minor is scarce however an ec50 of 25 5 mg l for cbz was already determined by cleuvers 2003 after 7 days in 2015 the concentration of chlorophylls in l minor exposed to various synthetic chemical compounds including some pharmaceutical products have been monitored fekete kertész et al 2015 this approach was destructive by harvesting duckweeds after 7 days of exposure and performing spectrophotometric assays from the extracts the authors demonstrated that duckweeds are less sensitive to a pharmaceutical i e diclofenac than to pesticides in our study the use of a non destructive measuring equipment to determine indices of phytometabolites allowed to put forward early effects on the metabolism of l minor from the lowest concentrations used however the great variability of responses between replicates and over time did not allow to identify a particular trend in the plant response to pharmaceutical exposure otherwise l minor is recognized as a pollutant tolerant plant species used in phytoremediation to metabolize some pharmaceuticals farrell 2012 matamoros et al 2012 reinhold et al 2010 consequently more research is needed due to the limited number of studies on the effects of cbz on this plant species and their discordant results matamoros et al 2012 hypothesize that the difference in results between studies could be due to different initial concentrations of pharmaceuticals and in the density of plant biomass l minor may also have a defined photoperiodism dependent on its circadian clock as it has been reported for another duckweed species hillman 1970 some xenobiotics may also cause a phase shift in the circadian rhythm as demonstrated in lemna gibba kondo 1989 phenolic compound synthesis in plants is controlled by the circadian rhythm lattanzio 2013 which results in a regulatory effect of the biosynthetic pathway via its key enzymes among the many functions of phenolic compounds they play a preponderant role in the response to plant stress cheynier et al 2013 the variability of the metabolic responses in l minor in our work may correspond to multiple responses at the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to the absence of a clear signal related to cbz and by product exposure given that these phytometabolites cannot be easily used as early biomarkers of the pharmaceutical effects further studies including more complex mixtures containing chemicals having different usage purpose pharmaceuticals pesticides industrial detergent should be explored before renouncing to this nondestructive approach for ecotoxicity assessment 4 2 chronic effects of cbz oxcbz and 9 caa on hydra circumcincta according to maruyama and sugiyama 1979 two factors determine the growth rate of a hydra population how frequently mature polyps produce buds and how rapidly newly formed buds mature to start producing their own buds the time for bud to form a fully developed new hydra is dependent of both feeding rate and temperature stiven 1962 in our study the feeding rate was constant each three days the polyps were equally fed and whatever the exposure conditions in the present experiments all polyps were still able to catch and ingest their prey therefore significant differences in the budding rates between control group and exposed ones could only be attributed to exposure conditions hence at day 3 the velocity at which polyps produced new buds at 23 c as compared to those maintained at 19 5 c can be attributed to the increase of temperature leading to a higher metabolism at 19 5 c the lower budding rate observed at day 6 in polyps exposed to cbz and at days 6 and 9 in polyps exposed to the mixture could explain in part the lower rhr observed at the following days for the same pharmaceutical exposure however as after day 9 no more differences in budding rate were observed it could be hypothesized that the decrease of rhr could also be explained by the action of cbz and pharmaceutical mixture on the highly molecular conserved signaling pathways involved in the development for example pharmacological approaches have demonstrated the importance of the fgfr fibroblast growth factor receptor notch membrane receptor signaling in bud development because when the fgfr or notch pathways are inhibited buds develop well but never detach from the parent see galliot 2012 for review therefore if cbz and the pharmaceutical mixture acted on such pathways it could retard the bud detachment i e lower rhr observed at days 12 and 14 but not necessarily slow the budding development ktot at 23 c and from day 7 significant differences in budding rates of exposed polyps were more frequently observed than at 19 5 c indeed in polyps exposed to cbz oxcbz but also the mixture the budding rate ktot was lower this latter result is consistent with a lower observed rhr from day 12 at this temperature thus it seems that the increase of temperature affected the sensitiveness of exposed organisms to cbz oxcbz and the mixture leading to decreases of both ktot and rhr at the end of the exposure finally maybe the decrease of reproductive rates rhr at both temperatures and after long term exposure to low concentration of pharmaceuticals especially to the mixture could lead to possible deleterious effects on the fitness of chronically exposed wild populations at 19 5 c from the first to the fourth day of mixture exposure morphological changes revealed effects that can be ranged from moderately toxic to highly toxic according to the nomenclature of wang 1990 and arkhipchuk et al 2006 then from day 5 to the end of exposure time two weeks a return to a normal morphology was observed these observations suggest an early setting up of efficient defense mechanisms at 23 c it seemed that the increase in metabolism activity suggested by an elevated ktot at day 3 may protect from intoxication at the beginning of exposure interestingly at 23 c morphological signs of intoxication appeared at day 12 and persisted at day 14 in polyps exposed to oxcbz and the mixture it could be hypothesized that the energetic allocation to survive to thermal stress may protect the polyp from intoxication for a while however the set up defense mechanisms could not be maintained to preserve homeostasis for a long time this hypothesis supports the apparition of b stages in controls and an increasing sensitiveness of polyps exposed to oxcbz and the mixture at day 14 at the end of the two week exposure morphological changes did not allow to classify the effects according a toxicity scale arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 as less than 20 of the exposed population showed toxicity signs interestingly at the end of the 2 week exposure at 23 c even if morphological alterations did not reach 20 and did not allow to classify the effects according a toxicity scale arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 they were greater than 10 in polyps exposed to the low pharmaceutical concentrations used in this study these results showed that h circumcincta is a sensitive species that could be used for detection of early intoxication signs and therefore be a good candidate for utilization in regulatory framework for the determination of classical ecotoxicological endpoints no observable effect concentration noec lowest observed effect concentration loec maximum acceptable threshold concentration matc noec x loec 1 2 and especially ec10 an alternative endpoint recommended by several authors instead of the three other above mentioned warne and van dam 2008 the sensitiveness of h circumcincta to pharmaceuticals was already supported by quinn et al 2009 regarding the biomarkers of the oxidative stress in h attenuata it has been previously shown that after a 48 h exposure to cbz at 20 c the inducible threshold concentrations matc for heme oxidase and glutathione s transferase activities are 0 03 μm and 0 2 μm cbz respectively equivalent to 7 and 47 mg l respectively quinn et al 2004 however these concentrations are considerably higher than the environmental levels of tens to hundreds ng l tested here separately and in mixture our results indicated that at 19 5 c the exposition at realistic pharmaceutical environmental concentrations of cbz and 9 caa did not induce the antioxidant defense systems which in turns lead to a membrane lipid peroxidation in contrast as the antioxidant defense systems were induced in polyps exposed to oxcbz no lipid peroxidation was measured in those polyps this can be explained by the fact that low doses of cbz and 9 caa induce membrane lipid peroxidation that is not counteracted by the antioxidative systems in polyps exposed to oxcbz the induction of antioxidative system seemed to have prevented lipid peroxidation the exposure to mixture seemed to have no impact on the oxidative balance parameters no induced oxidative defense mechanisms and low lipid peroxidation it can be hypothesized an unknown agonist antagonist synergistic effect of the combination of the three molecules on the oxidative balance these results indicated that hydra species is a sensitive model to detect the effects of low concentration of pharmaceuticals on cellular membrane lipid peroxidation at higher concentrations it has been reported that hydra may reduce the toxic effect of pharmaceuticals mixture by metabolizing the toxicants quinn et al 2009 hence hydra were found to possess glutathione s transferase activity stenersen et al 1987 an enzyme that plays an important role during phase ii biotransformation in the detoxification and metabolism of xenobiotics and endogen compounds hoarau et al 2004 the fact that the increase of temperature led to significantly lower levels of aoc in all groups of h circumcincta is consistent with the observations of dash and phillips 2012 which have reported that h vulgaris responds to thermal stress by regulating its catalase mrna transcription another enzyme involved in the regulation of the oxidative balance in their study these authors have investigated the effects of acute thermal stresses heat shocks on levels of hvcatalase mrna they have observed a decrease in hvcatalase mrna level in hydra groups exposed to 30 c or 37 c for 6 h as compared to control groups maintained at 18 c our thermal exposure condition 3 5 c for 14 days led to similar results as we observed a lower level of aoc in controls and groups exposed to pharmaceuticals moreover the anova results showing significant interactions between pharmaceutical and temperature argue in favor of an increased hydra sensitiveness to pharmaceuticals when temperature rises thus it could be hypothesized that hydra species are able to regulate mrna antioxidative enzyme levels according to surrounding temperature as proposed by dash and phillips 2012 it would be expected that exposure to increased temperatures for long duration would impair the transcriptional machinery of the cell thereby negatively affecting transcription of mrna of antioxidative enzymes and thus decreasing the total antioxidative capacity this decrease in aoc could in turns lead to an increase in cellular membrane lipid peroxidation in summary at the end of the two week pharmaceutical exposure none of the biological endpoints allowed to classify the effects according to a toxicity scale arkhipchuk et al 2006 wang 1990 as less than 20 of the exposed population showed toxicity signs however altogether the significant variations of biological parameters studied led to the same conclusions 1 long term exposure to low pharmaceuticals in mixture had deleterious effects on h circumcincta polyps and especially decreased reproductive rates suggesting possible harmful effects on the fitness of wild populations chronically exposed 2 temperature rising also seemed to have harmful effects on the studied biological endpoints when the temperature rising was combined with exposure to very low doses of pharmaceuticals in mixture the effects seemed to be more pronounced on some of the biological endpoints i e altered morphology in a context of global warming climate change it is possible that the toxic effects of mixtures in non target aquatic organisms will be higher 5 conclusion our results confirmed the necessity of identifying sensitive organisms belonging to different trophic levels to better assess ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals and their mixture especially at environmental levels and facing global changes although some variations of phytometabolite composition were noticed under exposure with the selected pharmaceuticals no specific trend could be identified the involvement of complex interactions between the pharmaceuticals and the plant metabolic pathways may induce time dependent effects which may also be connected with the circadian cycle of the duckweed further investigations are needed especially considering the activities of key enzymes which may give more contrasting results hydra circumcincta appears as an appropriate sensitive model for ecotoxicological studies aiming at investigating long term effect of complex environmental mixtures future steps could involve a screening of other biological endpoints and the use of experimental designs allowing to study more complex environmental mixtures and crossed effects between chemical

18373,electrochemical water softening was proposed as a sustainable alternative for ion exchange softening avoiding the input of salt to drinking water and the production of a concentrated brine here we demonstrated two novel modes of operation combining an electrochemical cell with a fluidized bed crystallizer the first approach relied on an electrochemical cell consisting of an anode and cathode separated by a cation or anion exchange membrane the feed water was first directed into a crystallizer where it was blended with alkaline cathode effluent the effluent of the crystallizer softened water was in part recirculated to the cathode to generate alkalinity in part to the anode compartment where the ph was again decreased average removal efficiencies for calcium and magnesium of 75 86 and 7 21 respectively could be sustainably reached at a specific energy consumption of 7 0 10 1 kwh kg 1 caco3 0 86 1 39 kwh m 3 water this configuration allowed reagent free water softening albeit with an effluent with a ph between 3 0 and 3 6 in a second mode of operation the process influent to soften was also directed to the crystallizer and recirculated over the cathode which was separated from the anode using an anion exchange membrane in this mode of operation the cathode effluent was sent through the crystallizing unit and the anode compartment was operated in closed loop average calcium and magnesium removal efficiencies of 73 78 and 40 44 were obtained at specific energy consumptions of 5 8 7 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 0 77 0 88 kwh m 3 water although the softened water had an elevated ph 9 4 the advantage of this configuration is concomitant removal of anions and the formation of acids disinfectant in the anode compartment both methods of operation thus showed reagent free water softening at a relatively low specific energy consumption these novel methods of softening could be used in remote locations where access to chemicals or discharge of ion exchange brines proves to be difficult or in case addition of chemicals for softening is unwanted further research is needed to further decrease the specific energy consumption during long term operation keywords electrochemical cell calcium ion exchange membrane water treatment chemical free softening 1 introduction water softening minimizes the risk of scaling in industrial and domestic piping systems when using aqueous solutions in which depending on the conditions the salts can exceed the solubility limit and deposit on piping surfaces hasson et al 2010 scaling with mostly calcium and magnesium salts is not only undesired because of the effects and costs of eventual clogging of piping but it also reduces the energetic efficiency in heat exchangers and boilers and decreases the efficiency of water

et al 2018a regeneration of the cathode has been described to be challenging as the electrical resistance increases as more deposits adhere to the cathode gabrielli et al 2006 luan et al 2019 yu et al 2018b hasson et al 2010 presented a novel configuration of an electrochemical water softening system in which the acidifying anode was separated from the alkalinizing cathode by a cation exchange membrane cem this proposed system allowed precipitation in an external crystallizer downstream of the cathode in this way the electrode area requirements could drastically be reduced as the electrochemical cell is continuously forcing cations e g sodium from the anode to the cathode through the cem by electrical migration the anolyte salt needs to be replaced upon depletion in this way the proposed technology cannot be considered as a zero chemical input technology zaslavschi et al 2013 designed two configurations for electrochemical water softening of synthetic brackish and seawater that would allow for operation without the need to provide salts by combining bipolar membranes bpm and cems in a four compartment configuration in one configuration used by these authors ia two cems one central bpm a similar flow rate of feed water as the flow rate of hard water that was treated was used as an external input of sodium calcium and magnesium to enable electromigration through the cem resulting in a cathodic ph increase this configuration resulted in a higher caco3 hardness removal at lower charge densities electrode surface and energy consumption compared to their previous electrochemical cem configuration where anode and cathode were separated by only one cem hasson et al 2010 although chlorine generation could not be prevented in configuration ia another configuration ii two bipolar membranes one central cem was proposed where the cations from the cathodically treated water could theoretically be used for cation recycling thus alleviating the need to foresee an input of salts to maintain the operation of the electrochemical water softening although this concept itself with cation recycling was not tested a similar concept iid where a synthetic brackish feed was used in the third acidic compartment instead of treated softened brackish water could successfully achieve caco3 precipitation without chlorine formation but without internal cation recycling zaslavschi et al 2013 applying electrochemical water softening on tap water is expected to be energetically less favorable than seawater as the electrical conductivity of tap water is much lower 0 5 ms cm 1 than seawater 50 ms cm 1 resulting in an increase of the ohmic voltage drop for the same electrode membrane configuration therefore minimizing the number of ion exchange membranes and the distance between the electrodes is expected to minimize the ohmic voltage drop when treating tap water the aim of this study was to demonstrate two novel concepts for electrochemical water softening of local tap water to achieve a reagent free approach towards effluent with a lower electrical conductivity two new process schemes are proposed that combine the advantages of an electrochemical softening system with a single ion exchange membrane and a zero chemical input system both configurations were evaluated in terms of bivalent cation removal final composition of the softened water and power consumption and the optimal charge density for tap water softening was identified 2 materials and methods an electrochemical cell 2 perspex frames 20 5 2 cm³ internal

the charge density was evaluated every charge density was maintained for at least four times the hydraulic retention time hrt so every charge density was tested for at least 49 h the flow rate was measured several times per week and the average flow rate over a whole run was used for further calculations the average process influent flow rate was between 0 32 and 0 34 l h 1 and one hrt between 12 9 and 13 7 h during the short term tests during runs a1 a2 a3 and a4 the flow rate was between 0 52 and 0 56 l h 1 hrt between 7 8 and 8 5 h samples were taken for analysis once the ph in the crystallizer reached a steady state value and average values and standard deviations were calculated based on the different samples taken throughout the same run the duration of runs a1 a2 a3 and a4 was 324 h 150 h 199 h and 192 h respectively treated effluent from previous operation was used as fresh anolyte in configuration b during run b1 500 ml anolyte was replaced approximately every 70 h mainly because of difficulties maintaining a constant anolyte volume water displacement between cathode and anode through the aem during run b2 the anolyte 750 ml was replaced twice after approximately 100 h after which the anode was operated with 1500 ml of fresh anolyte for another 200 h samples were taken for analysis once the ph in the crystallizer reached a steady state value and average values and standard deviations were calculated based on the different samples taken throughout the same run during runs b1 and b2 the flow rate was between 0 56 and 0 58 l h 1 hrt between 7 6

configuration a with a cem electrochemical water softening by internal sodium and potassium cycling 3 1 1 effect of charge density on the calcium removal the effectiveness of configuration a was tested at different charge densities 175 3129 c l 1 tap water with unmodified local tap water in order to obtain a calcium concentration below 0 5 mm 80 removal efficiency a charge density of at least 524 c l 1 tap water was required fig 2 b d while the ec of the tap water decreased from 0 45 0 02 ms cm 1 to 0 35 0 04 ms cm 1 from 524 c l 1 tap water on a ph of 9 8 or higher could be established in the crystallizer precipitation vessel by circulating the crystallizer liquid over the cathodic compartment fig 2a the ph of the cathodic effluent was slightly higher than the ph in the crystallizer where the process influent which had a lower ph was dosed in configuration a the liquid of the crystallizer passed first through the anode before being discharged to the effluent vessel resulting in a ph of 3 4 in the effluent a charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water was insufficient to establish a ph increase that was sufficient to remove the calcium more than 80 during the operation at a charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water the voltage over the cell needed to maintain this charge density increased from 5 0 v in the beginning of the test to 8 7 v after 121 h of operation whereas for charge densities of 524 c l 1 tap water or higher the cell voltage did not tend to increase at this low charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water the calcium concentration in the anode effluent was lower than in the cathodic effluent and crystallizer fig 2b the ohmic resistance increased up to 1 38 0 04 ω m2 at the end of the test while it had remained relatively constant at 0 38 0 02 ω m2 during the tests in the range of 524 3129 c l 1 tap water at charge densities up to 1097 c l 1 tap water no changes in the chloride concentration were observed whereas at 2237 and 3129 c l 1 tap water the chloride concentrations in the cathode effluent and the crystallizer were lower 0 1 0 2 mm compared to the process influent and effluent 0 7 0 8 mm fig 2c this is an indication for local cycling of chloride ions by electrical migration from cathode to anode even through the cem which purpose is to minimize anion migration however without clear chloride removal in the system the calcium removal efficiency could be increased up to 94 with a concomitant calcium effluent concentration below 0 2 mm by increasing the charge density to 2237 c l 1 tap water or higher however where the specific electrical energy consumption for calcium removal at 524 c l 1 tap was 5 4 0 2 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed 0 9 0 0 kwh m 3 tap water treated it increased up to 58 8 2 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed 9 9 0 1 kwh m 3 tap water treated at a charge density of 2237 c l 1 tap water fig 2d while the specific electrical energy consumption was relatively low 2 4 0 9 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed 0 3 0 1 kwh m 3 tap water treated at 175 c l 1 tap water the calcium removal efficiency was only 56 9 and the cell voltage could not be maintained constant over time 3 1 2 long term operation the long term stability of the process in configuration a was evaluated during three separate runs with a charge density of 646 c l 1 tap water run a1 480 c l 1 tap water run a2 and 633 c l 1 tap water run a3 respectively during at least 18 hrts 150 300 h fig 3 the cathodically induced ph increase 9 8 10 8 in the crystallizer could be maintained for all three runs fig 3 resulting in a calcium effluent concentration of 0 26 0 12 mm for run a1 and 0 33 0 04 mm for run a3 while a calcium effluent quality of 0 41 0 02 mm was obtained during run a2 where a lower charge density 480 c l 1 tap water was applied for runs a1 and a3 where the charge density was higher than 600 c l 1 tap water average calcium removal efficiencies of more than 82 were obtained while the removal efficiency was 75 1 during run a2 table 1 the process influent magnesium concentration ranged between 0 28 and 0 36 mm and the removal efficiency in run a2 and a3 was only 21 7 and 7 7 respectively no data for run a1 after passage through the anode the ph of the effluent was in the range of 3 0 3 6 and the ohmic resistance of the cell could be maintained at 0 32 0 04 ω m2 during the three runs the ec of the process influent was 0 57 0 13 ms cm 1 and decreased on average with 14 18 after passage through the system table 1 the sodium concentration in the crystallizer was 2 5 3 3 times higher than in the process influent whereas the sodium effluent concentration was similar as or slightly lower than the process influent concentration table 1 an even higher concentration effect was observed for potassium in the crystallizer 4 4 5 9 table 1 this concentrating of sodium and potassium in the crystallizer and cathode indicates that monovalent cations are recycled in the system by electromigration from anode back to cathode through the cem the chloride recovery efficiency in the effluent was 99 7 97 6 and 93 4 for runs a1 a2 and a3 respectively process influent concentration 0 92 0 06 mm which indicates that little max 7 or no chloride oxidation occurred at the anode table 1 similar concentrations were observed in the crystallizer as in the process influent and effluent during run a1 nitrate and sulfate were recovered in the effluent with an efficiency of 97 6 and 97 5 respectively whereas the nitrate recovery was only 50 16 and 45 6 for run a2 and a3 respectively nitrate process influent concentration 0 13 0 22 mm the sulfate recovery efficiency for run a2 and a3 was 85 2 and 87 2 respectively sulfate process influent concentration 0 51 0 59 mm the nitrite concentration in the process influent was below 0 02 mm and no increase nor decrease was observed in the effluent at the end of run a1 98 1 of the 2 4 0 2 mm incoming inorganic carbon was removed by the system during a titration of the effluent 0 9 mmol of naoh l 1 effluent was needed to increase the ph back to the same level as the process influent 3 2 configuration a with an aem electrochemical water softening by internal chloride cycling configuration a was also tested with an aem fujifilm for 24 hrts at a charge density of 630 c l 1 tap water run a4 the ph in the crystallizer was 9 4 0 3 and this resulted in an overall calcium removal efficiency of 81 3 the chloride concentrations in the process influent and effluent were 0 89 0 01 mm and 0 87 0 06 mm respectively while in the crystallizer the chloride concentration dropped to 0 42 0 06 mm the ec in the process influent was 0 53 0 01 ms cm 1 while the ec in the crystallizer and the effluent was 0 25 0 01 ms cm 1 and 0 40 0 08 ms cm 1 respectively the voltage required to maintain a fixed charge density started to increase after 12 hrts from 4 4 v to 17 v at the end of run a4 resulting in an increasing specific energy consumption of 8 6 20 0 kwh kg 1 caco3 the ohmic resistance increased from 0 13 to 0 71 ω m2 no increase in the nitrite concentration in the effluent was observed 3 3 configuration b with an aem water softening combined with anion removal and acid production in configuration b the effluent was directly extracted from the crystallizer without passage through the anode while the anode loop was operated in batch mode the performance of this configuration was evaluated with two different aem aem fujifilm aem m i in runs b1 and b2 respectively in both cases an increase of the ph in the crystallizer could be established to achieve effluent concentrations of 0 38 0 09 mm calcium and 0 21 0 05 mm magnesium table 2 besides precipitation of calcium and magnesium concomitant removal of anions from the tap water was established through migration through the aem where anions accumulated in the anolyte or were removed as a result also the ec of the tap water was approximately halved table 2 the removal efficiency of chloride and sulfate from the process influent was typically between 50 and 60 for both types of membrane whereas the removal of nitrate was higher in the case of the aem m i table 2 the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was 0 05 0 02 mm during run b1 and b2 while the process influent nitrite concentration was only 0 01 0 00 mm the cell voltage fluctuated more during run b1 compared to run b2 and minimizing water displacement between cathode and anode was more challenging with the aem used in run b1 during the first 23 hrts 180 h of run b2 the average cell voltage was 4 5 0 1 v fig 4 b and the specific energy consumption was 6 kwh kg 1 caco3 but then the cell voltage increased resulting in an increase in the specific energy consumption to 7 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 although the energetic efficiency decreased over time the ph gradient and calcium removal could be maintained throughout run b2 fig 4a after 311 h of operation in run b2 the generated acidic anolyte was used once to rinse the cathodic compartment for 6 h after which the operation was resumed and the cell voltage and the ohmic resistance levelled off fig 4b nevertheless a decrease in the calcium concentration in the process influent resulted in a further increase in the specific energy consumption 10 kwh kg 1 caco3 fig 4b during run b2 the anolyte was replaced by 750 ml fresh anolyte after 124 h and 198 h while after 317 h the anolyte was replaced by 1500 ml fresh anolyte the initial ph value in the anolyte rapidly decreased to 1 5 during operation the concentration of chloride nitrate and sulfate and as a consequence also the ec increased over time in the anolyte fig 5 although the concentration levelled off and decreased especially for chloride while no fluctuation was observed in the concentration of the anions in the treated tap water the recovery in the anolyte of the chloride nitrate and sulfate removed from the tap water over the 505 h of operation was 23 30 and 76 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 water softening with internal anion or cation cycling or with anion removal two different configurations for tap water softening were compared in this study in configuration a the effluent from the crystallizer passed through the anodic compartment before being discharged while in configuration b the effluent was directly extracted from the crystallizer and the anode loop was operated in batch mode overall both configurations had a similar calcium removal efficiency and energy consumption at a charge density of 600 c l 1 tap water whereas configuration b achieved an additional decrease in the salinity due to electromigration from cathode to anode ions migrate through the membrane to restore the electroneutrality in the electrode compartments to compensate the proton and hydroxyl production at anode cathode in configuration a this did not result in a net removal of anions or cations as the tap water was sent through both compartments resulting in an internal cycling of anions or cations with a cem cations sodium potassium calcium magnesium and protons migrated from the anode back to the cathode whereas with an aem anions chloride nitrate sulfate carbonate and hydroxyl ions migrated from the cathode to the anode anion migration to the anodic compartment through the aem in configuration b resulted in a net removal of anions decreasing the ec with 50 compared to 15 in configuration a the anions gradually accumulated in the anolyte creating an acidic salt solution which can be used to periodically rinse the electrochemical cell in order to remove precipitates from the electrode and membrane or it can be discharged chen et al 2016 used the acidic stream to regenerate ion exchange media in sanjuán et al 2019b electrochemical water softening was combined with electrochemical production of a weak acid to benefit from both the cathodic and anodic process an ed concentrate produced from groundwater was treated in the cathodic compartment to decrease the hardness while weak acids e g lactic acid were obtained by protonation of their conjugate bases e g lactate in the anodic compartment in configuration b the calcium and magnesium removal and decrease in ec was similar with both aem aem m i and aem fujifilm but the cell voltage fluctuated more during the run with aem fujifilm compared to the run with aem m i and minimizing water displacement between cathode and anode was more challenging with the aem fujifilm overall water displacement is a factor that needs to be managed which can be done by modulating anode fluid pressure another important difference between the two configurations is the change in ph of the tap water process influent ph 7 8 configuration a creates softened tap water with an acidic ph 3 4 due to the recirculation through the anodic compartment where protons are produced through water oxidation which imbalance the oh generation as the softening leads to some removal the tap water treated in configuration b has an alkaline high ph 9 5 as the acid is wasted the ph of tap water is typically kept between 6 5 and 9 5 further research is needed to evaluate whether the tap water treated with these electrochemical water softening systems is acceptable for potable use or is rather suited for softened process water it is important to note that due to the precipitation of carbonates and the lack of reagent addition the alkalinity of the water is very low enabling neutralization without major acid addition generating softened water at a high or low ph could be an advantage to prolong the storage time of drinking water as the extreme ph limits the risk for contamination further research would be needed to verify this as well as verify whether extreme ph have no other adverse impacts during storage if a low or a high ph in the treated tap water is undesired a combined system can be engineered in which a part of the water is treated with configuration a and the other part with configuration b further research is needed to verify that mixing the treated water of these two configurations high ph and low ph in a certain ratio could allow to obtain the desired effluent ph 4 2 optimal charge density for tap water softening the effect of the charge density on the calcium removal and specific energy consumption was investigated in configuration a with a cem separating the two electrode compartments generally the higher the charge density the more hydroxyl ions are produced at the cathode resulting in a higher ph in the crystallizer and hence more calcium removal higher supersaturation a charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water only increased the ph from 8 0 0 2 process influent ph to 8 4 0 1 removing less than 60 of the calcium hence a large fraction of the calcium remained in solution 40 which could have caused the increase in ohmic resistance and cell voltage part of the calcium migrated from anode to cathode through the cem and probably caused scaling in or on the membrane another possible explanation for the increase in ohmic resistance at a low charge density is scaling on the cathode due to the relatively low ph increase in the crystallizer ph of 8 4 at 175 c l 1 compared to ph 9 8 at charge densities 524 c l 1 there was a larger ph difference between the ph in the crystallizer and the local ph at the surface of the cathode which could have led to an increased precipitation on the cathode surface rather than in the crystallizer a charge density to 524 c l 1 tap water was sufficient to obtain 80 of calcium removal without an increasing ohmic resistance and cell voltage further stepwise increasing the charge density to 3129 c l 1 tap water only led to a slight increase in calcium removal efficiency from 83 to 93 while the energy consumption kwh m 3 tap water and specific electrical energy consumption kwh kg 1 caco3 removed increased with a factor of 10 despite the higher hydroxyl production at the cathode table 3 the ph in the crystallizer only marginally increased at higher charge densities from 524 till 3129 c l 1 tap water this can be attributed to the logarithmic nature of ph values and the limited availability of cations besides protons for electromigration to restore the electroneutrality in the electrode compartments cations migrated from the anodic compartment back to the cathodic compartment the tap water contained about 1 25 mm sodium and 0 12 mm potassium and less than 0 52 mm calcium after precipitation in the cathode while 5 mm hydroxyl is produced at charge densities above 524 c l 1 tap water hence the internal recycling of sodium and potassium from the anode to the cathode was not sufficient to compensate the hydroxyl and proton production at the electrodes as a result more protons migrated to the cathode at higher charge densities compensating the hydroxyl production at the cathode at 2237 and 3129 c l 1 tap water even chloride ions migrated from the cathode to the anode through the cem to balance the charge hence the optimal charge density for tap water softening to remove most of the calcium with a minimal energy investment was around 500 600 c l 1 tap water for the system and the water used here 4 3 safety issues concerns in both configurations chloride was present in the anodic compartment which can result in the production of chlorine cl2 due to chloride oxidation at the anode zaslavschi et al 2013 the chlorine can be released to the atmosphere or further react to hocl which can oxidize materials such as the membrane and to hcl zaslavschi et al 2013 in configuration a the chloride concentration in the anodic compartment was low 1 mm and the chloride recovery efficiencies were high indicating that there was no or very limited chloride oxidation at the anode in configuration b however chloride was concentrated in the anodic compartment which was operated in batch mode the concentration in the anolyte increased up to 10 15 mm but levelled off and decreased over time suggesting that chloride was removed by oxidation at the anode chlorine production can be prevented by applying more selective electrodes e g a boron doped diamond electrode instead of a mixed metal oxide anode by including a bpm chloride migration to the anodic compartment can be limited zaslavschi et al 2013 but this will increase the ohmic resistance and negate the ph effects needed likely the best strategy is to discharge regularly a small measure of anode fluid to minimize chloride accumulation given the low chloride concentrations in tap water the risk for formation of chlorinated byproducts is low however this requires further evaluation up to 93 removal of nitrate from the tap water was observed in configuration b2 which could be an interesting feature for generating drinking water with a low nitrate level because of the correlation between high nitrate intake and high methaemoglobin levels super et al 1981 since only 30 of the nitrate could be recovered in the anolyte it is likely that nitrate was electrochemically removed in the system future research is needed to avoid the formation of nitrite in the electrochemically treated tap water as it was found up to 0 05 mm in configuration b a second safety concern is the production of oxygen and hydrogen gas at the anode and cathode respectively table 3 a current density of 600 c l 1 tap water results in 3 1 mmol h2 l 1 tap water and 1 6 mmol o2 l 1 tap water without proper separator e g gas impermeable ion exchange membrane a flammable potentially explosive mixture of h2 and o2 could be formed due to convection or diffusion of the gasses across the membrane xiang et al 2016 so a proper risk management of the system is required for applying this technology on a large scale likely the introduction of an open air cathode with gas diffusion layer can alleviate this concern by eliminating hydrogen production besides minimizing energy requirements 4 4 how much softening is actually needed the optimal charge density in this study was around 500 600 c l 1 tap water which resulted in a calcium removal from 1 6 to 2 2 mm ca 16 22 f classified as moderately hard to hard water to 0 3 0 4 mm ca 3 4 f classified as very soft water too soft water has corrosive properties which can lead to leaching of heavy metals lead copper from piping and metal surfaces resulting in the presence of toxic heavy metals in the drinking water in flanders belgium a minimal water hardness of 15 f is imposed for the water distribution sector as it is not recommended to soften water below 15 f a bypass could be installed by mixing the softened water 15 f with non softened water 15 f the desired water hardness could be obtained and this would also neutralize the ph changes of the water i e the acidification obtained with configuration a or alkalinisation obtained with configuration b 4 5 an electrochemical softening unit for tap water softening in households electrochemical water softening is considered as alternative for ion exchange softening the cell will require an ion exchange membrane to allow for the creation of a ph gradient typically these are used in highly conductive streams like seawater and or brackish water zaslavschi et al 2013 tap water has a much lower conductivity 0 5 ms cm 1 compared to 50 ms cm 1 for seawater and therefore relative to current density the electrolyte and membrane resistances entail a higher energy consumption which implies that the current density needs to be limited the electrochemical methods of softening could be used in remote locations where access to chemicals or discharge of ion exchange brines proves to be difficult or in case the addition of chemicals for softening is unwanted the relatively low specific energy consumption 0 8 1 4 kwh m 3 tap water also opens opportunities for household based tap water softening current installations for softening at home level typically involve the use of an ion exchange unit which requires frequent regeneration with salt for a household of four people consuming 120 l water ie 1 d 1 less than 100 cm2 electrode surface area would suffice if the cell is operated at a current density of 100 a m 2 several aspects still require further development first it appears advisable to avoid chlorine formation at the anode which can be achieved with a boron doped diamond electrode interestingly such an electrode is highly suited for the removal of trace contaminants which delivers an additional benefit of further water purification second hydrogen formation at the cathode needs to be avoided which can be achieved via an open air cathode with a gas diffusion layer calcium precipitate mostly calcium carbonate will accumulate in the crystallizer and needs to be harvested from the crystallizer about 12 60 kg calcium carbonate year 1 is produced depending on the initial water hardness and the softening depth further research is necessary to determine the composition and value of this calcium precipitate which at household level could be discharged via the household waste besides the environmental benefits electrochemical water softening also seems a viable alternative to ion exchange in terms of costs si section b in contrast to ion exchange softeners which consume power 5 w salt 0 024 kg m ³ f 1 and water 1 6l m ³ f 1 for regeneration van der bruggen et al 2009 electrochemical water softening only requires energy to drive the oxidation and reduction reactions at the electrodes depending on the initial water hardness and softening depth about 60 20 f 15 f to 160 300 40 f 15 f kwh household 1 year 1 is consumed the major investment cost are the electrodes but by the use of the external crystallizer the required electrode surface is minimal 5 conclusions two configurations achieving softening of tap water at energy investments comparable to existing softeners 5 8 7 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed were demonstrated water reduction at the cathode increased the ph of the tap water removing 73 86 of calcium by precipitation depending on the application the softened tap water created in the cathodic compartment crystallizer i can be sent through the anodic compartment configuration a or ii can be extracted directly from the crystallizer configuration b configuration a produces tap water with a low ph whereas configuration b produces tap water with a high ph and lower salinity mixing the treated water of these two configurations could allow to obtain tap water with the desired ph contrarily to conventional approaches no chemical inputs are needed and the system only generates a calcite precipitate to be discharged for example with the household waste the electrical conductivity of the softened water is lower than the unsoftened water further developments can include the use of the anode to achieve trace contaminant removal thereby using the electricity to the maximum and enabling a fine tuned system requiring

18373,electrochemical water softening was proposed as a sustainable alternative for ion exchange softening avoiding the input of salt to drinking water and the production of a concentrated brine here we demonstrated two novel modes of operation combining an electrochemical cell with a fluidized bed crystallizer the first approach relied on an electrochemical cell consisting of an anode and cathode separated by a cation or anion exchange membrane the feed water was first directed into a crystallizer where it was blended with alkaline cathode effluent the effluent of the crystallizer softened water was in part recirculated to the cathode to generate alkalinity in part to the anode compartment where the ph was again decreased average removal efficiencies for calcium and magnesium of 75 86 and 7 21 respectively could be sustainably reached at a specific energy consumption of 7 0 10 1 kwh kg 1 caco3 0 86 1 39 kwh m 3 water this configuration allowed reagent free water softening albeit with an effluent with a ph between 3 0 and 3 6 in a second mode of operation the process influent to soften was also directed to the crystallizer and recirculated over the cathode which was separated from the anode using an anion exchange membrane in this mode of operation the cathode effluent was sent through the crystallizing unit and the anode compartment was operated in closed loop average calcium and magnesium removal efficiencies of 73 78 and 40 44 were obtained at specific energy consumptions of 5 8 7 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 0 77 0 88 kwh m 3 water although the softened water had an elevated ph 9 4 the advantage of this configuration is concomitant removal of anions and the formation of acids disinfectant in the anode compartment both methods of operation thus showed reagent free water softening at a relatively low specific energy consumption these novel methods of softening could be used in remote locations where access to chemicals or discharge of ion exchange brines proves to be difficult or in case addition of chemicals for softening is unwanted further research is needed to further decrease the specific energy consumption during long term operation keywords electrochemical cell calcium ion exchange membrane water treatment chemical free softening 1 introduction water softening minimizes the risk of scaling in industrial and domestic piping systems when using aqueous solutions in which depending on the conditions the salts can exceed the solubility limit and deposit on piping surfaces hasson et al 2010 scaling with mostly calcium and magnesium salts is not only undesired because of the effects and costs of eventual clogging of piping but it also reduces the energetic efficiency in heat exchangers and boilers and decreases the efficiency of water membrane filtration applications gabrielli et al 2006 hasson et al 2010 sung et al 2008 venkatesan and wankat 2011 yu et al 2019 in households hard water is known to cause scale deposition on domestic devices washing machines coffee machines to reduce the efficiency of water boilers to increase the soap and detergent consumption and to decrease comfort e g in showers van der bruggen et al 2009 ion exchange is commonly used to replace calcium and magnesium with monovalent ions the salinity of the water increases since the bivalent cations are replaced by a double molar concentration of monovalent ions e g sodium the ion exchange process in addition consumes salts or acid for the regeneration of the resins and a brine waste product containing salts 50 g l 1 hardness ions and organic

evaporation ponds treatment while discharge to the sewer system can result in toxicity to the associated activated sludge systems downstream and or corrosion in the sewer itself ariono et al 2016 chen et al 2016 romero barranco et al 2001 in most cases still ion exchange brines are discharged to the sewer system and contribute together with the discharge of used softened water with a higher salinity to a salinification of the watershed ground and surface water to which the treated wastewater is discharged which might eventually lead to a reduced availability of fresh water chen et al 2016 this might not be a global concern but has already led to bans or restrictions in specific critical areas e g in many communities in california on water softeners that rely on salts or acids for

been proposed and implemented as a way to remove calcium and magnesium from water without the need to dose reagents and without brine production gabrielli et al 2006 hasson et al 2008 nair and misra 1978 sanjuán et al 2019a the system relies on a ph increase in the proximity of e g an oxygen or water reducing cathode which also changes the carbonate equilibrium and results in the precipitation of caco3 and mg oh 2 hasson et al 2008 zeppenfeld 2011 a disadvantage is the high specific electrode area requirement since the scale mainly deposits on the cathodic electrode surface luan et al 2019 yu et al 2018a regeneration of the cathode has been described to be challenging as the electrical resistance increases as more deposits adhere to the cathode gabrielli et al 2006 luan et al 2019 yu et al 2018b hasson et al 2010 presented a novel configuration of an electrochemical water softening system in which the acidifying anode was separated from the alkalinizing cathode by a cation exchange membrane cem this proposed system allowed precipitation in an external crystallizer downstream of the cathode in this way the electrode area requirements could drastically be reduced as the electrochemical cell is continuously forcing cations e g sodium from the anode to the cathode through the cem by electrical migration the anolyte salt needs to be replaced upon depletion in this way the proposed technology cannot be considered as a zero chemical input technology zaslavschi et al 2013 designed two configurations for electrochemical water softening of synthetic brackish and seawater that would allow for operation without the need to provide salts by combining bipolar membranes bpm and cems in a four compartment configuration in one configuration used by these authors ia two cems one central bpm a similar flow rate of feed water as the flow rate of hard water that was treated was used as an external input of sodium calcium and magnesium to enable electromigration through the cem resulting in a cathodic ph increase this configuration resulted in a higher caco3 hardness removal at lower charge densities electrode surface and energy consumption compared to their previous electrochemical cem configuration where anode and cathode were separated by only one cem hasson et al 2010 although chlorine generation could not be prevented in configuration ia another configuration ii two bipolar membranes one central cem was proposed where the cations from the cathodically treated water could theoretically be used for cation recycling thus alleviating the need to foresee an input of salts to maintain the operation of the electrochemical water softening although this concept itself with cation recycling was not tested a similar concept iid where a synthetic brackish feed was used in the third acidic compartment instead of treated softened brackish water could successfully achieve caco3 precipitation without chlorine formation but without internal cation recycling zaslavschi et al 2013 applying electrochemical water softening on tap water is expected to be energetically less favorable than seawater as the electrical conductivity of tap water is much lower 0 5 ms cm 1 than seawater 50 ms cm 1 resulting in an increase of the ohmic voltage drop for the same electrode membrane configuration therefore minimizing the number of ion exchange membranes and the distance between the electrodes is expected to minimize the ohmic voltage drop when treating tap water the aim of this study was to demonstrate two novel concepts for electrochemical water softening of local tap water to achieve a reagent free approach towards effluent with a lower electrical conductivity two new process schemes are proposed that combine the advantages of an electrochemical softening system with a single ion exchange membrane and a zero chemical input system both configurations were evaluated in terms of bivalent cation removal final composition of the softened water and power consumption and the optimal charge density for tap water softening was identified 2 materials and methods an electrochemical cell 2 perspex frames 20 5 2 cm³ internal

the charge density was evaluated every charge density was maintained for at least four times the hydraulic retention time hrt so every charge density was tested for at least 49 h the flow rate was measured several times per week and the average flow rate over a whole run was used for further calculations the average process influent flow rate was between 0 32 and 0 34 l h 1 and one hrt between 12 9 and 13 7 h during the short term tests during runs a1 a2 a3 and a4 the flow rate was between 0 52 and 0 56 l h 1 hrt between 7 8 and 8 5 h samples were taken for analysis once the ph in the crystallizer reached a steady state value and average values and standard deviations were calculated based on the different samples taken throughout the same run the duration of runs a1 a2 a3 and a4 was 324 h 150 h 199 h and 192 h respectively treated effluent from previous operation was used as fresh anolyte in configuration b during run b1 500 ml anolyte was replaced approximately every 70 h mainly because of difficulties maintaining a constant anolyte volume water displacement between cathode and anode through the aem during run b2 the anolyte 750 ml was replaced twice after approximately 100 h after which the anode was operated with 1500 ml of fresh anolyte for another 200 h samples were taken for analysis once the ph in the crystallizer reached a steady state value and average values and standard deviations were calculated based on the different samples taken throughout the same run during runs b1 and b2 the flow rate was between 0 56 and 0 58 l h 1 hrt between 7 6 and 7 9 h the duration of runs b1 and b2 was 214 and 504 h respectively the concentrations of anions and cations were determined on a metrohm 930 and 761 compact ion chromatograph respectively

configuration a with a cem electrochemical water softening by internal sodium and potassium cycling 3 1 1 effect of charge density on the calcium removal the effectiveness of configuration a was tested at different charge densities 175 3129 c l 1 tap water with unmodified local tap water in order to obtain a calcium concentration below 0 5 mm 80 removal efficiency a charge density of at least 524 c l 1 tap water was required fig 2 b d while the ec of the tap water decreased from 0 45 0 02 ms cm 1 to 0 35 0 04 ms cm 1 from 524 c l 1 tap water on a ph of 9 8 or higher could be established in the crystallizer precipitation vessel by circulating the crystallizer liquid over the cathodic compartment fig 2a the ph of the cathodic effluent was slightly higher than the ph in the crystallizer where the process influent which had a lower ph was dosed in configuration a the liquid of the crystallizer passed first through the anode before being discharged to the effluent vessel resulting in a ph of 3 4 in the effluent a charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water was insufficient to establish a ph increase that was sufficient to remove the calcium more than 80 during the operation at a charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water the voltage over the cell needed to maintain this charge density increased from 5 0 v in the beginning of the test to 8 7 v after 121 h of operation whereas for charge densities of 524 c l 1 tap water or higher the cell voltage did not tend to increase at this low charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water the calcium concentration in the anode effluent was lower than in the cathodic effluent and crystallizer fig 2b the ohmic resistance increased up to 1 38 0 04 ω m2 at the end of the test while it had remained relatively constant at 0 38 0 02 ω m2 during the tests in the range of 524 3129 c l 1 tap water at charge densities up to 1097 c l 1 tap water no changes in the chloride concentration were observed whereas at 2237 and 3129 c l 1 tap water the chloride concentrations in the cathode effluent and the crystallizer were lower 0 1 0 2 mm compared to the process influent and effluent 0 7 0 8 mm fig 2c this is an indication for local cycling of chloride ions by electrical migration from cathode to anode even through the cem which purpose is to minimize anion migration however without clear chloride removal in the system the calcium removal efficiency could be increased up to 94 with a concomitant calcium effluent concentration below 0 2 mm by increasing the charge density to 2237 c l 1 tap water or higher however where the specific electrical energy consumption for calcium removal at 524 c l 1 tap was 5 4 0 2 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed 0 9 0 0 kwh m 3 tap water treated it increased up to 58 8 2 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed 9 9 0 1 kwh m 3 tap water treated at a charge density of 2237 c l 1 tap water fig 2d while the specific electrical energy consumption was relatively low 2 4 0 9 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed 0 3 0 1 kwh m 3 tap water treated at 175 c l 1 tap water the calcium removal efficiency was only 56 9 and the cell voltage could not be maintained constant over time 3 1 2 long term operation the long term stability of the process in configuration a was evaluated during three separate runs with a charge density of 646 c l 1 tap water run a1 480 c l 1 tap water run a2 and 633 c l 1 tap water run a3 respectively during at least 18 hrts 150 300 h fig 3 the cathodically induced ph increase 9 8 10 8 in the crystallizer could be maintained for all three runs fig 3 resulting in a calcium effluent concentration of 0 26 0 12 mm for run a1 and 0 33 0 04 mm for run a3 while a calcium effluent quality of 0 41 0 02 mm was obtained during run a2 where a lower charge density 480 c l 1 tap water was applied for runs a1 and a3 where the charge density was higher than 600 c l 1 tap water average calcium removal efficiencies of more than 82 were obtained while the removal efficiency was 75 1 during run a2 table 1 the process influent magnesium concentration ranged between 0 28 and 0 36 mm and the removal efficiency in run a2 and a3 was only 21 7 and 7 7 respectively no data for run a1 after passage through the anode the ph of the effluent was in the range of 3 0 3 6 and the ohmic resistance of the cell could be maintained at 0 32 0 04 ω m2 during the three runs the ec of the process influent was 0 57 0 13 ms cm 1 and decreased on average with 14 18 after passage through the system table 1 the sodium concentration in the crystallizer was 2 5 3 3 times higher than in the process influent whereas the sodium effluent concentration was similar as or slightly lower than the process influent concentration table 1 an even higher concentration effect was observed for potassium in the crystallizer 4 4 5 9 table 1 this concentrating of sodium and potassium in the crystallizer and cathode indicates that monovalent cations are recycled in the system by electromigration from anode back to cathode through the cem the chloride recovery efficiency in the effluent was 99 7 97 6 and 93 4 for runs a1 a2 and a3 respectively process influent concentration 0 92 0 06 mm which indicates that little max 7 or no chloride oxidation occurred at the anode table 1 similar concentrations were observed in the crystallizer as in the process influent and effluent during run a1 nitrate and sulfate were recovered in the effluent with an efficiency of 97 6 and 97 5 respectively whereas the nitrate recovery was only 50 16 and 45 6 for run a2 and a3 respectively nitrate process influent concentration 0 13 0 22 mm the sulfate recovery efficiency for run a2 and a3 was 85 2 and 87 2 respectively sulfate process influent concentration 0 51 0 59 mm the nitrite concentration in the process influent was below 0 02 mm and no increase nor decrease was observed in the effluent at the end of run a1 98 1 of the 2 4 0 2 mm incoming inorganic carbon was removed by the system during a titration of the effluent 0 9 mmol of naoh l 1 effluent was needed to increase the ph back to the same level as the process influent 3 2 configuration a with an aem electrochemical water softening by internal chloride cycling configuration a was also tested with an aem fujifilm for 24 hrts at a charge density of 630 c l 1 tap water run a4 the ph in the crystallizer was 9 4 0 3 and this resulted in an overall calcium removal efficiency of 81 3 the chloride concentrations in the process influent and effluent were 0 89 0 01 mm and 0 87 0 06 mm respectively while in the crystallizer the chloride concentration dropped to 0 42 0 06 mm the ec in the process influent was 0 53 0 01 ms cm 1 while the ec in the crystallizer and the effluent was 0 25 0 01 ms cm 1 and 0 40 0 08 ms cm 1 respectively the voltage required to maintain a fixed charge density started to increase after 12 hrts from 4 4 v to 17 v at the end of run a4 resulting in an increasing specific energy consumption of 8 6 20 0 kwh kg 1 caco3 the ohmic resistance increased from 0 13 to 0 71 ω m2 no increase in the nitrite concentration in the effluent was observed 3 3 configuration b with an aem water softening combined with anion removal and acid production in configuration b the effluent was directly extracted from the crystallizer without passage through the anode while the anode loop was operated in batch mode the performance of this configuration was evaluated with two different aem aem fujifilm aem m i in runs b1 and b2 respectively in both cases an increase of the ph in the crystallizer could be established to achieve effluent concentrations of 0 38 0 09 mm calcium and 0 21 0 05 mm magnesium table 2 besides precipitation of calcium and magnesium concomitant removal of anions from the tap water was established through migration through the aem where anions accumulated in the anolyte or were removed as a result also the ec of the tap water was approximately halved table 2 the removal efficiency of chloride and sulfate from the process influent was typically between 50 and 60 for both types of membrane whereas the removal of nitrate was higher in the case of the aem m i table 2 the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was 0 05 0 02 mm during run b1 and b2 while the process influent nitrite concentration was only 0 01 0 00 mm the cell voltage fluctuated more during run b1 compared to run b2 and minimizing water displacement between cathode and anode was more challenging with the aem used in run b1 during the first 23 hrts 180 h of run b2 the average cell voltage was 4 5 0 1 v fig 4 b and the specific energy consumption was 6 kwh kg 1 caco3 but then the cell voltage increased resulting in an increase in the specific energy consumption to 7 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 although the energetic efficiency decreased over time the ph gradient and calcium removal could be maintained throughout run b2 fig 4a after 311 h of operation in run b2 the generated acidic anolyte was used once to rinse the cathodic compartment for 6 h after which the operation was resumed and the cell voltage and the ohmic resistance levelled off fig 4b nevertheless a decrease in the calcium concentration in the process influent resulted in a further increase in the specific energy consumption 10 kwh kg 1 caco3 fig 4b during run b2 the anolyte was replaced by 750 ml fresh anolyte after 124 h and 198 h while after 317 h the anolyte was replaced by 1500 ml fresh anolyte the initial ph value in the anolyte rapidly decreased to 1 5 during operation the concentration of chloride nitrate and sulfate and as a consequence also the ec increased over time in the anolyte fig 5 although the concentration levelled off and decreased especially for chloride while no fluctuation was observed in the concentration of the anions in the treated tap water the recovery in the anolyte of the chloride nitrate and sulfate removed from the tap water over the 505 h of operation was 23 30 and 76 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 water softening with internal anion or cation cycling or with anion removal two different configurations for tap water softening were compared in this study in configuration a the effluent from the crystallizer passed through the anodic compartment before being discharged while in configuration b the effluent was directly extracted from the crystallizer and the anode loop was operated in batch mode overall both configurations had a similar calcium removal efficiency and energy consumption at a charge density of 600 c l 1 tap water whereas configuration b achieved an additional decrease in the salinity due to electromigration from cathode to anode ions migrate through the membrane to restore the electroneutrality in the electrode compartments to compensate the proton and hydroxyl production at anode cathode in configuration a this did not result in a net removal of anions or cations as the tap water was sent through both compartments resulting in an internal cycling of anions or cations with a cem cations sodium potassium calcium magnesium and protons migrated from the anode back to the cathode whereas with an aem anions chloride nitrate sulfate carbonate and hydroxyl ions migrated from the cathode to the anode anion migration to the anodic compartment through the aem in configuration b resulted in a net removal of anions decreasing the ec with 50 compared to 15 in configuration a the anions gradually accumulated in the anolyte creating an acidic salt solution which can be used to periodically rinse the electrochemical cell in order to remove precipitates from the electrode and membrane or it can be discharged chen et al 2016 used the acidic stream to regenerate ion exchange media in sanjuán et al 2019b electrochemical water softening was combined with electrochemical production of a weak acid to benefit from both the cathodic and anodic process an ed concentrate produced from groundwater was treated in the cathodic compartment to decrease the hardness while weak acids e g lactic acid were obtained by protonation of their conjugate bases e g lactate in the anodic compartment in configuration b the calcium and magnesium removal and decrease in ec was similar with both aem aem m i and aem fujifilm but the cell voltage fluctuated more during the run with aem fujifilm compared to the run with aem m i and minimizing water displacement between cathode and anode was more challenging with the aem fujifilm overall water displacement is a factor that needs to be managed which can be done by modulating anode fluid pressure another important difference between the two configurations is the change in ph of the tap water process influent ph 7 8 configuration a creates softened tap water with an acidic ph 3 4 due to the recirculation through the anodic compartment where protons are produced through water oxidation which imbalance the oh generation as the softening leads to some removal the tap water treated in configuration b has an alkaline high ph 9 5 as the acid is wasted the ph of tap water is typically kept between 6 5 and 9 5 further research is needed to evaluate whether the tap water treated with these electrochemical water softening systems is acceptable for potable use or is rather suited for softened process water it is important to note that due to the precipitation of carbonates and the lack of reagent addition the alkalinity of the water is very low enabling neutralization without major acid addition generating softened water at a high or low ph could be an advantage to prolong the storage time of drinking water as the extreme ph limits the risk for contamination further research would be needed to verify this as well as verify whether extreme ph have no other adverse impacts during storage if a low or a high ph in the treated tap water is undesired a combined system can be engineered in which a part of the water is treated with configuration a and the other part with configuration b further research is needed to verify that mixing the treated water of these two configurations high ph and low ph in a certain ratio could allow to obtain the desired effluent ph 4 2 optimal charge density for tap water softening the effect of the charge density on the calcium removal and specific energy consumption was investigated in configuration a with a cem separating the two electrode compartments generally the higher the charge density the more hydroxyl ions are produced at the cathode resulting in a higher ph in the crystallizer and hence more calcium removal higher supersaturation a charge density of 175 c l 1 tap water only increased the ph from 8 0 0 2 process influent ph to 8 4 0 1 removing less than 60 of the calcium hence a large fraction of the calcium remained in solution 40 which could have caused the increase in ohmic resistance and cell voltage part of the calcium migrated from anode to cathode through the cem and probably caused scaling in or on the membrane another possible explanation for the increase in ohmic resistance at a low charge density is scaling on the cathode due to the relatively low ph increase in the crystallizer ph of 8 4 at 175 c l 1 compared to ph 9 8 at charge densities 524 c l 1 there was a larger ph difference between the ph in the crystallizer and the local ph at the surface of the cathode which could have led to an increased precipitation on the cathode surface rather than in the crystallizer a charge density to 524 c l 1 tap water was sufficient to obtain 80 of calcium removal without an increasing ohmic resistance and cell voltage further stepwise increasing the charge density to 3129 c l 1 tap water only led to a slight increase in calcium removal efficiency from 83 to 93 while the energy consumption kwh m 3 tap water and specific electrical energy consumption kwh kg 1 caco3 removed increased with a factor of 10 despite the higher hydroxyl production at the cathode table 3 the ph in the crystallizer only marginally increased at higher charge densities from 524 till 3129 c l 1 tap water this can be attributed to the logarithmic nature of ph values and the limited availability of cations besides protons for electromigration to restore the electroneutrality in the electrode compartments cations migrated from the anodic compartment back to the cathodic compartment the tap water contained about 1 25 mm sodium and 0 12 mm potassium and less than 0 52 mm calcium after precipitation in the cathode while 5 mm hydroxyl is produced at charge densities above 524 c l 1 tap water hence the internal recycling of sodium and potassium from the anode to the cathode was not sufficient to compensate the hydroxyl and proton production at the electrodes as a result more protons migrated to the cathode at higher charge densities compensating the hydroxyl production at the cathode at 2237 and 3129 c l 1 tap water even chloride ions migrated from the cathode to the anode through the cem to balance the charge hence the optimal charge density for tap water softening to remove most of the calcium with a minimal energy investment was around 500 600 c l 1 tap water for the system and the water used here 4 3 safety issues concerns in both configurations chloride was present in the anodic compartment which can result in the production of chlorine cl2 due to chloride oxidation at the anode zaslavschi et al 2013 the chlorine can be released to the atmosphere or further react to hocl which can oxidize materials such as the membrane and to hcl zaslavschi et al 2013 in configuration a the chloride concentration in the anodic compartment was low 1 mm and the chloride recovery efficiencies were high indicating that there was no or very limited chloride oxidation at the anode in configuration b however chloride was concentrated in the anodic compartment which was operated in batch mode the concentration in the anolyte increased up to 10 15 mm but levelled off and decreased over time suggesting that chloride was removed by oxidation at the anode chlorine production can be prevented by applying more selective electrodes e g a boron doped diamond electrode instead of a mixed metal oxide anode by including a bpm chloride migration to the anodic compartment can be limited zaslavschi et al 2013 but this will increase the ohmic resistance and negate the ph effects needed likely the best strategy is to discharge regularly a small measure of anode fluid to minimize chloride accumulation given the low chloride concentrations in tap water the risk for formation of chlorinated byproducts is low however this requires further evaluation up to 93 removal of nitrate from the tap water was observed in configuration b2 which could be an interesting feature for generating drinking water with a low nitrate level because of the correlation between high nitrate intake and high methaemoglobin levels super et al 1981 since only 30 of the nitrate could be recovered in the anolyte it is likely that nitrate was electrochemically removed in the system future research is needed to avoid the formation of nitrite in the electrochemically treated tap water as it was found up to 0 05 mm in configuration b a second safety concern is the production of oxygen and hydrogen gas at the anode and cathode respectively table 3 a current density of 600 c l 1 tap water results in 3 1 mmol h2 l 1 tap water and 1 6 mmol o2 l 1 tap water without proper separator e g gas impermeable ion exchange membrane a flammable potentially explosive mixture of h2 and o2 could be formed due to convection or diffusion of the gasses across the membrane xiang et al 2016 so a proper risk management of the system is required for applying this technology on a large scale likely the introduction of an open air cathode with gas diffusion layer can alleviate this concern by eliminating hydrogen production besides minimizing energy requirements 4 4 how much softening is actually needed the optimal charge density in this study was around 500 600 c l 1 tap water which resulted in a calcium removal from 1 6 to 2 2 mm ca 16 22 f classified as moderately hard to hard water to 0 3 0 4 mm ca 3 4 f classified as very soft water too soft water has corrosive properties which can lead to leaching of heavy metals lead copper from piping and metal surfaces resulting in the presence of toxic heavy metals in the drinking water in flanders belgium a minimal water hardness of 15 f is imposed for the water distribution sector as it is not recommended to soften water below 15 f a bypass could be installed by mixing the softened water 15 f with non softened water 15 f the desired water hardness could be obtained and this would also neutralize the ph changes of the water i e the acidification obtained with configuration a or alkalinisation obtained with configuration b 4 5 an electrochemical softening unit for tap water softening in households electrochemical water softening is considered as alternative for ion exchange softening the cell will require an ion exchange membrane to allow for the creation of a ph gradient typically these are used in highly conductive streams like seawater and or brackish water zaslavschi et al 2013 tap water has a much lower conductivity 0 5 ms cm 1 compared to 50 ms cm 1 for seawater and therefore relative to current density the electrolyte and membrane resistances entail a higher energy consumption which implies that the current density needs to be limited the electrochemical methods of softening could be used in remote locations where access to chemicals or discharge of ion exchange brines proves to be difficult or in case the addition of chemicals for softening is unwanted the relatively low specific energy consumption 0 8 1 4 kwh m 3 tap water also opens opportunities for household based tap water softening current installations for softening at home level typically involve the use of an ion exchange unit which requires frequent regeneration with salt for a household of four people consuming 120 l water ie 1 d 1 less than 100 cm2 electrode surface area would suffice if the cell is operated at a current density of 100 a m 2 several aspects still require further development first it appears advisable to avoid chlorine formation at the anode which can be achieved with a boron doped diamond electrode interestingly such an electrode is highly suited for the removal of trace contaminants which delivers an additional benefit of further water purification second hydrogen formation at the cathode needs to be avoided which can be achieved via an open air cathode with a gas diffusion layer calcium precipitate mostly calcium carbonate will accumulate in the crystallizer and needs to be harvested from the crystallizer about 12 60 kg calcium carbonate year 1 is produced depending on the initial water hardness and the softening depth further research is necessary to determine the composition and value of this calcium precipitate which at household level could be discharged via the household waste besides the environmental benefits electrochemical water softening also seems a viable alternative to ion exchange in terms of costs si section b in contrast to ion exchange softeners which consume power 5 w salt 0 024 kg m ³ f 1 and water 1 6l m ³ f 1 for regeneration van der bruggen et al 2009 electrochemical water softening only requires energy to drive the oxidation and reduction reactions at the electrodes depending on the initial water hardness and softening depth about 60 20 f 15 f to 160 300 40 f 15 f kwh household 1 year 1 is consumed the major investment cost are the electrodes but by the use of the external crystallizer the required electrode surface is minimal 5 conclusions two configurations achieving softening of tap water at energy investments comparable to existing softeners 5 8 7 5 kwh kg 1 caco3 removed were demonstrated water reduction at the cathode increased the ph of the tap water removing 73 86 of calcium by precipitation depending on the application the softened tap water created in the cathodic compartment crystallizer i can be sent through the anodic compartment configuration a or ii can be extracted directly from the crystallizer configuration b configuration a produces tap water with a low ph whereas configuration b produces tap water with a high ph and lower salinity mixing the treated water of these two configurations could allow to obtain tap water with the desired ph contrarily to conventional approaches no chemical inputs are needed and the system only generates a calcite precipitate to be discharged for example with the household waste the electrical conductivity of the softened water is lower than the unsoftened water further developments can include the use of the anode to achieve trace contaminant removal thereby using the electricity to the maximum and enabling a fine tuned system requiring

18374,bisphenol a bpa and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are of increasing concerns for many years this paper presents the elimination of bpa under visible light vl λ 420 nm irradiated solutions containing fulvic acid fa and mnso4 mn ii and examines the possible effects of tbbpa on the transformation of bpa after 72 h of reaction time the removal efficiency of bpa in the studied system was 69 results of different experiments to identify oxidative species suggested the dominate role of soluble manganese iii mn iii in the conversion of bpa the transformation of bpa by the vl fa mn ii system was through self oligomerization in absence of co existence of tbbpa in the co existence of bpa with tbbpa the removal of bpa was largely inhibited due to the competition with available mn iii and the possible occurrence of cross coupling reactions between the two edcs this phenomenon was further elucidated by product analyses and density functional theory dft calculations the energy difference δe for generating a cross coupling product was calculated as 23 4 kj mol 1 much lower than the positive values of δe for self coupling products of bpa or tbbpa demonstrating that cross coupling reactions between bpa and tbbpa likely occurred easier than the respective self coupling reactions the toxicity test showed that the overall estrogenic activity of bpa reaction solution was significantly decreased by the vl fa mn ii system in general our study provided new insights into the transformation of co existing edcs by in situ formed mn iii in aqueous solution graphical abstract image 1 keywords mn iii visible light bisphenol a fulvic acid oligomerization dft calculations 1 introduction bisphenol a 4 4 1 methylethylidene bisphenol bpa is an essential industrial chemical with increasing demand in the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate pc plastics lin et al 2009a huang et al 2012 it is regarded as an endocrine disrupting compound that interferes human endocrine systems by multiple source exposure like pc containing drinking bottles or insulate coatings in cell phones lin et al 2009a which may lead to adverse impacts on adult reproduction and child development huang et al 2012 when released to waters bpa may also cause physiological disorders in aquatic species vermeirssen et al 2017 organic contaminants have been featured as the mixture of different pollutants bpa and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa were found as two co existing chemicals in aqueous environments e g 30 0 412 0 ng l 1 of bpa and 0 6 3 8 ng l 1 of tbbpa in sewage effluents sun et al 2018 and 0 55 1 ng l 1 of bpa and 0 8 55 ng l 1 of tbbpa in the surface water of taihu lake chen et al 2017 it is pivotal to investigate the elimination of co existing bpa and tbbpa and how tbbpa may influence the transformation of bpa in aquatic environment manganese containing oxidants are frequently studied due to their abundant contents on earth high efficiency in decontamination and relatively low toxicity towards environment lin et al 2009a zhang et al 2014 im et al 2015 balgooyen et al 2017 manganese iii trivalent manganese mn iii is a strong one electron oxidizing agent sisley and jordan 2006 with significant potential in eliminating contaminants mn iii can be generated from the aqueous oxidation of mn ii for example solid mnooh is abiotically generated through dissolved mn ii oxidation at alkaline ph in oxygen enriched aqueous solution kessick and morgan 1975 however as all d orbitals of mn ii are single electron occupied it is rather difficult to destroy this stable configuration nico et al 2002 so that the half life for natural homogeneous mn ii oxidation at ph 8 0 is relatively long 200 400 days diem and stumm 1984 von langen et al 1997 morgan 2005 it is feasible to catalytically accelerate mn ii oxidation by enzymes of bacterial and fungi webb et al 2005 or by the surfaces of metal oxides ren et al 2013 in the presence of ligands mn with higher valences are favored to be formed from mn ii ligand complexes cabelli and bielski 1984a 1984b duckworth and sposito 2005 chen and huang 2008 notably the generation rate of mnox x is between 1 and 2 could be promoted to 5 8 55 pm h 1 by o2 under simulated sunlight in the presence of humic acid nico et al 2002 in our previous study soluble mn iii was produced in humic acid solutions irradiated by visible light vl λ 420 nm and could be applied in the abatement of estrogens and chlorophene wang et al 2018a 2018b currently there is no study on bpa transformation led by in situ formed mn iii with the assistance of vl and fa importantly the studies on removing organic contaminants by vl fa mn ii in presence of co existing edcs are not known in literature the present study aims to degrade bpa alone and in combination with tbbpa by the vl fa mn ii system the dominated role of mn iii to cause elimination of bpa was elucidated by multiple quenching experiments the transformation intermediates of bpa were identified by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer hplc ms ms method to propose the reaction pathways the influences of various experimental parameters ph and dosages of mn ii and fa on mn iii formation and bpa disappearance were also systematically investigated the effect of tbbpa on the transformation of bpa by mn iii was observed by kinetics experiments and elaborated through product identification and density functional theory dft based calculations molecular descriptors and transition states the overall estrogenic activity of bpa and its products were assessed in general the results of our study suggest a novel approach to transform bpa by soluble mn iii and the fate of bpa when involved in co existing with other pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals details of chemicals used in this study are given in text s1 supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 vl assisted mn iii generation in presence of mn ii and fa 2 2 1 1 mn iii detection experiments were performed in capped quartz tubes 25 mm i d 18 cm irradiated by a 500 w xenon lamp with six surrounding optical filters λ 420 nm which were placed in a xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china equipped with a magnetic stirrer the typical reaction solution without the target substrate bpa used in this study was consisted of fa and mnso4 naac hac buffer solution 10 mm was used to maintain ph which had negligible effect on mn cycling sun et al 2013 the concentrations of mn iii at various irradiation times were measured by the method reported previously madison et al 2011 oldham et al 2015 the synthesis of α β γ δ tetrakis 4 carboxyphenyl porphine t 4 cp p was carried out by a known procedure ishii et al 1982 chiswell and o halloran 1991 to measure the in situ formed mn iii three stock solutions were prepared a 20 μm t 4 cp p solution a buffer solution i ph 8 0 containing 12 5 mm sodium tetraborate 20 mm hydrochloric acid and 0 15 m imidazole and a 1 2 mm cadmium chloride cdcl2 solution in performing experiments 360 μl t 4 cp p stock solution 120 μl buffer solution i 120 μl cdcl2 stock solution and 2 4 ml deionized water were thoroughly mixed in a quartz cell 1 cm pathlength and 4 ml volume and the baseline was obtained using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometer tu 1800 persee china after sampling the reaction solution 30 μl was added and the absorbance change of mn iii t 4 cp p at 468 nm was promptly recorded at 5 min of time intervals the concentrations of mn iii concentrations were calculated by fitting the kinetic curves of mn iii t 4 cp p using the following eq 1 1 m n t o t a l m n i i 1 e k 1 t m n i i i 1 e k 2 t where mn ii and mn iii are the concentrations of divalent and trivalent manganese in samples respectively t is the complexation time between manganese ions and t 4 cp p k 1 and k 2 are the rate constants for complexation reactions of mn ii and mn iii by t 4 cp p respectively details on using eq 1 are provided in text s2 2 2 1 2 o2 and 1o2 detection the detection of o2 in vl fa and vl fa mn ii systems was examined by 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo o2 is transient and dimethylsulfoxide dmso was applied to detect it samoilova et al 2011 the solution to detect o2 in the vl fa system was prepared by mixing 450 μl dmso 5 μl fa 10 g l 1 and 50 μl dmpo 0 1 m the vl fa mn ii system consisted of 450 μl dmso 5 μl fa 10 g l 1 1 3 μl or 5 μl mnso4 100 mm and 50 μl dmpo 0 1 m after 20 min of irradiation time the signal of dmpo o2 adduct was determined by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr emx 10 12 bruker germany the 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium 5 carboxanilide xtt 90 was also utilized to trap o2 in vl fa and vl fa mn ii systems and the generated xtt formazan formed from 50 μm xtt was detected by the uv vis spectrometer tu 1800 persee china at 475 nm wavelength the concentration of xtt formazan was calculated by measuring absorbance at 475 nm extinction coefficient at 475 nm 23800 m 1 cm 1 sutherland and learmonth 1997 an agent 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was applied to trap 1o2 and subsequently analyzed by epr technique no signal of temp 1o2 adducts was detected in h2o data not shown it was previously reported that 1o2 was more stable in d2o than in h2o haag and hoigne 1986 ho et al 2019 therefore the reaction solution was prepared using 450 μl d2o 10 μl fa 10 g l 1 and 100 μl temp 1 5 g l 1 2 2 2 bpa conversion in vl fa mn ii system batch kinetic experiments of degradation of 10 μm bpa and 10 μm tbbpa were performed the effects of initial concentrations of mn ii 20 800 μm and fa 0 25 10 0 mg l 1 and ph 3 0 7 0 on the transformation of bpa by vl fa mn ii system were explored acetate buffer solution 10 mm was used to maintain ph at suitable intervals in the illumination experiments 1 0 ml samples containing residual bpa or tbbpa were collected disproportionation of mn iii is spontaneous 2mn3 aq 2h2o mno2 s mn2 aq 4h therefore all samples were filtered by 0 22 μm filters to avoid any possible mn oxides the filtrates were instantly subjected to analysis by hplc method to identify the leading oxidizing species in this reaction we selected pp tba furfuryl alcohol ffa and bq to quench mn iii oh 1o2 and o2 respectively stability constant logk for mn pp 2 5 is 28 9 31 25 webb et al 2005 qian et al 2019 rate constants k for the reaction between oh and tba 1o2 and ffa o2 and bq are 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 haag et al 1984 9 108 m 1 s 1 greenstock and ruddock 1976 respectively the molar ratio of bpa to quenchers was set at 1 1000 a common ratio to observe significant inhibitory effect guan et al 2013 ji et al 2015 bpa and tbbpa transformation products were extracted using cnwbond lc c18 spe cartridges 1 g 6 ml cnw technologies first the spe cartridges were conditioned by 5 0 ml methanol and 5 0 ml ultrapure water in sequence and then 40 ml samples were subjected to them after inorganic salts on the cartridges were washed by a few aliquots of ultrapure water the cartridges were dried and then 4 0 ml methanol was applied to individually elute bpa or tbbpa and their products which were determined by applying hplc ms ms analysis all experiments were performed at least in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods residual bpa was quantified by an agilent 1200 hplc system agilent technologies usa specifically separated at 1 0 ml min 1 at 30 c by an agilent zorbax 300sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm agilent technologies usa and detected at 276 nm by a diode array detector the mobile phase was comprised of methanol and 0 3 formic acid aqueous solution v v 65 35 the quantification of tbbpa was carried out at the same system at a wavelength of 211 nm and using the mobile phase of methanol and 0 3 formic acid aqueous solution v v 85 15 for product identification the transformation products of bpa and tbbpa were separated by an agilent 1260 hplc system agilent technologies usa on a thermo bds hypersil c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm thermo fisher scientific usa by a gradient elution at a rate of 200 μl min 1 the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and 0 1 formic acid aqueous solution transformation products were qualitatively and semi quantitatively analyzed by a triple tof 5600 ms detector ab sciex usa the same gradient elution procedures ms and ms ms calibration methods and operation parameters for tof detection were also shown in our previous studies yao et al 2019 2 4 dft based theoretical calculations frontier orbital theory suggests that the highest occupied molecular orbitals homo are tightly relevant with reactive sites in an organic molecular todeschini and consonni 2009 for instance where there are orbitals with the highest density of two electrons 2 ci homo 2 ci homo represents the electron density of one homo electrophilic reactions are prone to occur lee et al 2001 the configurations of bpa and its dimer as well as of tbbpa were optimized by gaussian 09 program at rb3lyp 6 311g level and the electron densities of homo on all atoms except hydrogen within the studied molecules were calculated we obtained the values of 2 ci homo 2 for both of bpa and tbbpa o atom o1 and the c atom in the para position of another c atom connecting with o1 were the most vulnerable sites because of their high values of 2 ci homo 2 as mn iii leads one electron reactions radicals bpa tbbpa and h would be involved and they were optimized at ub3lyp 6 311g level transition state ts theory was applied to explain the differences of reactions between radicals bpa and tbbpa and neutral molecules bpa and tbbpa all geometry optimizations vibrational frequency calculations and energy calculations of these ts reactant and product complexes were performed at ub3lyp lanl2dz level those complexes were optimized to local minima on each potential surface with no imaginary frequency while all stabilized tss were confirmed to have only one imaginary frequency the deduction of intrinsic reactant coordinates irc pathways was used to validate that reactants and products were connected by ts the energy differences δe between reactant complexes rc and ts and product complexes pc were computed using total energy e 2 5 estrogenic activity examination the details of the method are described in text s3 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 effective elimination of bpa in vl fa mn ii system the elimination of bpa under different systems is shown in fig 1 results demonstrated all of the three components of the vl fa mn ii were necessary for removing bpa when individual component i e vl or fa or mn ii was applied to degrade bpa almost no removal was obtained fig 1 however 69 removal of bpa was achieved in the combination of vl mn ii and fa at 72 h bpa was too refractory to be transformed since almost no removal occurred to bpa in 72 h under dark in the presence of fa under vl irradiation only 6 2 of bpa could be removed but with the addition of mn ii the removal rate of bpa was enhanced to 68 8 after 72 h reaction time the results suggest a synergistic effect of all three components i e vl mn ii and fa to transform bpa the concentration of in situ formed mn iii was quantified which could be sustainably generated in the vl fa mn ii system see experimental details in text s4 of supporting information when studying the effect of ph we found that the trends of bpa removal and mn iii consumption at various ph occurred simultaneously this suggested that bpa was mainly attacked by the mn iii in the vl fa mn ii system see the details in text s5 in supporting information mn ii and fa positively influenced the removal of bpa when their dosages became larger details given in text s6 in supporting information 3 2 the identification of oxidizing species generated in vl fa mn ii system in the vl fa mn ii system the possible reactive species that caused removal of bpa were recognized with the assistance of the quenchers tba for oh guan et al 2013 ji et al 2015 ffa for 1o2 burns et al 2012 cheng et al 2017 pp for mn iii webb et al 2005 hu et al 2017 and bq for o2 burns et al 2012 du et al 2014 the pseudo first order kinetics model fitted well with the experimental data of the removal of bpa in the vl fa mn ii system and corresponding pseudo first order rate constants k obs min 1 were calculated fig 2 a illustrated that the addition of tba neither positively nor negatively influenced bpa removal without any quenchers removal of bpa was 63 4 after 72 h reaction comparatively 65 7 of bpa was eliminated in the presence of tba suggesting that oh was not responsible to transform bpa in the vl fa mn ii system the other three quenchers i e ffa pp and bq showed decrease in removal efficiency by 4 17 times calculated by specific k obs shown in fig 2b and the removal of bpa was 19 9 8 9 and 0 after 72 h irradiation respectively the role of dissolved oxygen in the vl fa mn ii system was also investigated fig s6 showed that the conversion rate of bpa was reduced from 68 8 to 48 3 under argon gas purging indicating dissolved oxygen participated in the reactions carried out by vl fa mn ii system based on the results from the above experiments and other published literature we proposed a reaction in scheme 1 that explained the roles of dissolved oxygen 3o2 1o2 mn iii and o2 in the vl fa mn ii system the generation of 1o2 and o2 was revealed by the energy transfer from irradiated fa to 3o2 zepp et al 1977 cooper et al 1989 latch and mcneill 2006 by pathway a 1o2 could be further converted to o2 with the assistance of fa through pathways b and c o2 could oxidize mn ii to mn iii or directly transform bpa respectively mn iii attacked directly bpa pathway d it seems some dissolved oxygen was still present in our experimental set up of argon gas purging because only partial suppression of bpa removal was observed the addition of excess bq completely inhibited bpa removal since it completely inhibited pathways b and c and neither o2 nor mn iii was available when pp was added 8 9 of bpa could still be removed by pathway c though mn iii was trapped by pp and pathway d was blocked ffa could quench 1o2 to prevent its further formation of o2 so it also negatively influenced the abatement of bpa however when ffa was added bpa could still be attacked by o2 and mn iii through pathways b d this is consistent with the previous literature that the irradiation of vl on humic materials would transfer the absorbed energy to dissolved oxygen so that 1o2 and o2 could be generated zepp et al 1977 cooper et al 1989 latch and mcneill 2006 the o2 could also be produced from 1o2 by the latter abstracting an electron from chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom 1o2 cdom cdom o2 dalrymple et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 the existence of 1o2 in vl fa system was confirmed by the signal of temp 1o2 adducts detected in measurement of epr method fig s7 supporting information additionally we used two probes i e dmpo and xtt to explain the proposed reaction between mn ii and o2 in the epr experiments we detected the signal of dmpo o2 peak fig 2c when fa was irradiated using vl it was interesting that it was attenuated with the addition of mn ii and the inhibition became more prominent as the concentration of mn ii increased no signals of dmpo o2 and dmpo other possible radicals adducts were detected in the presence of only dmso fig 2d illustrates that xtt formazan was generated continuously when fa was illuminated by vl however it was restrained by the presence of mn ii under the same conditions the decrease in the intensity of dmpo o2 adducts and the concentration of xtt formazan indicated that mn ii could react with o2 it has been reported that mn ii could be oxidized to mn iii or mn iv by o2 mediated by humic substances under simulated sunlight illumination nico et al 2002 in natural seawater samples mn ii would react with o2 to generate mn iii with second order rate constants of 6 106 1 107 m 1 s 1 mn ii o2 mn iii h2o2 hansard et al 2011 these phenomena demonstrated that mn iii was formed by the reaction between mn ii and o2 fig 1 shows that both mn iii and o2 directly contributed to the bpa conversion it has been reported that o2 reacts much faster with mn ii k o2 mn ii 106 107 m 1 s 1 hansard et al 2011 than phenolic compounds k o2 phenolic compounds 102 105 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 rené et al 2010 therefore mn iii played a more significant role than o2 in the destruction of bpa 3 3 product identification and reaction pathways elucidation of bpa nine products of bpa p1 p9 were found in the vl fa mn ii system the structural deconstructions of bpa and these intermediates and the isotope ratios of their ion peaks are displayed in figs s8 s17 supporting information p3 was selected as an example to demonstrate the structural analyses of all the products in fig s11b the difference of m z values between the fragments m z 453 21 and m z 359 17 indicated that p3 contained a phenoxy group which was confirmed by the detection of fragment m z 93 04 a bpa monomer was dissociated from the fragment m z 359 17 and the remained fragment m z 133 07 was detected from m z 453 21 to m z 423 16 from m z 453 21 to m z 227 07 and from m z 359 17 to m z 319 13 all these differences suggested that p3 involved multiple ch3 groups based on the above results we proposed that p3 was a dimer of bpa the structures of all other eight products were resolved following the above method and displayed in figs s9b s10b and s12b s17b supporting information the reaction pathways of bpa are proposed using the assistance of a dft based descriptor 2 ci homo 2 which was applied to distinguish the most reactive sites of bpa the values of 2 ci homo 2 at 1c atom 0 089 2c atom 0 076 4c atom 0 142 and 7o atom 0 121 on bpa fig s18a were relatively high indicating that these sites were prone to react with the in situ formed mn iii in the current reaction system by the attack of mn iii one proton and one electron would detach from 7o atom and the hydrogen atom connected with it the left unpaired electron may also appear at 2c and 4c therefore bpa radical exhibited the resonance structures of rb1 rb2 and rb3 scheme 2 the splitting of rb1 would result in the detachment of the two aromatic rings of bpa molecule and led to the development of p1 p5 p6 and p8 it was reported that the bpa molecule was first converted into rb1 and then cleaved into carbonium 2 4 hydroxyl phenyl propyl which further reacted with hydroquinone to generate p1 lin et al 2009a li et al 2018 rb2 could be carboxylated on the 2c atom to generate p2 respectively rb3 may attack the 2c atom of another bpa molecule so that the dimer of bpa p3 was formed according to the 2 ci homo 2 values of each site on p3 fig s18b we reckoned that 15c atom 0 040 and 17o atom 0 058 of the fourth benzene ring b4 were the most likely sites to be attacked to form p4 p7 it has been reported that humic acid could be broken by ultraviolet irradiation into smaller molecules such as formic acid and acetic acid zhong et al 2018 which may provide cooh groups when 17β estradiol was transformed by ε mno2 nanorods in humic acid solution products with additional cooh or ch2cooh groups attached were also detected by high resolution mass spectrometry sun et al 2016 similarly we speculated that p2 and p4 may be formed by the coupling of bpa and low molecular weight organic acids released from decomposed fulvic acid oxidative reactions may be less likely to occur on the benzene ring b3 since the possible steric hindrance though the values of 2 ci homo 2 of atoms on b3 were quite large p8 and p9 were further formed through c o coupling following the above mechanism formation of bpa dimer by bpa radicals through c o and c c coupling was also identified in the oxidative removal of bpa by manganese dioxide lin et al 2009a oligomerization of estrogens wang et al 2018b and chlorophene and 17β estradiol wang et al 2018a mediated by mn iii through single electron coupling reactions were also reported based on the results of lc ms ms analyses theoretical calculations and previous literature we proposed the possible transformation pathways of bpa in the vl fa mn ii system see scheme 2 the overall estrogenic activity of bpa and its products was decreased after their transformation by mn iii indicating that the vl fa mn ii system was beneficial in decreasing the toxicity of bpa which may also be effective to other endocrine disrupting chemicals see detailed discussion in text s7 3 4 the influence of tbbpa the influence of tbbpa on the removal of bpa by the vl fa mn ii system was investigated fig 3 demonstrated that 52 2 of bpa was eliminated in the vl fa mn ii system within 48 h comparatively only 33 2 of bpa was removed in the presence of 10 μm of tbbpa the conversion rate of tbbpa alone was only 13 5 but it was obviously elevated to 28 8 within 48 h in the presence of 10 μm of bpa a previous study found similar phenomena that 1 guaiacol and 4 chloroaniline were incubated with the peroxidase guaiacol disappearance was notably less whereas the transformation of 4 chloroaniline was little interfered relative to their individual transformation 2 in the incubation with the laccase the 4 chloroaniline disappearance was considerably enhanced in the presence of guaiacol but the reaction of guaiacol was hardly disturbed simmons et al 1989 on the other hand combined promotion of the removal of chlorophene and 17β estradiol was also observed in the mn iii mediated reaction wang et al 2018a four transformation products of tbbpa were identified in the vl fa mn ii system and their proposed structures were verified through the high values of 2 c ri homo 2 of atomic sites on tbbpa 1c 0 373 2c 0 257 4c 0 088 and 7o 0 366 shown in fig s18c and the ms ms spectra of tbbpa and p10 p13 figs s20 s24 isotope ratios of the ion peaks of tbbpa and p10 p13 are also listed figs s20 s24 p10 and p11 were reported in the oxidative processes of tbbpa by permanganate pang et al 2014 and manganese dioxide lin et al 2009b the main reaction pathways of tbbpa were also self oligomerization and displayed in scheme 2 self oligomerization would involve a two step reaction 1 the formation of bpa or tbbpa radicals bpa and tbbpa and 2 the reaction between radicals and molecules with the assistance of mn iii the hydroxyl groups of bpa and tbbpa could be dissociated which led to the formation of bpa h and tbbpa h respectively the dissociation energy of bpa was calculated at ub3lyp 6 311g level as 367 4 kj mol 1 a little lower than that of tbbpa 372 7 kj mol 1 it indicated that 1 when bpa and tbbpa reacted with mn iii separately bpa was converted faster by mn iii 2 when bpa and tbbpa co existed competition to react with mn iii happened to result in slow down of the conversion of bpa more information on the effect of reaction between radicals and molecules on the conversion of bpa is given in next section 3 5 self coupling vs cross coupling for bpa in the mixed system of bpa and tbbpa p1 and p3 p9 from bpa were generated p10 p13 were originated from tbbpa and two bpa tbbpa were cross coupling products p14 and p15 the proposed fragmentation patterns and isotope ratios of p14 and p15 ion peaks are displayed in figs s25 and s26 supporting information we calculated the relative contents of p1 and p3 p9 using eq 2 p10 p13 were based on eq 3 2 p b a p r o d u c t a b p a 0 m i n 3 p t a p r o d u c t a t b b p a 0 m i n where aproduct was the peak area of each product at each sampling time abpa 0 min and atbbpa 0 min were the peak areas of bpa and tbbpa at 0 min of each reaction in single substrate system or mixed substrates system respectively and pb and pt were the relative contents of products sourced from bpa and tbbpa respectively in fig s27 it was found that the generation of self coupling products p1 and p3 p9 was strongly inhibited when bpa was mixed with tbbpa compared to that of bpa alone similar suppression of p10 p13 of tbbpa was also detected fig s28 supporting information the time profile of the generation of p14 and p15 is displayed in fig s29 it could be seen from figs s27 s29 that p14 and p15 were formed much sooner than other products of bpa or tbbpa self oligomerization indicating cross coupling reactions were in preferable when bpa was mixed with tbbpa on the other hand the energy differences between ts and rc e a and pc and rc δe that were related to p3 and p13 p15 were calculated at the b3lyp lanl2dz level fig 4 the value of δe determines reaction direction the negative value of it accounts for a spontaneous reaction while a positive value demonstrates the reaction needs additional energy input the only negative value of δe of p14 generation 23 4 kj mol 1 demonstrated that bpa and tbbpa were prior to be cross coupled than self coupled when tbbpa was added e a has a negative relationship with reaction rate fig 4 illustrated that e a 91 3 kj mol 1 of bpa self coupling is the lowest among all four couplings so bpa was transformed faster alone than when mixed with tbbpa the transformation of tbbpa was promoted with bpa present as e a was reduced from 112 3 kj mol 1 to 106 6 kj mol 1 these results were in accordance with fig 3 besides under argon saturation the product distribution was not changed but the content of all products decreased fig s30 and figs s27 s29 which confirmed the contribution of dissolved oxygen as discussed in section 3 2 in general the influence of tbbpa on bpa removal is negative the above results suggested that the coexistence of tbbpa could disturb the transformation of bpa mediated by mn iii in vl fa mn ii system these phenomena may disclose the reasons why bpa is refractory in real aquatic environment 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated that bpa could be effectively removed by the in situ formed mn iii in the vl fa mn ii system removal of bpa was mainly by self oligomerization supported by hplc ms ms analyses and dft based calculations removal of bpa in vl fa mn ii system was notably suppressed in the presence of tbbpa because mn iii was competed and the self coupling reactions of bpa were significantly inhibited by tbbpa in the mixed solution of bpa and tbbpa the cross coupling reactions of bpa and tbbpa were found to contribute to enhancing the removal of tbbpa compared to the only tbbpa system further investigations may also be explored when bpa co existed with other organic pollutants and

18374,bisphenol a bpa and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are of increasing concerns for many years this paper presents the elimination of bpa under visible light vl λ 420 nm irradiated solutions containing fulvic acid fa and mnso4 mn ii and examines the possible effects of tbbpa on the transformation of bpa after 72 h of reaction time the removal efficiency of bpa in the studied system was 69 results of different experiments to identify oxidative species suggested the dominate role of soluble manganese iii mn iii in the conversion of bpa the transformation of bpa by the vl fa mn ii system was through self oligomerization in absence of co existence of tbbpa in the co existence of bpa with tbbpa the removal of bpa was largely inhibited due to the competition with available mn iii and the possible occurrence of cross coupling reactions between the two edcs this phenomenon was further elucidated by product analyses and density functional theory dft calculations the energy difference δe for generating a cross coupling product was calculated as 23 4 kj mol 1 much lower than the positive values of δe for self coupling products of bpa or tbbpa demonstrating that cross coupling reactions between bpa and tbbpa likely occurred easier than the respective self coupling reactions the toxicity test showed that the overall estrogenic activity of bpa reaction solution was significantly decreased by the vl fa mn ii system in general our study provided new insights into the transformation of co existing edcs by in situ formed mn iii in aqueous solution graphical abstract image 1 keywords mn iii visible light bisphenol a fulvic acid oligomerization dft calculations 1 introduction bisphenol a 4 4 1 methylethylidene bisphenol bpa is an essential industrial chemical with increasing demand in the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate pc plastics lin et al 2009a huang et al 2012 it is regarded as an endocrine disrupting compound that interferes human endocrine systems by multiple source exposure like pc containing drinking bottles or insulate coatings in cell phones lin et al 2009a which may lead to adverse impacts on adult reproduction and child development huang et al 2012 when released to waters bpa may also cause physiological disorders in aquatic species vermeirssen et al 2017 organic contaminants have been featured as the mixture of different pollutants bpa and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa were found as two co existing chemicals in aqueous environments e g 30 0 412 0 ng l 1 of bpa and 0 6 3 8 ng l 1 of tbbpa in sewage effluents sun et al 2018 and 0 55 1 ng l 1 of bpa and 0 8 55 ng l 1 of tbbpa in the surface water of taihu lake chen et al 2017 it is pivotal to investigate the elimination of co existing bpa and tbbpa and how tbbpa may influence the transformation of bpa in aquatic environment manganese containing oxidants are frequently studied due to their abundant contents on earth high efficiency in decontamination and relatively low toxicity towards environment lin et al 2009a zhang et al 2014 im et al 2015 balgooyen et al 2017 manganese iii trivalent manganese mn iii is a strong one electron oxidizing agent sisley and jordan 2006 with significant potential in eliminating contaminants mn iii can be generated from the aqueous oxidation of mn ii for example solid mnooh is abiotically generated through dissolved mn ii oxidation at alkaline ph in oxygen enriched aqueous solution kessick and morgan 1975 however as all d orbitals of mn ii are single electron occupied it is rather difficult to destroy this stable configuration nico et al 2002 so that the half life for natural homogeneous mn ii oxidation at ph 8 0 is relatively long 200 400 days diem and stumm 1984 von langen et al 1997 morgan 2005 it is feasible to catalytically accelerate mn ii oxidation by enzymes of bacterial and fungi webb et al 2005 or by the surfaces of metal oxides ren et al 2013 in the presence of ligands mn with higher valences are favored to be formed from mn ii ligand complexes cabelli and bielski 1984a 1984b duckworth and sposito 2005 chen and huang 2008 notably the generation rate of mnox x is between 1 and 2 could be promoted to 5 8 55 pm h 1 by o2 under simulated sunlight in the presence of humic acid nico et al 2002 in our previous study soluble mn iii was produced in humic acid solutions irradiated by visible light vl λ 420 nm and could be applied in the abatement of estrogens and chlorophene wang et al 2018a 2018b currently there is no study on bpa transformation led by in situ formed mn iii with the assistance of vl and fa importantly the studies on removing organic contaminants by vl fa mn ii in presence of co existing edcs are not known in literature the present study aims to degrade bpa alone and in combination with tbbpa by the vl fa mn ii system the dominated role of mn iii to cause elimination of bpa was elucidated by multiple quenching experiments the transformation intermediates of bpa were identified by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer hplc ms ms method to propose the reaction pathways the influences of various experimental parameters ph and dosages of mn ii and fa on mn iii formation and bpa disappearance were also systematically investigated the effect of tbbpa on the transformation of bpa by mn iii was observed by kinetics experiments and elaborated through product identification and density functional theory dft based calculations molecular descriptors and transition states the overall estrogenic activity of bpa and its products were assessed in general the results of our study suggest a novel approach to transform bpa by soluble mn iii and the fate of bpa when involved in co existing with other pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals details of chemicals used in this study are given in text s1 supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 vl assisted mn iii generation in presence of mn ii and fa 2 2 1 1 mn iii detection experiments were performed in capped quartz tubes 25 mm i d 18 cm irradiated by a 500 w xenon lamp with six surrounding optical filters

bpa used in this study was consisted of fa and mnso4 naac hac buffer solution 10 mm was used to maintain ph which had negligible effect on mn cycling sun et al 2013 the concentrations of mn iii at various irradiation times were measured by the method reported previously madison et al 2011 oldham et al 2015 the synthesis of α β γ δ tetrakis 4 carboxyphenyl porphine t 4 cp p was carried out by a known procedure ishii et al 1982 chiswell and o halloran 1991 to measure the in situ formed mn iii three stock solutions were prepared a 20 μm t 4 cp p solution a buffer solution i ph 8 0 containing 12 5 mm sodium tetraborate 20 mm hydrochloric acid and 0 15 m imidazole and a 1 2 mm cadmium chloride cdcl2 solution in performing experiments 360 μl t 4 cp p stock solution 120 μl buffer solution i 120 μl cdcl2 stock solution and 2 4 ml deionized water were thoroughly mixed in a quartz cell 1 cm pathlength and 4 ml volume and the baseline was obtained using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometer tu 1800 persee china after sampling the reaction solution 30 μl was added and the absorbance change of mn iii t 4 cp p at 468 nm was promptly recorded at 5 min of time intervals the concentrations of mn iii concentrations were calculated by fitting the kinetic curves of mn iii t 4 cp p using the following eq 1 1 m n t o t a l m n i i 1 e k 1 t m n i i i 1 e k 2 t where mn ii and mn iii are the concentrations of divalent and trivalent manganese in samples respectively t is the complexation time between manganese ions and t 4 cp p k 1 and k 2 are the rate constants for complexation reactions of mn ii and mn iii by t 4 cp p respectively details on using eq 1 are provided in text s2 2 2 1 2 o2 and 1o2 detection the detection of o2 in vl fa and vl fa mn ii systems was examined by 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo o2 is transient and dimethylsulfoxide dmso was applied to detect it samoilova et al 2011 the solution to detect o2 in the vl fa system was prepared by mixing 450 μl dmso 5 μl fa 10 g l 1 and 50 μl dmpo 0 1 m the vl fa mn ii system consisted of 450 μl dmso 5 μl fa 10 g l 1 1 3 μl or 5 μl mnso4 100 mm and 50 μl dmpo 0 1 m after 20 min of irradiation time the signal of dmpo o2 adduct was determined by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr emx 10 12 bruker germany the 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium 5 carboxanilide xtt 90 was also utilized to trap o2 in vl fa and vl fa mn ii systems and the generated xtt formazan formed from 50 μm xtt was detected by the uv vis spectrometer tu 1800 persee china at 475 nm wavelength the concentration of xtt formazan was calculated by measuring absorbance at 475 nm extinction coefficient at 475 nm 23800 m 1 cm 1 sutherland and learmonth 1997 an agent 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was applied to trap 1o2 and subsequently analyzed by epr technique no signal of temp 1o2 adducts was detected in h2o data not shown it was previously reported that 1o2 was more stable in d2o than in h2o haag and hoigne 1986 ho et al 2019 therefore the reaction solution was prepared using 450 μl d2o 10 μl fa 10 g l 1 and 100 μl temp 1 5 g l 1 2 2 2 bpa conversion in vl fa mn ii system batch kinetic experiments of degradation of 10 μm bpa and 10 μm tbbpa were performed the effects of initial concentrations of mn ii 20 800 μm and fa 0 25 10 0 mg l 1 and ph 3 0 7 0 on the transformation of bpa by vl fa mn ii system were explored acetate buffer solution 10 mm was used to maintain ph at suitable intervals in the illumination experiments 1 0 ml samples containing residual bpa or tbbpa were collected disproportionation of mn iii is spontaneous 2mn3 aq 2h2o mno2 s mn2 aq 4h therefore all samples were filtered by 0 22 μm filters to avoid any possible mn oxides the filtrates were instantly subjected to analysis by hplc method to identify the leading oxidizing species in this reaction we selected pp tba furfuryl alcohol ffa and bq to quench mn iii oh 1o2 and o2 respectively stability constant logk for mn pp 2 5 is 28 9 31 25 webb et al 2005 qian et al 2019 rate constants k for the reaction between oh and tba 1o2 and ffa o2 and bq are 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 haag et al 1984 9 108 m 1 s 1 greenstock and ruddock 1976 respectively the molar ratio of bpa to quenchers was set at 1 1000 a common ratio to observe significant inhibitory effect guan et al 2013 ji et al 2015 bpa and tbbpa transformation products were extracted using cnwbond lc c18 spe cartridges 1 g 6 ml cnw technologies first the spe cartridges were conditioned by 5 0 ml methanol and 5 0 ml ultrapure water in sequence and then 40 ml samples were subjected to them after inorganic salts on the cartridges were washed by a few aliquots of ultrapure water the cartridges were dried and then 4 0 ml methanol was applied to individually elute bpa or tbbpa and their products which were determined by applying hplc ms ms analysis all experiments were performed at least in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods residual bpa was quantified by an agilent 1200 hplc system agilent technologies usa specifically separated at 1 0 ml min 1 at 30 c by an agilent zorbax 300sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm agilent technologies usa and detected at 276 nm by a diode array detector the mobile phase was comprised of methanol and 0 3 formic acid aqueous solution v v 65 35 the quantification of tbbpa was carried out at the same system at a wavelength of 211 nm and using the mobile phase of methanol and 0 3 formic acid aqueous solution v v 85 15 for product identification the transformation products of bpa and tbbpa were separated by an agilent 1260 hplc system agilent technologies usa on a thermo bds hypersil c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm thermo fisher scientific usa by a gradient elution at a rate of 200 μl min 1 the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and 0 1 formic acid aqueous solution transformation products were qualitatively and semi quantitatively analyzed by a triple tof 5600 ms detector ab sciex usa the same gradient elution procedures ms and ms ms calibration methods and operation parameters for tof detection were also shown in our previous studies yao et al 2019 2 4 dft based theoretical calculations frontier orbital theory suggests that the highest occupied molecular orbitals homo are tightly relevant with reactive sites in an organic molecular todeschini and consonni 2009 for instance where there are orbitals with the highest density of two electrons 2 ci homo 2 ci homo represents the electron density of one homo electrophilic reactions are prone to occur lee et al 2001 the configurations of bpa and its dimer as well as of tbbpa were optimized by gaussian 09 program at rb3lyp 6 311g level and the electron densities of homo on all atoms except hydrogen within the studied molecules were calculated we obtained the values of 2 ci homo 2 for both of bpa and tbbpa o atom o1 and the c atom in the para position of another c atom connecting with o1 were the most vulnerable sites because of their high values of 2 ci homo 2 as mn iii leads one electron reactions radicals bpa tbbpa and h would be involved and they were optimized at ub3lyp 6 311g level transition state ts theory was applied to explain the differences of reactions between radicals bpa and tbbpa and neutral molecules bpa and tbbpa all geometry optimizations vibrational frequency calculations and energy calculations of these ts reactant and product complexes were performed at ub3lyp lanl2dz level those complexes were optimized to local minima on each potential surface with no imaginary frequency while all stabilized tss were confirmed to have only one imaginary frequency the deduction of intrinsic reactant coordinates irc pathways was used to validate that reactants and products were connected by ts the energy differences δe between reactant complexes rc and ts and product complexes pc were computed using total energy e 2 5 estrogenic activity examination the details of the method are described in text s3 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 effective elimination of bpa in vl fa mn ii system the elimination of bpa under different systems is shown in fig 1 results demonstrated all of the three components of the vl fa mn ii were necessary for removing bpa when individual component i e vl or fa or mn ii was applied to degrade bpa almost no removal was obtained fig 1 however 69 removal of bpa was achieved in the combination of vl mn ii and fa at 72 h bpa was too refractory to be transformed since almost no removal occurred to bpa in 72 h under dark in the presence of fa under vl irradiation only 6 2 of bpa could be removed but with the addition of mn ii the removal rate of bpa was enhanced to 68 8 after 72 h reaction time the results suggest a synergistic effect of all three components i e vl mn ii and fa to transform bpa the concentration of in situ formed mn iii was quantified which could be sustainably generated in the vl fa mn ii system see experimental details in text s4 of supporting information when studying the effect of ph we found that the trends of bpa removal and mn iii consumption at various ph occurred simultaneously this suggested that bpa was mainly attacked by the mn iii in the vl fa mn ii system see the details in text s5 in supporting information mn ii and fa positively influenced the removal of bpa when their dosages became larger details given in text s6 in supporting information 3 2 the identification of oxidizing species generated in vl fa mn ii system in the vl fa mn ii system the possible reactive species that caused removal of bpa were recognized with the assistance of the quenchers tba for oh guan et al 2013 ji et al 2015 ffa for 1o2 burns et al 2012 cheng et al 2017 pp for mn iii webb et al 2005 hu et al 2017 and bq for o2 burns et al 2012 du et al 2014 the pseudo first order kinetics model fitted well with the experimental data of the removal of bpa in the vl fa mn ii system and corresponding pseudo first order rate constants k obs min 1 were calculated fig 2 a illustrated that the addition of tba neither positively nor negatively influenced bpa removal without any quenchers removal of bpa was 63 4 after 72 h reaction comparatively 65 7 of bpa was eliminated in the presence of tba suggesting that oh was not responsible to transform bpa in the vl fa mn ii system the other three quenchers i e ffa pp and bq showed decrease in removal efficiency by 4 17 times calculated by specific k obs shown in fig 2b and the removal of bpa was 19 9 8 9 and 0 after 72 h irradiation respectively the role of dissolved oxygen in the vl fa mn ii system was also investigated fig s6 showed that the conversion rate of bpa was reduced from 68 8 to 48 3 under argon gas purging indicating dissolved oxygen participated in the reactions carried out by vl fa mn ii system based on the results from the above experiments and other published literature we proposed a reaction in scheme 1 that explained the roles of dissolved oxygen 3o2 1o2 mn iii and o2 in the vl fa mn ii system the generation of 1o2 and o2 was revealed by the energy transfer from irradiated fa to 3o2 zepp et al 1977 cooper et al 1989 latch and mcneill 2006 by pathway a 1o2 could be further converted to o2 with the assistance of fa through pathways b and c o2 could oxidize mn ii to mn iii or directly transform bpa respectively mn iii attacked directly bpa pathway d it seems some dissolved oxygen was still present in our experimental set up of argon gas purging because only partial suppression of bpa removal was observed the addition of excess bq completely inhibited bpa removal since it completely inhibited pathways b and c and neither o2 nor mn iii was available when pp was added 8 9 of bpa could still be removed by pathway c though mn iii was trapped by pp and pathway d was blocked ffa could quench 1o2 to prevent its further formation of o2 so it also negatively influenced the abatement of bpa however when ffa was added bpa could still be attacked by o2 and mn iii through pathways b d this is consistent with the previous literature that the irradiation of vl on humic materials would transfer the absorbed energy to dissolved oxygen so that 1o2 and o2 could be generated zepp et al 1977 cooper et al 1989 latch and mcneill 2006 the o2 could also be produced from 1o2 by the latter abstracting an electron from chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom 1o2 cdom cdom o2 dalrymple et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 the existence of 1o2 in vl fa system was confirmed by the signal of temp 1o2 adducts detected in measurement of epr method fig s7 supporting information additionally we used two probes i e dmpo and xtt to explain the proposed reaction between mn ii and o2 in the epr experiments we detected the signal of dmpo o2 peak fig 2c when fa was irradiated using vl it was interesting that it was attenuated with the addition of mn ii and the inhibition became more prominent as the concentration of mn ii increased no signals of dmpo o2 and dmpo other possible radicals adducts were detected in the presence of only dmso fig 2d illustrates that xtt formazan was generated continuously when fa was illuminated by vl however it was restrained by the presence of mn ii under the same conditions the decrease in the intensity of dmpo o2 adducts and the concentration of xtt formazan indicated that mn ii could react with o2 it has been reported that mn ii could be oxidized to mn iii or mn iv by o2 mediated by humic substances under simulated sunlight illumination nico et al 2002 in natural seawater samples mn ii would react with o2 to generate mn iii with second order rate constants of 6 106 1 107 m 1 s 1 mn ii o2 mn iii h2o2 hansard et al 2011 these phenomena demonstrated that mn iii was formed by the reaction between mn ii and o2 fig 1 shows that both mn iii and o2 directly contributed to the bpa conversion it has been reported that o2 reacts much faster with mn ii k o2 mn ii 106 107 m 1 s 1 hansard et al 2011 than phenolic compounds k o2 phenolic compounds 102 105 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 rené et al 2010 therefore mn iii played a more significant role than o2 in the destruction of bpa 3 3 product identification and reaction pathways elucidation of bpa nine products of bpa p1 p9 were found in the vl fa mn ii system the structural deconstructions of bpa and these intermediates and the isotope ratios of their ion peaks are displayed in figs s8 s17 supporting information p3 was selected as an example to demonstrate the structural analyses of all the products in fig s11b the difference of m z values between the fragments m z 453 21 and m z 359 17 indicated that p3 contained a phenoxy group which was confirmed by the detection of fragment m z 93 04 a bpa monomer was dissociated from the fragment m z 359 17 and the remained fragment m z 133 07 was detected from m z 453 21 to m z 423 16 from m z 453 21 to m z 227 07 and from m z 359 17 to m z 319 13 all these differences suggested that p3 involved multiple ch3 groups based on the above results we proposed that p3 was a dimer of bpa the structures of all other eight products were resolved following the above method and displayed in figs s9b s10b and s12b s17b supporting information the reaction pathways of bpa are proposed using the assistance of a dft based descriptor 2 ci homo 2 which was applied to distinguish the most reactive sites of bpa the values of 2 ci homo 2 at 1c atom 0 089 2c atom 0 076 4c atom 0 142 and 7o atom 0 121 on bpa fig s18a were relatively high indicating that these sites were prone to react with the in situ formed mn iii in the current reaction system by the attack of mn iii one proton and one electron would detach from 7o atom and the hydrogen atom connected with it the left unpaired electron may also appear at 2c and 4c therefore bpa radical exhibited the resonance structures of rb1 rb2 and rb3 scheme 2 the splitting of rb1 would result in the detachment of the two aromatic rings of bpa molecule and led to the development of p1 p5 p6 and p8 it was reported that the bpa molecule was first converted into rb1 and then cleaved into carbonium 2 4 hydroxyl phenyl propyl which further reacted with hydroquinone to generate p1 lin et al 2009a li et al 2018 rb2 could be carboxylated on the 2c atom to generate p2 respectively rb3 may attack the 2c atom of another bpa molecule so that the dimer of bpa p3 was formed according to the 2 ci homo 2 values of each site on p3 fig s18b we reckoned that 15c atom 0 040 and 17o atom 0 058 of the fourth benzene ring b4 were the most likely sites to be attacked to form p4 p7 it has been reported that humic acid could be broken by ultraviolet irradiation into smaller molecules such as formic acid and acetic acid zhong et al 2018 which may provide cooh groups when 17β estradiol was transformed by ε mno2 nanorods in humic acid solution products with additional cooh or ch2cooh groups attached were also detected by high resolution mass spectrometry sun et al 2016 similarly we speculated that p2 and p4 may be formed by the coupling of bpa and low molecular weight organic acids released from decomposed fulvic acid oxidative reactions may be less likely to occur on the benzene ring b3 since the possible steric hindrance though the values of 2 ci homo 2 of atoms on b3 were quite large p8 and p9 were further formed through c o coupling following the above mechanism formation of bpa dimer by bpa radicals through c o and c c coupling was also identified in the oxidative removal of bpa by manganese dioxide lin et al 2009a oligomerization of estrogens wang et al 2018b and chlorophene and 17β estradiol wang et al 2018a mediated by mn iii through single electron coupling reactions were also reported based on the results of lc ms ms analyses theoretical calculations and previous literature we proposed the possible transformation pathways of bpa in the vl fa mn ii system see scheme 2 the overall estrogenic activity of bpa and its products was decreased after their transformation by mn iii indicating that the vl fa mn ii system was beneficial in decreasing the toxicity of bpa which may also be effective to other endocrine disrupting chemicals see detailed discussion in text s7 3 4 the influence of tbbpa the influence of tbbpa on the removal of bpa by the vl fa mn ii system was investigated fig 3 demonstrated that 52 2 of bpa was eliminated in the vl fa mn ii system within 48 h comparatively only 33 2 of bpa was removed in the presence of 10 μm of tbbpa the conversion rate of tbbpa alone was only 13 5 but it was obviously elevated to 28 8 within 48 h in the presence of 10 μm of bpa a previous study found similar phenomena that 1 guaiacol and 4 chloroaniline were incubated with the peroxidase guaiacol disappearance was notably less whereas the transformation of 4 chloroaniline was little interfered relative to their individual transformation 2 in the incubation with the laccase the 4 chloroaniline disappearance was considerably enhanced in the presence of guaiacol but the reaction of guaiacol was hardly disturbed simmons et al 1989 on the other hand combined promotion of the removal of chlorophene and 17β estradiol was also observed in the mn iii mediated reaction wang et al 2018a four transformation products of tbbpa were identified in the vl fa mn ii system and their proposed structures were verified through the high values of 2 c ri homo 2 of atomic sites on tbbpa 1c 0 373 2c 0 257 4c 0 088 and 7o 0 366 shown in fig s18c and the ms ms spectra of tbbpa and p10 p13 figs s20 s24 isotope ratios of the ion peaks of tbbpa and p10 p13 are also listed figs s20 s24 p10 and p11 were reported in the oxidative processes of tbbpa by permanganate pang et al 2014 and manganese dioxide lin et al 2009b the main reaction pathways of tbbpa were also self oligomerization and displayed in scheme 2 self oligomerization would involve a two step reaction 1 the formation of bpa or tbbpa radicals bpa and tbbpa and 2 the reaction between radicals and molecules with the assistance of mn iii the hydroxyl groups of bpa and tbbpa could be dissociated which led to the formation of bpa h and tbbpa h respectively the dissociation energy of bpa was calculated at ub3lyp 6 311g level as 367 4 kj mol 1 a little lower than that of tbbpa 372 7 kj mol 1 it indicated that 1 when bpa and tbbpa reacted with mn iii separately bpa was converted faster by mn iii 2 when bpa and tbbpa co existed competition to react with mn iii happened to result in slow down of the conversion of bpa more information on the effect of reaction between radicals and molecules on the conversion of bpa is given in next section 3 5 self coupling vs cross coupling for bpa in the mixed system of bpa and tbbpa p1 and p3 p9 from bpa were generated p10 p13 were originated from tbbpa and two bpa tbbpa were cross coupling products p14 and p15 the proposed fragmentation patterns and isotope ratios of p14 and p15 ion peaks are displayed in figs s25 and s26 supporting information we calculated the relative contents of p1 and p3 p9 using eq 2 p10 p13 were based on eq 3 2 p b a p r o d u c t a b p a 0 m i n 3 p t a p r o d u c t a t b b p a 0 m i n where aproduct was the peak area of each product at each sampling time abpa 0 min and atbbpa 0 min were the peak areas of bpa and tbbpa at 0 min of each reaction in single substrate system or mixed substrates system respectively and pb and pt were the relative contents of products sourced from bpa and tbbpa respectively in fig s27 it was found that the generation of self coupling products p1 and p3 p9 was strongly inhibited when bpa was mixed with tbbpa compared to that of bpa alone similar suppression of p10 p13 of tbbpa was also detected fig s28 supporting information the time profile of the generation of p14 and p15 is displayed in fig s29 it could be seen from figs s27 s29 that p14 and p15 were formed much sooner than other products of bpa or tbbpa self oligomerization indicating cross coupling reactions were in preferable when bpa was mixed with tbbpa on the other hand the energy differences between ts and rc e a and pc and rc δe that were related to p3 and p13 p15 were calculated at the b3lyp lanl2dz level fig 4 the value of δe determines reaction direction the negative value of it accounts for a spontaneous reaction while a positive value demonstrates the reaction needs additional energy input the only negative value of δe of p14 generation 23 4 kj mol 1 demonstrated that bpa and tbbpa were prior to be cross coupled than self coupled when tbbpa was added e a has a negative relationship with reaction rate fig 4 illustrated that e a 91 3 kj mol 1 of bpa self coupling is the lowest among all four couplings so bpa was transformed faster alone than when mixed with tbbpa the transformation of tbbpa was promoted with bpa present as e a was reduced from 112 3 kj mol 1 to 106 6 kj mol 1 these results were in accordance with fig 3 besides under argon saturation the product distribution was not changed but the content of all products decreased fig s30 and figs s27 s29 which confirmed the contribution of dissolved oxygen as discussed in section 3 2 in general the influence of tbbpa on bpa removal is negative the above results suggested that the coexistence of tbbpa could disturb the transformation of bpa mediated by mn iii in vl fa mn ii system these phenomena may disclose the reasons why bpa is refractory in real aquatic environment 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated that bpa could be effectively removed by the in situ formed mn iii in the vl fa mn ii system removal of bpa was mainly by self oligomerization supported by hplc ms ms analyses and dft based calculations removal of bpa in vl fa mn ii system was notably suppressed in the presence of tbbpa because mn iii was competed and the self coupling reactions of bpa were significantly inhibited by tbbpa in the mixed solution of bpa and tbbpa the cross coupling reactions of bpa and tbbpa were found to contribute to enhancing the removal of tbbpa compared to the only tbbpa system further investigations may also be explored when bpa co existed with other organic pollutants and its oxidation is mediated by natural oxidizing species mn iii declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
