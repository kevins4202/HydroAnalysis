2240,to tackle ever changing global water problems inter basin water transfer ibwt projects provide water supply alternatives for water scarce regions and create potential risks for water supply regions to analyze the multiple interrelated impacts of ibwt projects on supply regions in this study we establish a cascade multi objective complementary optimal scheduling model and apply the model to the water supply regions of the west route of china s south north water transfer project and the dadu minjiang water transfer project with the goal of fully utilizing water resources to gain comprehensive benefits we objectively and quantitatively evaluate the impacts of ibwt projects on the ecology and hydropower generation of water supply regions to reduce the complexity of solving the model the model is decomposed into a two stage optimization model and is solved with particle swarm optimization and fuzzy optimization the results show that 1 the multi objective model that simultaneously considers minimal ecological water shortage degree maximal power generation and the maximization of the annual minimum output is more conducive to the full utilization of water resources 2 the factors affecting the ecological flow the power generation and its structure in the water supply region and the annual minimum output are different 3 to deal with risks the upstream power station in the water supply region is controlled to meet the ecological needs as the primary goal and the downstream power station is mainly responsible for the task of compensating and adjusting the output gap during the dry season this study can provide technical support for the demonstration and decision making of ibwt projects and it explores the ideas of water resource planning and management keywords inter basin water transfer project impact assessment complementary dispatch multi objective optimization particle swarm optimization cascade hydropower data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global freshwater resources are unevenly distributed in locations and time with rapid economic and social development regional water demand continues to grow rapidly with the process of urbanization and the imbalance between regional water supply and demand is even more severe an ibwt project can change the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of water resources between river basins by accumulating water when it is abundant and by supplying water during the dry season or to water scarce regions this type of project achieves the redistribution of water resources to effectively alleviate the urgent needs of water scarce regions this approach has become an increasingly popular solution shumilova et al 2018 however studies have shown that while ibwt projects have improved the economic structure and ecological situation of water scarce regions they have also changed hydrological runoff situations in water supply regions increasing the damage or risk to regional ecological security and economic and social development and further exacerbating the difficulty of water resource management duan et al 2022 yu et al 2018 zhuang 2016 therefore it is necessary to conduct a systematic and in depth evaluation and demonstration of the comprehensive benefits of ecology power generation irrigation and water supply in water receiving regions and water supply regions for an ibwt project and to perform a comprehensive analysis of the water balance relationships between river basins to avoid a water shortage and the corresponding unequal transfer sun et al 2021 at present many studies of the multiple interrelated effects of ibwt projects have been performed rani et al 2016 sinha et al 2020 wilson et al 2017 among these effects an ibwt project inevitably changes the natural flow process in a water supply region and reduces the flow in the rivers this may be detrimental to the stability and sustainable development of the ecosystem of a river and may even cause environmental degradation this makes the study of ecological security issues one of the topics of interest among the many impacts of ibwt projects zhang et al 2015 most of the studies on ecological impacts use water environment models to evaluate existing water quality problems li et al 2013 webber et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 it is difficult for these models to evaluate the potential ecological impact of water transfer projects during planning in addition in essence ibwt affects the entire ecological environment by affecting various subsystems of the ecological environment but its impact on the ecological environment must be within the scope of ecological carrying capacity to ensure the sustainable development of the ecological environment water volume is a primary factor to measure the ecological environment carrying capacity it is worth noting that the factors related to water environment such as water quality water temperature water ecology are also closely related to water quantity zhang et al 2022 therefore from the perspective of ecological safety ensuring the ecological base flow that maintains the ecological environment of a river is the most basic requirement for protecting an ecosystem acreman et al 2014 with the increasing emphasis on ecological issues it has become a trend to take ecological flow demand as one of the objectives for ibwt project evaluation and optimization jiao et al 2021 ma et al 2020 in addition hydropower plays an increasingly important role in modern energy systems jin et al 2021 the reduction of runoff changes the operation mode of a reservoir thus affecting the annual power generation and structure zhao et al 2022 which inevitably affects the power security and social economy history has shown that many attempts to implement resource management initiatives have been met with resistance from stakeholders lafreniere et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an ibwt project on the power generation and power structure of cascade hydropower stations in a water supply region tian et al 2019 in order to take measures to reduce negative impacts and to coordinate possible conflicts between regions to win support wu et al 2019 yin et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 studied the influence of power generation but seldom considered the influence on the annual power structure and output during the dry season however the annual power generation structure and the dry season output of a cascade hydropower station have an important impact on the power security of a power grid especially the dry season power security of power grids with hydropower as the main power source in general ibwt projects can break the original model of ecological and power systems manshadi et al 2015 explored the economic and environmental impacts of ibwt projects however there are few assessment methods that quantitatively analyze the potential impact of ibwt projects on the ecology power generation and output of water supply regions in addition compared with the traditional method of establishing an index system for evaluation and analysis abdi dehkordi et al 2021 analyzing the optimization results of multi objective coordinated operation model of cascade reservoirs provides a more objective quantitative result for decision makers to evaluate the multiple impacts of ibwt projects such an evaluation is conducted on the basis of tapping the potential of cascade hydropower regulation and making full use of water resources which reflects the almost unavoidable negative impact by analyzing the causes of the negative impact it is helpful to guide the decision making managers to adjust the project design reasonably furthermore the optimization results also provide the operation strategy of cascade hydropower to the power plant managers for the multi objective problems a variety of optimization methods have been designed and applied in recent years they are mainly divided into traditional planning algorithms and swarm intelligence algorithms with a large amount of progress chen 2021 yao et al 2022 different types of algorithms have different advantages and disadvantages as well as different use conditions overcoming the ever increasing difficulty of solving models swarm intelligence algorithms have attracted great interest due to their simple principles low calculation costs and fast optimization tang et al 2021 particle swarm optimization is relatively mature in the field of the multi objective solutions of cascade reservoirs to overcome its problems of large randomness and being prone to fall into a local optimum researchers have proposed various improvements the improved particle swarm algorithm has the advantages of fewer parameters fast convergence and simple computation bai et al 2019 niu et al 2018 shami et al 2022 to improve the efficiency of solving the models researchers have studied the solution ideas and methods from the perspectives of the model structure ming et al 2018 and the search space meng et al 2019 the more mature approach to dimensionality reduction is usually layering and nesting guo et al 2012 proposed a two layer model to solve the operation problem of cascade reservoirs in ibwt projects the upper layer optimizes the water transfer rule curve the lower layer optimizes the hedging rule curve and pursues the optimal water supply in the water transfer process zhang et al 2020 decomposed a heterogeneous energy complementary scheduling model by a two stage decoupling method and optimized the decision variables in the hierarchical structure greatly improving the efficiency of the model solution the above studies provide solutions and methods for solving the complex optimization problems of cascade hydropower in this study we establish a model for assessing the ecological environment power generation impact of the establishment of an ibwt project combined with the examples of the west route of china s south north water transfer project and the dadu minjiang water transfer project we study the impacts on the ecological discharge of the water supply region and the power generation of the cascade power stations we use a two stage decoupling method based on a particle swarm algorithm to solve the multi objective evaluation model and we quantitatively analyze the changes in the electricity structure the output changes during the dry season and the changes in the operation mode of the cascade reservoirs the findings of this study can provide useful information for local governments and policymakers to better understand the potential impacts of water transfer projects improve the scale and structure of water transfer projects and assist in the management of water transfer projects the model and the idea to solve the model established in this study can also be used in other projects and can provide a new idea for the demonstration and decision making of ibwt projects the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the water transfer projects scales and processes in the basins of study as well

study region the dadu river is the largest tributary of the minjiang river a first level tributary of the yangtze river in china and the most abundant river in the sichuan province its huge drop abundant water volume and narrow river valley form the rich and exploitable water resources of the dadu river it is designated as one of china s large scale hydropower energy bases and has an important national energy strategic position because of its abundant water volume it has become one of the water sources for the west route of china s south north water transfer project the largest ibwt project in the world hereinafter referred to as project 1 barnett et al 2015 according to the planning of project 1 1 15 billion m3 of water are to be transferred from the upstream tributary of dadu river the water transfer from the shuangjiangkou sjk reservoir in the uppermost reaches of the main stem of the dadu river will be 4 billion m3 the average annual water transfer amount will be 5 15 billion m3 according to statistics the average runoff of the sjk section over the years is 15 686 billion m3 which is reduced to 10 536 billion m3 after water transfer a reduction rate of 32 83 in addition to solve the problem of water shortage in the hinterland of the sichuan basin the dadu river has also become a water source of the dadu minjiang water transfer project a large scale ibwt project in the sichuan province hereinafter referred to as project 2 the dadu minjiang water transfer project plan recommends the dadu river luding ld hydropower station to be the water source for project 2 with an average annual water transfer of 2 282 billion m3 according to statistics the annual average runoff of the ld section is 27 656 billion m3 the combined water transfer of project 1 and project 2 reduces the annual average annual runoff to 20 224 billion m3 and the annual average runoff reduction rate is 26 87 an overview of the study basin and water transfer project is shown in fig 1 water transfer will change the hydrological situations of the basins reduce the output and power generation of the cascade power stations and inevitably affect the safety and supply of electricity a drastic measure in addition claiming that the yangtze river is rich in water resources conceals the fact that water shortages do occur barnett et al 2015 under the influence of future urbanization and climate change the problem of water shortage may become more serious the water supply regions of project 1 and project 2 are in a fragile ecological environment if water is diverted when the flow is low it may adversely affect the water supply region and the ecological environment of the water supply regions therefore it is very necessary to study the impacts of the ibwt project on the power generation of the dadu river cascade power stations and the impact of the ecological flow discharge 2 2 data the lack of water in the water supply regions will aggravate the imbalance caused by the transfer of water resources between the basins sousa estacio et al 2022 therefore using the worst case scenario wei et al 2020 we select a dry year with a water frequency of 90 for calculation and research according to the planning of project 1 and project 2 and the planning and development of cascade hydropower stations in the study basin we find that the affected area is the cascade reservoir group of four reservoirs and 24 levels in the main stem of the dadu river the characteristic parameters such as the normal water level dead water level installed capacity and output coefficient of each hydropower station are shown in table 1 the specific water transfer processes and natural runoff processes are as shown in fig 2 the four reservoirs of shuangjiangkou houyanyan changheba and pubugou are the reservoir power stations with seasonal or longer regulating capacity the other hydropower stations only have daily or shorter regulating capacity and only the power generation benefits of the cascade reservoirs participating in the joint dispatch as a runoff power station are considered in addition combined with the situation of the study area the wet season is from june to october and the dry season is from november to may of the following year 3 model specification in this study we establish a cascade multi objective optimization model with the complementary dispatching of ecology power generation and output to evaluate the ecological and power generation impacts of the ibwt project to the water supply region to establish the model we face three great challenges 1 under the condition of meeting the water intake demand of the water transfer project we must meet the ecological flow discharge and ecological dispatch requirements approved by the power station in the water supply region as much as possible because the water resources shortage caused by water transfer is mainly reflected in the water intake points of the project meeting the comprehensive water demand of the node is a priority 2 we need to maximize the use of reservoir capacity with a strong regulation ability and fully exploit cascade hydropower resources 3 to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power grid the output of cascade hydropower stations should be kept as stable as possible after meeting the demand for water transfer and ecological demand the model runs on a ten day basis and does not consider the time lag effect of flow variation 3 1 objective function because the ecological flow between the cascades is affected by the release of water from the upstream reservoir and the interval inflow there are temporal and spatial differences in the shortage of the ecological flow to achieve the full ecological water replenishment capacity of upstream regulating reservoirs to downstream reservoirs by using engineering cases we divide the cascade reservoirs into two sections according to water sources and consider their ecological objectives and we introduce an ecological water shortage degree to measure the impact of water transfer projects on the ecological environment objective function i is expressed as follows 1 m i n θ m i n m a x q i s h k t o h j p q i l d a n d d o w n s t r e a m 2 q i max q i t e q i t q i t e 0 t t where θ is the maximum ecological water shortage degree in the entire cascade q i is the ecological flow shortage degree of the i th power station q i t e is the ecological flow requirement of the i th power station at time t q i t is the ecological flow of the i th power station at time t and t is the total number of periods in the dispatch period in this study we adopt the ecological flow of each cascade power station approved by the ministry of ecology and environment as the standard to objectively reflect the influence of the ibwt project on the power generation and its structure for the water diversion region the optimization calculation is carried out before and after the water transfer with the objective of maximizing the annual total power generation of the cascade hydropower station group objective function ii is expressed as follows 3 maxe m a x t 1 t i 1 i λ i q i t h i t m t where e is the annual power generation of the entire cascade i is the number of cascade hydropower stations λ i is the output coefficient of the i th power station qi t is the power generation flow of the i th power station at time t hi t is the net water head of the i th power station at time t and mt is the number of hours at time t to make the power station provide the grid with output that is as large uniform and reliable as possible in the dry season and normal seasons and to achieve the full capacity benefit of hydropower another aim of this study is to maximize the annual minimum output of the cascade hydropower stations objective function iii is expressed as follows 4 maxn m a x m i n i 1 i λ i q i t h i t t t where n is the minimum output in the entire cascade

and n i t max are the minimum and maximum power generation outputs of the i th hydropower station at time t respectively the above variables are all non negative 4 model decomposition and solution 4 1 two stage decoupled optimization model the complementary scheduling model established in this study is a multi dimensional multivariable multi constraint nonlinear programming problem that is very difficult to solve to reduce the difficulty of solving this model and improve the solving efficiency we refer to the solution ideas of previous researchers we decouple the original problem into a two stage evaluation model including ecological compensation scheduling and generation optimization scheduling this is illustrated in fig 3 in the first stage only objective i is used as the optimization calculation objective and it is transformed into the ecological flow demand constraint of the second stage then the second stage optimization is performed with objectives ii and iii as the solution objectives finally the ecological flow process power generation process and operation plan of the hydropower station are obtained 4 2 model solution algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 were the first to introduce pso it is a stochastic optimization technique that relies on cooperative behavior and information sharing among particles in a group to achieve the goal of optimization since then researchers have improved the technology according to different application requirements pso has become a classic and effective intelligent optimization algorithm shami et al 2022 wang et al 2018 and has been widely used to solve various optimization problems in this study the pso algorithm is used as the core algorithm to solve the evaluation model the updated equations of the particle velocity and position state in the particle swarm optimization algorithm are 14 v k d g 1 ω g v k d g c 1 r 1 p k d g x k d g c 2 r 2 p g d g x k d g 15 x k d g 1 x k d g v k d g 1 where g is the number of iterations k is the serial number of a particle d is the dimension v k d g is the d th dimension velocity of the k th particle during the g th cycle v k d g v min v max to control the convergence speed x k d g represents the coordinates at the d th dimension of the k th particle in the g th cycle c 1 and c 2 are learning factors r 1 and r 2 are random numbers in the range of 0 1 p k d g represents the coordinates of the individual optimal position of the k th particle in the g th cycle at dimension d p g d g represents the coordinates of the global optimal position of all particles in the g th cycle at dimension d c 1 r 1 p k d g x k d g is the self cognitive term reflecting the influence of the particle s memory c 2 r 2 p g d g x k d g is the group cognitive term reflecting the effectiveness of the mutual information transfer between particles and ω is the time varying inertia weight and its update equation is expressed as follows 16 w g w max w min g g g w min where w max and w min are the initial and final values of the inertia weights respectively by changing ω an extensive global search can be performed in the early stage of optimization while a focused local search can be performed in the later stages 1 the first stage the first stage deals with a relatively simple single objective optimization problem the minimum ecological water shortage of each hydropower station can be obtained by using the particle swarm algorithm the solution steps are as follows step 1 set the initial parameters of the algorithm and randomly generate the initial population within the variable threshold step 2 calculate the initial fitness of the particle according to equation 1 and determine the initial global extreme value p g d g and the initial individual extreme value p k d g step 3 update the particle position and velocity according to equations 14 and 15 determine whether the constraint conditions are met and if yes calculate the updated fitness values compare these values with the historical individual extreme value and the global extreme value and determine the current individual optimal position and the current global optimal location if not go to step 3 again step 4 repeat step 3 until the set number of iterations is reached and output the obtained result 2 the second stage the second stage deals with a multi objective optimization problem the pareto optimal mechanism is used as the fitness value comparison principle of particle swarms and fuzzy optimization is used as the decision making mechanism to obtain non dominated solutions iteratively the solution steps are as follows step 1 save the intermediate calculation variables q i t obtained in the first stage to minimize the ecological water shortage degree convert them into the ecological flow parameters q i t e in the discharge flow constraint equation 12 and update the calculation boundary conditions step 2 set the initial parameters of the algorithm and randomly generate the initial population within the variable threshold step 3 calculate the initial fitness of the particle according to equations 3 and 4 and determine the initial global extremum p g d g and the initial individual extremum p k d g according to pareto optimality step 4 update the particle position and velocity according to equations 14 and 15 determine whether the constraint conditions are met and if yes calculate the updated fitness values compare these values with the historical individual extreme value and the global extreme value according to the pareto optimality determine the current individual optimal position and the current global optimal position and save the global optimal particle into an external file if not go to step 4 again step 5 repeat step 4 and update the elite individuals in the external file when the total number of individuals exceeds the file memory the individuals ranked according to the calculated congestion degree the individuals with higher congestion degrees are prioritized and the last individuals are eliminated step 6 determine whether the maximum number of iterations has been reached if yes output the elite individual of the external file if not repeat step 4 step 7 the individuals in the external file are the pareto optimal solution set a fuzzy optimization method is used as the decision making mechanism the pareto optimal solution with the largest comprehensive relative superiority is used as the final scheduling plan the fuzzy optimal decision making is expressed mathematically as follows 17 μ 1 1 m 1 m α m β m max β m j 2 m 1 m α m β m j β m min 2 where μ is the comprehensive relative superiority degree of the decision set α m is the weight of the m th objective β m j is the relative superiority degree of the decision j and the objective m β m max is the ideal superiority degree of membership and β m min is the ideal inferiority degree of membership in general β m max 1 β m min 0 the algorithm flowchart is shown in fig 4 after the program calculation and test the optimal parameters of the two stage multi objective particle swarm algorithm are obtained as shown in table 2 5 results and discussion 5 1 model rationality analysis to verify the rationality of the comprehensive evaluation model of ecological and power generation complementary dispatching proposed in this paper model 1 we establish two comparative models the model specifications are shown in table 3 the data for dry years are calculated using the three models and the optimal scheme of each model is determined with the fuzzy optimization method table 4 shows the comparison of the results from the three models in model 2 the ecological objective is replaced with the most common ecological water shortage amount minimization objective the function expression is 18 m i n w m i n t 1 t i 1 i m a x q i t e q i t 0 m t 3600 where w is the total ecological water shortage of cascade hydropower compared with model 1 the ecological water shortage amount of model 2 is smaller but the ecological water shortage degree θ is larger indicating that the ecological water shortages in individual power stations in some periods are worse thus the ecological objective set in model 1 is more equitable in ensuring the ecological flow of each power station in addition model 2 does not consider maximizing the minimum output it can be seen that the index n is smaller than the other two models and the difference is relatively large in model 3 only two generation objectives i e maximizing the power generation and maximizing the minimum output are considered the indicators e and n are better than those in the other two models additionally the amount of time consumed is the lowest however the ecological indicators are not ideal the above results show that in the complementary dispatching of cascade hydropower under insufficient natural runoff conditions consideration of only the benefits of power generation and output leads to a great reduction in the ecological benefits which is not conducive to the sustainable development of hydropower while consideration of the optimization of the ecological flow at the same time does not reduce too much generation benefit in addition the ecological objective of model 1 is more balanced for the entire cascade ecological flow distribution the reduction of the water shortage rate of the ecological flow at each moment is beneficial to achieving objective iii which reflects the fact that the ecological flow and power assurance are not completely opposite which is relatively close to the conclusion in su and yang 2021 therefore model 1 which considers multi objectives at the same time is more conducive to the efficient use of water resources and the safe supply of electricity in the case of insufficient natural runoff 5 2 analysis of ecological flow shortage to analyze the impact of the ibwt project on the ecological flow we conduct compensation adjustment calculations before and after the water transfer in a dry year fig 5 shows the comparison of the minimum ten day flow of the natural flow and the ecological flow in the two calculation results with the ecological flow approved by the ministry of ecology environment of china the ten day ecological shortage for the power stations with ecological flow gaps is shown in the form of a radar chart in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that after the water diversion the ecological flow is reduced to a certain extent and some power stations may not be able to meet the ecological flow requirement which is mainly related to the location of a power station its distance from the water intake point and the ecological flow requirement the power stations with ecological flow gaps are sjk the largest gap is 8 93 m3 s jc the largest gap is 15 86 m3 s and ld the largest gap is 6 99 m3 s sjk and jc are the first level and the second level on the main stem of the dadu river with fewer natural water supply and higher ecological flow requirements the ecological flow demand of the two stations accounts for 32 59 and 34 44 of the annual average flow respectively in addition sjk is the water intake point of project 1 and jc is the power station closest to it both are affected the most by the water transfer the ld is the ninth level on the main stem of the dadu river after the confluence of the river basin and the compensation adjustment of the upstream power stations the incoming water is relatively abundant however as the water intake point of project 2 the needs of the water supply and ecological requirements cannot be met at the same time after the secondary water transfer in addition it can also be seen from fig 5 that if there is no ecological compensation regulation from cascade reservoirs the demand for ecological flow in some river sections during the dry season cannot be guaranteed thus the hydropower station does not necessarily have a negative impact on the river ecology it can be seen from fig 6 that the hydropower station that is the most affected by the water diversion is jc followed by sjk and then ld the ecological water shortage times of jc and sjk are basically the same from early november to late march of the following year and may of the following year there is a relatively uniform water shortage flow the difference is that there is no water shortage in sjk in april and jc lacks water flow in april compared to other time periods which is related to the water diversion method of project 1 april is the maintenance month with no water diversion the time of the ecological water shortage in ld is from mid december to late april of the following year which is consistent with the dry period runoff structure of the natural inflow of the dadu river the runoff in the dry season only accounts for 25 of the annual flow it is worth mentioning that this study takes the design water flow as the baseline in a future characterized by climate change and strengthened regulation if the flow process that is more appropriate to the natural flow pattern is considered as the baseline the situation of ecological flow shortage will be more severe acreman et al 2014 5 3 analysis of the impact of water transfer on power generation the ibwt projects not only affect the annual power generation of the dadu river cascade power stations but also reduce the guaranteed output of the power stations and reduce the quality of power generation in this study we make a statistical comparison of the indicators that are related to the power generation and minimum output of the cascade power stations in the model s complementary dispatch results before and after water transfer 5 3 1 analysis of the impact of water transfer on power generation and its structure we compared the ten day power generation index of the cascade the ten day power reduction rate index of the cascade fig 7 a the cascade power generation index in wet and dry seasons the annual total power generation index of the cascade fig 7b the annual total power generation index of each power station and the power generation reduction rate index of each power station fig 7c before and after water transfer first based on the change trend fig 7a the reduction rates of electricity in the dry season are larger than those in the wet season and the reduction rates are basically inversely proportional to power generation that is the less power generation there is the greater the reduction rate is this is affected by the size of the base and the size of the water transfer as well as the regulating performance of the reservoirs that is to say the base of power generation in the dry season is small and the proportion of water transfer is large the regulation performance of the reservoir in the dry season is limited by the small amount of natural water inflow leading the water transfer to have a greater impact in the dry season in terms of the total amount fig 7b the total power generation of the dadu river cascade power station in dry years was 88 287 billion kw h and the total power generation loss of the cascade power station after the water transfer was 25 080 billion kw h a decrease of 28 41 from the perspective of electricity structure the wet season decreased by 9 771 billion kw h and the dry season was reduced by 15 309 billion kw h with decreases of 19 22 and 40 88 respectively indicating that water transfer has a more significant impact on the power generation level in the dry season moreover the water source for water transfer belongs to a province with a high proportion of hydropower and power supply presenting the problem of power supply abundant in the wet season and shortage in the dry season because of the effect of the water transfer the proportion of electricity in the wet season and the dry season has expanded from the original 1 36 1 to 1 85 1 this will undoubtedly exacerbate the imbalance and pose a challenge to the green and safe energy supply in sichuan where the power supply is already insufficient during the dry season in addition it can be seen from fig 7c that the annual power generation of each cascade power station is affected by water transfer which is negatively correlated to the distance from the water intake point and positively correlated to its installed capacity that is the power station close to the water intake point with a large installed capacity is more affected by the water transfer the hydropower stations that have a relatively large impact on power generation are pbg installed capacity of 3 6 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 785 billion kw h dgs 2 6 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 79 billion kw h chb 2 6 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 481 billion kw h and sjk 2 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 524 billion kw h the overall reduction rate of power generation shows a decreasing trend there are two causes for this the first cause is that the proportion of water transfer to natural incoming water decreases in turn the second cause is that the closer to the downstream power station the location is the greater the impact of the upstream power station reservoir s runoff regulation is and the smaller the power generation loss is the significant increase in the reduction ratio of the power generation of the ld is because ld is the second water intake point with a rapidly increased cross section water transfer volume 5 3 2 analysis of the impact of the water transfer on the output fig 8 a shows the output change of the cascade power stations before and after the water transfer it can be seen that the effect of the ten day output of the cascade fig 8a is similar to the effect of the water transfer on the power generation and the reduction rate is basically inversely proportional to the output which has a greater impact on the output in the dry season after the water transfer the average output during the dry season is reduced from 7 359 million kw to 4 351 million kw a decrease of 3 008 million kw or an average decrease of about 41 which greatly threatens the power supply guarantee rate during the dry season before the water transfer the minimum output in the year appears in late march 7 258 700 kw and after the water transfer the minimum output in the year appears in mid december 4 221 100 kw a decrease of 43 04 fig 8b shows the change in the minimum output of each power station during the year it can be seen that there are three main stages the minimum output loss of the cascade power station from chb to lyy2 is significantly higher than that of the other power stations which is close to half of what it was before the water transfer there are four main causes for this ① the minimum output of the chb appears in early may the calculation results of the cascade compensation adjustment show that the chb had dropped to the dead water level in late april indicating that the large output loss of the chb is mainly due to the limited regulating capacities of the chb itself and its upstream region ② the cascade power stations from hjp to lyy2 have no regulation capacity and have a small interval flow so the output structure is similar to that of the nearest upstream regulating power station chb ③ ld is the second water intake point so the minimum output loss is further increased ④ pbg has an annual adjustment capability and the minimum output loss of its downstream power stations during the year decreases in a stepwise manner after compensation regulation 5 4 analysis of the impact of water transfer on regulating reservoirs the ibwt project has a certain impact on the operation mode and development of cascade hydropower in the water diversion region which is mainly reflected in the change of the operating water level of the reservoir and the change of the main tasks undertaken by the regulating power station in order to obtain a cascade reservoir operation plan with regular significance to deal with the negative impact of the inter basin water transfer project we also carried out the calculation of complementary regulation before and after the water transfer in the wet year and the normal year fig 9 shows the ten day difference of the water levels of the regulating power stations in three typical years namely the changes of the operating water levels before and after the water transfer it can be seen that the difference of the operating water level of the cascade reservoirs before and after the water transfer is mainly in the dry season regardless of the incoming water condition overall the water level decrease of sjk is delayed during the dry season and the water levels of hzy chb and pbg almost all fall in advance during the dry period the difference is that the water level of hzy falls ahead of that of chb and the time of the pbg early drawdown water level is evenly distributed in the dry period this rule is consistent under different water inflow conditions conforms to the water transfer relationship between cascades reflects the regulation of the reservoir and explains the rationality of the dispatching scheme to better understand the reasons for the changes in the water level a comprehensive analysis is carried out along with the outflows of the power stations fig 10 first it is found that before and after the water transfer sjk always begins to draw down first followed by hzy and then the chb this is due to the flow volumes and head transfer laws of the cascade reservoirs in other words for the same outflow compared with the downstream power station the water level of the upstream power stations has a higher priority to be drawn down the total water head of the cascade is larger and the total cascade power generation benefit is greater pbg does not match this trend because the regulation performance of the four power stations is different sjk and pbg are annual regulating power stations and hzy and chb are seasonal regulating power stations therefore the pbg power station has a longer water drawdown cycle second the water level fluctuation of sjk is closely related to whether the inflow meets the ecological flow the water level is delayed to fall the reason is to postpone the release of water to make up for the shortage of ecological flow at the end of dry season the situation of early decline in the early dry season of normal and dry years is to increase the discharge flow to make up for the shortage of ecological flow in the early dry season third the water level of hzy and chb are reduced in advance because although the outflows of them meet the ecological flow it can be seen from section 5 2 that there is still an ecological flow gap in the downstream power stations so the two stations need to make up for the ecological flow of the downstream power stations in addition the great differences in the method of the water level drawdowns of them occur and the water level changes are more and more obvious with the decrease of incoming water because they are limited by the regulation performance and are sensitive to the change of water volume and with the decrease of incoming water the reservoir operations are more affected finally pbg and its downstream power stations have no ecological flow gap in three typical years based on the results of power generation and output it can be seen that pbg draws down in advance to make up for the high water head benefit abandoned by the upstream power station for ecological flow compensation resulting in reduced output during the dry season a regulating power station in a cascade power station mainly undertakes important tasks such as regulation and storage the water transfer changes the operation mode of the power station it can be seen from the analysis that the water volume regulation of the sjk hzy and chb reservoirs for the water transfer project has almost used up all the regulating capacity which weakens the ability of cascade hydropower in the diversion region to adjust to other demands in addition we found that after water transfer the upstream power stations need to sacrifice part of the water head benefits to increase the ecological flow in dry season while the downstream power stations mainly undertake the compensation and regulation of the output gap in dry season 5 5 optimization analysis of water transfer scale and process to achieve a balance between the ecological generation benefits in the water supply region and the human water demand in the water receiving region in this section we discuss options for optimizing the scale and process of water transfer to reduce the negative impacts in dry year the key to a water transfer project is to minimize the water shortage the water users face the ecological protection of the water supply region also cannot be ignored therefore as discussed in this section while ensuring ecology we set the minimization of water transfer shortage amount ren et al 2019 as one of the objectives the function expression is 19 m i n d m i n t 1 t p 1 p m a x q p t d e m a n d q p t s u p p l y 0 m t 3600 where d is the total water transfer shortage amount q p t demand is the water transfer demand flow of water transfer point p at time t q p t supply is the actual water transfer flow of water transfer point p at time t and p is the number of water transfer points we consider both power generation and output issues we establish a multi objective compensation adjustment model for cascade reservoirs model 4 and we use the solution algorithm described in section 4 for calculation and analysis we then compare the calculation results with the results of model 1 built in this paper table 5 fig 11 shows the optimized water transfer process fig 12 shows the situation in which the minimum ten day outflow of each cascade power station meets the ecological flow demand during the new water transfer process compared with the situation before water transfer optimization the water transfer decreases by 246 2416 million m3 it can be seen from the table 5 that the replacement ratio of ecological water shortage amount and water transfer shortage amount is 1 83 1 which means that a certain amount of water transfer can be reduced in exchange for greater ecological flow benefits the reason is that the ecological water shortage amount has a cumulative effect in addition after optimization the annual power generation is reduced and the minimum output during the year is also increased by 1 012 billion kw h and 201 900 kw it can be seen from fig 11 that project 1 has been optimized and project 2 has not changed combined with fig 12 it can be seen that the ecological needs of the power station that originally had a shortage of ecological flow near the water source have been met this shows that the method of uniform water transfer in project 1 is unreasonable according to the optimized project 1 the water transfer volume will be appropriately reduced in the dry season to ensure the ecological flow demand of sjk and jc near the first water source under the circumstance of avoiding the adjustment of the water transfer method for project 2 as much as possible the ecological flow gap of the downstream power station can be met by the compensation regulating of the cascade power station it can be seen in fig 10 that even in dry years water abandonment still occurs in the wet season after the water transfer from the discussion in section 5 4 it can be seen that the upstream reservoir regulation capacity of the cascade reservoirs after the water transfer is not enough to meet the demand for water transfer therefore the increase of the regulating capacity of the cascade reservoir groups by building regulating reservoirs in the upstream region can be considered to store extra water when supply is abundant and replenish water during droughts to meet the different water demands of the diversion region and the water supply region in addition the water transfer process can be adjusted that is the approach of diverting less water in the dry season and diverting more water in the wet season is used to make compensations and adjustments in the water receiving region to supplement the dry season with secondary storage this helps ensure the ecological power security in the water supply region and meet the needs of the water receiving region as much as possible in summary the ibwt project is huge expensive and has a complex and far reaching impact it needs to be fully evaluated and assessed the scale and process of water diversion can be flexibly adjusted by considering the abundance and shortage of water in the water supply region the structural process and the supply and demand relationship in the water receiving region 6 conclusion to quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of the ibwt project on the ecology and power system of the water supply region we propose a cascaded multi objective optimization model for the complementary dispatch of ecology power generation and output we use the dadu river basin which is one of the water sources in the western route of the south north water transfer project and also the water source of the dadu minjiang water transfer project as the study case the conclusions are as follows 1 the two stage decoupling optimization model is used to reduce the difficulty of solving the three objectives the optimal solution of the multi objective scheme is determined with particle swarm optimization and the fuzzy optimization method 2 two comparative models are established the results show that the optimization objective that considers the ecological flow demand power generation and output at the same time has little impact on the power index but can greatly improve the rate of meeting the ecological flow and allow for a more reasonable utilization of water resources 3 the amount of ecological water shortage is mainly related to the proportion of water transfer to the natural incoming water and the requirements of the ecological flow the time of occurrence of ecological water shortage is mainly related to the structure of the water transfer and natural runoff the annual power generation structure of the cascade power station is affected by the water transfer structure and the regulation performance of the reservoir the power generation loss of each power station is negatively correlated with the distance from the water transfer point and positively correlated with its installed capacity the annual minimum output of each power station is closely related to its regulation performance natural water flow and upstream and downstream locations 4 after the water transfer the original operation mode of the cascade hydropower station changes during the dry season the upstream power station sacrifices part of the head benefit to increase the ecological flow evenly and the downstream power station compensates and adjusts the output gap which is an effective strategy to face the ecological and power risks brought by the ibwt project the results of this study not only provide an important scientific basis for maintaining the sustainability management of water resources in a water supply region and provide cascade reservoir operation rules to minimize the negative impact they also help scientific decision making for the water transfer scale and water transfer method of an ibwt project the concepts of this study can be applied to similar water supply regions to establish a quantitative assessment model for the impact of ibwt and lay the foundation for further study on compensation mechanisms this is of importance for implementing comprehensive management of the strategic resource allocation of water resources and energy the model proposed in this study still has limitations in the future due to rapid social development population changes and climate changes it will be difficult to calculate the supply and demand information of large watersheds water resource management based on historical observation data is relatively unstable the evaluation and demonstration of the impact of ibwt projects based on the stability factor are very important for long term water resource planning and should be considered in future studies credit authorship

2240,to tackle ever changing global water problems inter basin water transfer ibwt projects provide water supply alternatives for water scarce regions and create potential risks for water supply regions to analyze the multiple interrelated impacts of ibwt projects on supply regions in this study we establish a cascade multi objective complementary optimal scheduling model and apply the model to the water supply regions of the west route of china s south north water transfer project and the dadu minjiang water transfer project with the goal of fully utilizing water resources to gain comprehensive benefits we objectively and quantitatively evaluate the impacts of ibwt projects on the ecology and hydropower generation of water supply regions to reduce the complexity of solving the model the model is decomposed into a two stage optimization model and is solved with particle swarm optimization and fuzzy optimization the results show that 1 the multi objective model that simultaneously considers minimal ecological water shortage degree maximal power generation and the maximization of the annual minimum output is more conducive to the full utilization of water resources 2 the factors affecting the ecological flow the power generation and its structure in the water supply region and the annual minimum output are different 3 to deal with risks the upstream power station in the water supply region is controlled to meet the ecological needs as the primary goal and the downstream power station is mainly responsible for the task of compensating and adjusting the output gap during the dry season this study can provide technical support for the demonstration and decision making of ibwt projects and it explores the ideas of water resource planning and management keywords inter basin water transfer project impact assessment complementary dispatch multi objective optimization particle swarm optimization cascade hydropower data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global freshwater resources are unevenly distributed in locations and time with rapid economic and social development regional water demand continues to grow rapidly with the process of urbanization and the imbalance between regional water supply and demand is even more severe an ibwt project can change the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of water resources between river basins by accumulating water when it is abundant and by supplying water during the dry season or to water scarce regions this type of project achieves the redistribution of water resources to effectively alleviate the urgent needs of water scarce regions this approach has become an increasingly popular solution shumilova et al 2018 however studies have shown that while ibwt projects have improved the economic structure and ecological situation of water scarce regions they have also changed hydrological runoff situations in water supply regions increasing the damage or risk to regional ecological security and economic and social development and further exacerbating the difficulty of water resource management duan et al 2022 yu et al 2018 zhuang 2016 therefore it is necessary to conduct a systematic and in depth evaluation and demonstration of the comprehensive benefits of ecology power generation irrigation and water supply in water receiving regions and water supply regions for an ibwt project and to perform a comprehensive analysis of the water balance relationships between river basins to avoid a water shortage and the corresponding unequal transfer sun et al 2021 at present many studies of the multiple interrelated effects of ibwt projects have been performed rani et al 2016 sinha et al 2020 wilson et al 2017 among these effects an ibwt project inevitably changes the natural flow process in a water supply region and reduces the flow in the rivers this may be detrimental to the stability and sustainable development of the ecosystem of a river and may even cause environmental degradation this makes the study of ecological security issues one of the topics of interest among the many impacts of ibwt projects zhang et al 2015 most of the studies on ecological impacts use water environment models to evaluate existing water quality problems li et al 2013 webber et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 it is difficult for these models to evaluate the potential ecological impact of water transfer projects during planning in addition in essence ibwt affects the entire ecological environment by affecting various subsystems of the ecological environment but its impact on the ecological environment must be within the scope of ecological carrying capacity to ensure the sustainable development of the ecological environment water volume is a primary factor to measure the ecological environment carrying capacity it is worth noting that the factors related to water environment such as water quality water temperature water ecology are also closely related to water quantity zhang et al 2022 therefore from the perspective of ecological safety ensuring the ecological base flow that maintains the ecological environment of a river is the most basic requirement for protecting an ecosystem acreman et al 2014 with the increasing emphasis on ecological issues it has become a trend to take ecological flow demand as one of the objectives for ibwt project evaluation and optimization jiao et al 2021 ma et al 2020 in addition hydropower plays an increasingly important role in modern energy systems jin et al 2021 the reduction of runoff changes the operation mode of a reservoir thus affecting the annual power generation and structure zhao et al 2022 which inevitably affects the power security and social economy history has shown that many attempts to implement resource management initiatives have been met with resistance from stakeholders lafreniere et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an ibwt project on the power generation and power structure of cascade hydropower stations in a water supply region tian et al 2019 in order to take measures to reduce negative impacts and to coordinate possible conflicts between regions to win support wu et al 2019 yin et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 studied the influence of power generation but seldom considered the influence on the annual power structure and output during the dry season however the annual power generation structure and the dry season output of a cascade hydropower station have an important impact on the power security of a power grid especially the dry season power security of power grids with hydropower as the main power source in general ibwt projects can break the original model of ecological and power systems manshadi et al 2015 explored the economic and environmental impacts of ibwt projects however there are few assessment methods that quantitatively analyze the potential impact of ibwt projects on the ecology power generation and output of water supply regions in addition compared with the traditional method of establishing an index system for evaluation and analysis abdi dehkordi et al 2021 analyzing the optimization results of multi objective coordinated operation model of cascade reservoirs provides a more objective quantitative result for decision makers to evaluate the multiple impacts of ibwt projects such an evaluation is conducted on the basis of tapping the potential of cascade hydropower regulation and making full use of water resources which reflects the almost unavoidable negative impact by analyzing the causes of the negative impact it is helpful to guide the decision making managers to adjust the project design reasonably furthermore the optimization results also provide the operation strategy of cascade hydropower to the power plant managers for the multi objective problems a variety of optimization methods have been designed and applied in recent years they are mainly divided into traditional planning algorithms and swarm intelligence algorithms with a large amount of progress chen 2021 yao et al 2022 different types of algorithms have different advantages and disadvantages as well as different use conditions overcoming the ever increasing difficulty of solving models swarm intelligence algorithms have attracted great interest due to their simple principles low calculation costs and fast optimization tang et al 2021 particle swarm optimization is relatively mature in the field of the multi objective solutions of cascade reservoirs to overcome its problems of large randomness and being prone to fall into a local optimum researchers have proposed various improvements the improved particle swarm algorithm has the advantages of fewer parameters fast convergence and simple computation bai et al 2019 niu et al 2018 shami et al 2022 to improve the efficiency of solving the models researchers have studied the solution ideas and methods from the perspectives of the model structure ming et al 2018 and the search space meng et al 2019 the more mature approach to dimensionality reduction is usually layering and nesting guo et al 2012 proposed a two layer model to solve the operation problem of cascade reservoirs in ibwt projects the upper layer optimizes the water transfer rule curve the lower layer optimizes the hedging rule curve and pursues the optimal water supply in the water transfer process zhang et al 2020 decomposed a heterogeneous energy complementary scheduling model by a two stage decoupling method and optimized the decision variables in the hierarchical structure greatly improving the efficiency of the model solution the above studies provide solutions and methods for solving the complex optimization problems of cascade hydropower in this study we establish a model for assessing the ecological environment power generation impact of the establishment of an ibwt project combined with the examples of the west route of china s south north water transfer project and the dadu minjiang water transfer project we study the impacts on the ecological discharge of the water supply region and the power generation of the cascade power stations we use a two stage decoupling method based on a particle swarm algorithm to solve the multi objective evaluation model and we quantitatively analyze the changes in the electricity structure the output changes during the dry season and the changes in the operation mode of the cascade reservoirs the findings of this study can provide useful information for local governments and policymakers to better understand the potential impacts of water transfer projects improve the scale and structure of water transfer projects and assist in the management of water transfer projects the model and the idea to solve the model established in this study can also be used in other projects and can provide a new idea for the demonstration and decision making of ibwt projects the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the water transfer projects scales and processes in the basins of study as well as the planning and development and the basic information about the cascade power stations in the water supply region section 3 describes the ecological environment power generation impact assessment

different conditions discusses the impacts of the water transfer projects on ecology power generation output and the changes in the operation mode of the regulating reservoir before and after the water transfer and provides the outlook for water transfer optimization schemes section 6 describes the conclusions and discusses their implications 2 scope of the study and data 2 1 overview of the study region the dadu river is the largest tributary of the minjiang river a first level tributary of the yangtze river in china and the most abundant river in the sichuan province its huge drop abundant water volume and narrow river valley form the rich and exploitable water resources of the dadu river it is designated as one of china s large scale hydropower energy bases and has an important national energy strategic position because of its abundant water volume it has become one of the water sources for the west route of china s south north water transfer project the largest ibwt project in the world hereinafter referred to as project 1 barnett et al 2015 according to the planning of project 1 1 15 billion m3 of water are to be transferred from the upstream tributary of dadu river the water transfer from the shuangjiangkou sjk reservoir in the uppermost reaches of the main stem of the dadu river will be 4 billion m3 the average annual water transfer amount will be 5 15 billion m3 according to statistics the average runoff of the sjk section over the years is 15 686 billion m3 which is reduced to 10 536 billion m3 after water transfer a reduction rate of 32 83 in addition to solve the problem of water shortage in the hinterland of the sichuan basin the dadu river has also become a water source of the dadu minjiang water transfer project a large scale ibwt project in the sichuan province hereinafter referred to as project 2 the dadu minjiang water transfer project plan recommends the dadu river luding ld hydropower station to be the water source for project 2 with an average annual water transfer of 2 282 billion m3 according to statistics the annual average runoff of the ld section is 27 656 billion m3 the combined water transfer of project 1 and project 2 reduces the annual average annual runoff to 20 224 billion m3 and the annual average runoff reduction rate is 26 87 an overview of the study basin and water transfer project is shown in fig 1 water transfer will change the hydrological situations of the basins reduce the output and power generation of the cascade power stations and inevitably affect the safety and supply of electricity a drastic measure in addition claiming that the yangtze river is rich in water resources conceals the fact that water shortages do occur barnett et al 2015 under the influence of future urbanization and climate change the problem of water shortage may become more serious the water supply regions of project 1 and project 2 are in a fragile ecological environment if water is diverted when the flow is low it may adversely affect the water supply region and the ecological environment of the water supply regions therefore it is very necessary to study the impacts of the ibwt project on the power generation of the dadu river cascade power stations and the impact of the ecological flow discharge 2 2 data the lack of water in the water supply regions will aggravate the imbalance caused by the transfer of water resources between the basins sousa estacio et al 2022 therefore using the worst case scenario wei et al 2020 we select a dry year with a water frequency of 90 for calculation and research according to the planning of project 1 and project 2 and the planning and development of cascade hydropower stations in the study basin we find that the affected area is the cascade reservoir group of four reservoirs and 24 levels in the main stem of the dadu river the characteristic parameters such as the normal water level dead water level installed capacity and output coefficient of each hydropower station are shown in table 1 the specific water transfer processes and natural runoff processes are as shown in fig 2 the four reservoirs of shuangjiangkou houyanyan changheba and pubugou are the reservoir power stations with seasonal or longer regulating capacity the other hydropower stations only have daily or shorter regulating capacity and only the power generation benefits of the cascade reservoirs participating in the joint dispatch as a runoff power station are considered in addition combined with the situation of the study area the wet season is from june to october and the dry season is from november to may of the following year 3 model specification in this study we establish a cascade multi objective optimization model with the complementary dispatching of ecology power generation and output to evaluate the ecological and power generation impacts of the ibwt project to the water supply region to establish the model we face three great challenges 1 under the condition of meeting the water intake demand of the water transfer project we must meet the ecological flow discharge and ecological dispatch requirements approved by the power station in the water supply region as much as possible because the water resources shortage caused by water transfer is mainly reflected in the water intake points of the project meeting the comprehensive water demand of the node is a priority 2 we need to maximize the use of reservoir capacity with a strong regulation ability and fully exploit cascade hydropower resources 3 to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power grid the output of cascade hydropower stations should be kept as stable as possible after meeting the demand for water transfer and ecological demand the model runs on a ten day basis and does not consider the time lag effect of flow variation 3 1 objective function because the ecological flow between the cascades is affected by the release of water from the upstream reservoir and the interval inflow there are temporal and spatial differences in the shortage of the ecological flow to achieve the full ecological water replenishment capacity of upstream regulating reservoirs to downstream reservoirs by using engineering cases we divide the cascade reservoirs into two sections according to water sources and consider their ecological objectives and we introduce an ecological water shortage degree to measure the impact of water transfer projects on the ecological environment objective function i is expressed as follows 1 m i n θ m i n m a x q i s h k t o h j p q i l d a n d d o w n s t r e a m 2 q i max q i t e q i t q i t e 0 t t where θ is the maximum ecological water shortage degree in the entire cascade q i is the ecological flow shortage degree of the i th power station q i t e is the ecological flow requirement of the i th power station at time t q i t is the ecological flow of the i th power station at time t and t is the total number of periods in the dispatch period in this study we adopt the ecological flow of each cascade power station approved by the ministry of ecology and environment as the standard to objectively reflect the influence of the ibwt project on the power generation and its structure for the water diversion region the optimization calculation is carried out before and after the water transfer with the objective of maximizing the annual total power generation of the cascade hydropower station group objective function ii is expressed as follows 3 maxe m a x t 1 t i 1 i λ i q i t h i t m t where e is the annual power generation of the entire cascade i is the number of cascade hydropower stations λ i is the output coefficient of the i th power station qi t is the power generation flow of the i th power station at time t hi t is the net water head of the i th power station at time t and mt is the number of hours at time t to make the power station provide the grid with output that is as large uniform and reliable as possible in the dry season and normal seasons and to achieve the full capacity benefit of hydropower another aim of this study is to maximize the annual minimum output of the cascade hydropower stations objective function iii is expressed as follows 4 maxn m a x m i n i 1 i λ i q i t h i t t t where n is the minimum output in the entire cascade

two stage decoupled optimization model the complementary scheduling model established in this study is a multi dimensional multivariable multi constraint nonlinear programming problem that is very difficult to solve to reduce the difficulty of solving this model and improve the solving efficiency we refer to the solution ideas of previous researchers we decouple the original problem into a two stage evaluation model including ecological compensation scheduling and generation optimization scheduling this is illustrated in fig 3 in the first stage only objective i is used as the optimization calculation objective and it is transformed into the ecological flow demand constraint of the second stage then the second stage optimization is performed with objectives ii and iii as the solution objectives finally the ecological flow process power generation process and operation plan of the hydropower station are obtained 4 2 model solution algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 were the first to introduce pso it is a stochastic optimization technique that relies on cooperative behavior and information sharing among particles in a group to achieve the goal of optimization since then researchers have improved the technology according to different application requirements pso has become a classic and effective intelligent optimization algorithm shami et al 2022 wang et al 2018 and has been widely used to solve various optimization problems in this study the pso algorithm is used as the core algorithm to solve the evaluation model the updated equations of the particle velocity and position state in the particle swarm optimization algorithm are 14 v k d g 1 ω g v k d g c 1 r 1 p k d g x k d g c 2 r 2 p g d g x k d g 15 x k d g 1 x k d g v k d g 1 where g is the number of

effectiveness of the mutual information transfer between particles and ω is the time varying inertia weight and its update equation is expressed as follows 16 w g w max w min g g g w min where w max and w min are the initial and final values of the inertia weights respectively by changing ω an extensive global search can be performed in the early stage of optimization while a focused local search can be performed in the later stages 1 the first stage the first stage deals with a relatively simple single objective optimization problem the minimum ecological water shortage of each hydropower station can be obtained by using the particle swarm algorithm the solution steps are as follows step 1 set the initial parameters of the algorithm and randomly generate the initial population within the variable threshold step 2 calculate the initial fitness of the particle according to equation 1 and determine the initial global extreme value p g d g and the initial individual extreme value p k d g step 3 update the particle position and velocity according to equations 14 and 15 determine whether the constraint conditions are met and if yes calculate the updated fitness values compare these values with the historical individual extreme value and the global extreme value and determine the current individual optimal position and the current global optimal location if not go to step 3 again step 4 repeat step 3 until the set number of iterations is reached and output the obtained result 2 the second stage the second stage deals with a multi objective optimization problem the pareto optimal mechanism is used as the fitness value comparison principle of particle swarms and fuzzy optimization is used as the decision making mechanism to obtain non dominated solutions iteratively the solution steps are as follows step 1 save the intermediate calculation variables q i t obtained in the first stage to minimize the ecological water shortage degree convert them into the ecological flow parameters q i t e in the discharge flow constraint equation 12 and update the calculation boundary conditions step 2 set the initial parameters of the algorithm and randomly generate the initial population within the variable threshold step 3 calculate the initial fitness of the particle according to equations 3 and 4 and determine the initial global extremum p g d g and the initial individual extremum p k d g according to pareto optimality step 4 update the particle position and velocity according to equations 14 and 15 determine whether the constraint conditions are met and if yes calculate the updated fitness values compare these values with the historical individual extreme value and the global extreme value according to the pareto optimality determine the current individual optimal position and the current global optimal position and save the global optimal particle into an external file if not go to step 4 again step 5 repeat step 4 and update the elite individuals in the external file when the total number of individuals exceeds the file memory the individuals ranked according to the calculated congestion degree the individuals with higher congestion degrees are prioritized and the last individuals are eliminated step 6 determine whether the maximum number of iterations has been reached if yes output the elite individual of the external file if not repeat step 4 step 7 the individuals in the external file are the pareto optimal solution set a fuzzy optimization method is used as the decision making mechanism the pareto optimal solution with the largest comprehensive relative superiority is used as the final scheduling plan the fuzzy optimal decision making is expressed mathematically as follows 17 μ 1 1 m 1 m α m β m max β m j 2 m 1 m α m β m j β m min 2 where μ is the comprehensive relative superiority degree of the decision set α m is the weight of the m th objective β m j is the relative superiority degree of the decision j and the objective m β m max is the ideal superiority degree of membership and β m min is the ideal inferiority degree of membership in general β m max 1 β m min 0 the algorithm flowchart is shown in fig 4 after the program calculation and test the optimal parameters of the two stage multi objective particle swarm algorithm are obtained as shown in table 2 5 results and discussion 5 1 model rationality analysis to verify the rationality of the comprehensive evaluation model of ecological and power generation complementary dispatching proposed in this paper model 1 we establish two comparative models the model specifications are shown in table 3 the data for dry years are calculated using the three models and the optimal scheme of each model is determined with the fuzzy optimization method table 4 shows the comparison of the results from the three models in model 2 the ecological objective is replaced with the most common ecological water shortage amount minimization objective the function expression is 18 m i n w m i n t 1 t i 1 i m a x q i t e q i t 0 m t 3600 where w is the total ecological water shortage of cascade hydropower compared with model 1 the ecological water shortage amount of model 2 is smaller but the ecological water shortage degree θ is larger indicating that the ecological water shortages in individual power stations in some periods are worse thus the ecological objective set in model 1 is more equitable in ensuring the ecological flow of each power station in addition model 2 does not consider maximizing the minimum output it can be seen that the index n is smaller than the other two models and the difference is relatively large in model 3 only two generation objectives i e maximizing the power generation and maximizing the minimum output are considered the indicators e and n are better than those in the other two models additionally the amount of time consumed is the lowest however the ecological indicators are not ideal the above results show that in the complementary dispatching of cascade hydropower under insufficient natural runoff conditions consideration of only the benefits of power generation and output leads to a great reduction in the ecological benefits which is not conducive to the sustainable development of hydropower while consideration of the optimization of the ecological flow at the same time does not reduce too much generation benefit in addition the ecological objective of model 1 is more balanced for the entire cascade ecological flow distribution the reduction of the water shortage rate of the ecological flow at each moment is beneficial to achieving objective iii which reflects the fact that the ecological flow and power assurance are not completely opposite which is relatively close to the conclusion in su and yang 2021 therefore model 1 which considers multi objectives at the same time is more conducive to the efficient use of water resources and the safe supply of electricity in the case of insufficient natural runoff 5 2 analysis of ecological flow shortage to analyze the impact of the ibwt project on the ecological flow we conduct compensation adjustment calculations before and after the water transfer in a dry year fig 5 shows the comparison of the minimum ten day flow of the natural flow and the ecological flow in the two calculation results with the ecological flow approved by the ministry of ecology environment of china the ten day ecological shortage for the power stations with ecological flow gaps is shown in the form of a radar chart in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that after the water diversion the ecological flow is reduced to a certain extent and some power stations may not be able to meet the ecological flow requirement which is mainly related to the location of a power station its distance from the water intake point and the ecological flow requirement the power stations with ecological flow gaps are sjk the largest gap is 8 93 m3 s jc the largest gap is 15 86 m3 s and ld the largest gap is 6 99 m3 s sjk and jc are the first level and the second level on the main stem of the dadu river with fewer natural water supply and higher ecological flow requirements the ecological flow demand of the two stations accounts for 32 59 and 34 44 of the annual average flow respectively in addition sjk is the water intake point of project 1 and jc is the power station closest to it both are affected the most by the water transfer the ld is the ninth level on the main stem of the dadu river after the confluence of the river basin and the compensation adjustment of the upstream power stations the incoming water is relatively abundant however as the water intake point of project 2 the needs of the water supply and ecological requirements cannot be met at the same time after the secondary water transfer in addition it can also be seen from fig 5 that if there is no ecological compensation regulation from cascade reservoirs the demand for ecological flow in some river sections during the dry season cannot be guaranteed thus the hydropower station does not necessarily have a negative impact on the river ecology it can be seen from fig 6 that the hydropower station that is the most affected by the water diversion is jc followed by sjk and then ld the ecological water shortage times of jc and sjk are basically the same from early november to late march of the following year and may of the following year there is a relatively uniform water shortage flow the difference is that there is no water shortage in sjk in april and jc lacks water flow in april compared to other time periods which is related to the water diversion method of project 1 april is the maintenance month with no water diversion the time of the ecological water shortage in ld is from mid december to late april of the following year which is consistent with the dry period runoff structure of the natural inflow of the dadu river the runoff in the dry season only accounts for 25 of the annual flow it is worth mentioning that this study takes the design water flow as the baseline in a future characterized by climate change and strengthened regulation if the flow process that is more appropriate to the natural flow pattern is considered as the baseline the situation of ecological flow shortage will be more severe acreman et al 2014 5 3 analysis of the impact of water transfer on power generation the ibwt projects not only affect the annual power generation of the dadu river cascade power stations but also reduce the guaranteed output of the power stations and reduce the quality of power generation in this study we make a statistical comparison of the indicators that are related to the power generation and minimum output of the cascade power stations in the model s complementary dispatch results before and after water transfer 5 3 1 analysis of the impact of water transfer on power generation and its structure we compared the ten day power generation index of the cascade the ten day power reduction rate index of the cascade fig 7 a the cascade power generation index in wet and dry seasons the annual total power generation index of the cascade fig 7b the annual total power generation index of each power station and the power generation reduction rate index of each power station fig 7c before and after water transfer first based on the change trend fig 7a the reduction rates of electricity in the dry season are larger than those in the wet season and the reduction rates are basically inversely proportional to power generation that is the less power generation there is the greater the reduction rate is this is affected by the size of the base and the size of the water transfer as well as the regulating performance of the reservoirs that is to say the base of power generation in the dry season is small and the proportion of water transfer is large the regulation performance of the reservoir in the dry season is limited by the small amount of natural water inflow leading the water transfer to have a greater impact in the dry season in terms of the total amount fig 7b the total power generation of the dadu river cascade power station in dry years was 88 287 billion kw h and the total power generation loss of the cascade power station after the water transfer was 25 080 billion kw h a decrease of 28 41 from the perspective of electricity structure the wet season decreased by 9 771 billion kw h and the dry season was reduced by 15 309 billion kw h with decreases of 19 22 and 40 88 respectively indicating that water transfer has a more significant impact on the power generation level in the dry season moreover the water source for water transfer belongs to a province with a high proportion of hydropower and power supply presenting the problem of power supply abundant in the wet season and shortage in the dry season because of the effect of the water transfer the proportion of electricity in the wet season and the dry season has expanded from the original 1 36 1 to 1 85 1 this will undoubtedly exacerbate the imbalance and pose a challenge to the green and safe energy supply in sichuan where the power supply is already insufficient during the dry season in addition it can be seen from fig 7c that the annual power generation of each cascade power station is affected by water transfer which is negatively correlated to the distance from the water intake point and positively correlated to its installed capacity that is the power station close to the water intake point with a large installed capacity is more affected by the water transfer the hydropower stations that have a relatively large impact on power generation are pbg installed capacity of 3 6 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 785 billion kw h dgs 2 6 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 79 billion kw h chb 2 6 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 481 billion kw h and sjk 2 million kw where the power generation is reduced by 2 524 billion kw h the overall reduction rate of power generation shows a decreasing trend there are two causes for this the first cause is that the proportion of water transfer to natural incoming water decreases in turn the second cause is that the closer to the downstream power station the location is the greater the impact of the upstream power station reservoir s runoff regulation is and the smaller the power generation loss is the significant increase in the reduction ratio of the power generation of the ld is because ld is the second water intake point with a rapidly increased cross section water transfer volume 5 3 2 analysis of the impact of the water transfer on the output fig 8 a shows the output change of the cascade power stations before and after the water transfer it can be seen that the effect of the ten day output of the cascade fig 8a is similar to the effect of the water transfer on the power generation and the reduction rate is basically inversely proportional to the output which has a greater impact on the output in the dry season after the water transfer the average output during the dry season is reduced from 7 359 million kw to 4 351 million kw a decrease of 3 008 million kw or an average decrease of about 41 which greatly threatens the power supply guarantee rate during the dry season before the water transfer the minimum output in the year appears in late march 7 258 700 kw and after the water transfer the minimum output in the year appears in mid december 4 221 100 kw a decrease of 43 04 fig 8b shows the change in the minimum output of each power station during the year it can be seen that there are three main stages the minimum output loss of the cascade power station from chb to lyy2 is significantly higher than that of the other power stations which is close to half of what it was before the water transfer there are four main causes for this ① the minimum output of the chb appears in early may the calculation results of the cascade compensation adjustment show that the chb had dropped to the dead water level in late april indicating that the large output loss of the chb is mainly due to the limited regulating capacities of the chb itself and its upstream region ② the cascade power stations from hjp to lyy2 have no regulation capacity and have a small interval flow so the output structure is similar to that of the nearest upstream regulating power station chb ③ ld is the second water intake point so the minimum output loss is further increased ④ pbg has an annual adjustment capability and the minimum output loss of its downstream power stations during the year decreases in a stepwise manner after compensation regulation 5 4 analysis of the impact of water transfer on regulating reservoirs the ibwt project has a certain impact on the operation mode and development of cascade hydropower in the water diversion region which is mainly reflected in the change of the operating water level of the reservoir and the change of the main tasks undertaken by the regulating power station in order to obtain a cascade reservoir operation plan with regular significance to deal with the negative impact of the inter basin water transfer project we also carried out the calculation of complementary regulation before and after the water transfer in the wet year and the normal year fig 9 shows the ten day difference of the water levels of the regulating power stations in three typical years namely the changes of the operating water levels before and after the water transfer it can be seen that the difference of the operating water level of the cascade reservoirs before and after the water transfer is mainly in the dry season regardless of the incoming water condition overall the water level decrease of sjk is delayed during the dry season and the water levels of hzy chb and pbg almost all fall in advance during the dry period the difference is that the water level of hzy falls ahead of that of chb and the time of the pbg early drawdown water level is evenly distributed in the dry period this rule is consistent under different water inflow conditions conforms to the water transfer relationship between cascades reflects the regulation of the reservoir and explains the rationality of the dispatching scheme to better understand the reasons for the changes in the water level a comprehensive analysis is carried out along with the outflows of the power stations fig 10 first it is found that before and after the water transfer sjk always begins to draw down first followed by hzy and then the chb this is due to the flow volumes and head transfer laws of the cascade reservoirs in other words for the same outflow compared with the downstream power station the water level of the upstream power stations has a higher priority to be drawn down the total water head of the cascade is larger and the total cascade power generation benefit is greater pbg does not match this trend because the regulation performance of the four power stations is different sjk and pbg are annual regulating power stations and hzy and chb are seasonal regulating power stations therefore the pbg power station has a longer water drawdown cycle second the water level fluctuation of sjk is closely related to whether the inflow meets the ecological flow the water level is delayed to fall the reason is to postpone the release of water to make up for the shortage of ecological flow at the end of dry season the situation of early decline in the early dry season of normal and dry years is to increase the discharge flow to make up for the shortage of ecological flow in the early dry season third the water level of hzy and chb are reduced in advance because although the outflows of them meet the ecological flow it can be seen from section 5 2 that there is still an ecological flow gap in the downstream power stations so the two stations need to make up for the ecological flow of the downstream power stations in addition the great differences in the method of the water level drawdowns of them occur and the water level changes are more and more obvious with the decrease of incoming water because they are limited by the regulation performance and are sensitive to the change of water volume and with the decrease of incoming water the reservoir operations are more affected finally pbg and its downstream power stations have no ecological flow gap in three typical years based on the results of power generation and output it can be seen that pbg draws down in advance to make up for the high water head benefit abandoned by the upstream power station for ecological flow compensation resulting in reduced output during the dry season a regulating power station in a cascade power station mainly undertakes important tasks such as regulation and storage the water transfer changes the operation mode of the power station it can be seen from the analysis that the water volume regulation of the sjk hzy and chb reservoirs for the water transfer project has almost used up all the regulating capacity which weakens the ability of cascade hydropower in the diversion region to adjust to other demands in addition we found that after water transfer the upstream power stations need to sacrifice part of the water head benefits to increase the ecological flow in dry season while the downstream power stations mainly undertake the compensation and regulation of the output gap in dry season 5 5 optimization analysis of water transfer scale and process to achieve a balance between the ecological generation benefits in the water supply region and the human water demand in the water receiving region in this section we discuss options for optimizing the scale and process of water transfer to reduce the negative impacts in dry year the key to a water transfer project is to minimize the water shortage the water users face the ecological protection of the water supply region also cannot be ignored therefore as discussed in this section while ensuring ecology we set the minimization of water transfer shortage amount ren et al 2019 as one of the objectives the function expression is 19 m i n d m i n t 1 t p 1 p m a x q p t d e m a n d q p t s u p p l y 0 m t 3600 where d is the total water transfer shortage amount q p t demand is the water transfer demand flow of water transfer point p at time t q p t supply is the actual water transfer flow of water transfer point p at time t and p is the number of water transfer points we consider both power generation and output issues we establish a multi objective compensation adjustment model for cascade reservoirs model 4 and we use the solution algorithm described in section 4 for calculation and analysis we then compare the calculation results with the results of model 1 built in this paper table 5 fig 11 shows the optimized water transfer process fig 12 shows the situation in which the minimum ten day outflow of each cascade power station meets the ecological flow demand during the new water transfer process compared with the situation before water transfer optimization the water transfer decreases by 246 2416 million m3 it can be seen from the table 5 that the replacement ratio of ecological water shortage amount and water transfer shortage amount is 1 83 1 which means that a certain amount of water transfer can be reduced in exchange for greater ecological flow benefits the reason is that the ecological water shortage amount has a cumulative effect in addition after optimization the annual power generation is reduced and the minimum output during the year is also increased by 1 012 billion kw h and 201 900 kw it can be seen from fig 11 that project 1 has been optimized and project 2 has not changed combined with fig 12 it can be seen that the ecological needs of the power station that originally had a shortage of ecological flow near the water source have been met this shows that the method of uniform water transfer in project 1 is unreasonable according to the optimized project 1 the water transfer volume will be appropriately reduced in the dry season to ensure the ecological flow demand of sjk and jc near the first water source under the circumstance of avoiding the adjustment of the water transfer method for project 2 as much as possible the ecological flow gap of the downstream power station can be met by the compensation regulating of the cascade power station it can be seen in fig 10 that even in dry years water abandonment still occurs in the wet season after the water transfer from the discussion in section 5 4 it can be seen that the upstream reservoir regulation capacity of the cascade reservoirs after the water transfer is not enough to meet the demand for water transfer therefore the increase of the regulating capacity of the cascade reservoir groups by building regulating reservoirs in the upstream region can be considered to store extra water when supply is abundant and replenish water during droughts to meet the different water demands of the diversion region and the water supply region in addition the water transfer process can be adjusted that is the approach of diverting less water in the dry season and diverting more water in the wet season is used to make compensations and adjustments in the water receiving region to supplement the dry season with secondary storage this helps ensure the ecological power security in the water supply region and meet the needs of the water receiving region as much as possible in summary the ibwt project is huge expensive and has a complex and far reaching impact it needs to be fully evaluated and assessed the scale and process of water diversion can be flexibly adjusted by considering the abundance and shortage of water in the water supply region the structural process and the supply and demand relationship in the water receiving region 6 conclusion to quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of the ibwt project on the ecology and power system of the water supply region we propose a cascaded multi objective optimization model for the complementary dispatch of ecology power generation and output we use the dadu river basin which is one of the water sources in the western route of the south north water transfer project and also the water source of the dadu minjiang water transfer project as the study case the conclusions are as follows 1 the two stage decoupling optimization model is used to reduce the difficulty of solving the three objectives the optimal solution of the multi objective scheme is determined with particle swarm optimization and the fuzzy optimization method 2 two comparative models are established the results show that the optimization objective that considers the ecological flow demand power generation and output at the same time has little impact on the power index but can greatly improve the rate of meeting the ecological flow and allow for a more reasonable utilization of water resources 3 the amount of ecological water shortage is mainly related to the proportion of water transfer to the natural incoming water and the requirements of the ecological flow the time of occurrence of ecological water shortage is mainly related to the structure of the water transfer and natural runoff the annual power generation structure of the cascade power station is affected by the water transfer structure and the regulation performance of the reservoir the power generation loss of each power station is negatively correlated with the distance from the water transfer point and positively correlated with its installed capacity the annual minimum output of each power station is closely related to its regulation performance natural water flow and upstream and downstream locations 4 after the water transfer the original operation mode of the cascade hydropower station changes during the dry season the upstream power station sacrifices part of the head benefit to increase the ecological flow evenly and the downstream power station compensates and adjusts the output gap which is an effective strategy to face the ecological and power risks brought by the ibwt project the results of this study not only provide an important scientific basis for maintaining the sustainability management of water resources in a water supply region and provide cascade reservoir operation rules to minimize the negative impact they also help scientific decision making for the water transfer scale and water transfer method of an ibwt project the concepts of this study can be applied to similar water supply regions to establish a quantitative assessment model for the impact of ibwt and lay the foundation for further study on compensation mechanisms this is of importance for implementing comprehensive management of the strategic resource allocation of water resources and energy the model proposed in this study still has limitations in the future due to rapid social development population changes and climate changes it will be difficult to calculate the supply and demand information of large watersheds water resource management based on historical observation data is relatively unstable the evaluation and demonstration of the impact of ibwt projects based on the stability factor are very important for long term water resource planning and should be considered in future studies credit authorship

2241,the interaction between hydrological factors is complex and the correlation effects cannot be quantitatively explained from a mechanistic perspective the extraction of effective features from several hydrological and meteorological data and quantifying their correlation effects to make runoff prediction more accurate and stable is an urgent problem to be solved in this study we introduce a structural paradigm for hydrological time series to handle the entire feature space composed of some feature sequences based on deep learning methods namely the feature attention mechanism this method transforms the problem of feature target association into multiple parallel binary classification problems and assigns attention units to each specific feature in the network the attention distribution was adjusted by updating the neural network parameters in a supervised manner to generate feature weightings in addition two extensions were proposed based on the initial network structure the three methods were used in a practical study of the upper yangtze river basin using three evaluation metrics compared with five benchmark methods the mean metric values were improved by up to 9 43 10 05 and 2 65 respectively meanwhile with the characteristics of hydrological data the rationality of the method is corroborated in hydrological feature discovery and time series dependence extraction moreover we tested the performance of the model on two constructed noise datasets to demonstrate its robustness the results of all the above experiments show that the attention module significantly improves the learning and generalization ability enhances noise resistance and strengthens the robustness of the model compared with the traditional method abbreviations am

learning feature attention mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resources are receiving increasing attention as renewable energy sources runoff prediction is an important part of water resource planning and management for reservoir operation and dam scheduling liu et al 2019 yeh 1985 and flood safety disaster prevention and mitigation as monitoring technology matures an increasing amount of data is available however the relationship between hydrological factors is difficult to quantify the hydrological mechanism remains unclear making it difficult to determine what information is input into the model to obtain better prediction results beven et al 1984 liu et al 2023 in addition fluctuations in hydrological data and various possible perturbations are important issues to be considered fazel et al 2015 lin et al 2021 recently deep learning models and methods have been successfully applied in hydrology achieving remarkable outcomes in hydrological prediction tasks kratzert et al 2021 chen et al 2020 developed self attentive long short term memory sa lstm for modeling short term time dependence based on lstm and considering short lag times the model was evaluated on eight runoff datasets the results showed that the model achieved the best performance compared with other baseline results chen et al 2022b applied iot techniques and proposed an attention mechanism for bidirectional gated recursive units to adjust the match between the input features and outputs their model produced better flood predictions than lstm chen et al 2022a combined a convolutional neural network cnn with lstm and proposed convolutional lstm convlstm to extract spatiotemporal features of hydrological information the prediction results were within the standard flood prediction permit errors it attained the optimum value in the method comparison liu et al 2022 combined the snapshot and attention ensembles to propose a deep learning multi model ensemble method to improve runoff prediction performance multiple evaluation metrics were used for comparison with the baseline model the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method the feature selection mechanism as a pre processing step for the model input data plays a crucial role in improving the prediction results by focusing on extracting useful information from a large amount of otherwise meaningless or undefined correlation data bolón canedo et al 2015 there are various techniques of feature processing and combining existing methods with deep learning based feature selection methods is emerging to adapt to the challenges posed by data growth zou et al 2015 proposed a supervised learning method based on deep belief networks to filter features by reconstruction error ranking chen et al 2017 achieved semi supervised feature selection using a projection matrix to rank features however all of the above methods apply to supervised targets of discrete variables and do not apply to time series prediction tasks zhang et al 2021 characterized feature selection as the effect of the selected combination of multiple input variables on model prediction yu and liu 2004 analyzed the effectiveness of feature selection from two perspectives relevance and redundancy and decoupled the two aspects however these methods are limited to selecting a subset of features and reducing the number of features without considering the information bias caused by reducing the feature dimension the attention mechanism is an emerging topic in deep learning the attention mechanism has been widely used in various research areas such as the natural language processing devlin et al 2018 he et al 2021 image analysis guo et al 2022 hu et al 2018 recommender systems xiao et al 2017 and time series analysis liu et al 2021 wen et al 2019 and has shown its powerful performance the attention mechanism is inspired by human visual attention which obtains the target area that needs to be focused on and then devotes more attention resources to this area to obtain more detailed information related to the target while ignoring other irrelevant information by introducing an attention mechanism to concentrate on the information that is more critical to the current task among many input information and reduce the attention to other information or filter out irrelevant information the information overload problem can be solved and the efficiency and accuracy of the neural network can be improved the attention generation process is similar to that of feature selection furthermore it has been shown that feature components with small contributions may often contain important information about sample differences di mauro et al 2021 which suggests that they may be more useful for differentiating samples but for previous methods these features were discarded another problem is that most feature selection methods are less robust based on evaluation studies of effrosynidis and arampatzis 2021 which implies that they are not resistant to interference and are not generalized applications to solve the above two problems simultaneously and inspired by the attention mechanism a feature selection model based on the attention mechanism is proposed which proceeds from the intrinsic issue of feature selection and describes the feature selection problem as a problem of selecting or not selecting a given feature and the probability of selection thus converting the previous discrete 0 1 subset selection problem the process of selecting a subset is 1 and not selecting is 0 into a continuous relevance distribution problem probability values between 0 and 1 this model assigns separate attention networks to each feature the method in this study takes all the feature inputs and reconstructs them through the feature attention network instead of treating feature engineering as pre processing of the input model which is often a subset of the feature space the proposed method can handle the entire space in such a manner that the input sequence maintains its original shape including the length and number of time series after passing through the feature selection module this study concentrated on short term runoff predictions the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 introduced a feature processing paradigm applied this paradigm to time series and developed a feature selection model for processing hydrological time series namely a model based on the feature attention mechanism 2 the dependence of the two dimensions of feature correlations and temporal patterns in the hydrological time series feature selection task is explained in conjunction with the adaptive feature weight distribution of the model 3 two methods for constructing noisy datasets were proposed to test the robustness of the model and apply them to practical datasets the performance of the model is validated 4 the accuracy and generality of the model are demonstrated and compared with those of the baseline model generality involves two aspects the first is that it applies to single step prediction while multi step prediction can also achieve high accuracy and the other is that it is appropriate for common datasets as well as noisy datasets achieving generalization on datasets that is model robustness the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the notations used in this study and the basic tasks section 3 introduces the feature processing method based on the attention mechanism two extensions and the model evaluation method section 4 describes the study area data preprocessing and experimental setup and analyzes the experimental results and discussion finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 problem formulation in this study the time series to be processed was a sequence of actual observations with continuous time stamps with an identical interval length the observations for the historical target time series are denoted as y 1 y 2 y t 1 with y t 1 r whereas the driving exogenous series is x 1 x 2 x t 1 with x t 1 r n which is assumed to be correlated with the target series in time series forecasting tasks a window of a given length of look back driven series window x x 1 t x 2 t x c t t 1 l with x r l c and target series window y y t t 1 l with y r l where l is the size of the window and c is the number of features is typically used to predict a fixed length of future series the corresponding prediction is denoted as y f y t t l 1 l t whereas the ground truth is y y t t l 1 l t where t is the size of the forecasting horizon the time series forecasting model aims to learn the mapping function f in y f f x y 3 methodology in this section the overall architecture of the proposed method namely the feature attention machine fam and the structure of each part are illustrated and analyzed two extensions were introduced in the base method the details of each method are provided in the following subsections 3 1 overall architecture similar to embedded methods our proposed fam architecture integrates feature selection into the overall model learning process as shown in fig 1 the fam is designed with a loosely coupled structure that contains two main modules the attention module and the learning module the data input to the model first passes through the attention module which computes the weights assigned to all features and outputs the weighted feature matrix the process called the feature weighting cai et al 2018 the learning module can be regarded as a process that solves the optimization problem to find the best fit between the reconstructed features and the supervised target the overall model connects the supervised target with the input features using back propagation mechanism and continuously updates the feature weights during the training process until it reaches the set fitting state furthermore benefitting from fam s detachable structural design the learning modules can be individually customized to match the corresponding tasks to achieve ideal results the attention and learning modules together construct the correlations that best describe the relationship between the target and features gui et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the method does not change the shape of the original input data as shown in the fig 2 3 2 attention module feature selection is performed by extracting common attributes or trends from several data instances for each feature there are only two states selected or not which indicate whether the feature is relevant to the supervised target the relevance is represented by the probability of selection in this way the feature selection problem is translated into a binary classification problem that is whether the current feature should be selected for a specific supervised target the feature weights are then derived from the distribution of selection patterns this section describes in detail the theoretical method of the attention module and the process of its construction and proposes two essential extensions based on it 3 2 1 basic structure of fam as shown in fig 1 the input data first passes through the embedding layer to extract the intrinsic correlation information and reduce data dimensionality for time series forecasting tasks where there are no prior assumptions on data structural properties and the correspondence between the input data and the target series is unknown a linear layer is usually used 1 e x w e t b e where w e r n e c and b e r n e are learnable parameters that represent weights and biases respectively the number of output units in the embedding layer with dimension n e is a hyperparameter that can be resized according to the requirements of specific tasks generally n e c which on the one hand compresses the original feature space into smaller vectors whereas the original features are represented as their linear combinations ueda 2000 thus retaining the vast majority of the information the introduced activation layer is expressed as follows 2 e t a n h e which is capable of converting linear projections to nonlinear projections while the zero mean and bounded nature of tanh allows it to retain both positive and negative values while limiting outliers which enables it to retain important information while suppressing individual noise during extraction the typical soft attention mechanism bahdanau et al 2014 first generates the attention distribution of all inputs and later calculates the weighted average over all input data dimensions based on the attention distribution in this study this approach was not used because first the softmax used directly assigns small weights to most of the features when its dimension is high which will lose the detailed part of the entire feature space while causing the features to be less discriminative furthermore when there are outliers or noisy data the dimensions in which these data are located may be incorrectly assigned larger weights rendering the model unstable and decreasing the noise immunity performance another problem is that the process of determining the attention distribution is computationally intensive for high dimensional data a novel soft attention mechanism is proposed inspired by the binary classification unler and murat 2010 approach we assigned separate attention units to each feature dimension instead of determining the distributions for all features or creating a subset of all features these shallow attentions generate bernoulli distributions of the current features that is selected or unselected states namely parallel attention cell for the c th feature the selected and unselected values denoted as s c and u c are each given by the following scoring functions 3 s c h e w s c b s c u c h e w u c b u c in practice to simplify the calculation the above formulas can be merged as 4 s c u c h e w c t b c where h e is the hidden layer output as the input for each attention unit w c r 2 n e and b c r 2 represents the learnable weights and bias parameters respectively softmax is then used to map the scores into feature attention distributions in which we focus only on the probability of being selected 5 a c s o f t m a x s c u c exp s c exp s c exp u c which is the output of the c th cell finally the output of all feature attention cells is stacked to form the attention map that is a a c c 1 c with a r l c the output weighted feature z of the attention module was obtained as follows 6 z x a where denotes the element wise multiplication when all parameters in the attention module are represented as θ a the feature attention process is as follows 7 z z θ a x the characteristics of the model are as follows first feature weighing is generated by parallel attention cells which greatly simplifies the computation and reduces the computational cost moreover the joint work of the embedding layer and tanh activation removes redundant features and enhances the stability of the feature selection finally the introduction of softmax can prevent gradient explosion and accelerate the convergence of the training process 3 2 2 two extensions of fam the embedding and activation layers have a simple structure and are easy to train however using them only to extract the correlation information between features may not be sufficient to preserve all the important messages as much as possible while extracting the correlation between features we introduce multi head attention mha to pre extract correlations between features which are later input to the embedding layer noting that historical observations of the target sequence are also input to the attention module at the same time the mha is based on scaled dot product attention to compute the self attention of the input this attention mechanism can be described as mapping a query and a set of key value pairs to the output where the key value pairs represent the input information the key is used to compute the attention distribution while the value is used to compute the aggregated information the output is calculated as a weighted sum of values where the weight assigned to each value is calculated using the similarity function between the query and the corresponding key note that the query key value and output are vectors in general the similarity function is expressed as 8 scor e i s i m i l a r i t y q u e r y k e y i and attention mechanism 9 attn q k v i 1 n softmax s c o r e i v a l u e i where q k and v stand for the query key and value matrix respectively the above equation shows the process of calculating the weights for scaled dot product attention the similarity is measured in multiplicative form and multiplied by a scaling factor 1 d k which can be further expressed as 10 attn q k v s o f t m a x queryke y t d k v a l u e mha divides the key value pairs into h subspaces and performs the attention function in parallel to yield d v dimensional output values and the projections of all subspaces are concatenated and projected again to obtain the final output vaswani et al 2017 expressed as follows 11 h i a t t n q w i q t k w i k t v w i v t mha q k v c a t h 1 h h w o t where d q d k and d v respectively represent the dimensions of query key and value and the cat function means concatenating all elements in this study it is given that 12 d q d k d v c 1 q k v x y after adding mha eqs 6 and 7 is expressed as 13 z x y c a t x y a 14 z x y z θ a x y self attention quantifies the interdependence between the input elements of the mechanism this mechanism allows the inputs to interact with each other self and determines what they should pay more attention to de santana correia and colombini 2022 in addition the introduced multi headed attention allows the model to focus on the representation correlation between different features in diverse subspaces which provides a further step to extract the correlation between features instead of just the correlation between exogenous sequences and target sequences however the problem that still exists is that the target sequences are input into the mha together first the autoregression that may be brought is destroyed because only a part of the information carried by the target sequence after the compression of the embedding layer represents the autoregressive property of the target sequence next owing to the use of softmax in the mha network to obtain the nonlinearity when the dot product is large it will cause the network to fall into the region of small gradients which causes the gradient vanishing problem for which we further introduce the residual connection orhan and pitkow 2017 the residual skip connection consists of two parts the first simulates the residual network following the mha layer normalization ba et al 2016 is performed 15 m l a y e r n o r m mha x y c a t x y the other is the skip connection to the target sequence 16 z y z θ a y y 17 z x y c a t z y z θ a x fig 3 shows the architecture of the residual fam with multi head attention 3 2 3 difference between the three methods in essence from generating the feature distribution the attention module in fam does not deal with the target sequence but learns the temporal patterns of the target sequence through the learning module in the process of updating the parameters in feature distribution it can be considered that the feature weight of the target sequence is 1 which is the way of dealing with the target sequence used in most of the previous time series forecasting tasks fam mha incorporates the target sequence into the attention module by introducing a multi headed attention layer and feeds the target sequence into the learning module after simultaneous processing with the feature sequence which has the same feature weight range and between 0 1 as the other sequences unlike other tasks the time series forecasting task is related to exogenous data and the autoregression of the target sequence is important this study intends to enable the attention module to achieve autocorrelation discovery and information aggregation through this process after adding the res mechanism the attention module converges to the above two mechanisms and the feature weights of the target sequence can be considered to be between 1 2 the differences between these three methods for processing data and yielding feature distributions are shown in fig 4 3 2 4 parameter initialization a truncated normal distribution initialization was used in this study to initialize the parameters of the attention module truncated distributions barr and sherrill 1999 thompson 1950 were employed to restrict the range of initial parameters all initialization parameters were drawn from the normal distribution n m e a n s t d 2 and values taken outside the interval a b were redrawn until they fell into the bounded range 3 3 learning module the learning module learns the parameters using a neural network through a back propagation mechanism to generate and update the feature weight matrix which can be expressed as y f l θ l z which in conjunction with the attention module and can be further expressed as 18 y f l θ l z θ a x y the learning process can be considered as the process of solving the objective function 19 argmin a l o s s y f y λ r θ where θ θ a θ l λ denotes the weight decay and r denotes the regularization function which can speed up the convergence and avoid possible overfitting for a specific learning task the learning module can be structured using the most appropriate network to obtain an optimal fit the most popular networks currently include deep neural networks dnns convolutional neural networks cnns and recurrent neural networks rnns and their variants the effectiveness of these off the shelf models that can be used as learning modules has been recognized by the deep learning community yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the representative ones including the feed forward network cheng et al 2020 fully convolutional network long et al 2015 perslev et al 2019 long and short term memory network liu et al 2022 and bi directional gated recurrent unit gao et al 2020 have been used extensively in time series forecasting 3 4 method evaluation metrics three evaluation metrics were adopted in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae all metrics were calculated for each prediction window and iterated through the entire dataset nse is used to quantitatively verify the performance of model simulation results and is particularly applicable to hydrological models it is calculated as 20 nse 1 rss tss 21 rss n 1 n y n y n 2 tss n 1 n y n y 2 where rss denotes the residual variance residual sum of square and tss is the total variance total sum of squares y 1 n n 1 n y is the mean of the observed values y indicates the predictions y indicates the observations and n indicates the number of observations from eq 20 it can be concluded that the closer the value is to 1 the better the simulation result rmse or standard deviation is calculated as follows 22 rmse 1 n n 1 n y n y n 2 it indicates the mean squared difference between the observed and predicted data reflects the degree of dispersion of a set of data and is particularly sensitive to outliers a smaller value indicated a better fit mae is calculated as follows 23 mae 1 n n 1 n y n y n it indicates the mean of the absolute error between the predicted and observed values and measures the average mode length of the error in the predicted values regardless of the direction the larger the error the larger the value 4 case study 4 1 study area and data all stations in the experiment were located in the upper stream of the yangtze river in china the runoff data from five neighboring hydrological stations upstream of yichang station and rainfall data from 27 rainfall stations were used as exogenous data the coordinates of each station and the watershed surface are shown in fig 5 with meteorological data from the yichang station including six groups of daily rainfall average temperature daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature average wind speed daily maximum wind speed etc a total of 38 groups of data may be related to the yichang station in terms of hydrological mechanism which implies the number of features is 38 and the target series is the runoff data from the yichang station these data cover a total of four decades from 1970 to 2009 with 14 610 sets of daily data 4 2 data pre processing 4 2 1 missing value processing missing data are considered to be completely random mcar missing completely at random which implies that the probability of missing data is completely independent of its hypothetical value and the values of other variables in this study the k nearest neighbor knn impute method troyanskaya et al 2001 was used the algorithm can be summarized as follows the k spatial nearest neighbor points are selected according to the euclidean distance metric and the distance weighted average of the k points represents the missing point estimate 4 2 2 data normalization to unify the magnitude of the features and order of magnitude of the values and eliminate the influence of units and scales among the features a minmax scaler normalization method was used to perform a linear transformation of the original data to map the results between 0 1 the transformation method is as follows 24 x i c x i c x min c x max c x min c where x i c is the normalized value x i c is the original value x min c is the minimum value of the c th feature and x max c is the maximum value of the c th feature 4 3 experiment setting five commonly used and considered effective feature selection algorithms were used for comparison in the experiments including the pearson correlation coefficient method liu et al 2022 mutual information coefficient method kraskov et al 2004 ross 2014 lasso regression method muthukrishnan and rohini 2016 random forest method huo et al 2021 and recursive feature elimination method guyon et al 2002 table 1 the performance of fam was tested on the original dataset and two constructed datasets comparison experiments were designed to compare the performance of fam and benchmark in which the learning module tested the generality of fam using four network structures ffn fcn lstm and bi gru the number of hidden layers for all learning modules was 2 and the number of hidden nodes was 16 to ensure that the experiments were implemented under the same conditions all experiments were divided into training and validation set in the ratio of 9 1 the training were performed by rolling the look back window of 30 with a step of 1 on all the data in the training set the number of training epochs was set to 60 the mse loss function is used and the adamw kingma and ba 2014 optimizer updates the parameters with decoupled weight decay regularization mechanism loshchilov and hutter 2017 where the weight decay coefficient λ in eq 19 is 0 01 the learning rate is scheduled by the cosine annealing warm restarts method loshchilov and hutter 2016 which has proven its effectiveness in runoff prediction liu et al 2022 with an initial learning rate of 0 01 to prevent a possible gradient explosion the training process was run with a maximum value of 10 for gradient clipping moreover all the models above were trained tested on a single nvidia rtx 3080 10 gb gpu it is worth noting that all the hyperparameters above are obtained by the bayesian optimization method of tuning snoek et al 2012 in addition all the models in this study were run 10 times under this experimental setting and the results are the average of multiple experiments 4 4 forecasting results the models were first validated on the original runoff dataset in terms of forecast accuracy under the condition of different forecasting tasks or learning modules which were in single or multi step forecasting or with different parametric learning modes l θ l the rmse mae and nse metrics of the forecast results are shown in table 2 table 3 and table 4 when fam and five benchmarks are applied to the daily runoff forecasts at yichang station where k is the number of selected features for the benchmark and the number of dimensionality after reduction for fam k n e 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 table 5 for all comparison experiments that is learning module in ffn fcn lstm bi gru and t in 1 7 and 10 it can be concluded that all three evaluation metrics of fam attain the optimum value the average percentage of their performance improvement is shown in where ratio m fam m benchmark m benchmark 100 m denotes the metrics values the formula takes when the indicator is nse which is expressed as an improvement compared with the benchmark fam method nse and will be taken when it is mae or rmse which is expressed as a decrease in mae or rmse bolded font are the maximum performance improvement of different learning modules at the same time step it can be noticed that the maximum decrease percentage of rmse and mae are 9 43 and 10 05 respectively whose learning modules are both bi gru the maximum improvement percentage of nse is 2 65 whose learning module is ffn which indicates that fam is more accurate and stable compared with the benchmark confirms fam s effectiveness in short term runoff forecasting tasks and shows the feasibility of available deep learning methods to be directly used in the fam learning module the gray underline shows the maximum performance improvement for the same learning module at different time steps and the four learning modules show the maximum improvement at t 10 t 1 t 1 10 and t 1 10 which suggests the generality of fam for the forecasting task that is it works for both single and multi step forecasting the changes in the nse are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figures the selection of the k value has less influence on fam compared with the benchmark and fam is more stable under different k values which implies that fam has lower parameter sensitivity observing the curve changes when the prediction step is 1 a significant decrease in benchmark performance with increasing k values can be found when the learning modules are fcn lstm and bi gru the main reason for this is that the five benchmark methods introduce a large number of redundant features when more features are included leading to degradation of the model generalization ability which is minimized by fam for the runoff prediction task the performance of the fam cannot be correlated with the k value the choice of the k value is related to the learning module and prediction horizon fig 8 a explains why the fcn is optimal for all feature selection methods at a prediction step of one from the perspective of the attention map as can be observed from the figure the fcn tends to push the feature weights to both ends of the distribution the darker the color in the figure the more the weights tend to be extreme or minimal which allows the network to compress the redundancy to a minimum and give more weight to the correlation information which is more differentiated thus enhancing the prediction accuracy this also confirms the superiority of the attention mechanism observing the other three the distribution of feature weights is more dispersed and thus the prediction accuracy is lower than that of the fcn to compare the performance difference between the fam and its two extensions in runoff prediction and to verify the role played by the skip connection and multi head attention mechanisms in practical studies the nse metrics of the three methods are shown in fig 7 the comparison reveals that the three methods do not differ significantly at t 1 namely in single step prediction but show a large disparity in multi step prediction such as t 7 and 10 when the learning module is ffn the fam mha res method has advantages and is more stable however for the other three learning modules the performance of the feature selection network with the addition of mha decreases and the accuracy fluctuates more the visualized feature weights are shown in fig 8 which explains the difference more intuitively and explores the influence of various factors on runoff it can be observed that fam assigns larger weights greater than 0 5 to only a few features most of the features are weighted below 0 2 which indicates that fam retains only some of the message whereas most of the feature information is filtered by dropping the weights which greatly reduces redundancy while retaining detailed information enhances the model generalization ability and improves prediction accuracy the fam mha res incorporates mha and skip connection as shown in fig 8 b this approach makes the weights more differentiated that is a few features are given large weights greater than 0 8 while there are also features with weights less than 0 1 which is more beneficial for distinguishing the features another noteworthy point is that as mentioned earlier the target sequence is also involved in the weight reconstruction after the addition of the mha and the attention module assigns a larger weight to the target sequence in almost all conditions the specific assignment of weights is directly related to the learning module 4 5 driving relationship this study adopts the ideas of wiegreffe and pinter 2019 that attention mechanism provides a basis for inquiry into the internals of the model as they produce an easy to understand feature state weighting and a reasonable reconstruction of the correlation between inputs and outputs in the attention layer and the decision process in this layer to assess the results of feature selection confirm the rationality of the selected features and incorporate a priori hydrological knowledge for possible mechanism discovery the driving relationship between feature factors and runoff changes was analyzed in this study feature correlation mechanism the distribution of the feature weights is shown in fig 9 the weights are normalized in the presentation to facilitate comparison and analysis all runoff related feature series were divided into three groups sub regional hydroelectric stations runoff series meteorological series and watershed rainfall series analysis of the relationship between each group of data and runoff formation showed that the strongest correlation was between watershed rainfall data and export runoff where precipitation events and conditions played a decisive role in runoff formation regardless of the forecast scale the precipitation region is equally critical as observed from the figure as the forecast step increases attention gradually shifts from proximal mainstem rainfall data s6 s7 s8 to proximal tributary rainfall data s9 s10 and then to distal rainfall data s16 s18 indicating that long term forecasts need to consider regional production of flow more and that historical rainfall requires a time cycle for runoff formation compared with precipitation river runoff exhibits strong time step correlation characteristics which have a major influence on inflow and is the most crucial influence in single step prediction whereas its influence is gradually smaller for multi step prediction precipitation is the main source of river runoff indicating the need to focus on potential flow production for longer forecast periods meteorological factors have the least influence on runoff among all meteorological data the most influential factors for short term forecasts are daily precipitation at the site and wind speed with daily precipitation directly or implicitly forming runoff and wind speed by affecting evapotranspiration which in turn is associated with runoff temporal attention pattern the lag period is an overwhelming factor in establishing the driving relationship between the historical feature series and the future runoff time series talei and chua 2012 the time dependence properties of the attention weights are illustrated in fig 10 where the time series attention mechanism can adaptively determine the hydrological meteorological and other feature series lag time periods and align the runoff series time steps the solid black line in it indicates the lag time and the length of the line represents the length of the time period it can be observed from the figure that such lag times may be different in runoff formation events due to different factors such as initial soil moisture rainfall intensity and climatic influence while rainfall data lag time meteorological influence lag time and streamflow lag time are also different the length of the prediction period is also one of the possible influencing factors in terms of the time dimension the model attends more on the long range rainfall series when horizon is 1 s6 s7 s8 time step 1 with the greatest attention weight which is related to the narrow shape of the region and long rainfall formation confluence analyzing several rainfall sequences the lag time of rainfall stations nearer s6 is shorter than that of distant points s7 s8 which is also consistent with the confluence mechanism for the basin site historical flow sequences the lag time is shorter when the horizon is 1 peak occurs at time steps 10 and time steps 30 compared with a longer lag time when horizon 10 attention weighting is greatest at time steps 1 sequences showed different temporal correlations in single step and multi step forecasts with attention weights increasing with time in single step forecasts and decreasing in multi step forecasts which may be related to the water flow propagation pattern meteorological factors such as wind speed affect runoff only in short periods the above mentioned properties further corroborate that the fam method can adaptively extract time dependence the adjustment of attention is coherent with the hydrological concept further illustrating the effectiveness of the fam method applied to hydrological time series 4 6 noise experiment results the awgn dataset was created using the raw dataset of runoff data by adding additive white gaussian noise whereas the cawgn dataset concatenated the raw and awgn data a signal to noise ratio snr of 20 db was used to construct a noisy dataset basu et al 2017 which emulates significant background clutter the change in the dataset before and after adding noise is shown in fig 12 where it can be observed that the noise completely changes the data distribution the performances of the three attention modules on the raw awgn and cawgn datasets are shown in detail in table 6 table 7 and table 8 for the awgn dataset fam mha was the most affected with a large drop in its performance the mae metric decreased the most with an average drop of 13 5 and 8 77 at t 7 and 10 respectively while the corresponding nse metrics decreased by 2 59 and 2 55 respectively indicating that the degree of fit of the prediction model decreased less while the degree of variability of the data increased significantly no significant decrease was observed in the mae metrics for fam and fam mha res with a maximum reduction of 1 31 t 1 for the cawgn dataset fam showed a larger decline in both the rmse and mae metrics 5 34 and 4 24 at t 1 respectively whereas for fam mha and fam mha res this metric did not decrease to compare the performance differences between the three datasets more visually fig 11 shows a comparison of the nse metrics as observed from the figure the three fam methods are equally effective on various noisy datasets the average nse of fam and fam mha res does not change significantly after adding noise the fam mha method has a small reduction in prediction accuracy in multi step prediction the degree of data variation of the fam method is unchanged and the error of fam mha and fam mha res data increases the above mentioned data results show that fam and its variants have good noise immunity performance and that autoregression has a greater impact on the prediction results confirming the necessity of using the skip connection therefore the effectiveness of the fam method as defined by effrosynidis and arampatzis 2021 is insensitive to the implemented dataset which indicates the robustness of the fam method suggesting that the effectiveness of the fam method can be generalized across datasets to visualize the differences in the prediction results and the reasons for the decrease in the metrics fig 13 shows the prediction data when the horizon is 1 with fam applied to the cawgn dataset as an example together with fig 12 it can be seen that the prediction results are better in the zone with concentrated distribution of observations while the predictions are worse in the region at the tail of the distribution which increases the distance between the spatial distribution of predicted and observed thus the performance of the rmse and mae metrics becomes worse 5 conclusion to extract runoff correlation features improve the accuracy of short term runoff forecasting enhance the noise resistance of the model and make the model applicable to various conditions a feature attention mechanism model is proposed in this study this method converts the feature selection problem into a binary classification problem by combining a network to extract inter feature correlations and update feature weights through a learning module the model was successfully applied to a practical short term runoff prediction task in the upper yangtze river basin china to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the model three evaluation metrics rmse mae and nse and four learning modules ffn fcn lstm and bi gru were employed and compared with the five methods to test the model performance the advantages of this method are evident first the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces redundancy enhances model generalization and achieves higher accuracy in single and multi step prediction compared with other methods furthermore by visualizing the process of attention shifting this method achieves a reasonable time dependence and feature aggregation in addition experiments on two constructed noisy datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the model applied to noisy data which is known as model robustness allowing it to be generalized to more application scenarios however this method has limitations limited by the data driven characteristics of the deep learning process the attention distribution cannot fully explain the physical mechanism of the runoff process influenced by other correlation factors from further research directions it is essential to explain each influencing factor in terms of the mechanism of action considering the constraints of the physical process in the data driven model credit authorship contribution statement hao wang writing original

2241,the interaction between hydrological factors is complex and the correlation effects cannot be quantitatively explained from a mechanistic perspective the extraction of effective features from several hydrological and meteorological data and quantifying their correlation effects to make runoff prediction more accurate and stable is an urgent problem to be solved in this study we introduce a structural paradigm for hydrological time series to handle the entire feature space composed of some feature sequences based on deep learning methods namely the feature attention mechanism this method transforms the problem of feature target association into multiple parallel binary classification problems and assigns attention units to each specific feature in the network the attention distribution was adjusted by updating the neural network parameters in a supervised manner to generate feature weightings in addition two extensions were proposed based on the initial network structure the three methods were used in a practical study of the upper yangtze river basin using three evaluation metrics compared with five benchmark methods the mean metric values were improved by up to 9 43 10 05 and 2 65 respectively meanwhile with the characteristics of hydrological data the rationality of the method is corroborated in hydrological feature discovery and time series dependence extraction moreover we tested the performance of the model on two constructed noise datasets to demonstrate its robustness the results of all the above experiments show that the attention module significantly improves the learning and generalization ability enhances noise resistance and strengthens the robustness of the model compared with the traditional method abbreviations am

learning feature attention mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resources are receiving increasing attention as renewable energy sources runoff prediction is an important part of water resource planning and management for reservoir operation and dam scheduling liu et al 2019 yeh 1985 and flood safety disaster prevention and mitigation as monitoring technology matures an increasing amount of data is available however the relationship between hydrological factors is difficult to quantify the hydrological mechanism remains unclear making it difficult to determine what information is input into the model to obtain better prediction results beven et al 1984 liu et al 2023 in addition fluctuations in hydrological data and various possible perturbations are important issues to be considered fazel et al 2015 lin et al 2021 recently deep learning models and methods have been successfully applied in hydrology achieving remarkable outcomes in hydrological prediction tasks kratzert et al 2021 chen et al 2020 developed self attentive long short term memory sa lstm for modeling short term time dependence based on lstm and considering short lag times the model was evaluated on eight runoff datasets the results showed that the model achieved the best performance compared with other baseline results chen et al 2022b applied iot techniques and proposed an attention mechanism for bidirectional gated recursive units to adjust the match between the input features and outputs their model produced better flood predictions than lstm chen et al 2022a combined a convolutional neural network cnn with lstm and proposed convolutional lstm convlstm to extract spatiotemporal features of hydrological information the prediction results were within the standard flood prediction permit errors it attained the optimum value in the method comparison liu et al 2022 combined the snapshot and attention ensembles to propose a deep learning multi model ensemble method to improve runoff prediction performance multiple evaluation metrics were used for comparison with the baseline model the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method the feature selection mechanism as a pre processing step for the model input data plays a crucial role in improving the prediction results by focusing on extracting useful information from a large amount of otherwise meaningless or undefined correlation data bolón canedo et al 2015 there are various techniques of feature processing and combining existing methods with deep learning based feature selection methods is emerging to adapt to the challenges posed by data growth zou et al 2015 proposed a supervised learning method based on deep belief networks to filter features by reconstruction error ranking chen et al 2017 achieved semi supervised feature selection using a projection matrix to rank features however all of the above methods apply to supervised targets of discrete variables and do not apply to time series prediction tasks zhang et al 2021 characterized feature selection as the effect of the selected combination of multiple input variables on model prediction yu and liu 2004 analyzed the effectiveness of feature selection from two perspectives relevance and redundancy and decoupled the two aspects however these methods are limited to selecting a subset of features and reducing the number of features without considering the information bias caused by reducing the feature dimension the attention mechanism is an emerging topic in deep learning the attention mechanism has been widely used in various research areas such as the natural language processing devlin et al 2018 he et al 2021 image analysis guo et al 2022 hu et al 2018 recommender systems xiao et al 2017 and time series analysis liu et al 2021 wen et al 2019 and has shown its powerful performance the attention mechanism is inspired by human visual attention which obtains the target area that needs to be focused on and then devotes more attention resources to this area to obtain more detailed information related to the target while ignoring other irrelevant information by introducing an attention mechanism to concentrate on the information that is more critical to the current task among many input information and reduce the attention to other information or filter out irrelevant information the information overload problem can be solved and the efficiency and accuracy of the neural network can be improved the attention generation process is similar to that of feature selection furthermore it has been shown that feature components with small contributions may often contain important information about sample differences di mauro et al 2021 which suggests that they may be more useful for differentiating samples but for previous methods these features were discarded another problem is that most feature selection methods are less robust based on evaluation studies of effrosynidis and arampatzis 2021 which implies that they are not resistant to interference and are not generalized applications to solve the above two problems simultaneously and inspired by the attention mechanism a feature selection model based on the attention mechanism is proposed which proceeds from the intrinsic issue of feature selection and describes the feature selection problem as a problem of selecting or not selecting a given feature and the probability of selection thus converting the previous discrete 0 1 subset selection problem the process of selecting a subset is 1 and not selecting is 0 into a continuous relevance distribution problem probability values between 0 and 1 this model assigns separate attention networks to each feature the method in this study takes all the feature inputs and reconstructs them through the feature attention network instead of treating feature engineering as pre processing of the input model which is often a subset of the feature space the proposed method can handle the entire space in such a manner that the input sequence maintains its original shape including the length and number of time series after passing through the feature selection module this study concentrated on short term runoff predictions the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 introduced a feature processing paradigm applied this paradigm to time series and developed a feature selection model for processing hydrological time series namely a model based on the feature attention mechanism 2 the dependence of the two dimensions of feature correlations and temporal patterns in the hydrological time series feature selection task is explained in conjunction with the adaptive feature weight distribution of the model 3 two methods for constructing noisy datasets were proposed to test the robustness of the model and apply them to practical datasets the performance of the model is validated 4 the accuracy and generality of the model are demonstrated and compared with those of the baseline model generality involves two aspects the first is that it applies to single step prediction while multi step prediction can also achieve high accuracy and the other is that it is appropriate for common datasets as well as noisy datasets achieving generalization on datasets that is model robustness the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the notations used in this study and the basic tasks section 3 introduces the feature processing method based on the attention mechanism two extensions and the model evaluation method section 4 describes the study area data preprocessing and experimental setup and analyzes the experimental results and discussion finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 problem formulation in this study the time series to be processed was a sequence of actual observations with continuous time stamps with an identical interval length the observations for the historical target time series are denoted as y 1 y 2 y t 1 with y t 1 r whereas the driving exogenous series is x 1 x 2 x t 1 with x t 1 r n which is assumed to be correlated with the target series in time series forecasting tasks a window of a given length of look back driven series window x x 1 t x 2 t x c t t 1 l with x r l c and target series window y y t t 1 l with y r l where l is the size of the window and c is the number of features is typically used to predict a fixed length of future series the corresponding prediction is denoted as y f y t t l 1 l t whereas the ground truth is y y t t l 1 l t where t is the size of the forecasting horizon the time series forecasting model aims to learn the mapping function f in y f f x y 3 methodology in this section the overall architecture of the proposed method namely the feature attention machine fam and the structure of each part are illustrated and analyzed two extensions were introduced in the base method the details of each method are provided in the following subsections 3 1 overall architecture similar to embedded methods our proposed fam architecture integrates feature selection into the overall model learning process as shown in fig 1 the fam is designed with a loosely coupled structure that contains two main modules the attention module and the learning module the data input to the model first passes through the attention module which computes the weights assigned to all features and outputs the weighted feature matrix the process called the feature weighting cai et al 2018 the learning module can be regarded as a process that solves the optimization problem to find the best fit between the reconstructed features and the supervised target the overall model connects the supervised target with the input features using back propagation mechanism and continuously updates the feature weights during the training process until it reaches the set fitting state furthermore benefitting from fam s detachable structural design the learning modules can be individually customized to match the corresponding tasks to achieve ideal results the attention and learning modules together construct the correlations that best describe the relationship between the target and features gui et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the method does not change the shape of the original input data as shown in the fig 2 3 2 attention module feature selection is performed by extracting common attributes or trends from several data instances for each feature there are only two states selected or not which indicate whether the feature is relevant to the supervised target the relevance is represented by the probability of selection in this way the feature selection problem is translated into a binary classification problem that is whether the current feature should be selected for a specific supervised target the feature weights are then derived from the distribution of selection patterns this section describes in detail the theoretical method of the attention module and the process of its construction and proposes two essential extensions based on it 3 2 1 basic structure of fam as shown in fig 1 the input data first passes through the embedding layer to extract the intrinsic correlation information and reduce data dimensionality for time series forecasting tasks where there are no prior assumptions on data structural properties and the correspondence between the input data and the target series is unknown a linear layer is usually used 1 e x w e t b e where w e r n e c and b e r n e are learnable parameters that represent weights and biases respectively the number of output units in the embedding layer with dimension n e is a hyperparameter that can be resized according to the requirements of specific tasks generally n e c which on the one hand compresses the original feature space into smaller vectors whereas the original features are represented as their linear combinations ueda 2000 thus retaining the vast majority of the information the introduced activation layer is expressed as follows 2 e t a n h e which is capable of converting linear projections to nonlinear projections while the zero mean and bounded nature of tanh allows it to retain both positive and negative values while limiting outliers which enables it to retain important information while suppressing individual noise during extraction the typical soft attention mechanism bahdanau et al 2014 first generates the attention distribution of all inputs and later calculates the weighted average over all input data dimensions based on the attention distribution in this study this approach was not used because first the softmax used directly assigns small weights to most of the features when its dimension is high which will lose the detailed part of the entire feature space while causing the features to be less discriminative furthermore when there are outliers or noisy data the dimensions in which these data are located may be incorrectly assigned larger weights rendering the model unstable and decreasing the noise immunity performance another problem is that the process of determining the attention distribution is computationally intensive for high dimensional data a novel soft attention mechanism is proposed inspired by the binary classification unler and murat 2010 approach we assigned separate attention units to each feature dimension instead of determining the distributions for all features or creating a subset of all features these shallow attentions generate bernoulli distributions of the current features that is selected or unselected states namely parallel attention cell for the c th feature the selected and unselected values denoted as s c and u c are each given by the following scoring functions 3 s c h e w s c b s c u c h e w u c b u c in practice to simplify the calculation the above formulas can be merged as 4 s c u c h e w c t b c where h e is the hidden layer output as the input for each attention unit w c r 2 n e and b c r 2 represents the learnable weights and bias parameters respectively softmax is then used to map the scores into feature attention distributions in which we focus only on the probability of being selected 5 a c s o f t m a x s c u c exp s c exp s c exp u c which is the output of the c th cell finally the output of all feature attention cells is stacked to form the attention map that is a a c c 1 c with a r l c the output weighted feature z of the attention module was obtained as follows 6 z x a where denotes the element wise multiplication when all parameters in the attention module are represented as θ a the feature attention process is as follows 7 z z θ a x the characteristics of the model are as follows first feature weighing is generated by parallel attention cells which greatly simplifies the computation and reduces the computational cost moreover the joint work of the embedding layer and tanh activation removes redundant features and enhances the stability of the feature selection finally the introduction of softmax can prevent gradient explosion and accelerate the convergence of the training process 3 2 2 two extensions of fam the embedding and activation layers have a simple structure and are easy to train however using them only to extract the correlation information between features may not be sufficient to preserve all the important messages as much as possible while extracting the correlation between features we introduce multi head attention mha to pre extract correlations between features which are later input to the embedding layer noting that historical observations of the target sequence are also input to the attention module at the same time the mha is based on scaled dot product attention to compute the self attention of the input this attention mechanism can be described as mapping a query and a set of key value pairs to the output where the key value pairs represent the input information the key is used to compute the attention distribution while the value is used to compute the aggregated information the output is calculated as a weighted sum of values where the weight assigned to each value is calculated using the similarity function between the query and the corresponding key note that the query key value and output are vectors in general the similarity function is expressed as 8 scor e i s i m i l a r i t y q u e r y k e y i and attention mechanism 9 attn q k v i 1 n softmax s c o r e i v a l u e i where q k and v stand for the query key and value matrix respectively the above equation shows the process of calculating the weights for scaled dot product attention the similarity is measured in multiplicative form and multiplied by a scaling factor 1 d k which can be further expressed as 10 attn q k v s o f t m a x queryke y t d k v a l u e mha divides the key value pairs into h subspaces and performs the attention function in parallel to yield d v dimensional output values and the projections of all subspaces are concatenated and projected again to obtain the final output vaswani et al 2017 expressed as follows 11 h i a t t n q w i q t k w i k t v w i v t mha q k v c a t h 1 h h w o t where d q d k and d v respectively represent the dimensions of query key and value and the cat function means concatenating all elements in this study it is given that 12 d q d k d v c 1 q k v x y after adding mha eqs 6 and 7 is expressed as 13 z x y c a t x y a 14 z x y z θ a x y self attention quantifies the interdependence between the input elements of the mechanism this mechanism allows the inputs to interact with each other self and determines what they should pay more attention to de santana correia and colombini 2022 in addition the introduced multi headed attention allows the model to focus on the representation correlation between different features in diverse subspaces which provides a further step to extract the correlation between features instead of just the correlation between exogenous sequences and target sequences however the problem that still exists is that the target sequences are input into the mha together first the autoregression that may be brought is destroyed because only a part of the information carried by the target sequence after the compression of the embedding layer represents the autoregressive property of the target sequence next owing to the use of softmax in the mha network to obtain the nonlinearity when the dot product is large it will cause the network to fall into the region of small gradients which causes the gradient vanishing problem for which we further introduce the residual connection orhan and pitkow 2017 the residual skip connection consists of two parts the first simulates the residual network following the mha layer normalization ba et al 2016 is performed 15 m l a y e r n o r m mha x y c a t x y the other is the skip connection to the target sequence 16 z y z θ a y y 17 z x y c a t z y z θ a x fig 3 shows the architecture of the residual fam with multi head attention 3 2 3 difference between the three methods in essence from generating the feature distribution the attention module in fam does not deal with the target sequence but learns the temporal patterns of the target sequence through the learning module in the process of updating the parameters in feature distribution it can be considered that the feature weight of the target sequence is 1 which is the way of dealing with the target sequence used in most of the previous time series forecasting tasks fam mha incorporates the target sequence into the attention module by introducing a multi headed attention layer and feeds the target sequence into the learning module after simultaneous processing with the feature sequence which has the same feature weight range and between 0 1 as the other sequences unlike other tasks the time series forecasting task is related to exogenous data and the autoregression of the target sequence is important this study intends to enable the attention module to achieve autocorrelation discovery and information aggregation through this process after adding the res mechanism the attention module converges to the above two mechanisms and the feature weights of the target sequence can be considered to be between 1 2 the differences between these three methods for processing data and yielding feature distributions are shown in fig 4 3 2 4 parameter initialization a truncated normal distribution initialization was used in this study to initialize the parameters of the attention module truncated distributions barr and sherrill 1999 thompson 1950 were employed to restrict the range of initial parameters all initialization parameters were drawn from the normal distribution n m e a n s t d 2 and values taken outside the interval a b were redrawn until they fell into the bounded range 3 3 learning module the learning module learns the parameters using a neural network through a back propagation mechanism to generate and update the feature weight matrix which can be expressed as y f l θ l z which in conjunction with the attention module and can be further expressed as 18 y f l θ l z θ a x y the learning process can be considered as the process of solving the objective function 19 argmin a l o s s y f y λ r θ where θ θ a θ l λ denotes the weight decay and r denotes the regularization function which can speed up the convergence and avoid possible overfitting for a specific learning task the learning module can be structured using the most appropriate network to obtain an optimal fit the most popular networks currently include deep neural networks dnns convolutional neural networks cnns and recurrent neural networks rnns and their variants the effectiveness of these off the shelf models that can be used as learning modules has been recognized by the deep learning community yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the representative ones including the feed forward network cheng et al 2020 fully convolutional network long et al 2015 perslev et al 2019 long and short term memory network liu et al 2022 and bi directional gated recurrent unit gao et al 2020 have been used extensively in time series forecasting 3 4 method evaluation metrics three evaluation metrics were adopted in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae all metrics were calculated for each prediction window and iterated through the entire dataset nse is used to quantitatively verify the performance of model simulation results and is particularly applicable to hydrological models it is calculated as 20 nse 1 rss tss 21 rss n 1 n y n y n 2 tss n 1 n y n y 2 where rss denotes the residual variance residual sum of square and tss is the total variance total sum of squares y 1 n n 1 n y is the mean of the observed values y indicates the predictions y indicates the observations and n indicates the number of observations from eq 20 it can be concluded that the closer the value is to 1 the better the simulation result rmse or standard deviation is calculated as follows 22 rmse 1 n n 1 n y n y n 2 it indicates the mean squared difference between the observed and predicted data reflects the degree of dispersion of a set of data and is particularly sensitive to outliers a smaller value indicated a better fit mae is calculated as follows 23 mae 1 n n 1 n y n y n it indicates the mean of the absolute error between the predicted and observed values and measures the average mode length of the error in the predicted values regardless of the direction the larger the error the larger the value 4 case study 4 1 study area and data all stations in the experiment were located in the upper stream of the yangtze river in china the runoff data from five neighboring hydrological stations upstream of yichang station and rainfall data from 27 rainfall stations were used as exogenous data the coordinates of each station and the watershed surface are shown in fig 5 with meteorological data from the yichang station including six groups of daily rainfall average temperature daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature average wind speed daily maximum wind speed etc a total of 38 groups of data may be related to the yichang station in terms of hydrological mechanism which implies the number of features is 38 and the target series is the runoff data from the yichang station these data cover a total of four decades from 1970 to 2009 with 14 610 sets of daily data 4 2 data pre processing 4 2 1 missing value processing missing data are considered to be completely random mcar missing completely at random which implies that the probability of missing data is completely independent of its hypothetical value and the values of other variables in this study the k nearest neighbor knn impute method troyanskaya et al 2001 was used the algorithm can be summarized as follows the k spatial nearest neighbor points are selected according to the euclidean distance metric and the distance weighted average of the k points represents the missing point estimate 4 2 2 data normalization to unify the magnitude of the features and order of magnitude of the values and eliminate the influence of units and scales among the features a minmax scaler normalization method was used to perform a linear transformation of the original data to map the results between 0 1 the transformation method is as follows 24 x i c x i c x min c x max c x min c where x i c is the normalized value x i c is the original value x min c is the minimum value of the c th feature and x max c is the maximum value of the c th feature 4 3 experiment setting five commonly used and considered effective feature selection algorithms were used for comparison in the experiments including the pearson correlation coefficient method liu et al 2022 mutual information coefficient method kraskov et al 2004 ross 2014 lasso regression method muthukrishnan and rohini 2016 random forest method huo et al 2021 and recursive feature elimination method guyon et al 2002 table 1 the performance of fam was tested on the original dataset and two constructed datasets comparison experiments were designed to compare the performance of fam and benchmark in which the learning module tested the generality of fam using four network structures ffn fcn lstm and bi gru the number of hidden layers for all learning modules was 2 and the number of hidden nodes was 16 to ensure that the experiments were implemented under the same conditions all experiments were divided into training and validation set in the ratio of 9 1 the training were performed by rolling the look back window of 30 with a step of 1 on all the data in the training set the number of training epochs was set to 60 the mse loss function is used and the adamw kingma and ba 2014 optimizer updates the parameters with decoupled weight decay regularization mechanism loshchilov and hutter 2017 where the weight decay coefficient λ in eq 19 is 0 01 the learning rate is scheduled by the cosine annealing warm restarts method loshchilov and hutter 2016 which has proven its effectiveness in runoff prediction liu et al 2022 with an initial learning rate of 0 01 to prevent a possible gradient explosion the training process was run with a maximum value of 10 for gradient clipping moreover all the models above were trained tested on a single nvidia rtx 3080 10 gb gpu it is worth noting that all the hyperparameters above are obtained by the bayesian optimization method of tuning snoek et al 2012 in addition all the models in this study were run 10 times under this experimental setting and the results are the average of multiple experiments 4 4 forecasting results the models were first validated on the original runoff dataset in terms of forecast accuracy under the condition of different forecasting tasks or learning modules which were in single or multi step forecasting or with different parametric learning modes l θ l the rmse mae and nse metrics of the forecast results are shown in table 2 table 3 and table 4 when fam and five benchmarks are applied to the daily runoff forecasts at yichang station where k is the number of selected features for the benchmark and the number of dimensionality after reduction for fam k n e 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 table 5 for all comparison experiments that is learning module in ffn fcn lstm bi gru and t in 1 7 and 10 it can be concluded that all three evaluation metrics of fam attain the optimum value the average percentage of their performance improvement is shown in where ratio m fam m benchmark m benchmark 100 m denotes the metrics values the formula takes when the indicator is nse which is expressed as an improvement compared with the benchmark fam method nse and will be taken when it is mae or rmse which is expressed as a decrease in mae or rmse bolded font are the maximum performance improvement of different learning modules at the same time step it can be noticed that the maximum decrease percentage of rmse and mae are 9 43 and 10 05 respectively whose learning modules are both bi gru the maximum improvement percentage of nse is 2 65 whose learning module is ffn which indicates that fam is more accurate and stable compared with the benchmark confirms fam s effectiveness in short term runoff forecasting tasks and shows the feasibility of available deep learning methods to be directly used in the fam learning module the gray underline shows the maximum performance improvement for the same learning module at different time steps and the four learning modules show the maximum improvement at t 10 t 1 t 1 10 and t 1 10 which suggests the generality of fam for the forecasting task that is it works for both single and multi step forecasting the changes in the nse are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figures the selection of the k value has less influence on fam compared with the benchmark and fam is more stable under different k values which implies that fam has lower parameter sensitivity observing the curve changes when the prediction step is 1 a significant decrease in benchmark performance with increasing k values can be found when the learning modules are fcn lstm and bi gru the main reason for this is that the five benchmark methods introduce a large number of redundant features when more features are included leading to degradation of the model generalization ability which is minimized by fam for the runoff prediction task the performance of the fam cannot be correlated with the k value the choice of the k value is related to the learning module and prediction horizon fig 8 a explains why the fcn is optimal for all feature selection methods at a prediction step of one from the perspective of the attention map as can be observed from the figure the fcn tends to push the feature weights to both ends of the distribution the darker the color in the figure the more the weights tend to be extreme or minimal which allows the network to compress the redundancy to a minimum and give more weight to the correlation information which is more differentiated thus enhancing the prediction accuracy this also confirms the superiority of the attention mechanism observing the other three the distribution of feature weights is more dispersed and thus the prediction accuracy is lower than that of the fcn to compare the performance difference between the fam and its two extensions in runoff prediction and to verify the role played by the skip connection and multi head attention mechanisms in practical studies the nse metrics of the three methods are shown in fig 7 the comparison reveals that the three methods do not differ significantly at t 1 namely in single step prediction but show a large disparity in multi step prediction such as t 7 and 10 when the learning module is ffn the fam mha res method has advantages and is more stable however for the other three learning modules the performance of the feature selection network with the addition of mha decreases and the accuracy fluctuates more the visualized feature weights are shown in fig 8 which explains the difference more intuitively and explores the influence of various factors on runoff it can be observed that fam assigns larger weights greater than 0 5 to only a few features most of the features are weighted below 0 2 which indicates that fam retains only some of the message whereas most of the feature information is filtered by dropping the weights which greatly reduces redundancy while retaining detailed information enhances the model generalization ability and improves prediction accuracy the fam mha res incorporates mha and skip connection as shown in fig 8 b this approach makes the weights more differentiated that is a few features are given large weights greater than 0 8 while there are also features with weights less than 0 1 which is more beneficial for distinguishing the features another noteworthy point is that as mentioned earlier the target sequence is also involved in the weight reconstruction after the addition of the mha and the attention module assigns a larger weight to the target sequence in almost all conditions the specific assignment of weights is directly related to the learning module 4 5 driving relationship this study adopts the ideas of wiegreffe and pinter 2019 that attention mechanism provides a basis for inquiry into the internals of the model as they produce an easy to understand feature state weighting and a reasonable reconstruction of the correlation between inputs and outputs in the attention layer and the decision process in this layer to assess the results of feature selection confirm the rationality of the selected features and incorporate a priori hydrological knowledge for possible mechanism discovery the driving relationship between feature factors and runoff changes was analyzed in this study feature correlation mechanism the distribution of the feature weights is shown in fig 9 the weights are normalized in the presentation to facilitate comparison and analysis all runoff related feature series were divided into three groups sub regional hydroelectric stations runoff series meteorological series and watershed rainfall series analysis of the relationship between each group of data and runoff formation showed that the strongest correlation was between watershed rainfall data and export runoff where precipitation events and conditions played a decisive role in runoff formation regardless of the forecast scale the precipitation region is equally critical as observed from the figure as the forecast step increases attention gradually shifts from proximal mainstem rainfall data s6 s7 s8 to proximal tributary rainfall data s9 s10 and then to distal rainfall data s16 s18 indicating that long term forecasts need to consider regional production of flow more and that historical rainfall requires a time cycle for runoff formation compared with precipitation river runoff exhibits strong time step correlation characteristics which have a major influence on inflow and is the most crucial influence in single step prediction whereas its influence is gradually smaller for multi step prediction precipitation is the main source of river runoff indicating the need to focus on potential flow production for longer forecast periods meteorological factors have the least influence on runoff among all meteorological data the most influential factors for short term forecasts are daily precipitation at the site and wind speed with daily precipitation directly or implicitly forming runoff and wind speed by affecting evapotranspiration which in turn is associated with runoff temporal attention pattern the lag period is an overwhelming factor in establishing the driving relationship between the historical feature series and the future runoff time series talei and chua 2012 the time dependence properties of the attention weights are illustrated in fig 10 where the time series attention mechanism can adaptively determine the hydrological meteorological and other feature series lag time periods and align the runoff series time steps the solid black line in it indicates the lag time and the length of the line represents the length of the time period it can be observed from the figure that such lag times may be different in runoff formation events due to different factors such as initial soil moisture rainfall intensity and climatic influence while rainfall data lag time meteorological influence lag time and streamflow lag time are also different the length of the prediction period is also one of the possible influencing factors in terms of the time dimension the model attends more on the long range rainfall series when horizon is 1 s6 s7 s8 time step 1 with the greatest attention weight which is related to the narrow shape of the region and long rainfall formation confluence analyzing several rainfall sequences the lag time of rainfall stations nearer s6 is shorter than that of distant points s7 s8 which is also consistent with the confluence mechanism for the basin site historical flow sequences the lag time is shorter when the horizon is 1 peak occurs at time steps 10 and time steps 30 compared with a longer lag time when horizon 10 attention weighting is greatest at time steps 1 sequences showed different temporal correlations in single step and multi step forecasts with attention weights increasing with time in single step forecasts and decreasing in multi step forecasts which may be related to the water flow propagation pattern meteorological factors such as wind speed affect runoff only in short periods the above mentioned properties further corroborate that the fam method can adaptively extract time dependence the adjustment of attention is coherent with the hydrological concept further illustrating the effectiveness of the fam method applied to hydrological time series 4 6 noise experiment results the awgn dataset was created using the raw dataset of runoff data by adding additive white gaussian noise whereas the cawgn dataset concatenated the raw and awgn data a signal to noise ratio snr of 20 db was used to construct a noisy dataset basu et al 2017 which emulates significant background clutter the change in the dataset before and after adding noise is shown in fig 12 where it can be observed that the noise completely changes the data distribution the performances of the three attention modules on the raw awgn and cawgn datasets are shown in detail in table 6 table 7 and table 8 for the awgn dataset fam mha was the most affected with a large drop in its performance the mae metric decreased the most with an average drop of 13 5 and 8 77 at t 7 and 10 respectively while the corresponding nse metrics decreased by 2 59 and 2 55 respectively indicating that the degree of fit of the prediction model decreased less while the degree of variability of the data increased significantly no significant decrease was observed in the mae metrics for fam and fam mha res with a maximum reduction of 1 31 t 1 for the cawgn dataset fam showed a larger decline in both the rmse and mae metrics 5 34 and 4 24 at t 1 respectively whereas for fam mha and fam mha res this metric did not decrease to compare the performance differences between the three datasets more visually fig 11 shows a comparison of the nse metrics as observed from the figure the three fam methods are equally effective on various noisy datasets the average nse of fam and fam mha res does not change significantly after adding noise the fam mha method has a small reduction in prediction accuracy in multi step prediction the degree of data variation of the fam method is unchanged and the error of fam mha and fam mha res data increases the above mentioned data results show that fam and its variants have good noise immunity performance and that autoregression has a greater impact on the prediction results confirming the necessity of using the skip connection therefore the effectiveness of the fam method as defined by effrosynidis and arampatzis 2021 is insensitive to the implemented dataset which indicates the robustness of the fam method suggesting that the effectiveness of the fam method can be generalized across datasets to visualize the differences in the prediction results and the reasons for the decrease in the metrics fig 13 shows the prediction data when the horizon is 1 with fam applied to the cawgn dataset as an example together with fig 12 it can be seen that the prediction results are better in the zone with concentrated distribution of observations while the predictions are worse in the region at the tail of the distribution which increases the distance between the spatial distribution of predicted and observed thus the performance of the rmse and mae metrics becomes worse 5 conclusion to extract runoff correlation features improve the accuracy of short term runoff forecasting enhance the noise resistance of the model and make the model applicable to various conditions a feature attention mechanism model is proposed in this study this method converts the feature selection problem into a binary classification problem by combining a network to extract inter feature correlations and update feature weights through a learning module the model was successfully applied to a practical short term runoff prediction task in the upper yangtze river basin china to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the model three evaluation metrics rmse mae and nse and four learning modules ffn fcn lstm and bi gru were employed and compared with the five methods to test the model performance the advantages of this method are evident first the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces redundancy enhances model generalization and achieves higher accuracy in single and multi step prediction compared with other methods furthermore by visualizing the process of attention shifting this method achieves a reasonable time dependence and feature aggregation in addition experiments on two constructed noisy datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the model applied to noisy data which is known as model robustness allowing it to be generalized to more application scenarios however this method has limitations limited by the data driven characteristics of the deep learning process the attention distribution cannot fully explain the physical mechanism of the runoff process influenced by other correlation factors from further research directions it is essential to explain each influencing factor in terms of the mechanism of action considering the constraints of the physical process in the data driven model credit authorship contribution statement hao wang writing original

2242,global climate change and reservoir regulations can alter the natural flow of rivers influenced by these two drivers flood sequences may no longer satisfy the assumption of stationary thereby making it difficult to accurately analysis flood frequency and to design water conservancy projects therefore it is of great significance to analyse the non stationary frequency of flood sequences in a changing environment in this study we proposed a method for conducting nonstationary flood frequency analysis caused by cascade reservoirs as well as the low frequency climate indices the proposed non stationary model 2 with the explanatory variables of climate indices and modified reservoir index mri was compared with the traditional stationary model and the widely used non stationary model 1 with time as the explanatory variable the study was conducted at six hydrological stations in the main stream and tributaries of the upper reaches of the yangtze river in china considered as the three gorges reservoir area the results of the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss showed that the akaike information criterion and bayesian information criterion values of the proposed non stationary model method 2 are smaller than those of the two comparison models when the low frequency south oscillation index is high or the arctic oscillation and north pacific oscillation are low the stationary model underestimates the design value of flood quantiles compared with the non stationary model 2 compared with the non stationary model 1 the mri and low frequency climate indices as the explanatory variables in model 2 can better describe the non stationary characteristics of flood frequency and amplitude in addition the non stationary model considering external physical factors can provide better prediction of future design flood compared with two traditional models keywords flood low frequency climate index modified reservoir index non stationarity

great significance for flood control management of river courses and water conservancy projects bates et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 traditional flood frequency analysis is usually based on the stationary assumption namely the sample sequence needs to satisfy the independent and identical distribution assumption madsen 2007 in recent years under the dual effects of global climate change and human activities on the environment numerous studies milly et al 2008 zhang et al 2015a sun et al 2018a lu et al 2020 have shown that the stationarity of hydrological process is dead the sixth ipcc assessment report ar6 ipcc 2021 indicates that low levels of global warming will also aggravate changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events climate change and land use change have changed the existing hydrological stationary laws jiang et al 2021 2022 and the frequency of extreme flood disasters will change with climate warming therefore non stationary flood frequency analysis is an important prerequisite to ensure the rationality of hydrological frequency analysis and calculation results the two most commonly used methods for flood frequency analysis in changing environments are the backward or forward restoration method and the time varying moment method liang et al 2012 the backward or forward restoration method considers that the non stationary hydrological sequence comprises deterministic components non stationary components and random components stationary components after removing the deterministic components using the backward or forward restoration method the original sequence is converted into a stationary sequence and the sequence is then analysed using the method based on the stationary assumption the time varying moment method was first used in hydrological statistics by strupczewski et al 2001a 2001b and strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 it can directly embed linear and non linear functions into the extreme flood sequence distribution to describe the non stationary characteristics of the hydrological sequence thereby directly comparing the original sequence frequency analysis on this basis rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 proposed a generalised additive model for location scale and shape gamlss that can use a variety of distribution functions to describe the linear or non linear relationship between the distribution parameters of the random variable sequence and the explanatory variables this ensures that the principle of the time varying moment method is clearer and more intuitive and that it can conveniently be applied to non stationary hydrological frequency analysis in the gamlss model the explanatory variables that establish a functional relationship with the distribution parameters can be time variables villarini et al 2009 2010 villarini and serinaldi 2012 yan et al 2020 and physical factors that have a causal relationship with the hydrological sequence such as low frequency climate indicators zhang et al 2015b 2015c sun et al 2018b hao et al 2019 gu et al 2019 water conservancy and soil conservation engineering factors li and tan 2015 reservoir indicators wang et al 2022a 2022b greenhouse gases gao et al 2018 artificial index zhang et al 2021 and atmospheric circulation model yan et al 2020 li et al 2019 among others if the time variable is used as the explanatory variable for the distribution parameters of the hydrological sequence it can only describe the trend change of the sequence but cannot describe the sudden change in the sequence additionally there is no causal relationship between the time variable and hydrological series which cannot explain the reasons for the non stationarity of the hydrological series resulting in greater uncertainty in the prediction of future trend changes yan et al 2020 the use of physical factor indicators as covariates can satisfactorily describe and predict the non stationary characteristics of hydrological series and can also attribute the non stationary characteristics of the series from the perspective of physical factors prosdocimi et al 2015 neetu and pennan 2021 wang et al 2022a therefore the selection of explanatory variables is also a core challenge in non stationary hydrological frequency analyses when considering the impact of reservoirs on floods some scholars use the reservoir index ri calculated from the total storage capacity and annual runoff lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015b which can reflect the impact of reservoirs on floods to a certain extent but are not sufficiently accurate during the flood season the flood control storage capacity rather than the total storage capacity is more important in flood regulation and storage here we modified the original ri to obtain a new mri that considers the flood control storage capacity under the non stationary conditions it is urgent to carry out the analysis of the non stationary characteristics of extreme hydrological events to provide reliable support for flood control and disaster reduction under the changing environment faulkner et al 2020 guo et al 2023 owing to the large number of water conservancy projects and different climatic conditions there is a lack of a reliable model framework to comprehensively evaluate the non stationary characteristics of floods under the influence of both reservoir groups and the changes in low frequency climate indices therefore the purpose of this study was to propose a method to evaluate the non stationary characteristics of flood evolution in large rivers influenced by river regulation as well as climate change the main goal is achieved through i screening the climate and reservoir covariate factors of the region basin using the constructed model framework ii constructing the non stationary model of the flood sequence according to the selected covariate characteristics and iii analysing the prediction accuracy of the non stationary evolution of the flood and the main factors affecting the evolution of flood characteristics the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the study area and dataset section 3 describes the construction of a non stationary assessment framework for floods under the influence of climate change and reservoir groups section 4 presents the non stationary characteristics and prediction performance of floods under the influence of climate change and reservoir groups section 5 discusses the parameters affecting the non stationary evolution of floods and the limitations of this method section 6 presents the main conclusions of the study 2 study area and data source 2 1 study area the three gorges reservoir area tgra is one of the largest water conservation projects in the world with functions such as flood control power generation and navigation zhu et al 2021 the upper yangtze river basin area controlled by the dam site close to the yichang hydrological station is approximately 1 0 106 km2 accounting for 56 of the total area of the yangtze river basin fig 1 the flood season is from june to september each year in recent years for the purpose of promoting water conservancy and eliminating water hazards large scale water conservancy projects such as hongjiadu pubugou jinping xiluodu xiangjiaba and tingzikou have been built in the upper reaches of the yangtze river forming the reservoir groups which is the core of the tgra the construction of reservoir groups has greatly eased the flood control pressure on the upstream trunk and tributaries and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river according to incomplete statistics the large scale reservoirs planned for the upper reaches of the yangtze river have a storage capacity of more than 1 6 1012 m3 accounting for more than one third of the annual runoff at yichang station the completion and operation of these reservoirs significantly affect the flow of floods 2 2 data in this study the annual maximum daily flows of hydrological stations in zhutuo cuntan yichang beibei wulong and wuxi were selected for analysis the catchment areas and data lengths of the hydrological stations are listed in table 1 which also includes the trend test results among them the zhutuo cuntan and yichang hydrological stations are located on the mainstream of the yangtze river and the beibei wulong and wuxi are located on main tributaries in the reservoir area flow data were provided by the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission the location and basic storage information of the main controlling reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river are shown in fig 1 and table 2 the number of reservoirs shown in fig 1 corresponds to those presented in table 2 multiple studies have shown that climate change indicators have a significant impact on china s regional water resources seven global climate change indicators with great impact on the runoff of the yangtze river basin were selected to reflect the impact of extreme climate change on flood zhang et al 2015c zhang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 the seven climate indicators were ao north pacific oscillation npo pacific interdecadal

observing system gcos https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp 3 methodology 3 1 research idea based on the research background of non stationary change trends of floods the main contribution of this study is the proposed non stationary analysis model of floods affected by reservoir groups under climate change an improved ri which is more suitable for flood analysis was proposed to analyse the non stationarity of basin floods the tgra the largest reservoir area in china was selected as the research object to analyse the non stationary frequency of the flood sequence of six typical hydrological stations in the mainstream region and tributaries of the reservoir area fig 2 we also aimed to provide theoretical support for the risk assessment of flood control and other projects under the influence of large reservoir groups 3 2 selection of the low frequency climate indices the flood season in the upper reaches of the yangtze river typically occurs from june to september as low frequency climate indicators have a lagging effect on the formation of floods zhang et al 2019 dong et al 2019 the low frequency climate index series of the previous two years and the period from january to june 30 months in total of the current year were collected as 1 260 candidate predictors of the flood sequence 6 stations 6 variables 30 months the stepwise regression method is used to screen out the two low frequency climate factors with the highest degree of correlation with the flood sequence as the covariates representing low frequency climate factors in the flood non uniformity fitting the calculation process is shown in the supplementary document the correlation of low frequency climate factors screened is shown in fig 3 3 3 modified reservoir index mri to reflect the impact of reservoirs on flood retention lópez and francés 2013 proposed an ri that reflects the impact of dams and reservoirs on flood changes 1 ri i 1 n a i a t c i c t where n is the number of upstream reservoirs of the hydrological station ai is the catchment area of the reservoir km2 at is the catchment area of the hydrological station km2 ci is the total reservoir capacity 1 0 108 m3 and ct is the annual average runoff at the hydrological station 1 0 108 m3 the greater the ri value the greater the degree of change in the flood pattern by the reservoir the flood control storage capacity of the reservoir inhibits floods rather than the total storage capacity as the annual runoff distribution of the hydrological stations is different during the year the average annual runoff ct of hydrological stations may not accurately reflect the flood volume during the flood season therefore it is necessary to redefine the ri to reflect the impact of the flood control capacity of the reservoir during the flood season in this study the flood control storage capacity bi and multi year average runoff bt during the flood season were used to replace ci and ct respectively and the modified reservoir index mri was then obtained and expressed in eq 2 in the following discussion section we prove the superiority of the mri over ri the ri and mri are shown in fig 4 2 mri i 1 n a i a t b i b t 3 4 construction of the non stationary models the basic principle of the gamlss model stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 is as follows assuming that the random variable yt at a certain time t obeys the probability density function f yt t its distribution parameter t can be reflected by the position parameter mean and scale parameter mean square error among others the mathematical description is as follows 3 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where η k is the observed value at time k xk is the explanatory variable matrix which can be a time variable sequence or low frequency climate indices reservoir index and other physical factors gk is a monotonic and differentiable connection function that represents the relationship between the distribution parameter θ k and the variable xk β k is the jk dimensional regression parameter vector and z jk γ jk is the j th random effect term based on the gamlss we established the distribution function of the random variable y and fitted the functional relationship between the distribution parameters and explanatory variables through the cubic spline function the following three models were constructed for the extreme flood frequency analysis 1 stationary model model 0 the distribution parameters are constant 2 non stationary model model 1 at least one distribution parameter changes with time 3 non stationary model model 2 at least one distribution parameter changes with the climate indices and changes in the ri or mri the detailed fitting methods for the stationary and non stationary models are shown in fig 5 the fitting distribution of non stationary flood frequency analysis is mostly analyzed by two parameter distribution zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b we chose five commonly used two parameter distributions as candidate distributions normal no log normal logno weibull wei gamma ga and logistic lo distributions for each model models 0 1 and 2 five distributions were used to fit the flood sequence at each station in the tgra and the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic values for each fitting were calculated if the aic and bic values are small the corresponding model performs better and can be used to determine whether the flood sequence is suitable for a stationary or non stationary model to evaluate the goodness of fit of the optimal model we tested the independence and normality of the residual normalised quantile by creating a worm diagram buuren and fredriks 2001 he et al 2021 at the same time we add non negative conditions for the fitting of non stationary distribution to ensure that its estimated quantile data is greater than 0 4 results 4 1 change point and temporal trend analysis previous studies zhu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 have shown that large cascade reservoirs retain flooding thereby affecting the runoff process for example the mri value of the yichang station changed from 0 001 in 2005 to 0 283 in 2006 which indicates that the flood control capacity changed greatly after construction simultaneously the mutation test results showed that the maximum flood sequence of yichang station had a mutation in 2006 table 3 the average maximum daily flows at the yichang station from 1961 to 2005 and 2006 to 2020 were 49 152 and 38918 m3 s respectively showing a decrease of 20 8 and a difference of 10234 m3 s the changing trends of all the station are shown in fig s1 long term trend changes in the extreme hydrological series are a typical form of non stationarity the trend test results of the flood sequence of the selected hydrological stations are presented in table 3 and graphically shown in fig s2 the decreasing trends of the zhutuo and yichang stations are significant p 0 05 while the p values of the decreasing trend at wulong station cuntan beibei and wuxi stations are 1 69 1 58 1 38 0 94 respectively 4 2 gamlss model optimisation according to the principle of the minimum values of aic and bic the optimal distribution types of models 0 1 and 2 and the optimal functional relationship between distribution parameters and explanatory variables are screened out the results are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively in table 4 bold numbers represent the minimum values of aic and bic corresponding to the best models among models 0 1 and 2 as presented in table 4 for the flood sequence of each hydrological station model 1 is better than model 0 indicating that all the distribution parameters of the flood sequence show non stationary characteristics that change over time model 2 is better than models 1 and 0 indicating that the distribution parameters of the flood sequence have better fitting effects when low frequency climate change and ri or mri are used as explanatory variables instead of time variables when the mri is used as the explanatory variable the aic and bic values are smaller than when ri is used as the explanatory variable indicating that mri can better reflect the non stationary characteristics of the flood sequence the optimal distribution types of models 0 1 and 2 and the optimal functional relationship between their distribution parameters and explanatory variables are presented in table 5 the best distributions for zhutuo and cuntan are logno those for yichang and beibei are no and wei respectively those for model 0 model 1 and model 2 at wulong station are ga logno and wei and those for model 0 model 1 and model 2 at wuxi station are wei ga and wei respectively according to the optimal function relationship between the distribution parameters and the explanatory variables listed in table 5 the following conclusion was obtained the distribution parameter θ 1 in model 1 shows a linear function zhutuo cuntan and a non linear function relationship yichang beibei wu long and wuxi the distribution parameter θ 2 in model 2 shows constant zhutuo cuntan and yichang linear functions beibei and wuxi and non linear functions wulong for model 2 mri has a linear function relationship with the parameter θ 1 of cuntan zhutuo yichang beibei and wulong stations with more upstream reservoirs but has no obvious effect on wuxi station with fewer reservoirs climate indices ao soi and npo have a wide range of influences on the distribution parameter θ 1 showing linear and non linear relationships and nao has the second most important effect on the distribution parameter θ 1 considering the distribution parameter θ 2 in the beibei and wulong stations which are present in the tributaries of the reservoir area shows a non linear relationship with the npo and nao respectively and those in the other stations are constant the fitting effect of the gamlss model is shown in the worm diagram the ordinate value of the scatter points in the fig 6 is the standardised residual and the abscissa value is the theoretical residual value the range between the upper and lower elliptic curves was a 95 confidence interval if all scattered points in the worm graph are within the confidence interval between the upper and lower curves the model fits well fig 6 shows that the scattered points are all located within the confidence interval between the upper and lower curves the residual sequence of the optimal model at each site obeys the standard normal distribution therefore it can be used to reasonably judge the distribution type and parameter selection of the 18 optimal models constructed above 4 3 comparison of the design values of flood quantiles fig 7 shows the observed values estimated medians and 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles at each site model 1 shows that the percentile estimates for all sites after 2000 show a downward trend model 1 can satisfactorily describe the changes in the flood sequence indicating the suitability of using cubic splines with different degrees of freedom to establish the relationship between the distribution parameters and time however the impacts of drastic changes in floods caused by reservoir regulation at yichang and wulong stations around 2006 and the sharp increase in floods at beibei station after 1995 were not well reflected in model 1 fig 7 also shows that model 2 can more fully capture the random variation characteristics of flood values over the years which also reflects the impact of low frequency climate indices and mri on flood frequency changes in model 2 the percentile design value of the mainstream region zhutuo cuntan and yichang of the tgra showed a downward trend the design value of the 2006 flood quantile at yichang station showed a sharp downward trend resulting from the adjustment and storage of tgr reservoir the 95 percentile design value of the tributaries zhutuo and wuxi fluctuated and no continuous upward or downward trend was observed the design value of the 97 5 quantile of the flood sequence at beibei station did not show a downward trend after 1995 because of the regulation and storage of the upper jialing river reservoir group but showed a fluctuating upward trend this indicated that the positive effect of low frequency climate change on floods in the jialing river basin is greater than the restraining effect of reservoirs on floods the design value of the 97 5 percentile of the wulong station dropped sharply after 2005 reflecting the role of reservoirs in the upper reaches of the wujiang river in flood regulation the 97 5 percentile design value calculated by model 2 for wuxi station fluctuated randomly the 97 5 percentile design value of model 1 first increased and then decreased model 1 reflects the evolution of the measured flood better than model 2 this may be due to the factors such as the small catchment area of the daning river where wuxi station is located steep local topography and few controlled reservoirs thereby the flood evolution is less affected by the low frequency climate indices in the non stationary flood frequency analysis fig 6 and table s1 lists the 97 5 quantile design values and the maximum and minimum values of the flood sequence under the optimal models models 0 1 and 2 from the perspective of the design value of the 97 5 quantile of the flood the six hydrological stations in the tgra had the following characteristics the 97 5 quantile design value was within the corresponding design value range of model 2 for example the 97 5 quantile design values of models 0 1 and 2 of yichang station are 64 700 m3 s between 53 990 and 65 713 m3 s and between 44 000 and 76 000 m3 s respectively indicating that the estimated design value range of model 2 includes that of model 1 therefore from the perspective of engineering applications model 2 is safer 4 4 prediction of the design value of the flood quantile to verify the predictive effect of models 1 and 2 this study considers the flood sequence before 2000 as the model parameter estimation period and that after 2000 as the model verification period to reflect the prediction effects of models 1 and 2 the results are shown in fig 8 model 1 using the time variable as the explanatory variable had a good prediction effect at the zhutuo and cuntan stations however model 1 incorrectly verified the floods at yichang beibei wulong and wuxi stations leading to an overestimation model 2 had a good prediction effect in the mainstream region and tributaries of the tgra during the forecast period model 2 fully captured the changes in the flood frequency at each site the dynamic changes in the flood sequence shown in fig 7 can be broadly explained as being partly caused by changes in the precipitation owing to phase transitions of low frequency climate changes and partly caused by changes in flood flow patterns in the reservoir groups it is noteworthy that since the construction of cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the flood of tgra has been controlled in recent decades the main and tributaries have shown a fluctuating decline pattern fig s1 model 2 considers the impact of climate change and human activities and can more accurately estimate the confidence interval of flood this also proves that flood change has a strong relationship with climate forcing and reservoirs the non stationary model with time as covariate model 1 cannot clearly explain the relationship between flood and time t on the other hand a more complex function may better explain the change of data in statistics but due to the lack of physical significance its confidence interval will become larger and larger so that its prediction of the future is unreliable in summary model 2 with the low frequency climate indices and mri as explanatory variables can successfully capture the changing characteristics of the flood sequence at each station in the tgra during the regular and forecast periods 5 discussions 5 1 influence of the low frequency climate indices on the flood sequence previous studies have shown that flood flow from many locations in china is strongly correlated with the low frequency climate indices zhang et al 2015a yan et al 2020 hao et al 2019 this study selects the alternate low frequency climate indices based on stepwise correlation analysis and then selects the two best low frequency climate indices through the aic and bic values in the gamlss model framework too many parameters can lead to overfitting thus we choose two low frequency climate indices at most as presented in table 4 we concluded that soi ao and npo have the highest frequency and a greater impact on the floods in the tgra the 2 5 50 and 97 5 quantile values of flood sequences of models 0 and 2 over the years show a one to one correspondence with the soi ao and npo values here we used the soi ao and npo as the horizontal axis and the 2 5 50 and 97 5 quantiles of models 0 and 2 as the vertical axis and the correlation graph is shown in fig 9 notably when the soi value is high or the ao and npo values are low model 0 may underestimate the design flood value compared to the non stationary model model 2 this implies that in a changing environment flood control planning based on the assumption of stationarity may result in a series of problems fig 9 also shows that the distribution parameters of model 2 establish a functional relationship among the soi ao npo other climate indicators and reservoir indicators the design quantile values are not only affected by the soi ao and npo but also by other factors low frequency climate indices have an impact on extreme precipitation and floods in many regions of china and the degree of impact varies in time and space gu et al 2017a 2017b xu et al 2007 dong et al 2019 5 2 reservoir construction management and regulation the operation of reservoir will usually have a direct impact on the flood process of the basin and will also break the stability of the flood sequence xiong et al 2020 wang et al 2022a the yangtze river basin experienced two numbered floods in august 2020 during which the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin suffered heavy rainfall the runoff from the main and tributaries of the upper reaches of the yangtze river will form a flood peak before entering the tgra if the reservoir does not operate it will form a flood with a return period of more than 100 years zhang et al 2022 in 2020 tgra suffered the largest inflow flood since the data was recorded reaching 74 600 m3 s after the joint operation of the reservoir group the maximum flood flow decreased to 50 831 m3 s and the flood magnitude decreased by 31 9 by 2020 the total flood control capacity of cascade reservoirs in the yangtze river basin is 3 87 1010 m3 xia and chen 2020 the construction and operation of reservoir group in the upper reaches of the yangtze river reduces the flood scale through peak shifting regulation li et al 2022 the reservoir group operation plan in the study area usually needs to consider flood prevention water resource allocation and hydropower generation reservoirs often adopt anti season regulation to make their distribution more uniform within a year that is to maintain a large flood control storage capacity in the flood season to cope with floods and store water in the dry season to ensure ecological flow and water conservancy and power generation considering that the flood control storage capacity of the reservoir plays the important role of flood regulation and storage rather than the total storage capacity and that the annual distribution difference of runoff is large the multi year average runoff ct of a station may not accurately reflect its flood volume during the flood season as presented in table 2 the aic and bic values when the mri was used as the covariate were smaller than those when the original ri was used as the covariate this indicates that the mri better reflects the impact of the reservoir group on the flood sequence fig 4 shows that the non stationary model with mri as a covariate provides a more accurate fitting of flood frequency especially regarding the changes before and after the flow change points related to the construction of large reservoirs in the upper reaches of the basin these attempts provide the idea of a parameterisation scheme and using mri as a covariate can build a better non stationary flood frequency analysis model the nonstationary flood analysis framework proposed in this paper is expected to provide a reference for river flood disaster prevention 6 uncertainty and limitations some limitations of our study are as follows the non stationary flood frequency analysis and research method proposed in this study only consider the non stationary nature of climate change factors and large reservoir group operation factors that have a significant impact on flood frequency when flood frequency analysis is applied to other areas where the reservoir factor has a small impact other non stationary forcing factors should be considered such as the comprehensive human impact index land use and cover change agricultural water intake and irrigation wang et al 2020 milly et al 2002 slater et al 2021 future work can focus on developing parametric schemes for different regions for example by considering the impact of human activities on hydrological mechanisms the factors that can explain the influence of human activities can be used to the analysis framework of non stationary flood frequency 7 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to analyse the non stationary flood frequency of large rivers impacted by both low frequency climate indices and reservoir index the proposed methodology was exemplified on the mainstream and tributaries of the tgra first through the kendall and spearman trend test method pettitt mutation test method and non stationary diagnosis methods the evolution trend and variation characteristics of the flood in the tgra were analysed second based on the gamlss model framework optimal models namely models 0 stationary model 1 time as an explanatory variable and 2 mri and low frequency climate indices as explanatory variables were selected from the five distribution types no logno wei ga and lo moreover the cubic spline function relationship between the distribution parameters and the multiple degrees of freedom of the explanatory variables were used to analyse the non stationary flood frequency the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 from the trend and abrupt analysis results all the flood sequences of the six mainstream and tributary hydrological stations selected in the tgra showed a downward trend among them the zhutuo and yichang flood sequences had a significant downward trend and abrupt changes occurred in 1992 and 2006 respectively 2 the aic and bic values of models 1 and 2 are both smaller than those of model 0 indicating that the non stationary model can better capture the evolution trend of the measured flood sequence compared to the stationary model namely the flood sequences of the six hydrological stations no longer meet the stationary assumption 3 the low frequency climate indices soi ao and npo of the previous month had a significant impact on the flood of the year when the low frequency climate index soi value is high or the ao and npo values are low model 0 may underestimate the flood quantile design value compared to model 2 this implies that in a changing environment flood control planning based on stationary assumptions may threaten the local water security to a certain extent moreover the mri fully reflects the impact of upstream reservoirs on flooding in model 2 4 compared to model 1 model 2 can better describe the non stationarity of the flood frequency and amplitude in the tgra additionally the relationship between the distribution parameters of model 1 and the explanatory variables was derived only from the measured flood data with regular parameter rates therefore the uncertainty is large and predicting the future trends is difficult model 2 considers the external physical factors that cause the frequency of flooding thus its prediction performance is high however the low frequency climate indices as a descriptive variable of climate change in the flood series also has certain limitations its forecast period is only 1 30 months and long term prediction for the low frequency climate indices is still lacking credit authorship

2242,global climate change and reservoir regulations can alter the natural flow of rivers influenced by these two drivers flood sequences may no longer satisfy the assumption of stationary thereby making it difficult to accurately analysis flood frequency and to design water conservancy projects therefore it is of great significance to analyse the non stationary frequency of flood sequences in a changing environment in this study we proposed a method for conducting nonstationary flood frequency analysis caused by cascade reservoirs as well as the low frequency climate indices the proposed non stationary model 2 with the explanatory variables of climate indices and modified reservoir index mri was compared with the traditional stationary model and the widely used non stationary model 1 with time as the explanatory variable the study was conducted at six hydrological stations in the main stream and tributaries of the upper reaches of the yangtze river in china considered as the three gorges reservoir area the results of the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss showed that the akaike information criterion and bayesian information criterion values of the proposed non stationary model method 2 are smaller than those of the two comparison models when the low frequency south oscillation index is high or the arctic oscillation and north pacific oscillation are low the stationary model underestimates the design value of flood quantiles compared with the non stationary model 2 compared with the non stationary model 1 the mri and low frequency climate indices as the explanatory variables in model 2 can better describe the non stationary characteristics of flood frequency and amplitude in addition the non stationary model considering external physical factors can provide better prediction of future design flood compared with two traditional models keywords flood low frequency climate index modified reservoir index non stationarity

hydrological research blöschl et al 2020 arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 flood frequency analysis is a basic method for quantifying extreme flood uncertainty and its risk and is of great significance for flood control management of river courses and water conservancy projects bates et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 traditional flood frequency analysis is usually based on the stationary

activities on the environment numerous studies milly et al 2008 zhang et al 2015a sun et al 2018a lu et al 2020 have shown that the stationarity of hydrological process is dead the sixth ipcc assessment report ar6 ipcc 2021 indicates that low levels of global warming will also aggravate changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events climate change and land use change have changed the existing hydrological stationary laws jiang et al 2021 2022 and the frequency of extreme flood disasters will change with climate warming therefore non stationary flood frequency analysis is an important prerequisite to ensure the rationality of hydrological frequency analysis and calculation results the two most commonly used methods for flood frequency analysis in changing environments are the backward or forward restoration method and the time varying moment method liang et al 2012 the backward or forward restoration method considers that the non stationary hydrological sequence comprises deterministic components non stationary components and random components stationary components after removing the deterministic components using the backward or forward restoration method the original sequence is converted into a stationary sequence and the sequence is then analysed using the method based on the stationary assumption the time varying moment method was first used in hydrological statistics by strupczewski et al 2001a 2001b and strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 it can directly embed linear and non linear functions into the extreme flood sequence distribution to describe the non stationary characteristics of the hydrological sequence thereby directly comparing the original sequence frequency analysis on this basis rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 proposed a generalised additive model for location scale and shape gamlss that can use a variety of distribution functions to describe the linear or non linear relationship between the distribution parameters of the random variable sequence and the explanatory variables this ensures that the principle of the time varying moment method is clearer and more intuitive and that it can conveniently be applied to non stationary hydrological frequency analysis in the gamlss model the explanatory variables that establish a functional relationship with the distribution parameters can be time variables villarini et al 2009 2010 villarini and serinaldi 2012 yan et al 2020 and physical factors that have a causal relationship with the hydrological sequence such as low frequency climate indicators zhang et al 2015b 2015c sun et al 2018b hao et al 2019 gu et al 2019 water conservancy and soil conservation engineering factors li and tan 2015 reservoir indicators wang et al 2022a 2022b greenhouse gases gao et al 2018 artificial index zhang et al 2021 and atmospheric circulation model yan et al 2020 li et al 2019 among others if the time variable is used as the explanatory variable for the distribution parameters of the hydrological sequence it can only describe the trend change of the sequence but cannot describe the sudden change in the sequence additionally there is no causal relationship between the time variable and hydrological series which cannot explain the reasons for the non stationarity of the hydrological series resulting in greater uncertainty in the prediction of future trend changes yan et al 2020 the use of physical factor indicators as covariates can satisfactorily describe and predict the non stationary characteristics of hydrological series and can also attribute the non stationary characteristics of the series from the perspective of physical factors prosdocimi et al 2015 neetu and pennan 2021 wang et al 2022a therefore the selection of explanatory variables is also a core challenge in non stationary hydrological frequency analyses when considering the impact of reservoirs on floods some scholars use the reservoir index ri calculated from the total storage capacity and annual runoff lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015b which can reflect the impact of reservoirs on floods to a certain extent but are not sufficiently accurate during the flood season the flood control storage capacity rather than the total storage capacity is more important in flood regulation and storage here we modified the original ri to obtain a new mri that considers the flood control storage capacity under the non stationary conditions it is urgent to carry out the analysis of the non stationary characteristics of extreme hydrological events to provide reliable support for flood control and disaster reduction under the changing environment faulkner et al 2020 guo et al 2023 owing to the large number of water conservancy projects and different climatic conditions there is a lack of a reliable model framework to comprehensively evaluate the non stationary characteristics of floods under the influence of both reservoir groups and the changes in low frequency climate indices therefore the purpose of this study was to propose a method to evaluate the non stationary characteristics of flood evolution in large rivers influenced by river regulation as well as climate change the main goal is achieved through i screening the climate and reservoir covariate factors of the region basin using the constructed model framework ii constructing the non stationary model of the flood sequence according to the selected covariate characteristics and iii analysing the prediction accuracy of the non stationary evolution of the flood and the main factors affecting the evolution of flood characteristics the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the study area and dataset section 3 describes the construction of a non stationary assessment framework for floods under the influence of climate change and reservoir groups section 4 presents the non stationary characteristics and prediction performance of floods under the influence of climate change and reservoir groups section 5 discusses the parameters affecting the non stationary evolution of floods and the limitations of this method section 6 presents the main conclusions of the study 2 study area and data source 2 1 study area the three gorges reservoir area tgra is one of the largest water conservation projects in the world with functions such as flood control power generation and navigation zhu et al 2021 the upper yangtze river basin area controlled by the dam site close to the yichang hydrological station is approximately 1 0 106 km2 accounting for 56 of the total area of the yangtze river basin fig 1 the flood season is from june to september each year in recent years for the purpose of promoting water conservancy and eliminating water hazards large scale water conservancy projects such as hongjiadu pubugou jinping xiluodu xiangjiaba and tingzikou have been built in the upper reaches of the yangtze river forming the reservoir groups which is the core of the tgra the construction of reservoir groups has greatly eased the flood control pressure on the upstream trunk and tributaries and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river according to incomplete statistics the large scale reservoirs planned for the upper reaches of the yangtze river have a storage capacity of more than 1 6 1012 m3 accounting for more than one third of the annual runoff at yichang station the completion and operation of these reservoirs significantly affect the flow of floods 2 2 data in this study the annual maximum daily flows of hydrological stations in zhutuo cuntan yichang beibei wulong and wuxi were selected for analysis the catchment areas and data lengths of the hydrological stations are listed in table 1 which also includes the trend test results among them the zhutuo cuntan and yichang hydrological stations are located on the mainstream of the yangtze river and the beibei wulong and wuxi are located on main tributaries in the reservoir area flow data were provided by the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission the location and basic storage information of the main controlling reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river are shown in fig 1 and table 2 the number of reservoirs shown in fig 1 corresponds to those presented in table 2 multiple studies have shown that climate change indicators have a significant impact on china s regional water resources seven global climate change indicators with great impact on the runoff of the yangtze river basin were selected to reflect the impact of extreme climate change on flood zhang et al 2015c zhang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 the seven climate indicators were ao north pacific oscillation npo pacific interdecadal

observing system gcos https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp 3 methodology 3 1 research idea based on the research background of non stationary change trends of floods the main contribution of this study is the proposed non stationary analysis model of floods affected by reservoir groups under climate change an improved ri which is more suitable for flood analysis was proposed to analyse the non stationarity of basin floods the tgra the largest reservoir area in china was selected as the research object to analyse the non stationary frequency of the flood sequence of six typical hydrological stations in the mainstream region and tributaries of the reservoir area fig 2 we also aimed to provide theoretical support for the risk assessment of flood control and other projects under the influence of large reservoir groups 3 2 selection of the low frequency climate indices the flood season in the upper reaches of the yangtze river typically occurs from june to september as low frequency climate indicators have a lagging effect on the formation of floods zhang et al 2019 dong et al 2019 the low frequency climate index series of the previous two years and the period from january to june 30 months in total of the current year were collected as 1 260 candidate predictors of the flood sequence 6 stations 6 variables 30 months the stepwise regression method is used to screen out the two low frequency climate factors with the highest degree of correlation with the flood sequence as the covariates representing low frequency climate factors in the flood non uniformity fitting the calculation process is shown in the supplementary document the correlation of low frequency climate factors screened is shown in fig 3 3 3 modified reservoir index mri to reflect the impact of reservoirs on flood retention lópez and francés 2013 proposed an ri that reflects the impact of dams and reservoirs on flood changes 1 ri i 1 n a i a t c i c t where n is the number of upstream reservoirs of the hydrological station ai is the catchment area of the reservoir km2 at is the catchment area of the hydrological station km2 ci is the total reservoir capacity 1 0 108 m3 and ct is the annual average runoff at the hydrological station 1 0 108 m3 the greater the ri value the greater the degree of change in the flood pattern by the reservoir the flood control storage capacity of the reservoir inhibits floods rather than the total storage capacity as the annual runoff distribution of the hydrological stations is different during the year the average annual runoff ct of hydrological stations may not accurately reflect the flood volume during the flood season therefore it is necessary to redefine the ri to reflect the impact of the flood control capacity of the reservoir during the flood season in this study the flood control storage capacity bi and multi year average runoff bt during the flood season were used to replace ci and ct respectively and the modified reservoir index mri was then obtained and expressed in eq 2 in the following discussion section we prove the superiority of the mri over ri the ri and mri are shown in fig 4 2 mri i 1 n a i a t b i b t 3 4 construction of the non stationary models the basic principle of the gamlss model stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 is as follows assuming that the random variable yt at a certain time t obeys the probability density function f yt t its distribution parameter t can be reflected by the position parameter mean and scale parameter mean square error among others the mathematical description is as follows 3 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where η k is the observed value at time k xk is the explanatory variable matrix which can be a time variable sequence or low frequency climate indices reservoir index and other physical factors gk is a monotonic and differentiable connection function that represents the relationship between the distribution parameter θ k and the variable xk β k is the jk dimensional regression parameter vector and z jk γ jk is the j th random effect term based on the gamlss we established the distribution function of the random variable y and fitted the functional relationship between the distribution parameters and explanatory variables through the cubic spline function the following three models were constructed for the extreme flood frequency analysis 1 stationary model model 0 the distribution parameters are constant 2 non stationary model model 1 at least one distribution parameter changes with time 3 non stationary model model 2 at least one distribution parameter changes with the climate indices and changes in the ri or mri the detailed fitting methods for the stationary and non stationary models are shown in fig 5 the fitting distribution of non stationary flood frequency analysis is mostly analyzed by two parameter distribution zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b we chose five commonly used two parameter distributions as candidate distributions normal no log normal logno weibull wei gamma ga and logistic lo distributions for each model models 0 1 and 2 five distributions were used to fit the flood sequence at each station in the tgra and the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic values for each fitting were calculated if the aic and bic values are small the corresponding model performs better and can be used to determine whether the flood sequence is suitable for a stationary or non stationary model to evaluate the goodness of fit of the optimal model we tested the independence and normality of the residual normalised quantile by creating a worm diagram buuren and fredriks 2001 he et al 2021 at the same time we add non negative conditions for the fitting of non stationary distribution to ensure that its estimated quantile data is greater than 0 4 results 4 1 change point and temporal trend analysis previous studies zhu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 have shown that large cascade reservoirs retain flooding thereby affecting the runoff process for example the mri value of the yichang station changed from 0 001 in 2005 to 0 283 in 2006 which indicates that the flood control capacity changed greatly after construction simultaneously the mutation test results showed that the maximum flood sequence of yichang station had a mutation in 2006 table 3 the average maximum daily flows at the yichang station from 1961 to 2005 and 2006 to 2020 were 49 152 and 38918 m3 s respectively showing a decrease of 20 8 and a difference of 10234 m3 s the changing trends of all the station are shown in fig s1 long term trend changes in the extreme hydrological series are a typical form of non stationarity the trend test results of the flood sequence of the selected hydrological stations are presented in table 3 and graphically shown in fig s2 the decreasing trends of the zhutuo and yichang stations are significant p 0 05 while the p values of the decreasing trend at wulong station cuntan beibei and wuxi stations are 1 69 1 58 1 38 0 94 respectively 4 2 gamlss model optimisation according to the principle of the minimum values of aic and bic the optimal distribution types of models 0 1 and 2 and the optimal functional relationship between distribution parameters and explanatory variables are screened out the results are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively in table 4 bold numbers represent the minimum values of aic and bic corresponding to the best models among models 0 1 and 2 as presented in table 4 for the flood sequence of each hydrological station model 1 is better than model 0 indicating that all the distribution parameters of the flood sequence show non stationary characteristics that change over time model 2 is better than models 1 and 0 indicating that the distribution parameters of the flood sequence have better fitting effects when low frequency climate change and ri or mri are used as explanatory variables instead of time variables when the mri is used as the explanatory variable the aic and bic values are smaller than when ri is used as the explanatory variable indicating that mri can better reflect the non stationary characteristics of the flood sequence the optimal distribution types of models 0 1 and 2 and the optimal functional relationship between their distribution parameters and explanatory variables are presented in table 5 the best distributions for zhutuo and cuntan are logno those for yichang and beibei are no and wei respectively those for model 0 model 1 and model 2 at wulong station are ga logno and wei and those for model 0 model 1 and model 2 at wuxi station are wei ga and wei respectively according to the optimal function relationship between the distribution parameters and the explanatory variables listed in table 5 the following conclusion was obtained the distribution parameter θ 1 in model 1 shows a linear function zhutuo cuntan and a non linear function relationship yichang beibei wu long and wuxi the distribution parameter θ 2 in model 2 shows constant zhutuo cuntan and yichang linear functions beibei and wuxi and non linear functions wulong for model 2 mri has a linear function relationship with the parameter θ 1 of cuntan zhutuo yichang beibei and wulong stations with more upstream reservoirs but has no obvious effect on wuxi station with fewer reservoirs climate indices ao soi and npo have a wide range of influences on the distribution parameter θ 1 showing linear and non linear relationships and nao has the second most important effect on the distribution parameter θ 1 considering the distribution parameter θ 2 in the beibei and wulong stations which are present in the tributaries of the reservoir area shows a non linear relationship with the npo and nao respectively and those in the other stations are constant the fitting effect of the gamlss model is shown in the worm diagram the ordinate value of the scatter points in the fig 6 is the standardised residual and the abscissa value is the theoretical residual value the range between the upper and lower elliptic curves was a 95 confidence interval if all scattered points in the worm graph are within the confidence interval between the upper and lower curves the model fits well fig 6 shows that the scattered points are all located within the confidence interval between the upper and lower curves the residual sequence of the optimal model at each site obeys the standard normal distribution therefore it can be used to reasonably judge the distribution type and parameter selection of the 18 optimal models constructed above 4 3 comparison of the design values of flood quantiles fig 7 shows the observed values estimated medians and 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles at each site model 1 shows that the percentile estimates for all sites after 2000 show a downward trend model 1 can satisfactorily describe the changes in the flood sequence indicating the suitability of using cubic splines with different degrees of freedom to establish the relationship between the distribution parameters and time however the impacts of drastic changes in floods caused by reservoir regulation at yichang and wulong stations around 2006 and the sharp increase in floods at beibei station after 1995 were not well reflected in model 1 fig 7 also shows that model 2 can more fully capture the random variation characteristics of flood values over the years which also reflects the impact of low frequency climate indices and mri on flood frequency changes in model 2 the percentile design value of the mainstream region zhutuo cuntan and yichang of the tgra showed a downward trend the design value of the 2006 flood quantile at yichang station showed a sharp downward trend resulting from the adjustment and storage of tgr reservoir the 95 percentile design value of the tributaries zhutuo and wuxi fluctuated and no continuous upward or downward trend was observed the design value of the 97 5 quantile of the flood sequence at beibei station did not show a downward trend after 1995 because of the regulation and storage of the upper jialing river reservoir group but showed a fluctuating upward trend this indicated that the positive effect of low frequency climate change on floods in the jialing river basin is greater than the restraining effect of reservoirs on floods the design value of the 97 5 percentile of the wulong station dropped sharply after 2005 reflecting the role of reservoirs in the upper reaches of the wujiang river in flood regulation the 97 5 percentile design value calculated by model 2 for wuxi station fluctuated randomly the 97 5 percentile design value of model 1 first increased and then decreased model 1 reflects the evolution of the measured flood better than model 2 this may be due to the factors such as the small catchment area of the daning river where wuxi station is located steep local topography and few controlled reservoirs thereby the flood evolution is less affected by the low frequency climate indices in the non stationary flood frequency analysis fig 6 and table s1 lists the 97 5 quantile design values and the maximum and minimum values of the flood sequence under the optimal models models 0 1 and 2 from the perspective of the design value of the 97 5 quantile of the flood the six hydrological stations in the tgra had the following characteristics the 97 5 quantile design value was within the corresponding design value range of model 2 for example the 97 5 quantile design values of models 0 1 and 2 of yichang station are 64 700 m3 s between 53 990 and 65 713 m3 s and between 44 000 and 76 000 m3 s respectively indicating that the estimated design value range of model 2 includes that of model 1 therefore from the perspective of engineering applications model 2 is safer 4 4 prediction of the design value of the flood quantile to verify the predictive effect of models 1 and 2 this study considers the flood sequence before 2000 as the model parameter estimation period and that after 2000 as the model verification period to reflect the prediction effects of models 1 and 2 the results are shown in fig 8 model 1 using the time variable as the explanatory variable had a good prediction effect at the zhutuo and cuntan stations however model 1 incorrectly verified the floods at yichang beibei wulong and wuxi stations leading to an overestimation model 2 had a good prediction effect in the mainstream region and tributaries of the tgra during the forecast period model 2 fully captured the changes in the flood frequency at each site the dynamic changes in the flood sequence shown in fig 7 can be broadly explained as being partly caused by changes in the precipitation owing to phase transitions of low frequency climate changes and partly caused by changes in flood flow patterns in the reservoir groups it is noteworthy that since the construction of cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the flood of tgra has been controlled in recent decades the main and tributaries have shown a fluctuating decline pattern fig s1 model 2 considers the impact of climate change and human activities and can more accurately estimate the confidence interval of flood this also proves that flood change has a strong relationship with climate forcing and reservoirs the non stationary model with time as covariate model 1 cannot clearly explain the relationship between flood and time t on the other hand a more complex function may better explain the change of data in statistics but due to the lack of physical significance its confidence interval will become larger and larger so that its prediction of the future is unreliable in summary model 2 with the low frequency climate indices and mri as explanatory variables can successfully capture the changing characteristics of the flood sequence at each station in the tgra during the regular and forecast periods 5 discussions 5 1 influence of the low frequency climate indices on the flood sequence previous studies have shown that flood flow from many locations in china is strongly correlated with the low frequency climate indices zhang et al 2015a yan et al 2020 hao et al 2019 this study selects the alternate low frequency climate indices based on stepwise correlation analysis and then selects the two best low frequency climate indices through the aic and bic values in the gamlss model framework too many parameters can lead to overfitting thus we choose two low frequency climate indices at most as presented in table 4 we concluded that soi ao and npo have the highest frequency and a greater impact on the floods in the tgra the 2 5 50 and 97 5 quantile values of flood sequences of models 0 and 2 over the years show a one to one correspondence with the soi ao and npo values here we used the soi ao and npo as the horizontal axis and the 2 5 50 and 97 5 quantiles of models 0 and 2 as the vertical axis and the correlation graph is shown in fig 9 notably when the soi value is high or the ao and npo values are low model 0 may underestimate the design flood value compared to the non stationary model model 2 this implies that in a changing environment flood control planning based on the assumption of stationarity may result in a series of problems fig 9 also shows that the distribution parameters of model 2 establish a functional relationship among the soi ao npo other climate indicators and reservoir indicators the design quantile values are not only affected by the soi ao and npo but also by other factors low frequency climate indices have an impact on extreme precipitation and floods in many regions of china and the degree of impact varies in time and space gu et al 2017a 2017b xu et al 2007 dong et al 2019 5 2 reservoir construction management and regulation the operation of reservoir will usually have a direct impact on the flood process of the basin and will also break the stability of the flood sequence xiong et al 2020 wang et al 2022a the yangtze river basin experienced two numbered floods in august 2020 during which the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin suffered heavy rainfall the runoff from the main and tributaries of the upper reaches of the yangtze river will form a flood peak before entering the tgra if the reservoir does not operate it will form a flood with a return period of more than 100 years zhang et al 2022 in 2020 tgra suffered the largest inflow flood since the data was recorded reaching 74 600 m3 s after the joint operation of the reservoir group the maximum flood flow decreased to 50 831 m3 s and the flood magnitude decreased by 31 9 by 2020 the total flood control capacity of cascade reservoirs in the yangtze river basin is 3 87 1010 m3 xia and chen 2020 the construction and operation of reservoir group in the upper reaches of the yangtze river reduces the flood scale through peak shifting regulation li et al 2022 the reservoir group operation plan in the study area usually needs to consider flood prevention water resource allocation and hydropower generation reservoirs often adopt anti season regulation to make their distribution more uniform within a year that is to maintain a large flood control storage capacity in the flood season to cope with floods and store water in the dry season to ensure ecological flow and water conservancy and power generation considering that the flood control storage capacity of the reservoir plays the important role of flood regulation and storage rather than the total storage capacity and that the annual distribution difference of runoff is large the multi year average runoff ct of a station may not accurately reflect its flood volume during the flood season as presented in table 2 the aic and bic values when the mri was used as the covariate were smaller than those when the original ri was used as the covariate this indicates that the mri better reflects the impact of the reservoir group on the flood sequence fig 4 shows that the non stationary model with mri as a covariate provides a more accurate fitting of flood frequency especially regarding the changes before and after the flow change points related to the construction of large reservoirs in the upper reaches of the basin these attempts provide the idea of a parameterisation scheme and using mri as a covariate can build a better non stationary flood frequency analysis model the nonstationary flood analysis framework proposed in this paper is expected to provide a reference for river flood disaster prevention 6 uncertainty and limitations some limitations of our study are as follows the non stationary flood frequency analysis and research method proposed in this study only consider the non stationary nature of climate change factors and large reservoir group operation factors that have a significant impact on flood frequency when flood frequency analysis is applied to other areas where the reservoir factor has a small impact other non stationary forcing factors should be considered such as the comprehensive human impact index land use and cover change agricultural water intake and irrigation wang et al 2020 milly et al 2002 slater et al 2021 future work can focus on developing parametric schemes for different regions for example by considering the impact of human activities on hydrological mechanisms the factors that can explain the influence of human activities can be used to the analysis framework of non stationary flood frequency 7 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to analyse the non stationary flood frequency of large rivers impacted by both low frequency climate indices and reservoir index the proposed methodology was exemplified on the mainstream and tributaries of the tgra first through the kendall and spearman trend test method pettitt mutation test method and non stationary diagnosis methods the evolution trend and variation characteristics of the flood in the tgra were analysed second based on the gamlss model framework optimal models namely models 0 stationary model 1 time as an explanatory variable and 2 mri and low frequency climate indices as explanatory variables were selected from the five distribution types no logno wei ga and lo moreover the cubic spline function relationship between the distribution parameters and the multiple degrees of freedom of the explanatory variables were used to analyse the non stationary flood frequency the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 from the trend and abrupt analysis results all the flood sequences of the six mainstream and tributary hydrological stations selected in the tgra showed a downward trend among them the zhutuo and yichang flood sequences had a significant downward trend and abrupt changes occurred in 1992 and 2006 respectively 2 the aic and bic values of models 1 and 2 are both smaller than those of model 0 indicating that the non stationary model can better capture the evolution trend of the measured flood sequence compared to the stationary model namely the flood sequences of the six hydrological stations no longer meet the stationary assumption 3 the low frequency climate indices soi ao and npo of the previous month had a significant impact on the flood of the year when the low frequency climate index soi value is high or the ao and npo values are low model 0 may underestimate the flood quantile design value compared to model 2 this implies that in a changing environment flood control planning based on stationary assumptions may threaten the local water security to a certain extent moreover the mri fully reflects the impact of upstream reservoirs on flooding in model 2 4 compared to model 1 model 2 can better describe the non stationarity of the flood frequency and amplitude in the tgra additionally the relationship between the distribution parameters of model 1 and the explanatory variables was derived only from the measured flood data with regular parameter rates therefore the uncertainty is large and predicting the future trends is difficult model 2 considers the external physical factors that cause the frequency of flooding thus its prediction performance is high however the low frequency climate indices as a descriptive variable of climate change in the flood series also has certain limitations its forecast period is only 1 30 months and long term prediction for the low frequency climate indices is still lacking credit authorship

2243,climate change has emerged as a vital issue for hydropower management in the future general circulation model gcm informed climate is commonly applied to assess the impact of climate change on hydropower however the effect of gcm credibility on hydropower robustness has been rarely explored one objective of this study is to seek valuable and robust policies and the other is to evaluate the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower robustness based on the pre optimized operating policies a multi objective robust optimization approach is first proposed to design operating policies by coupling stochastic simulation heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization the gcm credibility is then evaluated based on multi criteria ranking scores and the hydropower robustness is illustrated by stepwise culling the lowest credible gcms the climate induced impacts on hydropower robustness rely on an ensemble of 18 gcms under three representative concentration pathways in coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 and 17 gcms under three shared socioeconomic pathways in cmip6 the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs in upper yellow river basin are selected as a case study the results show that 1 the proposed stochastic approach outperforms the deterministic approach regarding hydropower generation and firm output where the mean annual hydropower generation of stochastic operation is improved by 0 50 19 53 compared to deterministic operation indicating that the operating rules derived using historical stochastic inflows can adapt flexibly to future inflow changes than that using deterministic inflow 2 cmip6 maintains a more robust performance than cmip5 with higher satisficing measures and lower regret measures 3 hydropower robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility and will be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty ignorance of gcm credibility may lead to biased climate change adaptation decisions keywords climate change gcm credibility hydropower production robustness cmip5 vs cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydropower plays a vital role in supporting rapid economic development all over the world guo et al 2021 however changing climate implies a change in precipitation and temperature patterns which may affect the streamflow regime and alter the resource potential of a given river basin thus negatively impacting long term hydropower production chilkoti et al 2017 identifying how hydropower responds to climate change is necessary for sustainable economic development the most traditional and effective way to address climate change is the use of general circulation models gcms provided by the coupled model intercomparison project cmip of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which can simulate the future climate change for different greenhouse gas emission scenarios chen et al 2012 hoomehr et al 2016 wang et al 2017 reshmidevi et al 2018 gao et al 2020 guo et al 2020a xuan et al 2021 recent gcms based hydropower studies focus on two main topics forecast informed hydropower evaluation and forecast informed reservoir operations the first one is to advance optimization techniques into reservoir operations under forecast informed climate change and then quantify the impact of climate change on hydropower production lucena et al 2018 wang et al 2019a fan et al 2020 li et al 2020b qin et al 2020a qin et al 2020b caceres et al 2021 kim et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the other one is to consider the system characteristics of risk and uncertainty to propose potential adaptation strategies against climate change giuliani and castelletti 2016 guo et al 2018 ren et al 2019 hurford et al 2020 cohen et al 2021 guo et al 2021 kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b such studies argue that an operation strategy based on historical information is not inapplicable and can answer the question of how to improve reservoir adaptation under climate change these studies assume that optimization is modeled with specific runoff sequences which indicates that all the future information is known beforehand during the operation period however gcm projections are affected by a range of uncertainties including emissions scenarios initial conditions model structures and parameterization kudo et al 2017 lee et al 2021 chen and yuan 2022 as a result in practical reservoir operation climate change adaptation is uncertain for long planning horizons because almost all future specifics represented by gcms cannot be accurately predicted it is challenging to devise reasonable operation strategies based on gcm projections that can be directly employable in the future therefore operational strategies identified from historical optimization to improve the ability of a reservoir system to adapt to climate change are urgently needed stochastic operations generally provide superior solutions to deterministic models huang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 which are preferred to derive reservoir operating strategies in our study multi objective robust optimization moro is a newly introduced optimization method which uses multiple futures robustness criteria and adaptivity to hedge against uncertainty it can identify trade offs between different solutions under deep uncertainties to avoid being overly confident about current management strategies and timid in adopting planning innovations that reduce risk kasprzyk et al 2013 direct policy search dps has been applied to design the rules for operational strategies given its flexibility in the objective formulation and data driven nature that allows using trajectories of nonmodeled information in policy design in recent years quinn et al 2017 bertoni et al 2019 quinn et al 2019 this paper contributes to the moro framework by combining the strengths of multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea optimization and dps to propose robust operational strategies one key step in the dps is to select reasonable input variables several input feature extraction methods can be divided into three classifications i e prior posterior and online methods zaniolo et al 2021 the prior methods such as principal component analysis and grey relational analysis fang et al 2018 are very low computationally demanding approaches however they are independent of the policy search step yang et al 2017 in contrast input variables in posterior approaches are combined with each other and the desired input datasets are identified as the one subset generating the best performing policy undoubtedly posterior approaches are time consuming when too many combinations are needed to validate zaniolo et al 2021 the third the online approach interleaves feature extraction phases throughout the policy search process and simultaneously updates features during the search via a heuristic algorithm yang et al 2020 they are more expensive than a priori but less than a posteriori method in running time online approaches can optimize the input combinations and choose the one which maximizes the benefit and thus are applied to pair feature extraction and policy search for learning an operating policy in this study acknowledging that not all climate models are equally skilled numerous studies have applied a large ensemble of gcms for climate change projections taking accounting of model uncertainties rather than selecting one well performing gcm model it might be preferred to use an ensemble of gcms weighted based on their credibility pastén zapata et al 2022 gcm credibility is defined by the ability to capture observed historical records ignoring gcm credibility may result in biased probability distributions when using climate models to sample different future climate states of the world however due to a lack of alternatives it is generally assumed that those gcms performed better in the past are those that performed better in the future robustness is commonly defined as the insensitivity of the system design to random or otherwise errors in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice ren et al 2019 robustness values that are determined by running a trusted simulation model may be inaccurate in the future zhang et al 2021a pointed out that gcm credibility had significant influences on the water resources system robustness whether a gcm model agrees well with observations and maintains good robustness in the future is still a question that needs to be explored therefore the other aim of this study is to identify how climate model credibility affects hydropower production robustness previous climate change studies on hydropower production are mainly based on cmip5 outputs tarroja et al 2016 taner et al 2017 mishra et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 guerra et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 hou et al 2021 cmip6 the latest sixth phase of cmip has been recently released compared with those in cmip5 gcms derived from cmip6 have higher spatial resolutions and more complicated physical processes yue et al 2021 some studies have investigated future hydropower operations under cmip6 gcms for instance zhao et al 2022 employed 10 cmip6 models to project climate change impacts on hydropower in the yangtze river basin yrb and reported that the hydropower generation of the yrb would reduce and affect the energy structure in the future zhong et al 2021 evaluated the trade off between hydropower benefits and ecological interest in the upper mekong basin under climate change using five cmip6 models and five cmip5 models zhang et al 2022 employed cmip6 gcms to assess the climate change impacts on the hydro wind solar energy supply system in yunnan china and found that the projected increased level of electricity supply would be the highest under ssp585 however studies that have been conducted regarding future hydropower differences between cmip6 and cmip5 are limited there remains an opportunity to strength the comparison of hydropower generation between cmip5 and cmip6 in different regions this study seeks to answer the following research questions 1 how can we devise robust operational strategies through historical information 2 can a gcm model agreeing well with observations maintain good climate informed robustness in hydropower production 3 what are the differences in future hydropower production between cmip6 and cmip5 for this purpose we choose a typical reservoir system in the upper yellow river basin uyrb including longyangxia reservoir and liujiaxia reservoir two major regulatory reservoirs on the mainstream of the upper yellow river 2 methodology 2 1 methodology framework fig 1 illustrates the model framework integrating different modules used in this study the model framework aims to explore the implications of climate model credibility on hydropower robustness evaluation which includes stochastic simulations multi objective robust optimization gcm credibility ranking and its impact on hydropower production robustness deep uncertainty commonly refers to a situation in which decision makers show disagreement on probabilistic distributions kim et al 2021 to reflect the deep uncertainty of streamflow rather than using the deterministic sequences stochastic streamflow processes are preferred the stochastic simulation of streamflow can be generated using the bivariate copula functions including gamma t gumbel clayton and frank copula functions gao et al 2018 combined with the monte carlo sampling method it can effectively establish the correlation structures of streamflow between adjacent months and simulate streamflow the detailed simulation process of copula can be found in the supplement robust optimization is an effective way to deal with deep uncertainty which has been successfully applied to solve a number of water resources management problems several classical definitions of robustness metrics can be formulated for a minimization problem under uncertainty using more than one robustness metric to deal with the stochastic streamflow process would turn the maximum hydropower problem into a multi objective robust optimization moro one instead of finding one solution the multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas are developed to capture a pareto approximate set of solutions which can optimize all objectives simultaneously guo et al 2020b this paper contributes to the moro framework by combining the strengths of moea optimization and dps to tackle streamflow uncertainty and propose operational strategies based on the historical stochastic streamflow a hydrological model is needed to simulate the monthly streamflow under gcm projections the swat hydrological model is selected due to its good simulation performance on long term streamflow guo et al 2020a parameter calibration and validation in the swat model can be conducted by the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup the calibrated swat model projects both historical and future streamflow under each gcm projection where the historical streamflow is used to rank gcm credibility according to their simulation skills and the future streamflow is used to evaluate the impact of gcm credibility on hydropower robustness we also generate stochastic streamflow processes based on future projections using copulas in the robustness assessment module there are two common methods to integrate gcm credibility into robustness evaluation one is to weight all models based on credibility and the other one is to cull models according to the credibility ranking christensen et al 2010 pointed out that the choice of weighted aggregation methods had relatively small influences on the performance of the model ensemble when they attempted different ways of aggregating performance metrics into single weights for climate models accordingly we choose another method the model culling method to explore the gcm credibility impacts this approach allocates zero weight to the culled models and one weight to the retained models the robustness under climate change is then evaluated by culling the lowest credible gcms step by step with the pre optimized operating policies overall to explore the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness the framework consists of five steps 1 in step 1 a copula method gao et al 2018 is implemented to generate monthly stochastic streamflow based on historical records 2 in step 2 a multi objective robust optimization approach is proposed to design operating policies by coupling heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization 3 in step 3 we use gcms to generate monthly streamflow projections and a copula method to generate stochastic streamflow based on future projections 4 in step 4 the multi criteria ranking is used to evaluate gcm credibility according to their simulation skills of historical streamflow 5 in step 5 the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness are explored using the pre optimized operating policies in step 2 detailed descriptions of each part of the proposed framework are presented in the following sections 2 2 multi objective robust optimization for reservoir operation we propose a multi objective robust optimization approach to design operating policies by coupling heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization 2 2 1 reservoir robust optimization operation model herein an optimal operation model is developed to optimize the average annual hydropower generation e and firm output f 1 f max e f max 1 t t 1 t i 1 m n i t min t i 1 m n i t 2 n i t a i h i t q i t p subject to 3 v i t 1 v i t q i t i q i t r δ t 4 z i t min z i t z i t max 5 q i t r min q i t r q i t r max 6 q i t p min q i t p r q i t p max 7 n i min n i t n i max where t is the index of time step and i is the number of hydropower plant a i is the power output coefficient of the i th hydropower plant h i t and n i t are the hydraulic head m and power output mw of the i th hydropower plant at t th time step respectively q i t i q i t r and q i t p are the inflow total release and release for hydropower generation of the i th hydropower plant at t th time step m3 s respectively v i t and z i t are the reservoir storage m3 and water level m of the i th reservoir at t th time step respectively v i t f z i t min and max are the top and bottom limitations the objective in eq 1 is then evaluated over stochastic inflows to assess the vulnerability of reservoir operations to potential uncertainties the uncertainties are mitigated using a robust approach to improve the robustness of the identified solutions under uncertainty there are several classical definitions of robustness metrics formulated for a minimization problem under uncertainty where the performance f s w of an alternative solution s depends on the state of the world w ξ that will realize in the future the metrics we consider in this study are the following 1 the minimax pessimism metric wald 1949 focuses on the worst possible performance of each alternative solution and it selects the best solution s by adopting a pessimistic point as it assumes that the worst will happen 8 s arg min s max ξ f s w 2 the minimax regret metric is also a pessimistic approach this metric is defined as the difference between the performance resulting from the best solution given that wj is the true state of the world and the performance of an alternative solution under wj in this way the minimax regret metric selects the best solution by minimizing the maximum regret 9 s arg min s max ξ f s w j min s f s w j 3 the principle of insufficient reason hurwicz 1951 is treated as a decision making problem under risk where the best solution is selected as the one associated with the minimum expected performance in the absence of knowledge of the probabilities associated with the different states of the world it is generally suggested that the decision can be taken by assigning equal probability to all the states i e p 1 ns ns is the number of possible states 10 s arg min s 1 n s j n s f s w j in this way we run a multi objective robust optimization i e we solve problem 1 by optimizing the operating policies with respect to the three different robust objectives 2 2 2 heuristic parameterized policy search approach a parameterized policy search instead of open loop strategies we choose closed loop control strategies i e direct policy search dps in this study it can be identified according to the basic storage relationship of a reservoir considering that the optimization problems of multi reservoir operations are high dimensional and non linear we choose the gaussian rbfs method to design the reservoir operating rules giuliani et al 2016 yang et al 2017 rbfs can be used as a regression model to establish the relationship between reservoir input variables and decision variables 11 u t k i 1 l ω i φ i k γ t where l is the number of rbfs φ γ t is the policy input vectors at t th time step including exogenous information and ω i k is the weight of the i th rbf i 1 l ω i 1 ω i 0 the single rbf is defined as follows 12 φ i k γ t exp j 1 m γ t j c j i 2 b j i 2 where m denotes the number of policy inputs γ t and ci bi are the m dimensional center and radius vectors of the i th rbf respectively the centers of the rbf must lie within the bounded input space b heuristic input features extraction one key step in the dps is to select the reasonable input variables this work uses online approaches to pair feature extraction and policy search to learn a policy and its representation the parameters in rbfs i e the enter radius and weights and input variables are optimized using a heuristic algorithm simultaneously and are searched with the best performance in predicting the reservoir decision variable water release or water level and maximizing the decision maker s preferences yang et al 2020 in this way the input variables most relevant to reservoir decision making can be selected according to the optimized structure of rbfs after the optimization reservoir operation trajectories simulated from the optimized rbfs are used as the dataset for the input variables c calibration validation testing techniques recent studies have observed a tendency for policy search methods to overfit the hydrologic data used in training we adopt calibration validation testing designs brodeur et al 2020 inspired by the machine learning literature to reduce overfitting policy search and improve reservoir control policy performance on out of sample hydrological sequences the calibration data are used directly to fit the model and the validation data are used to approximate out of sample behavior and guide the training process the test data is used to assess the expected performance in the future 2 2 3 steps of the proposed multi objective robust optimization approach the main steps of the proposed multi objective robust optimization approach are summarized below step 1 split the streamflow data into a training set a calibration set and a testing set based on hydrological years for each case 50 of the streamflow series are selected as the training set while the remaining 50 are equally selected as the validation and test set step 2 determine the rbfs number and initialize randomly center radius and weights for all rbfs and select initial inputs randomly from candidate input variables step 3 predict the output in each period using the rbfs during the training and calibration period and estimate the fitness the fitness in this study is evaluated by the three robust metrics i e minimax pessimism minimax regret and the principle of insufficient between the training and calibration sets step 4 update current input variables rbfs center and radius in the heuristic algorithm and repeat step 3 step 4 until the fitness of the output values is not significantly improved or the maximum number of function evaluations is reached step 5 predict the output in each period using the rbfs during the test period and estimate the robust fitness suppose the fitness of the output values is satisfying in that case export the optimal pareto solutions each solution is a combination of entering radius and weights for all rbfs and input variables and repeat step 2 step 5 otherwise the calibration validation testing method is performed to avoid over fitting 2 3 multi criteria gcm credibility ranking gcm credibility assessment is sensitive to the selection of variables and metrics zhang et al 2021a climate e g temperature and precipitation and streamflow variables are generally used to evaluate the credibility of gcm lorenz et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a wang et al 2019b pointed out that streamflow based weights have a better performance in reproducing observed mean hydrograph than climate variable based weights accordinglly we choose streamflow as the baseline variable instead of climate variables to measure model to observation similarities of gcms the statistical moments of monthly conditions e g nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and relative bias pbias and the correlation coefficients e g spearman and kendall can describe the phase of the monthly time series and spatial correlations of streamflow variables which are commonly used to evaluate the similarities between simulated and observed streamflow in sum the five metrics mentioned above are selected to rank gcm models we then define a multi criteria rank score rs value 13 r s i max j e i e i j max j e i min j e i i f t h e g i v e n m e t r i c i s t h e s m a l l e r t h e b e t t e r 14 r s i e i j min j e i max j e i min j e i i f t h e g i v e n m e t r i c i s t h e l arg e r t h e b e t t e r where e i j is the value of the i th performance metric of the j th gcm the min j e i and max j e i indicate the minimum and maximum values across all models finally the total rank score for each gcm is obtained by weighting the sum of all metrics to indicate the credibility of model performance 15 f i 1 p w i r s i where w i indicate the weight of each performance metric although there may be differences among metrics equal weighting is still a valuable method to assess climate model credibility therefore in this study we assume equal weighting of all metrics i e wi 1 p p is the number of performance metrics 2 4 hydropower robustness measures robustness is commonly defined as the insensitivity of the system design to random or otherwise errors in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice one regret based measure and one satisfying based measure are considered hereafter the regret based measure r quantifies the performance deviation of an objective between the current state of the world and the baseline state of the world it can be measured by 16 r i j f x i j f x i j f x i j where f x i j is the best value of indictor i across the alternative states of the world wj and f x i j is the value of indicator i in the state of the world wj the satisfying based measure can incorporate the performance requirements of multiple stakeholders herein the satisfying based measure s is defined as the degree of satisfaction in which performance requirements of decision makers are satisfied by a solution in one or more objectives ren et al 2019 17 s j 1 n s δ s j n s where if solution s meets the requirements in the state of the world wj δ s j 1 and δ s j 0 otherwise this study aims to assess the hydropower production robustness under climate change and thus considers the indicators of hydropower sustainability eq 18 20 to describe the satisfying based measure s hydropower sustainability is generally determined by indicators of reliability resilience and efficiency in this study the reliability is quantified by the power assurance rate par the resiliency is quantified by the resiliency index ri and the efficiency can be quantified by the water use rate wua guo et al 2021 18 par n n n base t 100 19 ri t 1 t 1 n t n base n t 1 n base n n n base 100 20 wua q p q r 100 where n base is the firm power output mw n n n base is the number of failed states while n n n base is on the contrary and is a function that returns 1 when the condition is satisfied and returns 0 otherwise the larger the values of par ri and wua the better this study assumes that the indicator of par above 95 ri above 80 and wua above 90 can meet the requirements hypervolume proposed by zitzler and thiele 1998 is frequently used to measure the similarities between the optimized pareto front and true pareto front for comparing the results of evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms in addition to the regret based and satisfying based measures we also apply hypervolume to measure the hydropower production robustness under climate change the hypervolume indicator h assesses the size of the region weakly dominated by an approximation set and thus larger values indicate better non dominated sets while 2005 21 h f x i j f x i j f x i j f x i j where i is the number of indictor 3 study area and experimental settings 3 1 study area and data the yellow river with a total length estimated to be approximately 5 464 km and a drainage basin covering 7 5 3 105 km2 is the sixth longest river in the world the upper yellow river basin uyrb as shown in fig 2 is one of the thirteen major hydropower bases in china there are many reservoirs along the mainstream in uyrb including longyangxia liujiaxia and qingtongxia high mountains and gorges from the river source to qingtongxia reservoir bring abundant hydropower resources among these reservoirs in uyrb longyangxia lyx and liujiaxia ljx reservoirs are the two dominant reservoirs with the largest regulation capacities while the other remaining reservoirs are run of river reservoirs si et al 2018 reasonable compensation actions between lyx and ljx reservoirs can improve the comprehensive benefits of the uyrb hydropower system in this study we choose the lyx and ljx reservoirs to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method in cascade reservoir operation the main characteristics of lyx and ljx reservoirs are shown in table 1 the observed daily meteorological data obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration https data cma cn are from 1961 to 2010 including precipitation temperature wind speed and relative humidity the naturalized monthly streamflow datasets at the tangnaihai tnh and lanzhou lz stations are used to calibrate and validate the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model of the uyrb the monthly streamflow series of tnh and lz stations cover a period from january 1971 to december 2010 and january 1963 to december 2010 respectively in the swat hydrological model 70 of the streamflow series are selected as the training set while 30 are selected as the validation set in this way for the tnh station a 28 year period 1971 1998 is used for calibration and a 12 year period 1999 2010 for validation for lz stations a 32 year period 1963 1994 is used for calibration and a 16 year period 1995 2010 for validation the earth system grid data https www earthsystemgrid org provides the cmip6 and cmip5 model outputs including the monthly precipitation and average maximum and minimum temperature we analyze 18 cmip5 and 17 cmip6 models for which monthly model outputs for three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios and three corresponding shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios are available the detailed information of gcms can be found in the supplement three 30 year time slices 1971 2000 for the historical climate 2026 2055 and 2066 2095 for future climate are considered in this study generally the raw gcm outputs are too coarse to be compatible with hydrological models the bias correction and spatial disaggregation bcsd method guo et al 2020a is used to correct and downscale the cmip gcm projections 3 2 experimental settings in this study the bivariate copula function is used for generating long term cascade reservoirs monthly streamflow the p iii distribution is chosen to fit the marginal distribution since it is commonly used to characterize the distribution of hydrologic variables in china the joint distribution of inflows periods is established by five copula functions gamma t gumbel clayton and frank copulas gao et al 2018 after the final copula function for each period is selected the simulation is then performed the historical stochastic simulation is divided into three periods calibration validation and test based on the observed streamflow record in calibration formulation streamflow is simulated as 100 unique 100 year streamflow series while in validation and test formulation streamflow is simulated as 100 unique 50 year streamflow series respectively in this study the future uncertain ensemble is only used to test the pre optimized operating rules in terms of future formulation streamflow is simulated as one unique 100 year streamflow series based on a 30 year record the simulation results can better retain the statistical characteristics of the original observation values streamflow projection in the future can be used to evaluate the impacts of gcm credibility on cascade reservoir operation robustness we employ 18 cmip5 and 17 cmip6 models in this way a total of 36 and 34 numerical modelling experiments are designed to demonstrate the effects of cmip5 and cmip6 gcm credibility on reservoir operation robustness under two time periods respectively i e a total of 18 operations to cull cmip5 models 2 periods 36 experiments and 17 operations to cull cmip6 models 2 periods 34 experiments in each modelling experiment gcms with lower credibility are culled and gcms with higher credibility are combined as the inflow inputs of the reservoir operation model accordingly the number n of gcm combination models to calculate robustness is reduced from 18 and 17 to one under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively the proposed framework is performed on lyx and ljx cascade reservoirs note that the ljx is the closest reservoir with the yearly regulation capacity to the ningxia mongolia reach and is responsible for meeting the multiple utilization requirements downstream referring to si et al 2018 the minimum and maximum water released from the ljx reservoir vary yearly the minimum water release ranges from 700 to 950 m3 s during the water supply season while it should meet the downstream ecological water requirement during the other periods the maximum water release is approximately 4 290 m3 s during the flood season and it ranges from 400 to 600 m3 s during the ice season both the initial water levels of lyx and ljx reservoirs are set as the average level between the dead and normal levels the fore bay water level of reservoirs should be lowered below the flood limited water level during the flood season and should be lower than the normal water level during the non flood seasons in historical calibration formulation objectives are calculated over 100 ensemble members of length 100 years while in validation and test formulation objectives are calculated over 100 ensemble members of length 50 years in this study the future uncertain ensemble is only used to test the pre optimized operating rules and refer to the future formulations the objectives are calculated over one ensemble member of a length of 100 years the reservoir operations are regulated based on both deterministic and stochastic inflow to verify the proposed multi objective robust optimization approach in the single objective deterministic operation the operating rule can be obtained directly by naturalized streamflow over calibration validation and test periods rather than synthetic streamflow sets another difference between deterministic and stochastic operations is that only one solution is obtained by deterministic operation while a pareto optimal solution is obtained by stochastic operation the best solution under each synthetic streamflow or naturalized streamflow is calculated using the grey wolf optimizer gwo algorithm guo et al 2020c with a population size of 100 and a maximum number of generations of 1000 the cascade reservoir operation optimization is solved by applying the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii algorithm to search for the operating policies based on experimental validation we find that each optimization could reach convergence with the population size setting 100 and the maximum number of generations setting 1000 4 results and discussion 4 1 multi objective robust optimization using historical records this study explores how alternative definitions of robustness impact decisions under stochastic uncertainty the stochastic streamflow process can be found in the supplement each solution across the alternative states of the world can be calculated using the parameterization simulation optimization approach fig 3 shows that the pareto front of three robust objectives is well distributed in a curved surface from 19 38 104 to 21 62 104 kw for the minimax regret from 228 75 104 to 230 60 104 kw for the minimax pessimism and 241 22 104 to 242 07 104 kw for the principle of insufficient reason there are apparent trade offs between the minimax pessimism and minimax regret i e an increase in minimax pessimism values will inevitably lead to a decrease in the value of minimax regret however when these two values change the value of the principle of insufficient reason is not significantly affected according to the characteristics of the pareto optimal solutions it can be observed that any point lying on the pareto front curve serves as an optimal solution to the multi objective problem an ideal solution should be located at the left corner of the plot and represented by a blue marker the apparent trade offs between the minimax pessimism and minimax regret result in a compromised surface as shown in fig 3 a the range of the principle of insufficient reason is lower than that of the minimax regret and minimax pessimism accordingly ignoring the metric of the principle of insufficient reason two typical schemes are chosen from 100 alternatives to further analyze the relationships between the two objectives they are s1 minimum minimax regret solution and s2 maximum minimax pessimism solution when selecting a single best policy from a candidate set the use of test performance provides a more robust metric that can help prevent policy performance degradation on out of sample hydrology brodeur et al 2020 to access model validity the evaluation of the modelled solutions is performed over calibration validation and test periods using the metric of original single objective performance eq 1 and its regret values fig 3 b shows the regret performance metric ranges apparently replicative performance ranges from 9 13 104 to 9 88 104 kw in calibration and predictive performance ranges from 9 59 104 to 10 21 104 kw in validation and test sets are valid this result provides evidence that the calibration validation test method can avoid policy overfitting although the future runoff ensemble has been sampled this ensemble is only used to test the operating rules rather than to identify the robust operating rules the obtained operating rules are then used to simulate hydropower generation under future scenarios based gcms fig 4 shows the comparison between deterministic and stochastic operations on mean annual hydropower generation and firm output respectively in general if the firm output of a hydropower plant is increased it may reduce the total hydropower generation li et al 2020a however the proposed stochastic approach can almost outperform the deterministic approach in terms of hydropower generation and firm output the mean annual hydropower generation of stochastic operation is improved by 0 50 19 53 compared to deterministic operation the firm output is significantly improved with the ranges of 16 83 1090 29 the risk of using real deterministic inflow is that the stochastic inflow may introduce noise and errors and ultimately alter the information selection this indicates that the operating rules derived using stochastic inflows can adapt flexibly to future inflow changes more than those using deterministic inflow 4 2 multi criteria gcm credibility ranking the swat hydrological model is used to project monthly streamflow the nse pbias and coefficient of determination r2 are used to evaluate the results of monthly streamflow simulation at tnh and lz hydrological stations given that the model performance can generally be considered acceptable if nse 0 50 r2 0 50 and pbias within 25 for streamflow table 2 indicates that the swat model can be used to simulate the hydrological process in the uyrb we then use the calibrated swat model to simulate the monthly inflow series of lyx and ljx reservoirs under gcm derived and downscaled climate scenarios in uyrb during the historical period a total of 10 indicators five metrics two hydrological stations are used to rank gcm models i e nse tnh nse lz pbias tnh pbias lz rmse tnh rmse lz spearman tnh spearman lz kendall tnh and kendall lz fig 5 shows the credibility of gcm indicated by total rank score values the total multi criteria rank score values of the 18 cmip5 gcms range from 0 19 to 0 83 and that of the 17 cmip6 gcms range from 0 08 to 0 76 among cmip5 gcms the gcm with the best simulation effect is giss e2 r with a score of 0 83 followed by giss e2 h 0 80 and cnrm cm5 0 75 the poorest three cmip5 models in this region are bcc csm1 1 0 19 miroc esm chem 0 24 and miroc5 0 43 among cmip6 gcms the gcm with the best simulation effect is miroc6 0 76 followed by miroc es2l 0 73 and bcc csm2 mr 0 73 the poorest three cmip6 gcm models are cnrm cm6 1 hr 0 08 cnrm cm6 1 0 40 and giss e2 1 g 0 45 an interesting finding is that the giss e2 model in cmip5 provides the best simulation performance but that in cmip6 provides the poor simulation performance besides miroc shows the best simulation performance in cmip6 but poor simulation performance in cmip5 in general these differences in gcm credibility for this case study cannot be ignored 4 3 impacts of gcm credibility on reservoir operation robustness under future projections in each modelling experiment gcms with lower credibility are culled and gcms with higher credibility are combined as the inflow inputs of the reservoir operation model accordingly the number n of gcm combination models to calculate robustness is reduced from 18 and 17 to one under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively fig 6 and fig 7 show the regret measures of annual mean hydropower generation with the number of gcm combination models under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively the regret measures are ensemble means of the retained models in each modelling experiment the x axis represents the number of pareto optimal solutions the y axis represents the number of combined gcm models and the color ranging from blue to red corresponds to the regret measures according to eq 16 the lower the regret values are the better the results in this case a blue point indicates a good regret measure the two typical schemes i e s1 minimum minimax regret solutions and s2 maximum minimax pessimism solutions are identified in fig 6 and fig 7 whether a system will be more robust in the future depends on the performance to be measured and the future state related to that performance it can be observed that there is a clear boundary between these two typical schemes in the near future as indicated by the black dash dot line however the difference is weakened in the far future for both cmip5 and cmip6 scenarios the regret measures in the near future of annual mean hydropower generation are less than that in the far future the regret measures in the near future range from 0 91 to 2 45 and range from 1 73 to 1 82 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in comparison the ranges of regret measures in the far future period are 0 01 4 12 and 0 34 4 56 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively this is because the future state will become more and more uncertain and the robustness will be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty the same conclusions are reported in zhang et al 2021a by reducing the number n of combination models from 18 to one we can observe the relationship between robustness and n is complicated shown in fig 6 and fig 7 n equalling 18 indicates that all the gcms are used without considering credibility it can be noted that the choice of scenarios has a substantial impact on regret robustness and the extent of the impact is related to the time periods regardless of the time periods regret robustness has a sudden change from low to high when n is reduced to lower than four under three cmip5 scenarios rcp26 outperforms the other two rcps on regret robustness followed by rcp85 and last is rcp45 as for cmip6 the sudden change point is not evident but robustness generally shows high values with a smaller number of gcm combinations moreover ssp126 outperforms the other two ssps on regret robustness followed by ssp245 and last is ssp585 therefore robustness has a volatile changing trend as n decreases in terms of cmip5 and cmip6 and tends to be higher when considering credibility than when not considering credibility in this case study in contrast fig 8 and fig 9 demonstrate the regret measures of firm output with the number of gcm combination models under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively herein a blue point also indicates a good regret measure the arrow indicates the direction of preference the ranges of regret measures of firm output are larger than that of hydropower generation but there is a similar performance between the two regret measures the regret measures of firm output in the near future are less than that in the far future for both cmip5 and cmip6 scenarios the regret measures in the near future range from 4 55 to 24 40 and from 5 90 to 18 90 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in comparison the regret measures in the far future are between 9 00 and 24 70 and between 11 05 and 23 80 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively this is consistent with the results of the regret robustness of hydropower generation that the regret robustness of firm output decreases with time since later periods exhibit more uncertainty it indicates that the current robust policies obtained in historical records can be vulnerable to potential uncertainty highlighting the necessity of shifting away from conventional decision making strategies however it is difficult to quantify the future uncertainties which makes sense for a better robust policy identified using historical stochastic simulations fig 10 and fig 11 plot the satisficing measures with the number of gcm combination models under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively the range of satisficing measures is 0 1 the arrow directs to the robustness preference the color ranging from blue to red corresponds to the satisficing measures in this case a red point indicates a high satisficing measure as described above the robustness to be measured related to that performance determines the future state s change for example in most cases satisficing robustness has a consistent downward trend as n decreased under rcp26 and rcp85 and when n was reduced to lower than five robustness has a consistent upward trend and has high values as noted above the gcms with the best two simulation effects are giss e2 r and giss e2 h with scores of 0 83 and 0 80 among all cmip5 gcms respectively however the combination of giss e2 r and giss e2 h is superior to the single giss e2 r it is difficult to guarantee that gcms have a similar ability to capture the past climate and have a consistent future prediction in fig 10 and fig 11 robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility than when not considering credibility since cmip6 gcms achieve satisfied robustness with n lower than four in both the near and far future however there are some exceptions that the best model obtains poor performance under ssp126 and ssp585 in the near future the results indicate that even though some models agree well with observations of the past climate it is difficult to guarantee that their predictions about the future climate are consistent in comparison with cmip5 the satisficing measures vary greatly among different cmip6 ssps in our case study the ever expanding range of red areas demonstrates larger satisficing measures and better robust performance of cmip6 than cmip5 this is in agreement with the finding reported in several studies that cmip6 obtains better performance compared to cmip5 for example bağçaci et al 2021 reported that cmip6 could improve the amplitude of precipitation and alleviate errors departing from observations this may be because gcms derived from cmip6 have higher spatial resolutions and more complicated physical processes compared with those in cmip5 yue et al 2021 hypervolume measures under varied models culling are calculated to further investigate the gcm credibility on reservoir operation robustness under future projections a higher hypervolume indicates better robustness fig 12 displays that the robustness generally has a downward trend as n decreases the combinations of giss e2 r giss e2 h cnrm cm5 and gfdl cm3 derive the best robustness among cmip5 gcms as for cmip6 gcms the best robustness is obtained using the combinations of miroc6 miroc es2l and bcc csm2 mr in terms of both cmip5 and cmip6 the best number of combinations can be treated as lower than five focusing initially on robustness for two time periods the robustness decreases with time the robustness is sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions but has a non linear changing trend for instance rcp85 is superior to rcp26 and rcp45 in the near future but rcp26 outperforms the three scenarios in the far future similar performance can be obtained in three cmip6 scenarios referring to both cmip5 and cmip6 the range of hypervolume measures is 0 65 0 90 and 0 50 0 80 in the near and far future respectively the results of the evaluation using the hypervolume measures also indicate that the robust policies obtained in historical records can be vulnerable in the far future again highlighting the necessity of seeking adaptive decision making strategies 4 4 analysis of different robust policies to investigate the differences between the alternative definitions of robustness i e minimax regret and minimax pessimism a systematic comparison is conducted between two representative operational solutions with the highest robustness figs 13 16 present the box plots of monthly water levels of lyx and ljx reservoirs under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in comparison with the results of minimax pessimism in the near future minimax regret lowers the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 07 0 46 m and the ljx reservoir by 0 48 0 59 m under cmip5 gcms and consequently reduces the hydropower generation by 0 13 0 14 specifically cmip5 gcms generate the average annual hydropower generation with values of 120 84 108 122 98 108 and 118 59 108 kw h using minimax regret strategies under rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 respectively in contrast minimax pessimism strategies provide hydropower generation with values of 121 00 108 123 15 108 and 118 79 108 kw h in terms of cmip6 gcms minimax regret lowers the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 28 0 36 m and ljx reservoir by 0 49 0 57 m and hence reduces the hydropower generation by 0 04 0 18 in this case the average annual hydropower generation obtained by minimax regret strategies is 121 19 108 117 70 108 and 118 54 108 kw h and that using minimax regret strategies are 121 24 108 117 91 108 and 118 65 108 kw h under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 respectively in the far future the mean annual hydropower generation derived from the minimax regret and minimax pessimism solutions under rcps is 122 31 108 115 06 108 121 86 108 kw h and 122 30 108 115 35 108 and 121 96 108 kw h respectively compared with the minimax pessimism minimax regret lowers the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 09 0 32 m and the ljx reservoir by 0 42 0 51 m hence reducing the hydropower generation by 0 00 0 25 interestingly the annual hydropower generation obtained by minimax regret solutions is more larger than that obtained by the minimax pessimism solutions by 0 19 0 34 in the far future under cmip6 gcms specifically the minimax regret solutions provide the hydropower generation with values of 128 75 108 127 94 108 and 128 74 108 kw h while minimax pessimism solutions provide values of 128 37 108 127 50 108 and 128 49 108 kw h under three ssps respectively herein the minimax regret strategies lower the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 07 0 46 m and the ljx reservoir by 0 38 0 40 m compared with the minimax pessimism strategies however the reservoir release of minimax regret strategies is slightly increased by 0 01 than that of minimax pessimism strategies it demonstrates both reservoir storage and releases dominate the increments keeping a relatively high level of reservoir water curves can generally maintain the high power generation and firm output it can be noted in figs 13 16 that the curves of lyx and ljx reservoirs are distributed between the upper and lower limits of the reservoir s storage capacity especially the operation rule of the wet season e g july and august the higher robustness benefits from the lyx reservoir taking full advantage of substantial regulating storage to regulate the natural runoff in the upper yellow river the regulation dramatically changes the natural runoff process significantly increasing the downstream runoff in the dry season to balance hydropower generation and firm output the release from the lyx reservoir in the initial wet flood seasons becomes higher resulting in a general decrease in the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir on the other hand to deal with the low inflow in the dry seasons the water stored in the reservoir in the later wet flood seasons maintains an increase in the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir it can be observed in fig 15 and fig 16 that the differences between the solution of minimax regret and minimax pessimism on the fore bay water level of the ljx reservoir are larger than that of the lyx reservoir the operation of the ljx reservoir adapts to various incoming flows from the lyx reservoir it maintains a higher water level to maximize energy production and firm output however the operation of the ljx reservoir is also dominated by various strictly constrained releases to downstream due to the limitation of release ranging from 400 to 600 m3 s during the ice season e g january february and march the fore bay water level of the ljx reservoir keeps relatively stable overall the distribution of the reservoir water level can answer why gcms with the highest credibility obtain higher hydropower and have better robustness in the future hydropower generation will generally increase with increasing reservoir inflows as introduced above no obvious positive or negative relationship can be detected between scenarios and hydropower generation it implies that hydropower generation associated with future streamflow is sensitive to the forcing level fig 17 plots the relationship between future reservoir inflow and hydropower generation as we all know while most gcms project warming in the future there is a disagreement on the direction of precipitation change this fact creates substantial uncertainty in future streamflow projection the projected mean annual streamflow in the near future is between 710 750 m3 s and is lower than that in the far future with ranges of 730 780 m3 s in comparison to the hydropower generation in the near future 117 124 108 kw h the increased hydropower generation in the far future with a range of 114 130 108 kw h is caused by the increased streamflow taking synthetically generated runoff sequences as inputs the mathematical model proposed in this study can be used to derive robust policies in comparison to the results of the far future hydropower generation in the near future shows a more significant linearly increasing trend with increasing reservoir inflows this indicates that in the near future the utilization of robust policies derived from historical stochastic records can excavate the reservoirs regulating ability and perform better in water resource utilization this answers why gcms with higher credibility in history have better robustness in the future however the positive relationship almost breaks up in the far future for instance rcp45 and rcp85 fail to project high hydropower generation with increased streamflow this represents a fact that the capability of the cascade reservoirs has not been fully exploited using robust policies in the far future it again highlights the necessity of seeking valuable decision making strategies in the future however precise prediction of future streamflow conditions is lacking and a robust operating policy that can mitigate the gap between optimization operation and actual reservoir operation is urgently needed 5 conclusions taking the lyx and ljx reservoirs as a case study the results from this study illustrated the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness robust operational strategies distinguished from historical risk neutral expected value optimization were urgently needed due to the difficulty of accurately forecasting climate change in the future this study first proposed a multi objective robust optimization approach to design operating policies by coupling stochastic simulation heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization to derive optimized operating rules the calibration validation test method was implemented to avoid policy overfitting compared to the results of deterministic operation the proposed stochastic approach outperformed the deterministic approach in terms of hydropower generation and firm output indicating that the operating rules derived using stochastic inflows could adapt more flexibly to future inflow changes than using deterministic inflow an ensemble of 18 gcms under three rcps and 17 gcms under ssps in cmip6 were used to project streamflow in the historical period 1971 2000 and in two future periods 2026 2055 and 2066 2095 the credibility of gcm model performance was indicated by the multi criteria rank scores associated with historical streamflow simulations the robustness under climate change was then evaluated by culling the lowest credible gcms step by step using the pre optimized operating policies cmip6 maintained larger satisficing measures and better robust performance than cmip5 results also showed that the robustness generally had a downward trend as the number of gcm combination models decreased it indicated that those gcms capturing the climate well in the past had a certain consistency in future predictions this agreed well with the conclusion that robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility than when not considering credibility however the future state could become more and more uncertain and the robustness would be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty hydropower generation of the near future showed a more significant linearly increasing trend with increasing reservoir inflows than that of the far future this highlights the necessity of seeking valuable decision making but it isn t easy to accurately forecast the future making sense for a better robust policy that was identified using historical stochastic simulations this study demonstrated the significance of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness ignorance of gcm credibility may lead to biased climate change adaptation decisions our work was also subject to some limitations that could be overcome in future studies we considered the competition between water consumption and hydropower generation by setting up operational constraints in the optimization model however besides water consumption other human activities including soil conservation practices played an important role in runoff reduction in yrb shi et al 2013 using naturalized streamflow for hydrological model calibration and validation might lead to overestimated hydropower generation regardless of soil conservation practices future studies would extend the analysis to gcm credibility on hydropower robustness under both climate change and human activities another limitation is that the results obtained in this study were only specific to the lyx and ljx hyperpower systems it should be noted that uyrb is comprised of 25 reservoirs with about 16 gw of total installed capacity operating all the reservoirs and evaluating their hydropower robustness would be more comprehensive and valuable in addition to improve our understanding of the relationship between gcm credibility and hydropower robustness it would also be interesting to test the sensitivity of our results to the use of other multiple hydropower generation systems like the yangtze river hydropower system credit authorship contribution statement yuxue guo conceptualization methodology software writing original

2243,climate change has emerged as a vital issue for hydropower management in the future general circulation model gcm informed climate is commonly applied to assess the impact of climate change on hydropower however the effect of gcm credibility on hydropower robustness has been rarely explored one objective of this study is to seek valuable and robust policies and the other is to evaluate the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower robustness based on the pre optimized operating policies a multi objective robust optimization approach is first proposed to design operating policies by coupling stochastic simulation heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization the gcm credibility is then evaluated based on multi criteria ranking scores and the hydropower robustness is illustrated by stepwise culling the lowest credible gcms the climate induced impacts on hydropower robustness rely on an ensemble of 18 gcms under three representative concentration pathways in coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 and 17 gcms under three shared socioeconomic pathways in cmip6 the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs in upper yellow river basin are selected as a case study the results show that 1 the proposed stochastic approach outperforms the deterministic approach regarding hydropower generation and firm output where the mean annual hydropower generation of stochastic operation is improved by 0 50 19 53 compared to deterministic operation indicating that the operating rules derived using historical stochastic inflows can adapt flexibly to future inflow changes than that using deterministic inflow 2 cmip6 maintains a more robust performance than cmip5 with higher satisficing measures and lower regret measures 3 hydropower robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility and will be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty ignorance of gcm credibility may lead to biased climate change adaptation decisions keywords climate change gcm credibility hydropower production robustness cmip5 vs cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydropower plays a vital role in supporting rapid economic development all over the world guo et al 2021 however changing climate implies a change in precipitation and temperature patterns which may affect the streamflow regime and alter the resource potential of a given river basin thus negatively impacting long term hydropower production chilkoti et al 2017 identifying how hydropower responds to climate change is necessary for sustainable economic development the most traditional and effective way to address climate change is the use of general circulation models gcms provided by the coupled model intercomparison project cmip of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which can simulate the future climate change for different greenhouse gas emission scenarios chen et al 2012 hoomehr et al 2016 wang et al 2017 reshmidevi et al 2018 gao et al 2020 guo et al 2020a xuan et al 2021 recent gcms based hydropower studies focus on two main topics forecast informed hydropower evaluation and forecast informed reservoir operations the first one is to advance optimization techniques into reservoir operations under forecast informed climate change and then quantify the impact of climate change on hydropower production lucena et al 2018 wang et al 2019a fan et al 2020 li et al 2020b qin et al 2020a qin et al 2020b caceres et al 2021 kim et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the other one is to consider the system characteristics of risk and uncertainty to propose potential adaptation strategies against climate change giuliani and castelletti 2016 guo et al 2018 ren et al 2019 hurford et al 2020 cohen et al 2021 guo et al 2021 kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b such studies argue that an operation strategy based on historical information is not inapplicable and can answer the question of how to improve reservoir adaptation under climate change these studies assume that optimization is modeled with specific runoff sequences which indicates that all the future information is known beforehand during the operation period however gcm projections are affected by a range of uncertainties including emissions scenarios initial conditions model structures and parameterization kudo et al 2017 lee et al 2021 chen and yuan 2022 as a result in practical reservoir operation climate change adaptation is uncertain for long planning horizons because almost all future specifics represented by gcms cannot be accurately predicted it is challenging to devise reasonable operation strategies based on gcm projections that can be directly employable in the future therefore operational strategies identified from historical optimization to improve the ability of a reservoir system to adapt to climate change are urgently needed stochastic operations generally provide superior solutions to deterministic models huang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 which are preferred to derive reservoir operating strategies in our study multi objective robust optimization moro is a newly introduced optimization method which uses multiple futures robustness criteria and adaptivity to hedge against uncertainty it can identify trade offs between different solutions under deep uncertainties to avoid being overly confident about current management strategies and timid in adopting planning innovations that reduce risk kasprzyk et al 2013 direct policy search dps has been applied to design the rules for operational strategies given its flexibility in the objective formulation and data driven nature that allows using trajectories of nonmodeled information in policy design in recent years quinn et al 2017 bertoni et al 2019 quinn et al 2019 this paper contributes to the moro framework by combining the strengths of multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea optimization and dps to propose robust operational strategies one key step in the dps is to select reasonable input variables several input feature extraction methods can be divided into three classifications i e prior posterior and online methods zaniolo et al 2021 the prior methods such as principal component analysis and grey relational analysis fang et al 2018 are very low computationally demanding approaches however they are independent of the policy search step yang et al 2017 in contrast input variables in posterior approaches are combined with each other and the desired input datasets are identified as the one subset generating the best performing policy undoubtedly posterior approaches are time consuming when too many combinations are needed to validate zaniolo et al 2021 the third the online approach interleaves feature extraction phases throughout the policy search process and simultaneously updates features during the search via a heuristic algorithm yang et al 2020 they are more expensive than a priori but less than a posteriori method in running time online approaches can optimize the input combinations and choose the one which maximizes the benefit and thus are applied to pair feature extraction and policy search for learning an operating policy in this study acknowledging that not all climate models are equally skilled numerous studies have applied a large ensemble of gcms for climate change projections taking accounting of model uncertainties rather than selecting one well performing gcm model it might be preferred to use an ensemble of gcms weighted based on their credibility pastén zapata et al 2022 gcm credibility is defined by the ability to capture observed historical records ignoring gcm credibility may result in biased probability distributions when using climate models to sample different future climate states of the world however due to a lack of alternatives it is generally assumed that those gcms performed better in the past are those that performed better in the future robustness is commonly defined as the insensitivity of the system design to random or otherwise errors in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice ren et al 2019 robustness values that are determined by running a trusted simulation model may be inaccurate in the future zhang et al 2021a pointed out that gcm credibility had significant influences on the water resources system robustness whether a gcm model agrees well with observations and maintains good robustness in the future is still a question that needs to be explored therefore the other aim of this study is to identify how climate model credibility affects hydropower production robustness previous climate change studies on hydropower production are mainly based on cmip5 outputs tarroja et al 2016 taner et al 2017 mishra et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 guerra et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 hou et al 2021 cmip6 the latest sixth phase of cmip has been recently released compared with those in cmip5 gcms derived from cmip6 have higher spatial resolutions and more complicated physical processes yue et al 2021 some studies have investigated future hydropower operations under cmip6 gcms for instance zhao et al 2022 employed 10 cmip6 models to project climate change impacts on hydropower in the yangtze river basin yrb and reported that the hydropower generation of the yrb would reduce and affect the energy structure in the future zhong et al 2021 evaluated the trade off between hydropower benefits and ecological interest in the upper mekong basin under climate change using five cmip6 models and five cmip5 models zhang et al 2022 employed cmip6 gcms to assess the climate change impacts on the hydro wind solar energy supply system in yunnan china and found that the projected increased level of electricity supply would be the highest under ssp585 however studies that have been conducted regarding future hydropower differences between cmip6 and cmip5 are limited there remains an opportunity to strength the comparison of hydropower generation between cmip5 and cmip6 in different regions this study seeks to answer the following research questions 1 how can we devise robust operational strategies through historical information 2 can a gcm model agreeing well with observations maintain good climate informed robustness in hydropower production 3 what are the differences in future hydropower production between cmip6 and cmip5 for this purpose we choose a typical reservoir system in the upper yellow river basin uyrb including longyangxia reservoir and liujiaxia reservoir two major regulatory reservoirs on the mainstream of the upper yellow river 2 methodology 2 1 methodology framework fig 1 illustrates the model framework integrating different modules used in this study the model framework aims to explore the implications of climate model credibility on hydropower robustness evaluation which includes stochastic simulations multi objective robust optimization gcm credibility ranking and its impact on hydropower production robustness deep uncertainty commonly refers to a situation in which decision makers show disagreement on probabilistic distributions kim et al 2021 to reflect the deep uncertainty of streamflow rather than using the deterministic sequences stochastic streamflow processes are preferred the stochastic simulation of streamflow can be generated using the bivariate copula functions including gamma t gumbel clayton and frank copula functions gao et al 2018 combined with the monte carlo sampling method it can effectively establish the correlation structures of streamflow between adjacent months and simulate streamflow the detailed simulation process of copula can be found in the supplement robust optimization is an effective way to deal with deep uncertainty which has been successfully applied to solve a number of water resources management problems several classical definitions of robustness metrics can be formulated for a minimization problem under uncertainty using more than one robustness metric to deal with the stochastic streamflow process would turn the maximum hydropower problem into a multi objective robust optimization moro one instead of finding one solution the multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas are developed to capture a pareto approximate set of solutions which can optimize all objectives simultaneously guo et al 2020b this paper contributes to the moro framework by combining the strengths of moea optimization and dps to tackle streamflow uncertainty and propose operational strategies based on the historical stochastic streamflow a hydrological model is needed to simulate the monthly streamflow under gcm projections the swat hydrological model is selected due to its good simulation performance on long term streamflow guo et al 2020a parameter calibration and validation in the swat model can be conducted by the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup the calibrated swat model projects both historical and future streamflow under each gcm projection where the historical streamflow is used to rank gcm credibility according to their simulation skills and the future streamflow is used to evaluate the impact of gcm credibility on hydropower robustness we also generate stochastic streamflow processes based on future projections using copulas in the robustness assessment module there are two common methods to integrate gcm credibility into robustness evaluation one is to weight all models based on credibility and the other one is to cull models according to the credibility ranking christensen et al 2010 pointed out that the choice of weighted aggregation methods had relatively small influences on the performance of the model ensemble when they attempted different ways of aggregating performance metrics into single weights for climate models accordingly we choose another method the model culling method to explore the gcm credibility impacts this approach allocates zero weight to the culled models and one weight to the retained models the robustness under climate change is then evaluated by culling the lowest credible gcms step by step with the pre optimized operating policies overall to explore the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness the framework consists of five steps 1 in step 1 a copula method gao et al 2018 is implemented to generate monthly stochastic streamflow based on historical records 2 in step 2 a multi objective robust optimization approach is proposed to design operating policies by coupling heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization 3 in step 3 we use gcms to generate monthly streamflow projections and a copula method to generate stochastic streamflow based on future projections 4 in step 4 the multi criteria ranking is used to evaluate gcm credibility according to their simulation skills of historical streamflow 5 in step 5 the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness are explored using the pre optimized operating policies in step 2 detailed descriptions of each part of the proposed framework are presented in the following sections 2 2 multi objective robust optimization for reservoir operation we propose a multi objective robust optimization approach to design operating policies by coupling heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization 2 2 1 reservoir robust optimization operation model herein an optimal operation model is developed to optimize the average annual hydropower generation e and firm output f 1 f max e f max 1 t t 1 t i 1 m n i t min t i 1 m n i t 2 n i t a i h i t q i t p subject to 3 v i t 1 v i t q i t i q i t r δ t 4 z i t min z i t z i t max 5 q i t r min q i t r q i t r max

i t and n i t are the hydraulic head m and power output mw of the i th hydropower plant at t th time step respectively q i t i q i t r and q i t p are the inflow total release and release for hydropower generation of the i th hydropower plant at t th time step m3 s respectively v i t and z i t are the reservoir storage m3 and water level m of the i th reservoir at t th time step respectively v i t f z i t min and max are the top and bottom limitations the objective in eq 1 is then evaluated over stochastic inflows to assess the vulnerability of reservoir operations to potential uncertainties the uncertainties are mitigated using a robust approach to improve the robustness of the identified solutions under uncertainty there are several classical definitions of robustness metrics formulated for a minimization problem under uncertainty where the performance f s w of an alternative solution s depends on the state of the world w ξ that will realize in the future the metrics we consider in this study are the following 1 the minimax pessimism metric wald 1949 focuses on the worst possible performance of each alternative solution and it selects the best solution s by adopting a pessimistic point as it assumes that the worst will happen 8 s arg min s max ξ f s w 2 the minimax regret metric is also a pessimistic approach this metric is defined as the difference between the performance resulting from the best solution given that wj is the true state of the world and the performance of an alternative solution under wj in this way the minimax regret metric selects the best solution by minimizing the maximum regret 9 s arg min s max ξ f s w j min s f s w j 3 the principle of insufficient reason hurwicz 1951 is treated as a decision making problem under risk where the best solution is selected as the one associated with the minimum expected performance in the absence of knowledge of the probabilities associated with the different states of the world it is generally suggested that the decision can be taken by assigning equal probability to all the states i e p 1 ns ns is the number of possible states 10 s arg min s 1 n s j n s f s w j in this way we run a multi objective robust optimization i e we solve problem 1 by optimizing the operating policies with respect to the three different robust objectives 2 2 2 heuristic parameterized policy search approach a parameterized policy search instead of open loop strategies we choose closed loop control strategies i e direct policy search dps in this study it can be identified according to the basic storage relationship of a reservoir considering that the optimization problems of multi reservoir operations are high dimensional and non linear we choose the gaussian rbfs method to design the reservoir operating rules giuliani et al 2016 yang et al 2017 rbfs can be used as a regression model to establish the relationship between reservoir input variables and decision variables 11 u t k i 1 l ω i φ i k γ t where l is the number of rbfs φ γ t is the policy input vectors at t th time step including exogenous information and ω i k is the weight of the i th rbf i 1 l ω i 1 ω i 0 the single rbf is defined as follows 12 φ i k γ t exp j 1 m γ t j c j i 2 b j i 2 where m denotes the number of policy inputs γ t and ci bi are the m dimensional center and radius vectors of the i th rbf respectively the centers of the rbf must lie within the bounded input space b heuristic input features extraction one key step in the dps is to select the reasonable input variables this work uses online approaches to pair feature extraction and policy search to learn a policy and its representation the parameters in rbfs i e the enter radius and weights and input variables are optimized using a heuristic algorithm simultaneously and are searched with the best performance in predicting the reservoir decision variable water release or water level and maximizing the decision maker s preferences yang et al 2020 in this way the input variables most relevant to reservoir decision making can be selected according to the optimized structure of rbfs after the optimization reservoir operation trajectories simulated from the optimized rbfs are used as the dataset for the input variables c calibration validation testing techniques recent studies have observed a tendency for policy search methods to overfit the hydrologic data used in training we adopt calibration validation testing designs brodeur et al 2020 inspired by the machine learning literature to reduce overfitting policy search and improve reservoir control policy performance on out of sample hydrological sequences the calibration data are used directly to fit the model and the validation data are used to approximate out of sample behavior and guide the training process the test data is used to assess the expected performance in the future 2 2 3 steps of the proposed multi objective robust optimization approach the main steps of the proposed multi objective robust optimization approach are summarized below step 1 split the streamflow data into a training set a calibration set and a testing set based on hydrological years for each case 50 of the streamflow series are selected as the training set while the remaining 50 are equally selected as the validation and test set step 2 determine the rbfs number and initialize randomly center radius and weights for all rbfs and select initial inputs randomly from candidate input variables step 3 predict the output in each period using the rbfs during the training and calibration period and estimate the fitness the fitness in this study is evaluated by the three robust metrics i e minimax pessimism minimax regret and the principle of insufficient between the training and calibration sets step 4 update current input variables rbfs center and radius in the heuristic algorithm and repeat step 3 step 4 until the fitness of the output values is not significantly improved or the maximum number of function evaluations is reached step 5 predict the output in each period using the rbfs during the test period and estimate the robust fitness suppose the fitness of the output values is satisfying in that case export the optimal pareto solutions each solution is a combination of entering radius and weights for all rbfs and input variables and repeat step 2 step 5 otherwise the calibration validation testing method is performed to avoid over fitting 2 3 multi criteria gcm credibility ranking gcm credibility assessment is sensitive to the selection of variables and metrics zhang et al 2021a climate e g temperature and precipitation and streamflow variables are generally used to evaluate the credibility of gcm lorenz et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a wang et al 2019b pointed out that streamflow based weights have a better performance in reproducing observed mean hydrograph than climate variable based weights accordinglly we choose streamflow as the baseline variable instead of climate variables to measure model to observation similarities of gcms the statistical moments of monthly conditions e g nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and relative bias pbias and the correlation coefficients e g spearman and kendall can describe the phase of the monthly time series and spatial correlations of streamflow variables which are commonly used to evaluate the similarities between simulated and observed streamflow in sum the five metrics mentioned above are selected to rank gcm models we then define a multi criteria rank score rs value 13 r s i max j e i e i j max j e i min j e i i f t h e g i v e n m e t r i c i s t h e s m a l l e r t h e b e t t e r 14 r s i e i j min j e i max j e i min j e i i f t h e g i v e n m e t r i c i s t h e l arg e r t h e b e t t e r where e i j is the value of the i th performance metric of the j th gcm the min j e i and max j e i indicate the minimum and maximum values across all models finally the total rank score for each gcm is obtained by weighting the sum of all metrics to indicate the credibility of model performance 15 f i 1 p w i r s i where w i indicate the weight of each performance metric although there may be differences among metrics equal weighting is still a valuable method to assess climate model credibility therefore in this study we assume equal weighting of all metrics i e wi 1 p p is the number of performance metrics 2 4 hydropower robustness measures robustness is commonly defined as the insensitivity of the system design to random or otherwise errors in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice one regret based measure and one satisfying based measure are considered hereafter the regret based measure r quantifies the performance deviation of an objective between the current state of the world and the baseline state of the world it can be measured by 16 r i j f x i j f x i j f x i j where f x i j is the best value of indictor i across the alternative states of the world wj and f x i j is the value of indicator i in the state of the world wj the satisfying based measure can incorporate the performance requirements of multiple stakeholders herein the satisfying based measure s is defined as the degree of satisfaction in which performance requirements of decision makers are satisfied by a solution in one or more objectives ren et al 2019 17 s j 1 n s δ s j n s where if solution s meets the requirements in the state of the world wj δ s j 1 and δ s j 0 otherwise this study aims to assess the hydropower production robustness under climate change and thus considers the indicators of hydropower sustainability eq 18 20 to describe the satisfying based measure s hydropower sustainability is generally determined by indicators of reliability resilience and efficiency in this study the reliability is quantified by the power assurance rate par the resiliency is quantified by the resiliency index ri and the efficiency can be quantified by the water use rate wua guo et al 2021 18 par n n n base t 100 19 ri t 1 t 1 n t n base n t 1 n base n n n base 100 20 wua q p q r 100 where n base is the firm power output mw n n n base is the number of failed states while n n n base is on the contrary and is a function that returns 1 when the condition is satisfied and returns 0 otherwise the larger the values of par ri and wua the better this study assumes that the indicator of par above 95 ri above 80 and wua above 90 can meet the requirements hypervolume proposed by zitzler and thiele 1998 is frequently used to measure the similarities between the optimized pareto front and true pareto front for comparing the results of evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms in addition to the regret based and satisfying based measures we also apply hypervolume to measure the hydropower production robustness under climate change the hypervolume indicator h assesses the size of the region weakly dominated by an approximation set and thus larger values indicate better non dominated sets while 2005 21 h f x i j f x i j f x i j f x i j where i is the number of indictor 3 study area and experimental settings 3 1 study area and data the yellow river with a total length estimated to be approximately 5 464 km and a drainage basin covering 7 5 3 105 km2 is the sixth longest river in the world the upper yellow river basin uyrb as shown in fig 2 is one of the thirteen major hydropower bases in china there are many reservoirs along the mainstream in uyrb including longyangxia liujiaxia and qingtongxia high mountains and gorges from the river source to qingtongxia reservoir bring abundant hydropower resources among these reservoirs in uyrb longyangxia lyx and liujiaxia ljx reservoirs are the two dominant reservoirs with the largest regulation capacities while the other remaining reservoirs are run of river reservoirs si et al 2018 reasonable compensation actions between lyx and ljx reservoirs can improve the comprehensive benefits of the uyrb hydropower system in this study we choose the lyx and ljx reservoirs to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method in cascade reservoir operation the main characteristics of lyx and ljx reservoirs are shown in table 1 the observed daily meteorological data obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration https data cma cn are from 1961 to 2010 including precipitation temperature wind speed and relative humidity the naturalized monthly streamflow datasets at the tangnaihai tnh and lanzhou lz stations are used to calibrate and validate the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model of the uyrb the monthly streamflow series of tnh and lz stations cover a period from january 1971 to december 2010 and january 1963 to december 2010 respectively in the swat hydrological model 70 of the streamflow series are selected as the training set while 30 are selected as the validation set in this way for the tnh station a 28 year period 1971 1998 is used for calibration and a 12 year period 1999 2010 for validation for lz stations a 32 year period 1963 1994 is used for calibration and a 16 year period 1995 2010 for validation the earth system grid data https www earthsystemgrid org provides the cmip6 and cmip5 model outputs including the monthly precipitation and average maximum and minimum temperature we analyze 18 cmip5 and 17 cmip6 models for which monthly model outputs for three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios and three corresponding shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios are available the detailed information of gcms can be found in the supplement three 30 year time slices 1971 2000 for the historical climate 2026 2055 and 2066 2095 for future climate are considered in this study generally the raw gcm outputs are too coarse to be compatible with hydrological models the bias correction and spatial disaggregation bcsd method guo et al 2020a is used to correct and downscale the cmip gcm projections 3 2 experimental settings in this study the bivariate copula function is used for generating long term cascade reservoirs monthly streamflow the p iii distribution is chosen to fit the marginal distribution since it is commonly used to characterize the distribution of hydrologic variables in china the joint distribution of inflows periods is established by five copula functions gamma t gumbel clayton and frank copulas gao et al 2018 after the final copula function for each period is selected the simulation is then performed the historical stochastic simulation is divided into three periods calibration validation and test based on the observed streamflow record in calibration formulation streamflow is simulated as 100 unique 100 year streamflow series while in validation and test formulation streamflow is simulated as 100 unique 50 year streamflow series respectively in this study the future uncertain ensemble is only used to test the pre optimized operating rules in terms of future formulation streamflow is simulated as one unique 100 year streamflow series based on a 30 year record the simulation results can better retain the statistical characteristics of the original observation values streamflow projection in the future can be used to evaluate the impacts of gcm credibility on cascade reservoir operation robustness we employ 18 cmip5 and 17 cmip6 models in this way a total of 36 and 34 numerical modelling experiments are designed to demonstrate the effects of cmip5 and cmip6 gcm credibility on reservoir operation robustness under two time periods respectively i e a total of 18 operations to cull cmip5 models 2 periods 36 experiments and 17 operations to cull cmip6 models 2 periods 34 experiments in each modelling experiment gcms with lower credibility are culled and gcms with higher credibility are combined as the inflow inputs of the reservoir operation model accordingly the number n of gcm combination models to calculate robustness is reduced from 18 and 17 to one under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively the proposed framework is performed on lyx and ljx cascade reservoirs note that the ljx is the closest reservoir with the yearly regulation capacity to the ningxia mongolia reach and is responsible for meeting the multiple utilization requirements downstream referring to si et al 2018 the minimum and maximum water released from the ljx reservoir vary yearly the minimum water release ranges from 700 to 950 m3 s during the water supply season while it should meet the downstream ecological water requirement during the other periods the maximum water release is approximately 4 290 m3 s during the flood season and it ranges from 400 to 600 m3 s during the ice season both the initial water levels of lyx and ljx reservoirs are set as the average level between the dead and normal levels the fore bay water level of reservoirs should be lowered below the flood limited water level during the flood season and should be lower than the normal water level during the non flood seasons in historical calibration formulation objectives are calculated over 100 ensemble members of length 100 years while in validation and test formulation objectives are calculated over 100 ensemble members of length 50 years in this study the future uncertain ensemble is only used to test the pre optimized operating rules and refer to the future formulations the objectives are calculated over one ensemble member of a length of 100 years the reservoir operations are regulated based on both deterministic and stochastic inflow to verify the proposed multi objective robust optimization approach in the single objective deterministic operation the operating rule can be obtained directly by naturalized streamflow over calibration validation and test periods rather than synthetic streamflow sets another difference between deterministic and stochastic operations is that only one solution is obtained by deterministic operation while a pareto optimal solution is obtained by stochastic operation the best solution under each synthetic streamflow or naturalized streamflow is calculated using the grey wolf optimizer gwo algorithm guo et al 2020c with a population size of 100 and a maximum number of generations of 1000 the cascade reservoir operation optimization is solved by applying the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii algorithm to search for the operating policies based on experimental validation we find that each optimization could reach convergence with the population size setting 100 and the maximum number of generations setting 1000 4 results and discussion 4 1 multi objective robust optimization using historical records this study explores how alternative definitions of robustness impact decisions under stochastic uncertainty the stochastic streamflow process can be found in the supplement each solution across the alternative states of the world can be calculated using the parameterization simulation optimization approach fig 3 shows that the pareto front of three robust objectives is well distributed in a curved surface from 19 38 104 to 21 62 104 kw for the minimax regret from 228 75 104 to 230 60 104 kw for the minimax pessimism and 241 22 104 to 242 07 104 kw for the principle of insufficient reason there are apparent trade offs between the minimax pessimism and minimax regret i e an increase in minimax pessimism values will inevitably lead to a decrease in the value of minimax regret however when these two values change the value of the principle of insufficient reason is not significantly affected according to the characteristics of the pareto optimal solutions it can be observed that any point lying on the pareto front curve serves as an optimal solution to the multi objective problem an ideal solution should be located at the left corner of the plot and represented by a blue marker the apparent trade offs between the minimax pessimism and minimax regret result in a compromised surface as shown in fig 3 a the range of the principle of insufficient reason is lower than that of the minimax regret and minimax pessimism accordingly ignoring the metric of the principle of insufficient reason two typical schemes are chosen from 100 alternatives to further analyze the relationships between the two objectives they are s1 minimum minimax regret solution and s2 maximum minimax pessimism solution when selecting a single best policy from a candidate set the use of test performance provides a more robust metric that can help prevent policy performance degradation on out of sample hydrology brodeur et al 2020 to access model validity the evaluation of the modelled solutions is performed over calibration validation and test periods using the metric of original single objective performance eq 1 and its regret values fig 3 b shows the regret performance metric ranges apparently replicative performance ranges from 9 13 104 to 9 88 104 kw in calibration and predictive performance ranges from 9 59 104 to 10 21 104 kw in validation and test sets are valid this result provides evidence that the calibration validation test method can avoid policy overfitting although the future runoff ensemble has been sampled this ensemble is only used to test the operating rules rather than to identify the robust operating rules the obtained operating rules are then used to simulate hydropower generation under future scenarios based gcms fig 4 shows the comparison between deterministic and stochastic operations on mean annual hydropower generation and firm output respectively in general if the firm output of a hydropower plant is increased it may reduce the total hydropower generation li et al 2020a however the proposed stochastic approach can almost outperform the deterministic approach in terms of hydropower generation and firm output the mean annual hydropower generation of stochastic operation is improved by 0 50 19 53 compared to deterministic operation the firm output is significantly improved with the ranges of 16 83 1090 29 the risk of using real deterministic inflow is that the stochastic inflow may introduce noise and errors and ultimately alter the information selection this indicates that the operating rules derived using stochastic inflows can adapt flexibly to future inflow changes more than those using deterministic inflow 4 2 multi criteria gcm credibility ranking the swat hydrological model is used to project monthly streamflow the nse pbias and coefficient of determination r2 are used to evaluate the results of monthly streamflow simulation at tnh and lz hydrological stations given that the model performance can generally be considered acceptable if nse 0 50 r2 0 50 and pbias within 25 for streamflow table 2 indicates that the swat model can be used to simulate the hydrological process in the uyrb we then use the calibrated swat model to simulate the monthly inflow series of lyx and ljx reservoirs under gcm derived and downscaled climate scenarios in uyrb during the historical period a total of 10 indicators five metrics two hydrological stations are used to rank gcm models i e nse tnh nse lz pbias tnh pbias lz rmse tnh rmse lz spearman tnh spearman lz kendall tnh and kendall lz fig 5 shows the credibility of gcm indicated by total rank score values the total multi criteria rank score values of the 18 cmip5 gcms range from 0 19 to 0 83 and that of the 17 cmip6 gcms range from 0 08 to 0 76 among cmip5 gcms the gcm with the best simulation effect is giss e2 r with a score of 0 83 followed by giss e2 h 0 80 and cnrm cm5 0 75 the poorest three cmip5 models in this region are bcc csm1 1 0 19 miroc esm chem 0 24 and miroc5 0 43 among cmip6 gcms the gcm with the best simulation effect is miroc6 0 76 followed by miroc es2l 0 73 and bcc csm2 mr 0 73 the poorest three cmip6 gcm models are cnrm cm6 1 hr 0 08 cnrm cm6 1 0 40 and giss e2 1 g 0 45 an interesting finding is that the giss e2 model in cmip5 provides the best simulation performance but that in cmip6 provides the poor simulation performance besides miroc shows the best simulation performance in cmip6 but poor simulation performance in cmip5 in general these differences in gcm credibility for this case study cannot be ignored 4 3 impacts of gcm credibility on reservoir operation robustness under future projections in each modelling experiment gcms with lower credibility are culled and gcms with higher credibility are combined as the inflow inputs of the reservoir operation model accordingly the number n of gcm combination models to calculate robustness is reduced from 18 and 17 to one under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively fig 6 and fig 7 show the regret measures of annual mean hydropower generation with the number of gcm combination models under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively the regret measures are ensemble means of the retained models in each modelling experiment the x axis represents the number of pareto optimal solutions the y axis represents the number of combined gcm models and the color ranging from blue to red corresponds to the regret measures according to eq 16 the lower the regret values are the better the results in this case a blue point indicates a good regret measure the two typical schemes i e s1 minimum minimax regret solutions and s2 maximum minimax pessimism solutions are identified in fig 6 and fig 7 whether a system will be more robust in the future depends on the performance to be measured and the future state related to that performance it can be observed that there is a clear boundary between these two typical schemes in the near future as indicated by the black dash dot line however the difference is weakened in the far future for both cmip5 and cmip6 scenarios the regret measures in the near future of annual mean hydropower generation are less than that in the far future the regret measures in the near future range from 0 91 to 2 45 and range from 1 73 to 1 82 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in comparison the ranges of regret measures in the far future period are 0 01 4 12 and 0 34 4 56 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively this is because the future state will become more and more uncertain and the robustness will be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty the same conclusions are reported in zhang et al 2021a by reducing the number n of combination models from 18 to one we can observe the relationship between robustness and n is complicated shown in fig 6 and fig 7 n equalling 18 indicates that all the gcms are used without considering credibility it can be noted that the choice of scenarios has a substantial impact on regret robustness and the extent of the impact is related to the time periods regardless of the time periods regret robustness has a sudden change from low to high when n is reduced to lower than four under three cmip5 scenarios rcp26 outperforms the other two rcps on regret robustness followed by rcp85 and last is rcp45 as for cmip6 the sudden change point is not evident but robustness generally shows high values with a smaller number of gcm combinations moreover ssp126 outperforms the other two ssps on regret robustness followed by ssp245 and last is ssp585 therefore robustness has a volatile changing trend as n decreases in terms of cmip5 and cmip6 and tends to be higher when considering credibility than when not considering credibility in this case study in contrast fig 8 and fig 9 demonstrate the regret measures of firm output with the number of gcm combination models under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively herein a blue point also indicates a good regret measure the arrow indicates the direction of preference the ranges of regret measures of firm output are larger than that of hydropower generation but there is a similar performance between the two regret measures the regret measures of firm output in the near future are less than that in the far future for both cmip5 and cmip6 scenarios the regret measures in the near future range from 4 55 to 24 40 and from 5 90 to 18 90 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in comparison the regret measures in the far future are between 9 00 and 24 70 and between 11 05 and 23 80 under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively this is consistent with the results of the regret robustness of hydropower generation that the regret robustness of firm output decreases with time since later periods exhibit more uncertainty it indicates that the current robust policies obtained in historical records can be vulnerable to potential uncertainty highlighting the necessity of shifting away from conventional decision making strategies however it is difficult to quantify the future uncertainties which makes sense for a better robust policy identified using historical stochastic simulations fig 10 and fig 11 plot the satisficing measures with the number of gcm combination models under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively the range of satisficing measures is 0 1 the arrow directs to the robustness preference the color ranging from blue to red corresponds to the satisficing measures in this case a red point indicates a high satisficing measure as described above the robustness to be measured related to that performance determines the future state s change for example in most cases satisficing robustness has a consistent downward trend as n decreased under rcp26 and rcp85 and when n was reduced to lower than five robustness has a consistent upward trend and has high values as noted above the gcms with the best two simulation effects are giss e2 r and giss e2 h with scores of 0 83 and 0 80 among all cmip5 gcms respectively however the combination of giss e2 r and giss e2 h is superior to the single giss e2 r it is difficult to guarantee that gcms have a similar ability to capture the past climate and have a consistent future prediction in fig 10 and fig 11 robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility than when not considering credibility since cmip6 gcms achieve satisfied robustness with n lower than four in both the near and far future however there are some exceptions that the best model obtains poor performance under ssp126 and ssp585 in the near future the results indicate that even though some models agree well with observations of the past climate it is difficult to guarantee that their predictions about the future climate are consistent in comparison with cmip5 the satisficing measures vary greatly among different cmip6 ssps in our case study the ever expanding range of red areas demonstrates larger satisficing measures and better robust performance of cmip6 than cmip5 this is in agreement with the finding reported in several studies that cmip6 obtains better performance compared to cmip5 for example bağçaci et al 2021 reported that cmip6 could improve the amplitude of precipitation and alleviate errors departing from observations this may be because gcms derived from cmip6 have higher spatial resolutions and more complicated physical processes compared with those in cmip5 yue et al 2021 hypervolume measures under varied models culling are calculated to further investigate the gcm credibility on reservoir operation robustness under future projections a higher hypervolume indicates better robustness fig 12 displays that the robustness generally has a downward trend as n decreases the combinations of giss e2 r giss e2 h cnrm cm5 and gfdl cm3 derive the best robustness among cmip5 gcms as for cmip6 gcms the best robustness is obtained using the combinations of miroc6 miroc es2l and bcc csm2 mr in terms of both cmip5 and cmip6 the best number of combinations can be treated as lower than five focusing initially on robustness for two time periods the robustness decreases with time the robustness is sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions but has a non linear changing trend for instance rcp85 is superior to rcp26 and rcp45 in the near future but rcp26 outperforms the three scenarios in the far future similar performance can be obtained in three cmip6 scenarios referring to both cmip5 and cmip6 the range of hypervolume measures is 0 65 0 90 and 0 50 0 80 in the near and far future respectively the results of the evaluation using the hypervolume measures also indicate that the robust policies obtained in historical records can be vulnerable in the far future again highlighting the necessity of seeking adaptive decision making strategies 4 4 analysis of different robust policies to investigate the differences between the alternative definitions of robustness i e minimax regret and minimax pessimism a systematic comparison is conducted between two representative operational solutions with the highest robustness figs 13 16 present the box plots of monthly water levels of lyx and ljx reservoirs under cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in comparison with the results of minimax pessimism in the near future minimax regret lowers the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 07 0 46 m and the ljx reservoir by 0 48 0 59 m under cmip5 gcms and consequently reduces the hydropower generation by 0 13 0 14 specifically cmip5 gcms generate the average annual hydropower generation with values of 120 84 108 122 98 108 and 118 59 108 kw h using minimax regret strategies under rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 respectively in contrast minimax pessimism strategies provide hydropower generation with values of 121 00 108 123 15 108 and 118 79 108 kw h in terms of cmip6 gcms minimax regret lowers the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 28 0 36 m and ljx reservoir by 0 49 0 57 m and hence reduces the hydropower generation by 0 04 0 18 in this case the average annual hydropower generation obtained by minimax regret strategies is 121 19 108 117 70 108 and 118 54 108 kw h and that using minimax regret strategies are 121 24 108 117 91 108 and 118 65 108 kw h under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 respectively in the far future the mean annual hydropower generation derived from the minimax regret and minimax pessimism solutions under rcps is 122 31 108 115 06 108 121 86 108 kw h and 122 30 108 115 35 108 and 121 96 108 kw h respectively compared with the minimax pessimism minimax regret lowers the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 09 0 32 m and the ljx reservoir by 0 42 0 51 m hence reducing the hydropower generation by 0 00 0 25 interestingly the annual hydropower generation obtained by minimax regret solutions is more larger than that obtained by the minimax pessimism solutions by 0 19 0 34 in the far future under cmip6 gcms specifically the minimax regret solutions provide the hydropower generation with values of 128 75 108 127 94 108 and 128 74 108 kw h while minimax pessimism solutions provide values of 128 37 108 127 50 108 and 128 49 108 kw h under three ssps respectively herein the minimax regret strategies lower the average water level of the lyx reservoir by 0 07 0 46 m and the ljx reservoir by 0 38 0 40 m compared with the minimax pessimism strategies however the reservoir release of minimax regret strategies is slightly increased by 0 01 than that of minimax pessimism strategies it demonstrates both reservoir storage and releases dominate the increments keeping a relatively high level of reservoir water curves can generally maintain the high power generation and firm output it can be noted in figs 13 16 that the curves of lyx and ljx reservoirs are distributed between the upper and lower limits of the reservoir s storage capacity especially the operation rule of the wet season e g july and august the higher robustness benefits from the lyx reservoir taking full advantage of substantial regulating storage to regulate the natural runoff in the upper yellow river the regulation dramatically changes the natural runoff process significantly increasing the downstream runoff in the dry season to balance hydropower generation and firm output the release from the lyx reservoir in the initial wet flood seasons becomes higher resulting in a general decrease in the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir on the other hand to deal with the low inflow in the dry seasons the water stored in the reservoir in the later wet flood seasons maintains an increase in the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir it can be observed in fig 15 and fig 16 that the differences between the solution of minimax regret and minimax pessimism on the fore bay water level of the ljx reservoir are larger than that of the lyx reservoir the operation of the ljx reservoir adapts to various incoming flows from the lyx reservoir it maintains a higher water level to maximize energy production and firm output however the operation of the ljx reservoir is also dominated by various strictly constrained releases to downstream due to the limitation of release ranging from 400 to 600 m3 s during the ice season e g january february and march the fore bay water level of the ljx reservoir keeps relatively stable overall the distribution of the reservoir water level can answer why gcms with the highest credibility obtain higher hydropower and have better robustness in the future hydropower generation will generally increase with increasing reservoir inflows as introduced above no obvious positive or negative relationship can be detected between scenarios and hydropower generation it implies that hydropower generation associated with future streamflow is sensitive to the forcing level fig 17 plots the relationship between future reservoir inflow and hydropower generation as we all know while most gcms project warming in the future there is a disagreement on the direction of precipitation change this fact creates substantial uncertainty in future streamflow projection the projected mean annual streamflow in the near future is between 710 750 m3 s and is lower than that in the far future with ranges of 730 780 m3 s in comparison to the hydropower generation in the near future 117 124 108 kw h the increased hydropower generation in the far future with a range of 114 130 108 kw h is caused by the increased streamflow taking synthetically generated runoff sequences as inputs the mathematical model proposed in this study can be used to derive robust policies in comparison to the results of the far future hydropower generation in the near future shows a more significant linearly increasing trend with increasing reservoir inflows this indicates that in the near future the utilization of robust policies derived from historical stochastic records can excavate the reservoirs regulating ability and perform better in water resource utilization this answers why gcms with higher credibility in history have better robustness in the future however the positive relationship almost breaks up in the far future for instance rcp45 and rcp85 fail to project high hydropower generation with increased streamflow this represents a fact that the capability of the cascade reservoirs has not been fully exploited using robust policies in the far future it again highlights the necessity of seeking valuable decision making strategies in the future however precise prediction of future streamflow conditions is lacking and a robust operating policy that can mitigate the gap between optimization operation and actual reservoir operation is urgently needed 5 conclusions taking the lyx and ljx reservoirs as a case study the results from this study illustrated the effects of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness robust operational strategies distinguished from historical risk neutral expected value optimization were urgently needed due to the difficulty of accurately forecasting climate change in the future this study first proposed a multi objective robust optimization approach to design operating policies by coupling stochastic simulation heuristic parameterized policy search and robust optimization to derive optimized operating rules the calibration validation test method was implemented to avoid policy overfitting compared to the results of deterministic operation the proposed stochastic approach outperformed the deterministic approach in terms of hydropower generation and firm output indicating that the operating rules derived using stochastic inflows could adapt more flexibly to future inflow changes than using deterministic inflow an ensemble of 18 gcms under three rcps and 17 gcms under ssps in cmip6 were used to project streamflow in the historical period 1971 2000 and in two future periods 2026 2055 and 2066 2095 the credibility of gcm model performance was indicated by the multi criteria rank scores associated with historical streamflow simulations the robustness under climate change was then evaluated by culling the lowest credible gcms step by step using the pre optimized operating policies cmip6 maintained larger satisficing measures and better robust performance than cmip5 results also showed that the robustness generally had a downward trend as the number of gcm combination models decreased it indicated that those gcms capturing the climate well in the past had a certain consistency in future predictions this agreed well with the conclusion that robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility than when not considering credibility however the future state could become more and more uncertain and the robustness would be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty hydropower generation of the near future showed a more significant linearly increasing trend with increasing reservoir inflows than that of the far future this highlights the necessity of seeking valuable decision making but it isn t easy to accurately forecast the future making sense for a better robust policy that was identified using historical stochastic simulations this study demonstrated the significance of gcm credibility on hydropower production robustness ignorance of gcm credibility may lead to biased climate change adaptation decisions our work was also subject to some limitations that could be overcome in future studies we considered the competition between water consumption and hydropower generation by setting up operational constraints in the optimization model however besides water consumption other human activities including soil conservation practices played an important role in runoff reduction in yrb shi et al 2013 using naturalized streamflow for hydrological model calibration and validation might lead to overestimated hydropower generation regardless of soil conservation practices future studies would extend the analysis to gcm credibility on hydropower robustness under both climate change and human activities another limitation is that the results obtained in this study were only specific to the lyx and ljx hyperpower systems it should be noted that uyrb is comprised of 25 reservoirs with about 16 gw of total installed capacity operating all the reservoirs and evaluating their hydropower robustness would be more comprehensive and valuable in addition to improve our understanding of the relationship between gcm credibility and hydropower robustness it would also be interesting to test the sensitivity of our results to the use

2244,sedimentary organic matter som production and transformation processes have a prominent role in regulating biogenic element cycling in mangrove ecosystems however aquaculture biodeposits can substantially affect source apportionments and biogeochemical processes of som within mangroves in this study natural stable isotopes 13c and 15n spectral techniques and hydrogeochemical analysis were used to elucidate the sources preservation and degradation of som across the dongzhai harbor dzh estuary southern china where aquaculture systems are extensive along the estuarine salinity gradient sediment and bottom water samples were collected from the upper fluvial mangrove zones to the lower marine endmember results indicated that source contributions to som along the estuarine gradient were spatially heterogeneous aquaculture derived organic matter was the largest contributor to the sanjiang river 44 29 in the upper estuary and terrestrial sources from c3 mangrove forests were highest in the yanfeng east river 62 87 near the middle estuary farther seaward marine plankton sources were elevated in the dongzhai harbor channel 64 15 and yanfeng west river 48 83 of the lower estuary the terrestrial microbial humic like component c1 tryptophan like component c2 and soil derived fulvic acid c3 were identified from the samples using fluorescence excitation emission matrices and parallel factor analysis eem parafac results show that in the upper and middle estuary som was preserved by sedimentation due to the abundance of fine grained aquaculture derived biodeposits weak hydrodynamic conditions and the formation of fe mn humus complexes in contrast in the lower estuary som originated from marine plankton and was rapidly degraded via aerobic respiration moreover correlations between δ13c and δ15n values vs c n ratios further suggest progressive som degradation from initial diagenesis to post depositional geochemical processes this study provides new insights into aquacultural and environmental factors controlling som preservation and degradation within estuaries the findings have implications for shoreline stability and the protection and restoration of estuarine mangrove wetlands keywords organic matter preservation isotope mangrove estuary aquaculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benthic sediments serve as sources and sinks of organic matter om playing a pivotal role in controlling global biogeochemical cycling of sedimentary organic matter som and biogenic elements schartup et al 2014 estuarine som can have multiple sources including allochthonous inputs e g soil plant materials and waste discharge bauer et al 2013 and autochthonous production e g in situ marine plankton derived substances samantaray and sanyal 2022 furthermore over 90 of som can be trapped and preserved in sediments through incorporation into fe mn hydr oxide and clay minerals which can reduce the bioavailability of som in environments where redox conditions oscillate conant et al 2011 chen et al 2018 depending on the depositional environment and the nature of som the quantity and quality of buried som can vary considerably resmi et al 2016 consequently owing largely to the coupled influence of marine and terrestrial sources som in mangrove estuaries is compositionally complex and often exhibits varying degrees of reactivity microbial processing of som is a chemically important process that affects elemental cycling and mangrove health in the coastal zone mangroves thrive in land ocean transition zones where there are high levels of sediment deposition an abundance of organic rich deposits and where anoxic conditions persist alongi 2014 deborde et al 2015 wang et al 2019 nevertheless hydrodynamic e g tide typhoon storm surge and sea level rise and anthropogenic e g aquaculture agriculture and urbanization pressures are causing mangroves to disappear at an alarming rate marchand et al 2011 typically wastes produced by marine aquaculture increase som deposition rates by one or two orders of magnitude above natural background levels and also act as nutrient and energy sources for microbes martinez garcia et al 2015 benthic environments with low oxygen levels motivate anaerobic metabolic pathways primarily sulfate reduction fe mn respiration and methanogenesis leading to som degradation processes kappler et al 2021 moreover several microbial metabolites such as sulfide h2s reduced iron fes trace elements and organic acids produced in hypoxia conditions are toxic to mangrove forests alongi 2021 therefore knowledge of the sources and processes impacting the som preservation and degradation is essential to understand the transport and transformations of biogenic elements which ultimately regulate the health of coastal mangrove wetland environments analysis of stable isotopic compositions 13c and 15n and mixing models are effective methods for estimating som sources and degradation processes derrien et al 2019 in addition fluorescence spectroscopy excitation emission matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac have been successfully applied to characterize som sources and dynamics in coastal ecosystems chen and hur 2015 qiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 fluorescent om is primarily composed of humic substances that are preferentially preserved in sediments under anoxic conditions while other components are readily metabolized by heterotrophic bacteria such as aromatic amino acids proteins chen and jaffe 2014 dongzhai harbor hainan island china is the first mangrove nature reserve in china as aquaculture and tourism have grown rapidly in the past six decades the mangrove area has been significantly reduced from initial 40 km2 to 17 km2 he et al 2019 high level shrimp farming has caused eutrophication of mangrove wetland water bodies further triggering the outbreak of wood boring isopod sphaeroma species xu et al 2014 these wood borers attacked the mangroves species bruguiera spp mostly and followed by ceriops tagal avicennia marina kandelia obovata and aegiceras corniculatu thiri and yang 2022 most previous studies have analyzed elemental composition and stable carbon isotopes to characterize som in coastal zones such as the yangtze river estuary zhou et al 2022 pearl river delta dan et al 2021 and pichavaram estuary naidu et al 2022 however in complex mangrove estuaries with intensive aquacultural activities the decomposition and burial processes of som has received little attention to date notably the continuous supply of labile biodeposits from aquaculture ponds to benthic sediments may promote the remineralization of refractory som which can affect biogenic element budgets in mangrove ecosystems santos et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the relative contribution of som from heterogeneous sources using δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing models 2 identify key constrains on som preservation and degradation and 3 characterize som biogeochemical processes that affect mangrove environments along estuarine salinity gradients 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the dongzhai harbor dzh mangrove estuary covering an area of 100 km2 is located in the northeastern part of hainan island china n 19 51 20 01 e 110 30 110 37 liu et al 2019 and has an irregular semidiurnal tide averagely there is 1 92 m tidal range during spring tides and 0 38 m during neap tides li et al 2013 the estuary is funnel shaped and is connected to the qiongzhou strait to the north fig 1 the mean annual rainfall in the region is 1676 mm of which 80 falls from may to october xiong et al 2018 the mangrove in dongzhai harbor estuary occupy a 40 km2 area and are located in three distinct areas of the estuary sanjiang river hereafter termed as the upstream river yanfeng east river midstream river and yanfeng west river downstream river xia et al 2021 generally the northeast side of the estuary is an alluvial floodplain consisting mainly of silty sand sandy silt and gravel in contrast the southwest region is primarily composed of quaternary basalt and tuff with lateritic soils due to long term weathering li et al 2013 the estuary is bordered by tidal rivers and contains multiple shrimp and shellfish ponds that are raised above sea level aquaculture and densely populated areas are concentrated around sanjiang river located in the southern part of dongzhai harbor in november 2019 46 benthic sediment samples were collected from a depth interval of 0 10 cm below the bed using a stainless steel peterson grab sampler fig 1 samples were collected during a flooding tide stage by cruising together with several boats from the most downstream to upstream sampling sites three sets of sediment subsamples were then collected from each grab sample the subsamples were mixed to obtain a representative sample of the sediment at each sampling site at each sampling site bottom water hydrochemical parameters including ph salinity s ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured on site with a calibrated portable multimeter model hq40d hach company sampling spanned the land sea transition zone and included three large mangrove tidal rivers and within the dongzhai harbor channel for a total of four areas fig 1c thus the sampling sites captured the full range of som characteristics within and surrounding the mangrove estuary and included areas near aquaculture ponds the samples were classified according to location along the land sea gradient samples

monte carlo simulations of isotope ratios bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach was applied to quantify the relative contributions of potential sources to som andersson 2011 bosch et al 2015 li et al 2020b the mcmc computations produced 100 million normally distributed random numbers based on an δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing temm model one million of these values were then used to estimate the proportions of som sources li et al 2020c statistical parameters e g mean median maximum minimum and standard deviation were computed from the temm model the 13c 15n isotopic mixing

is the c or n concentration of source i and xi is the fractional sediment mass contribution of source i wang et al 2021 the δ13c and δ15n endmember values were selected by dividing the som samples into three pools terrestrial aquaculture and marine these pools make up the dominate land cover within and surrounding the estuary yan et al 2021 the mean δ13c and δ15n values measured in the samples of each pool were defined as the end member the δ13c and δ15n isotopic values of the terrestrial endmember were 26 9 0 40 and 7 0 1 46 while those for the marine endmember were 23 7 0 96 and 5 4 0 95 respectively the benthic sediments in the upstream river were used to define the aquaculture endmember δ13c 25 7 1 00 δ15n 4 9 0 28 because aquaculture ponds are extensive in the area 2 4 statistical

software inc northampton ma statistically significant differences were evaluated at the p 0 05 levels using the least significant differences lsd 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical properties bottom water salinity ph and do were spatially variable along the land sea gradient the results of the statistical analysis of the hydrogeochemical parameters are presented in table 1 in the dzh mangrove estuary bottom water salinity ranged from 7 88 to 30 70 psu and the ec values varied from 14 74 to 51 60 ms cm indicating strong tidal mixing the average salinity of the upstream river midstream river downstream river and main estuary were 13 00 17 72 28 29 25 78 psu ph and do increased with salinity from headwaters to the estuary and ranged from 7 00 to 8 0 and from 3 66 to 8 48 mg l respectively the sediment biogenic elements toc tn tp ts fe2o3 and mn and isotope values also exhibited considerable spatial variability fig 2 fig s1 generally the fluvial sediments contained more biogenic elements than marine sediments the contents of toc tn tp ts fe2o3 and mn in the midstream river were the highest with averages of 2 60 0 22 1235 μg g 0 77 73 6 mg kg and 903 2 μg g respectively followed by the upstream river 1 25 0 13 936 7 μg g 0 53 58 6 mg kg and 530 0 μg g the average δ13c value in the main estuary 23 7 was higher compared to the downstream river 24 8 upstream river 25 7 and midstream river 26 9 in contrast the highest average δ15n value was measured in the midstream 6 99 followed by estuary 5 38 downstream 5 15 and upstream 4 94 3 2 grain size distribution of sediments a ternary diagram of the grain size distribution shows that surface sediments were composed primarily of silt and sand fig s2 only the upstream river a section of the midstream river and the upper region of the estuary comprised of more than 25 clay fig s2 sediments in the upstream river and midstream river were mainly clayey silt and silty sand while the downstream river was composed of coarser silty sand in the dzh channel proportions of fine grained sediments decreased slightly from the upper estuary to near the mouth of the harbor whereas the opposite trend was observed for coarse silty sand sediments table s1 the spatial distributions of sediment grain size are depicted in fig s3 generally mean values of fine grained sediments decreased from the upstream 71 16 midstream river 61 94 to the downstream river 50 44 estuary 56 22 on the contrary sand fractions increased gradually up the salinity gradient with mean values of 28 41 upstream 37 32 midstream 43 75 estuary and 49 56 downstream respectively this distribution patterns of sediment texture may be attributed to dynamic diversion a complex interaction between longshore currents and tidal flow similarly near the jiaozhou bay mouth sediment is even dominated by gravel and a deep trough is formed there due to tidal current scouring hu et al 2018 sediment grain size appeared to be impacted by aquaculture activities owing to riverine discharges input of fecal pellets and pseudofeces from intensive shellfish culture can increase the abundance of fine grained benthic sediments xu et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 there are significant positive relationships between biogenic elements and clay content because fecal pellets and pseudofeces increase clay content kennedy et al 2014 the relationships suggest that input of om from upstream shellfish cultures is an important control on som adsorption and elemental cycling in the tidal rivers this finding is supported by previous studies which have shown that granular characteristics can affect the geochemical behavior of organic matter and biogenic elements in sedimentary environments martinez garcia et al 2015 3 3 variations of toc tn δ13c δ15n and elemental ratios the correlation between toc and tn was statistically significant p 0 001 fig 4 a indicating a common source moreover the fitting line intercept was close to zero i e 0 03 suggesting that tn was predominantly organic nitrogen goñi et al 2013 toc content ranged from 0 09 to 4 09 average 0 85 and tn ranged from 0 02 to 0 30 average 0 09 the toc and tn levels in the dzh mangrove estuary were within the range reported for other coastal estuaries affected by aquaculture such as the africa cross river estuary dan et al 2019 rufiji delta minu et al 2020 maowei sea xu et al 2020 and qinglan harbor bao et al 2013 mangrove estuaries without aquaculture have lower toc and tn values than found in the dzh estuary such as conception bay marchand et al 2011 bangladesh sundarban prasad et al 2017 and the rio caeté estuary koch et al 2011 these results suggest that som in estuaries is strongly influenced by the intensity of nearby aquaculture activities c n ratios and δ13c and δ15n values of all samples ranged from 4 07 to 13 44 c n 27 47 to 21 79 δ13c and 3 52 to 11 46 δ15n table 1 typically terrestrial vascular plants have relatively high c n ratios 12 because vegetative material is composed of lignin and cellulose which are nitrogen poor lamb et al 2006 c n ratios of marine plankton tend to be lower studies have shown ratios to range from 4 to 10 with an average between 5 and 7 kirkby et al 2011 in this study the average c n ratio 7 66 was similar to the ratios in abalone culture areas of ailian bay c n 7 46 pan et al 2019 and zhelin bay c n 7 31 gu et al 2017 which have been heavily impacted by aquaculture activities the relationship between δ13c and c n was negative while the relationship between δ15n and c n was positive and both correlations were statistically significant fig 4b 4c additionally c n ratios and δ15n composition gradually decreased from the upper estuary to the lower estuary these results imply that sedimentary organic matter in the upstream regions upstream river midstream river received higher contributions from terrigenous sources relative to the downstream regions downstream river main estuary 3 4 optical characteristics of som three fluorescent components c1 c3 of som were identified using parafac modeling fig 5 the c1 ex em maxima 235 340 440 nm component has been assigned as peak c and identified as terrestrial allochthonous humic like material coble et al 1998 li et al 2020a in some cases c1 like components were considered as microbial degraded diagenetic products of organic matter yamashita et al 2010 du et al 2021 c2 ex em maxima 250 320 390 nm was consistent with the fluorescence spectra of coalescing m and t peaks and was surmised as originating from marine humic like or tryptophan like materials typically this component was found in proteinaceous substances from fresh autochthonous organic matter clark et al 2008 the c3 ex em maxima 395 500 nm component closely resembled soil derived fulvic acid osburn et al 2016 while peaks of similar fluorescent spectra have not been well defined in recent studies in general the relative intensity of c1 c1 was the highest ranging from 51 58 to 76 83 followed by c3 15 46 33 14 and c2 3 82 22 58 slightly higher hix values were observed in the midstream sediments 1 27 4 10 than in other three regions upstream 0 94 2 59 downstream 0 99 2 31 main estuary 0 88 2 64 table s3 indicating a higher degree of som humification and abundance of refractory substances in the middle estuary guo et al 2019 the bix values were similar across all sample sites ranging from 0 51 to 0 74 average 0 62 while the upstream sediment samples had relatively higher bix values average 0 66 table s3 which suggests som source contributions from aquaculture biodeposition yang et al 2014 4 discussion 4 1 relative source contributions of som based on δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing model spatial heterogeneity was observed in som source apportionments of fluvial and marine sediments the δ13c and δ15n values were used in a three endmember mixing model to quantify the relative contributions of som from the three potential sources terrestrial om aquaculture derived om and marine plankton om table s2 and fig 6 b show the monte carlo model results of the proportional source contributions of som in fluvial sediments upstream river midstream river downstream river organic matter was mainly derived from terrestrial sources mean 35 33 while planktonic om mean 63 99 was the dominant source of som in marine benthic sediment main estuary on average the proportion of som originating from terrestrial aquaculture ponds was higher in fluvial sediments 31 76 compared to marine sediments 22 98 these results indicate that aquaculture activities had a large impact on som source and that this effect diminished with increasing distance from aquaculture regions the upstream river draining into the upper estuary received the largest proportion of aquaculture derived organic matter 44 29 followed by the midstream river 27 93 downstream river 27 02 and main estuary 24 23 further the mean δ15n composition of som in the upstream river was 4 94 0 28 fig 6a which is similar to the δ15n composition of shellfish fecal matter biodeposits in ailian bay 5 12 0 20 pan et al 2019 both our δ15n composition values for the upstream river and the values from ailian bay are lower than anthropogenic sewage 10 to 25 which tends to be isotopically rich in heavy nitrogenous components fenech et al 2012 thus our lower observed δ15n values in the upstream river were likely due to fecal matter inputs derived from aquaculture the results are consistent with the high population density along the upstream river as well as the prevalence of aquaculture ponds and wastewater discharge in the area these anthropogenic influences increased organic matter and biogenic elements accumulation and burial in the upstream river the composition and sources of som are also affected by controls of surface water hydrodynamics on suspended particulate organic matter production rates sarà et al 2004 and ayvazian et al 2021 found that weak tidal currents increased particulate organic matter production leading to higher levels of som these findings suggest that fecal matter sourced from aquaculture ponds was deposited and buried in the upstream river and that the weak tidal currents in the upstream river restricted mixing of som sourced from other areas mangroves within the dongzhai harbor influenced som source contributions near the middle estuary the proportions of som from terrestrial sources were high in the midstream 62 87 and upstream 28 30 rivers fig 6b and gradually decreased towards the lower estuary additionally the mean δ13c value 26 91 0 40 of the midstream river sediments located near the middle of the estuary fell within the typical range of c3 plants 29 5 to 24 4 krishna et al 2014 and the highest c n ratio 13 44 was measured in the midstream river near the dongzhai harbor mangrove reserve these results indicate that som in surface sediments of the middle estuary likely originated from mangrove forests the spatial distribution of som derived from marine plankton was nearly opposite the distribution of terrestrial som fig 6b the proportion of plankton derived som was elevated in the dzh main estuary 64 15 and downstream river 48 83 additionally δ13c values gradually increased down the land sea gradient with more positive values in the lower estuary fig 6a s1 these trends are consistent with previous studies showing that plankton δ13c values in estuaries are a function of salinity and range from 23 9 to 18 yamamuro 2000 depending on the source of carbon fixed by phytoplankton lamb et al 2006 the higher levels of plankton derived som in the lower estuary where salinity was higher were likely related to the long water residence times in the dzh channel studies have shown that long water residence times in the dzh channel enhance plankton exposure to sunlight xuan et al 2020 the greater light exposure likely encouraged phytoplankton growth and promoted plankton accumulation on the seafloor in the lower estuary 4 2 constrains on som preservation and degradation estuarine sediments contribute significantly to global biogeochemical cycling of biogenic elements due to the preservation and reactivity of som pools in benthic sediments keil 2017 dan et al 2019 the som pools influence levels of biogenic elements through controls on the sorption release of nutrients in sediments rowley et al 2017 thus it is important to consider factors that affect som preservation and degradation when aiming to develop a better understanding of the role of som on mediating coastal chemical budgets the pca analysis in this study revealed positive correlations among toc tn tp ts fe mn and clay sediments while correlations between sand and biogenic elements were negative fig 7 a the correlations are likely owed to the strong effect of sediment grain size on som preservation in which fine sediments provide greater surface area for som adsorption keith et al 2014 thus the observed correlations indicate that fine grained sediments enhanced the accumulation and preservation of biogenic elements in the dzh mangrove estuary due to the greater mineral surface area available for organic matter sorption the spatial distributions of biogenic elements were similar to the proportion of clay sediments along the estuarine salinity gradient fig 3 s1 this relationship was related to surface water hydrodynamic patterns in general fine benthic sediments such as clays are associated with weak hydrodynamic conditions while high energy environments are characterized by coarser sediments chen et al 2018 at our study site coarser sand sediments were clustered in the lower estuary fig 7a the areas with coarser sediments are higher energy environments with active sediment suspension driven by tides waves and currents pondell and canuel 2017 which limited the burial of som in contrast weak surface water hydrodynamic forces in the upper estuary promoted som deposition and accumulation of biogenic elements aquaculture activity is another factor responsible for som preservation the pca analysis revealed a cluster of aquaculture om and the presence of clay and silt sediments in the upper estuary as well as a positive correlation between toc and aquaculture om r 0 34 p 0 05 fig 7a table s4 this suggests that weak hydrodynamics in the upper estuary promoted deposition of som sourced from aquaculture ponds the higher som deposition was likely due to the influence of aquaculture on increasing sedimentation rates of suspended particles pan et al 2019 the statistical analysis table s4 fig 7b showed a significant positive correlation between toc terrestrial om and fe mn because organic matter interacts strongly with fe mn minerals the positive relationships demonstrate that som can be preserved as a more stable compound via chelation bonding and coprecipitation with mineral grains aftabtalab et al 2022 association of som mineral compounds narrows pore spaces and prevents som decomposition by catalyzing condensation reactions altering molecular structure and inhibiting enzyme access which can significantly reduce remineralization rates of som spivak et al 2019 the stability of such organo mineral interactions varies with their geochemical composition as well as environmental conditions for example in the yangtze river estuary low levels of reactive fe associated with om in mobile muds suggested that frequent physical resuspension resulted in desorption with selective loss of marine som zhao et al 2018 furthermore humic substances with higher molecular weight and aromaticity can serve as the dominant iron binding ligands krachler and krachler 2021 this is likely the case in the dzh estuary which is supported by the cluster of fe mn terrestrial soil derived fulvic acid c3 and hix values in the middle estuary fig 7a redox conditions also play a critical role in controlling som degradation shah walter et al 2018 as shown in fig 7b prominently negative relationships were found among do toc terrestrial om aquaculture om and other biogenic elements while do and marine plankton om increased up the salinity gradient longer exposure of som to oxygenated conditions can result in early decomposition and can destroy the som mineral aggregates further reducing som preservation in surface sediments arnarson and keil 2007 depending on bottom water redox conditions sediment c p ratios can vary significantly with low ratios generally found in oxic conditions and high ratios prevalent in hypoxic or possibly anoxic sediments mort et al 2010 in our study the significant covariation r 0 97 p 0 001 between c p ratios and toc fig s4 was consistent with anoxic conditions indicating that anoxia enhanced som preservation the lower c p ratios of the downstream average 20 97 and main estuary average 20 96 compared to the upstream average 117 05 and midstream average 321 30 implied a more oxidizing environment in the lower estuary moreover som derived from marine plankton was most labile where strong tidal influences and bioturbation produced more oxic conditions in such an environment the plankton derived som would be oxidized more rapidly by the benthic bacterial community cook et al 2007 leading to higher overall som degradation rates in addition the seasonal variation may potentially affect som dynamics in dzh mangrove estuary due to the high riverine discharge aquaculture derived om and terrestrial om would be higher during the wet season summer than dry season winter during the rainy season high temperatures and terrestrial nutrient inputs may promote phytoplankton production leading to an increase in marine plankton derived som it is possible however that low rainfall can result in low river flows turbidity and intensive irradiance during the dry season thereby also favoring phytoplankton growth hoffman and bronk 2006 guo et al 2015 as bottom water temperatures drop in winter biological productivity decreases which can further slow down som degradation and preserve som in mangrove estuarine sediments xu et al 2020 som degradation processes preferentially enrich sediment δ13c relative to δ15n douglas et al 2022 thus differences between our bulk sediment δ13c and δ15n values were used to provide insight into the dominant som degradation processes in dongzhai harbor the δ13c values increased up the salinity gradient and were inversely correlated to c n ratios indicating progressive degradation of som during initial diagenesis lamb et al 2006 showed that c n ratios in the upper and middle estuary of dongzhai harbor can increase due to rapid loss of nitrogen we further observed lower c n ratios enriched δ13c and higher marine plankton om in the lower estuary these observations indicate that autochthonous fresh plankton derived om with low molecular weight was preferentially biodegraded during post depositional processes previous studies have shown that these post depositional processes can preserve nh3 and release co2 or ch4 as decay products dan et al 2019 xuan et al 2019 the spatial trend in average δ13c values were generally similar to δ15n the average δ15n values increased with salinity in sediment samples collected from the upstream river downstream river and main estuary fig 2h this suggests that labile nitrogenous compounds were assimilated during som transformation denk et al 2017 which resulted in general enrichment of 15n isotopic signatures in the residual som from the upper to lower estuary however the highest average δ15n value was measured in the midstream river with a large degree of variability across the individual measurements the variability was likely due to complex interactions between differences in source contributions and diagenetic alteration under different redox conditions canadas et al 2022 4 3 implications for som on mangrove wetland environments the sources composition preservation and degradation processes of som as observed in this study have important implications for mangrove growth and development fig 8 our results show that mangrove litterfall is a key terrestrial source of sedimentary organic matter in certain areas of the dongzhai harbor estuary in turn som entering mangrove wetlands is either produced autochthonously or imported by tides and rivers in the upper estuary high proportions of fine grained sediments and aquaculture derived biodeposits can facilitate som preservation through fine grained sedimentation this process is conducive to shoreland accretion and stability which promotes mangrove forest habitat in face of sea level rise krauss et al 2014 however excessive aquaculture derived om sequestration beyond ecological balance can transform benthic environments from an oxidized to reduced state in response to heightened microbial processing pan et al 2019 our results suggest that sediments in the upstream river are likely to shift to reducing conditions as the upstream river exhibited the highest relative intensity of tryptophan like c2 components average 11 56 sourced from aquaculture under such reducing conditions anaerobic respiration and sulfate reduction can lead to the accumulation of heavy metal sulfides and organic acids boye et al 2017 which could increase the toxicity of the mangrove rhizosphere soil additionally aquaculture ponds surrounding dongzhai harbor have elevated nutrient concentrations and som levels owing to wastewater discharge increasing the risk of eutrophication in mangrove wetlands farther down the estuary in the middle estuary most sources of som were derived from recalcitrant fine grained terrestrial organic matter which has implications for heavy metal phases within mangrove sediments the pca analysis revealed a cluster of terrestrial om c3 hix toc tn tp ts fe and mn fig 7a indicating adsorption of high molecular weight som to biogenic elements li et al 2021 on the one hand fe mn humus complexes can associate with heavy metals thereby reducing heavy metal bioavailability and mobility in sediments chen et al 2020 on the other hand mangrove plants can release oxygen oxidize rhizosphere soil and convert heavy metals into a bioavailable phase which are absorbed by mangrove roots and transported upward to the aboveground part of the plant hu et al 2021 mangrove wetlands are limited in the amount of heavy metals they can purify and when the level of pollution exceeds certain thresholds the wetland ecosystem is damaged resulting in reduced plant growth because metabolic processes are adversely affected maurya and kumari 2021 in the lower estuary where oxic conditions prevailed marine plankton derived bacterial metabolites and by products were the dominant fraction of som this plankton derived om would undergo rapid aerobic degradation due to the large quantity of energy released during oxygen reduction mcdonough et al 2022 the aerobic respiration rates would be higher in the lower oxygenated estuary compared to the hypoxic upper estuary because anaerobic processes yield lower energy per mole of electron acceptor reduced boye et al 2017 the high degradation potential of som in the lower estuary would likely lead to release of inorganic nitrogen phosphorous and other biogenic elements to the overlying water column schmidt et al 2011 zhou et al 2022 the release of these elements from som can increase nutrient supply to mangrove forests banerjee et al 2018 and enhance plant growth and survival even under strong tidal and bioturbation effects 5 conclusion this study explored biogeochemical processes impacting sedimentary organic matter som sources preservation and degradation in the dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary where aquaculture activities are extensive bulk hydrogeochemistry carbon and nitrogen isotopes and optical composition of som was characterized at 46 sampling sites along the land sea estuarine gradient the measurements showed that biogenic element concentrations toc tn tp ts fe and mn and the proportion of benthic clay particles decreased down the land sea salinity gradient a δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing model indicated that som was derived primarily from aquaculture terrestrial sources and marine plankton in the upper middle and lower estuary respectively three som fluorescent components were identified consisting of a terrestrial microbial humic like component c1 a tryptophan like component c2 and a soil derived fulvic acid c3 som can be preserved through sedimentation due to the high proportion of fine grained aquaculture derived biodeposits and weak hydrodynamic conditions in the upper estuary coupled with formation of fe mn humus complexes in the middle estuary the findings also show that microbes can aerobically metabolize som sourced from marine plankton in the downstream oxic environment resulting in faster decomposition of som additionally relationships between c n ratios vs δ13c and δ15n values indicate progressive som degradation including initial diagenesis and post depositional processes these findings provide new insights into the factors that affect som dynamics along land sea transition zones and have important implications for the environmental sustainability of mangrove estuaries in density populated regions with aquaculture production

2244,sedimentary organic matter som production and transformation processes have a prominent role in regulating biogenic element cycling in mangrove ecosystems however aquaculture biodeposits can substantially affect source apportionments and biogeochemical processes of som within mangroves in this study natural stable isotopes 13c and 15n spectral techniques and hydrogeochemical analysis were used to elucidate the sources preservation and degradation of som across the dongzhai harbor dzh estuary southern china where aquaculture systems are extensive along the estuarine salinity gradient sediment and bottom water samples were collected from the upper fluvial mangrove zones to the lower marine endmember results indicated that source contributions to som along the estuarine gradient were spatially heterogeneous aquaculture derived organic matter was the largest contributor to the sanjiang river 44 29 in the upper estuary and terrestrial sources from c3 mangrove forests were highest in the yanfeng east river 62 87 near the middle estuary farther seaward marine plankton sources were elevated in the dongzhai harbor channel 64 15 and yanfeng west river 48 83 of the lower estuary the terrestrial microbial humic like component c1 tryptophan like component c2 and soil derived fulvic acid c3 were identified from the samples using fluorescence excitation emission matrices and parallel factor analysis eem parafac results show that in the upper and middle estuary som was preserved by sedimentation due to the abundance of fine grained aquaculture derived biodeposits weak hydrodynamic conditions and the formation of fe mn humus complexes in contrast in the lower estuary som originated from marine plankton and was rapidly degraded via aerobic respiration moreover correlations between δ13c and δ15n values vs c n ratios further suggest progressive som degradation from initial diagenesis to post depositional geochemical processes this study provides new insights into aquacultural and environmental factors controlling som preservation and degradation within estuaries the findings have implications for shoreline stability and the protection and restoration of estuarine mangrove wetlands keywords organic matter preservation isotope mangrove estuary aquaculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benthic sediments serve as sources and sinks of organic matter om playing a pivotal role in controlling global biogeochemical cycling of sedimentary organic matter som and biogenic elements schartup et al 2014 estuarine som can have multiple sources including allochthonous inputs e g soil plant materials and waste discharge bauer et al 2013 and autochthonous production e g in situ marine plankton derived substances samantaray and sanyal 2022 furthermore over 90 of som can be trapped and preserved in sediments through incorporation into fe mn hydr oxide and clay minerals which can reduce the bioavailability of som in environments where redox conditions oscillate conant et al 2011 chen et al 2018 depending on the depositional environment and the nature of som the quantity and quality of buried som can vary considerably resmi et al 2016 consequently owing largely to the coupled influence of marine and terrestrial sources som in mangrove estuaries is compositionally complex and often exhibits varying degrees of reactivity microbial processing of som is a chemically important process that affects elemental cycling and mangrove health in the coastal zone mangroves thrive in land ocean transition zones where there are high levels of sediment deposition an abundance of organic rich deposits and where anoxic conditions persist alongi 2014 deborde et al 2015 wang et al 2019 nevertheless hydrodynamic e g tide typhoon storm surge and sea level rise and anthropogenic e g aquaculture agriculture and urbanization pressures are causing mangroves to disappear at an alarming rate marchand et al 2011 typically wastes produced by marine aquaculture increase som deposition rates by one or two orders of magnitude above natural background levels and also act as nutrient and energy sources for microbes martinez garcia et al 2015 benthic environments with low oxygen levels motivate anaerobic metabolic pathways primarily sulfate reduction fe mn respiration and methanogenesis leading to som degradation processes kappler et al 2021 moreover several microbial metabolites such as sulfide h2s reduced iron fes trace elements and organic acids produced in hypoxia conditions are toxic to mangrove forests alongi 2021 therefore knowledge of the sources and processes impacting the som preservation and degradation is essential to understand the transport and transformations of biogenic elements which ultimately regulate the health of coastal mangrove wetland environments analysis of stable isotopic compositions 13c and 15n and mixing models are effective methods for estimating som sources and degradation processes derrien et al 2019 in addition fluorescence spectroscopy excitation emission matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac have been successfully applied to characterize som sources and dynamics in coastal ecosystems chen and hur 2015 qiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 fluorescent om is primarily composed of humic substances that are preferentially preserved in sediments under anoxic conditions while other components are readily metabolized by heterotrophic bacteria such as aromatic amino acids proteins chen and jaffe 2014 dongzhai harbor hainan island china is the first mangrove nature reserve in china as aquaculture and tourism have grown rapidly in the past six decades the mangrove area has been significantly reduced from initial 40 km2 to 17 km2 he et al 2019 high level shrimp farming has caused eutrophication of mangrove wetland water bodies further triggering the outbreak of wood boring isopod sphaeroma species xu et al 2014 these wood borers attacked the mangroves species bruguiera spp mostly and followed by ceriops tagal avicennia marina kandelia obovata and aegiceras corniculatu thiri and yang 2022 most previous studies have analyzed elemental composition and stable carbon isotopes to characterize som in coastal zones such as the yangtze river estuary zhou et al 2022 pearl river delta dan et al 2021 and pichavaram estuary naidu et al 2022 however in complex mangrove estuaries with intensive aquacultural activities the decomposition and burial processes of som has received little attention to date notably the continuous supply of labile biodeposits from aquaculture ponds to benthic sediments may promote the remineralization of refractory som which can affect biogenic element budgets in mangrove ecosystems santos et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the relative contribution of som from heterogeneous sources using δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing models 2 identify key constrains on som preservation and degradation and 3 characterize som biogeochemical processes that affect mangrove environments along estuarine salinity gradients 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the dongzhai harbor dzh mangrove estuary covering an area of 100 km2 is located in the northeastern part of hainan island china n 19 51 20 01 e 110 30 110 37 liu et al 2019 and has an irregular semidiurnal tide averagely there is 1 92 m tidal range during spring tides and 0 38 m during neap tides li et al 2013 the estuary is funnel shaped and is connected to the qiongzhou strait to the north fig 1 the mean annual rainfall in the region is 1676 mm of which 80 falls from may to october xiong et al 2018 the mangrove in dongzhai harbor estuary occupy a 40 km2 area and are located in three distinct areas of the estuary sanjiang river hereafter termed as the upstream river yanfeng east river midstream river and yanfeng west river downstream river xia et al 2021 generally the northeast side of the estuary is an alluvial floodplain consisting mainly of silty sand sandy silt and gravel in contrast the southwest region is primarily composed of quaternary basalt and tuff with lateritic soils due to long term weathering li et al 2013 the estuary is bordered by tidal rivers and contains multiple shrimp and shellfish ponds that are raised above sea level aquaculture and densely populated areas are concentrated around sanjiang river located in the southern part of dongzhai harbor in november 2019 46 benthic sediment samples were collected from a depth interval of 0 10 cm below the bed using a stainless steel peterson grab sampler fig 1 samples were collected during a flooding tide stage by cruising together with several boats from the most downstream to upstream sampling sites three sets of sediment subsamples were then collected from each grab sample the subsamples were mixed to obtain a representative sample of the sediment at each sampling site at each sampling site bottom water hydrochemical parameters including ph salinity s ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured on site with a calibrated portable multimeter model hq40d hach company sampling spanned the land sea transition zone and included three large mangrove tidal rivers and within the dongzhai harbor channel for a total of four areas fig 1c thus the sampling sites captured the full range of som characteristics within and surrounding the mangrove estuary and included areas near aquaculture ponds the samples were classified according to location along the land sea gradient samples representing marine sediments are labeled s24 s40 orange in fig 1c the sites labeled s1 s11 blue s12 s17 purple and s18 s23 pink are fluvial sites and are located in the downstream river midstream

monte carlo simulations of isotope ratios bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach was applied to quantify the relative contributions of potential sources to som andersson 2011 bosch et al 2015 li et al 2020b the mcmc computations produced 100 million normally distributed random numbers based on an δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing temm model one million of these values were then used to estimate the proportions of som sources li et al 2020c statistical parameters e g mean median maximum minimum and standard deviation were computed from the temm model the 13c 15n isotopic mixing

is the c or n concentration of source i and xi is the fractional sediment mass contribution of source i wang et al 2021 the δ13c and δ15n endmember values were selected by dividing the som samples into three pools terrestrial aquaculture and marine these pools make up the dominate land cover within and surrounding the estuary yan et al 2021 the mean δ13c and δ15n values measured in the samples of each pool were defined as the end member the δ13c and δ15n isotopic values of the terrestrial endmember were 26 9 0 40 and 7 0 1 46 while those for the marine endmember were 23 7 0 96 and 5 4 0 95 respectively the benthic sediments in the upstream river were used to define the aquaculture endmember δ13c 25 7 1 00 δ15n 4 9 0 28 because aquaculture ponds are extensive in the area 2 4 statistical

software inc northampton ma statistically significant differences were evaluated at the p 0 05 levels using the least significant differences lsd 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical properties bottom water salinity ph and do were spatially variable along the land sea gradient the results of the statistical analysis of the hydrogeochemical parameters are presented in table 1 in the dzh mangrove estuary bottom water salinity ranged from 7 88 to 30 70 psu and the ec values varied from 14 74 to 51 60 ms cm indicating strong tidal mixing the average salinity of the upstream river midstream river downstream river and main estuary were 13 00 17 72 28 29 25 78 psu ph and do increased with salinity from headwaters to the estuary and ranged from 7 00 to 8 0 and from 3 66 to 8 48 mg l respectively the sediment biogenic elements toc tn tp ts fe2o3 and mn and isotope values also exhibited considerable spatial variability fig 2 fig s1 generally the fluvial sediments contained more biogenic elements than marine sediments the contents of toc tn tp ts fe2o3 and mn in the midstream river were the highest with averages of 2 60 0 22 1235 μg g 0 77 73 6 mg kg and 903 2 μg g respectively followed by the upstream river 1 25 0 13 936 7 μg g 0 53 58 6 mg kg and 530 0 μg g the average δ13c value in the main estuary 23 7 was higher compared to the downstream river 24 8 upstream river 25 7 and midstream river 26 9 in contrast the highest average δ15n value was measured in the midstream 6 99 followed by estuary 5 38 downstream 5 15 and upstream 4 94 3 2 grain size distribution of sediments a ternary diagram of the grain size distribution shows that surface sediments were composed primarily of silt and sand fig s2 only the upstream river a section of the midstream river and the upper region of the estuary comprised of more than 25 clay fig s2 sediments in the upstream river and midstream river were mainly clayey silt and silty sand while the downstream river was composed of coarser silty sand in the dzh channel proportions of fine grained sediments decreased slightly from the upper estuary to near the mouth of the harbor whereas the opposite trend was observed for coarse silty sand sediments table s1 the spatial distributions of sediment grain size are depicted in fig s3 generally mean values of fine grained sediments decreased from the upstream 71 16 midstream river 61 94 to the downstream river 50 44 estuary 56 22 on the contrary sand fractions increased gradually up the salinity gradient with mean values of 28 41 upstream 37 32 midstream 43 75 estuary and 49 56 downstream respectively this distribution patterns of sediment texture may be attributed to dynamic diversion a complex interaction between longshore currents and tidal flow similarly near the jiaozhou bay mouth sediment is even dominated by gravel and a deep trough is formed there due to tidal current scouring hu et al 2018 sediment grain size appeared to be impacted by aquaculture activities owing to riverine discharges input of fecal pellets and pseudofeces from intensive shellfish culture can increase the abundance of fine grained benthic sediments xu et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 there are significant positive relationships between biogenic elements and clay content because fecal pellets and pseudofeces increase clay content kennedy et al 2014 the relationships suggest that input of om from upstream shellfish cultures is an important control on som adsorption and elemental cycling in the tidal rivers this finding is supported by previous studies which have shown that granular characteristics can affect the geochemical behavior of organic matter and biogenic elements in sedimentary environments martinez garcia et al 2015 3 3 variations of toc tn δ13c δ15n and elemental ratios the correlation between toc and tn was statistically significant p 0 001 fig 4 a indicating a common source moreover the fitting line intercept was close to zero i e 0 03 suggesting that tn was predominantly organic nitrogen goñi et al 2013 toc content ranged from 0 09 to 4 09 average 0 85 and tn ranged from 0 02 to 0 30 average 0 09 the toc and tn levels in the dzh mangrove estuary were within the range reported for other coastal estuaries affected by aquaculture such as the africa cross river estuary dan et al 2019 rufiji delta minu et al 2020 maowei sea xu et al 2020 and qinglan harbor bao et al 2013 mangrove estuaries without aquaculture have lower toc and tn values than found in the dzh estuary such as conception bay marchand et al 2011 bangladesh sundarban prasad et al 2017 and the rio caeté estuary koch et al 2011 these results suggest that som in estuaries is strongly influenced by the intensity of nearby aquaculture activities c n ratios and δ13c and δ15n values of all samples ranged from 4 07 to 13 44 c n 27 47 to 21 79 δ13c and 3 52 to 11 46 δ15n table 1 typically terrestrial vascular plants have relatively high c n ratios 12 because vegetative material is composed of lignin and cellulose which are nitrogen poor lamb et al 2006 c n ratios of marine plankton tend to be lower studies have shown ratios to range from 4 to 10 with an average between 5 and 7 kirkby et al 2011 in this study the average c n ratio 7 66 was similar to the ratios in abalone culture areas of ailian bay c n 7 46 pan et al 2019 and zhelin bay c n 7 31 gu et al 2017 which have been heavily impacted by aquaculture activities the relationship between δ13c and c n was negative while the relationship between δ15n and c n was positive and both correlations were statistically significant fig 4b 4c additionally c n ratios and δ15n composition gradually decreased from the upper estuary to the lower estuary these results imply that sedimentary organic matter in the upstream regions upstream river midstream river received higher contributions from terrigenous sources relative to the downstream regions downstream river main estuary 3 4 optical characteristics of som three fluorescent components c1 c3 of som were identified using parafac modeling fig 5 the c1 ex em maxima 235 340 440 nm component has been assigned as peak c and identified as terrestrial allochthonous humic like material coble et al 1998 li et al 2020a in some cases c1 like components were considered as microbial degraded diagenetic products of organic matter yamashita et al 2010 du et al 2021 c2 ex em maxima 250 320 390 nm was consistent with the fluorescence spectra of coalescing m and t peaks and was surmised as originating from marine humic like or tryptophan like materials typically this component was found in proteinaceous substances from fresh autochthonous organic matter clark et al 2008 the c3 ex em maxima 395 500 nm component closely resembled soil derived fulvic acid osburn et al 2016 while peaks of similar fluorescent spectra have not been well defined in recent studies in general the relative intensity of c1 c1 was the highest ranging from 51 58 to 76 83 followed by c3 15 46 33 14 and c2 3 82 22 58 slightly higher hix values were observed in the midstream sediments 1 27 4 10 than in other three regions upstream 0 94 2 59 downstream 0 99 2 31 main estuary 0 88 2 64 table s3 indicating a higher degree of som humification and abundance of refractory substances in the middle estuary guo et al 2019 the bix values were similar across all sample sites ranging from 0 51 to 0 74 average 0 62 while the upstream sediment samples had relatively higher bix values average 0 66 table s3 which suggests som source contributions from aquaculture biodeposition yang et al 2014 4 discussion 4 1 relative source contributions of som based on δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing model spatial heterogeneity was observed in som source apportionments of fluvial and marine sediments the δ13c and δ15n values were used in a three endmember mixing model to quantify the relative contributions of som from the three potential sources terrestrial om aquaculture derived om and marine plankton om table s2 and fig 6 b show the monte carlo model results of the proportional source contributions of som in fluvial sediments upstream river midstream river downstream river organic matter was mainly derived from terrestrial sources mean 35 33 while planktonic om mean 63 99 was the dominant source of som in marine benthic sediment main estuary on average the proportion of som originating from terrestrial aquaculture ponds was higher in fluvial sediments 31 76 compared to marine sediments 22 98 these results indicate that aquaculture activities had a large impact on som source and that this effect diminished with increasing distance from aquaculture regions the upstream river draining into the upper estuary received the largest proportion of aquaculture derived organic matter 44 29 followed by the midstream river 27 93 downstream river 27 02 and main estuary 24 23 further the mean δ15n composition of som in the upstream river was 4 94 0 28 fig 6a which is similar to the δ15n composition of shellfish fecal matter biodeposits in ailian bay 5 12 0 20 pan et al 2019 both our δ15n composition values for the upstream river and the values from ailian bay are lower than anthropogenic sewage 10 to 25 which tends to be isotopically rich in heavy nitrogenous components fenech et al 2012 thus our lower observed δ15n values in the upstream river were likely due to fecal matter inputs derived from aquaculture the results are consistent with the high population density along the upstream river as well as the prevalence of aquaculture ponds and wastewater discharge in the area these anthropogenic influences increased organic matter and biogenic elements accumulation and burial in the upstream river the composition and sources of som are also affected by controls of surface water hydrodynamics on suspended particulate organic matter production rates sarà et al 2004 and ayvazian et al 2021 found that weak tidal currents increased particulate organic matter production leading to higher levels of som these findings suggest that fecal matter sourced from aquaculture ponds was deposited and buried in the upstream river and that the weak tidal currents in the upstream river restricted mixing of som sourced from other areas mangroves within the dongzhai harbor influenced som source contributions near the middle estuary the proportions of som from terrestrial sources were high in the midstream 62 87 and upstream 28 30 rivers fig 6b and gradually decreased towards the lower estuary additionally the mean δ13c value 26 91 0 40 of the midstream river sediments located near the middle of the estuary fell within the typical range of c3 plants 29 5 to 24 4 krishna et al 2014 and the highest c n ratio 13 44 was measured in the midstream river near the dongzhai harbor mangrove reserve these results indicate that som in surface sediments of the middle estuary likely originated from mangrove forests the spatial distribution of som derived from marine plankton was nearly opposite the distribution of terrestrial som fig 6b the proportion of plankton derived som was elevated in the dzh main estuary 64 15 and downstream river 48 83 additionally δ13c values gradually increased down the land sea gradient with more positive values in the lower estuary fig 6a s1 these trends are consistent with previous studies showing that plankton δ13c values in estuaries are a function of salinity and range from 23 9 to 18 yamamuro 2000 depending on the source of carbon fixed by phytoplankton lamb et al 2006 the higher levels of plankton derived som in the lower estuary where salinity was higher were likely related to the long water residence times in the dzh channel studies have shown that long water residence times in the dzh channel enhance plankton exposure to sunlight xuan et al 2020 the greater light exposure likely encouraged phytoplankton growth and promoted plankton accumulation on the seafloor in the lower estuary 4 2 constrains on som preservation and degradation estuarine sediments contribute significantly to global biogeochemical cycling of biogenic elements due to the preservation and reactivity of som pools in benthic sediments keil 2017 dan et al 2019 the som pools influence levels of biogenic elements through controls on the sorption release of nutrients in sediments rowley et al 2017 thus it is important to consider factors that affect som preservation and degradation when aiming to develop a better understanding of the role of som on mediating coastal chemical budgets the pca analysis in this study revealed positive correlations among toc tn tp ts fe mn and clay sediments while correlations between sand and biogenic elements were negative fig 7 a the correlations are likely owed to the strong effect of sediment grain size on som preservation in which fine sediments provide greater surface area for som adsorption keith et al 2014 thus the observed correlations indicate that fine grained sediments enhanced the accumulation and preservation of biogenic elements in the dzh mangrove estuary due to the greater mineral surface area available for organic matter sorption the spatial distributions of biogenic elements were similar to the proportion of clay sediments along the estuarine salinity gradient fig 3 s1 this relationship was related to surface water hydrodynamic patterns in general fine benthic sediments such as clays are associated with weak hydrodynamic conditions while high energy environments are characterized by coarser sediments chen et al 2018 at our study site coarser sand sediments were clustered in the lower estuary fig 7a the areas with coarser sediments are higher energy environments with active sediment suspension driven by tides waves and currents pondell and canuel 2017 which limited the burial of som in contrast weak surface water hydrodynamic forces in the upper estuary promoted som deposition and accumulation of biogenic elements aquaculture activity is another factor responsible for som preservation the pca analysis revealed a cluster of aquaculture om and the presence of clay and silt sediments in the upper estuary as well as a positive correlation between toc and aquaculture om r 0 34 p 0 05 fig 7a table s4 this suggests that weak hydrodynamics in the upper estuary promoted deposition of som sourced from aquaculture ponds the higher som deposition was likely due to the influence of aquaculture on increasing sedimentation rates of suspended particles pan et al 2019 the statistical analysis table s4 fig 7b showed a significant positive correlation between toc terrestrial om and fe mn because organic matter interacts strongly with fe mn minerals the positive relationships demonstrate that som can be preserved as a more stable compound via chelation bonding and coprecipitation with mineral grains aftabtalab et al 2022 association of som mineral compounds narrows pore spaces and prevents som decomposition by catalyzing condensation reactions altering molecular structure and inhibiting enzyme access which can significantly reduce remineralization rates of som spivak et al 2019 the stability of such organo mineral interactions varies with their geochemical composition as well as environmental conditions for example in the yangtze river estuary low levels of reactive fe associated with om in mobile muds suggested that frequent physical resuspension resulted in desorption with selective loss of marine som zhao et al 2018 furthermore humic substances with higher molecular weight and aromaticity can serve as the dominant iron binding ligands krachler and krachler 2021 this is likely the case in the dzh estuary which is supported by the cluster of fe mn terrestrial soil derived fulvic acid c3 and hix values in the middle estuary fig 7a redox conditions also play a critical role in controlling som degradation shah walter et al 2018 as shown in fig 7b prominently negative relationships were found among do toc terrestrial om aquaculture om and other biogenic elements while do and marine plankton om increased up the salinity gradient longer exposure of som to oxygenated conditions can result in early decomposition and can destroy the som mineral aggregates further reducing som preservation in surface sediments arnarson and keil 2007 depending on bottom water redox conditions sediment c p ratios can vary significantly with low ratios generally found in oxic conditions and high ratios prevalent in hypoxic or possibly anoxic sediments mort et al 2010 in our study the significant covariation r 0 97 p 0 001 between c p ratios and toc fig s4 was consistent with anoxic conditions indicating that anoxia enhanced som preservation the lower c p ratios of the downstream average 20 97 and main estuary average 20 96 compared to the upstream average 117 05 and midstream average 321 30 implied a more oxidizing environment in the lower estuary moreover som derived from marine plankton was most labile where strong tidal influences and bioturbation produced more oxic conditions in such an environment the plankton derived som would be oxidized more rapidly by the benthic bacterial community cook et al 2007 leading to higher overall som degradation rates in addition the seasonal variation may potentially affect som dynamics in dzh mangrove estuary due to the high riverine discharge aquaculture derived om and terrestrial om would be higher during the wet season summer than dry season winter during the rainy season high temperatures and terrestrial nutrient inputs may promote phytoplankton production leading to an increase in marine plankton derived som it is possible however that low rainfall can result in low river flows turbidity and intensive irradiance during the dry season thereby also favoring phytoplankton growth hoffman and bronk 2006 guo et al 2015 as bottom water temperatures drop in winter biological productivity decreases which can further slow down som degradation and preserve som in mangrove estuarine sediments xu et al 2020 som degradation processes preferentially enrich sediment δ13c relative to δ15n douglas et al 2022 thus differences between our bulk sediment δ13c and δ15n values were used to provide insight into the dominant som degradation processes in dongzhai harbor the δ13c values increased up the salinity gradient and were inversely correlated to c n ratios indicating progressive degradation of som during initial diagenesis lamb et al 2006 showed that c n ratios in the upper and middle estuary of dongzhai harbor can increase due to rapid loss of nitrogen we further observed lower c n ratios enriched δ13c and higher marine plankton om in the lower estuary these observations indicate that autochthonous fresh plankton derived om with low molecular weight was preferentially biodegraded during post depositional processes previous studies have shown that these post depositional processes can preserve nh3 and release co2 or ch4 as decay products dan et al 2019 xuan et al 2019 the spatial trend in average δ13c values were generally similar to δ15n the average δ15n values increased with salinity in sediment samples collected from the upstream river downstream river and main estuary fig 2h this suggests that labile nitrogenous compounds were assimilated during som transformation denk et al 2017 which resulted in general enrichment of 15n isotopic signatures in the residual som from the upper to lower estuary however the highest average δ15n value was measured in the midstream river with a large degree of variability across the individual measurements the variability was likely due to complex interactions between differences in source contributions and diagenetic alteration under different redox conditions canadas et al 2022 4 3 implications for som on mangrove wetland environments the sources composition preservation and degradation processes of som as observed in this study have important implications for mangrove growth and development fig 8 our results show that mangrove litterfall is a key terrestrial source of sedimentary organic matter in certain areas of the dongzhai harbor estuary in turn som entering mangrove wetlands is either produced autochthonously or imported by tides and rivers in the upper estuary high proportions of fine grained sediments and aquaculture derived biodeposits can facilitate som preservation through fine grained sedimentation this process is conducive to shoreland accretion and stability which promotes mangrove forest habitat in face of sea level rise krauss et al 2014 however excessive aquaculture derived om sequestration beyond ecological balance can transform benthic environments from an oxidized to reduced state in response to heightened microbial processing pan et al 2019 our results suggest that sediments in the upstream river are likely to shift to reducing conditions as the upstream river exhibited the highest relative intensity of tryptophan like c2 components average 11 56 sourced from aquaculture under such reducing conditions anaerobic respiration and sulfate reduction can lead to the accumulation of heavy metal sulfides and organic acids boye et al 2017 which could increase the toxicity of the mangrove rhizosphere soil additionally aquaculture ponds surrounding dongzhai harbor have elevated nutrient concentrations and som levels owing to wastewater discharge increasing the risk of eutrophication in mangrove wetlands farther down the estuary in the middle estuary most sources of som were derived from recalcitrant fine grained terrestrial organic matter which has implications for heavy metal phases within mangrove sediments the pca analysis revealed a cluster of terrestrial om c3 hix toc tn tp ts fe and mn fig 7a indicating adsorption of high molecular weight som to biogenic elements li et al 2021 on the one hand fe mn humus complexes can associate with heavy metals thereby reducing heavy metal bioavailability and mobility in sediments chen et al 2020 on the other hand mangrove plants can release oxygen oxidize rhizosphere soil and convert heavy metals into a bioavailable phase which are absorbed by mangrove roots and transported upward to the aboveground part of the plant hu et al 2021 mangrove wetlands are limited in the amount of heavy metals they can purify and when the level of pollution exceeds certain thresholds the wetland ecosystem is damaged resulting in reduced plant growth because metabolic processes are adversely affected maurya and kumari 2021 in the lower estuary where oxic conditions prevailed marine plankton derived bacterial metabolites and by products were the dominant fraction of som this plankton derived om would undergo rapid aerobic degradation due to the large quantity of energy released during oxygen reduction mcdonough et al 2022 the aerobic respiration rates would be higher in the lower oxygenated estuary compared to the hypoxic upper estuary because anaerobic processes yield lower energy per mole of electron acceptor reduced boye et al 2017 the high degradation potential of som in the lower estuary would likely lead to release of inorganic nitrogen phosphorous and other biogenic elements to the overlying water column schmidt et al 2011 zhou et al 2022 the release of these elements from som can increase nutrient supply to mangrove forests banerjee et al 2018 and enhance plant growth and survival even under strong tidal and bioturbation effects 5 conclusion this study explored biogeochemical processes impacting sedimentary organic matter som sources preservation and degradation in the dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary where aquaculture activities are extensive bulk hydrogeochemistry carbon and nitrogen isotopes and optical composition of som was characterized at 46 sampling sites along the land sea estuarine gradient the measurements showed that biogenic element concentrations toc tn tp ts fe and mn and the proportion of benthic clay particles decreased down the land sea salinity gradient a δ13c and δ15n three endmember mixing model indicated that som was derived primarily from aquaculture terrestrial sources and marine plankton in the upper middle and lower estuary respectively three som fluorescent components were identified consisting of a terrestrial microbial humic like component c1 a tryptophan like component c2 and a soil derived fulvic acid c3 som can be preserved through sedimentation due to the high proportion of fine grained aquaculture derived biodeposits and weak hydrodynamic conditions in the upper estuary coupled with formation of fe mn humus complexes in the middle estuary the findings also show that microbes can aerobically metabolize som sourced from marine plankton in the downstream oxic environment resulting in faster decomposition of som additionally relationships between c n ratios vs δ13c and δ15n values indicate progressive som degradation including initial diagenesis and post depositional processes these findings provide new insights into the factors that affect som dynamics along land sea transition zones and have important implications for the environmental sustainability of mangrove estuaries in density populated regions with aquaculture production
