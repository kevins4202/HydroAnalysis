5720,how the water transfer imposes impacts on the groundwater in the water receiving area is still unknown here we employed hydrometric observations hydrogeochemical analyses and data analysis methods to address this issue taking one of the yellow river water transfer project of china for example we found that the interaction between river and groundwater is totally changed by the water transfer and the impact of the water transfer on groundwater is confined by the high stream gradient with the water transfer the natural annual pattern of rainy season high river flow is inversed with low flow in rainy seasons and high flow during the water transfer moreover the river stage is always higher than the groundwater level throughout the year the usual bidirectional river groundwater hydraulic gradient is altered to be a gradient always away from the river the groundwater directly connects with the river water the regime of groundwater level follows the change of the river stage even in the valley side a long term standing groundwater mound is formed within the riparian zone due to the continuous recharge from the water receiving river the transferred yellow river water is hydrochemically featured by high ec value and concentrations of na and cl the hydrochemical features of the water receiving river are obviously changed by the transferred yellow river water the hydrochemical impact of the river on the groundwater is mainly confined to the riparian zone and some low reach transections despite of the dominated control of the river on the valley groundwater table the high stream gradient trends to produce the downstream groundwater flow and hinder the lateral groundwater flow from river to valley sides in the upper reaches responsible for the confined impact on groundwater our study highlights that the stream gradient could obviously influence the river water and groundwater interaction promoting or confining the impact of river water on groundwater keywords narrow river valley stream gradient losing river mountain block recharge anthropogenic disturbance 1 introduction water is a precious natural resource making the earth a vibrant planet however the distribution of water especially the freshwater is extremely uneven inter basin water transfer ibwt projects such as the chinese south to north water transfer project the north american water and power alliance the canadian james bay project and the lake chenghai water diversion projects balance the regional uneven distribution and meet increasing demands for freshwater by artificially reallocating surface water resources jain et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2019 recently the indian government has proposed about 30 ibwt links over 37 rivers aiming to increase water availability water quality public health status and other socioeconomic aspects by homogenizing distribution of water resources kumar and verma 2020 the portion of the global water withdrawal by ibwt projects is expected to rise to 25 percent by 2025 gohari et al 2013 the implementation of the ibwt projects may cause changes of the physical and chemical characteristics of water the local hydrological cycle and the water quality in both water supply areas and water receiving areas such changes are two sided zhuang 2016 the negative impacts such as expansion of invasive species gallardo and aldridge 2018 acceleration of biotic homogenization daga et al 2019 degradation of groundwater dependent eco environment zhu et al 2018 and so on were reported to mitigate the negative impacts hundreds of millions of dollars should be paid by water receiving basins as compensation to the water supply basin ahmadi et al 2019 and an intelligent water allocation methodology for establishing optimal inter basin water transfer schemes is needed zhou et al 2017 in addition groundwater sustainable development and management needs more attention in an ibwt strategy yao et al 2019 because groundwater as an important freshwater source tends to be impacted by the ibwt through groundwater and surface water gw sw interaction however impacts of ibwt on groundwater of receiving basins and its factors remain unclear the gw sw interaction is a key issue related to impacts of ibwt on groundwater in a hydrogeological unit groundwater and surface water are usually in hydraulic connectivity state water and the dissolved substances can exchange between groundwater and surface water under a hydraulic gradient which is the so called gw sw interaction verification of impacts of ibwt on groundwater and identification of its factors should be on the basis of the gw sw interaction study however the ibwt projects would disturb the hydrological processes of the local water cycle the impact of ibwt on the gw sw interaction and the outcome of this impact is a matter of strong scientific interest different methods have been employed to explore the gw sw interaction the current methods can be divided into three categories including direct measurements model simulations and tracer based diagnostic methods direct measurements of the amount of water exchange are usually carried out at a point of field hydrological models can draw a whole picture of gw sw interaction in various scales however the accuracy of modeling results is greatly influenced by spatial heterogeneity of sediments availability of observation data and uncertainty of the model the gw sw connectivity is often accompanied by the consistency of spatial and temporal variations of major ions compositions and concentrations brindha et al 2014 oyarzún et al 2015a therefore tracing physicochemical changes in water becomes a well recognized method to identify and quantify the gw sw interaction in recent years tracer based diagnostic methods usually combine hydrogeochemical diagnosis and data analysis methods supporting a robust identification of gw sw interaction yuan et al 2013 oyarzún et al 2015b yuan et al 2017 matiatos et al 2018 the use of multiple techniques including physicochemical parameters hydrogeochemical compositions environmental isotope analyses and data analysis methods can effectively reduce the uncertainty of analyses of the gw sw interaction burnett et al 2010 martinez et al 2015 xing et al 2016 with global population growth and economic development the issue of water resources has constrained human sustainable development the spatial mismatch of water resources and socio economic developments is common throughout the world making water transfer one of the widely adopted solutions to achieve a reliable assessment of the impact of a water transfer project on groundwater of the receiving area hydrometric observation hydrogeochemistry isotope hydrology and data analysis methods were combined and cross validated this paper aims to clarify the impact of water transfer on the gw sw interaction and its consequence in addition the influences of the stream gradient on the impact of the water transfer are also discussed this study contributes to a thorough evaluation of potential risks of the ibwt and sustainable protection of groundwater resource 2 study area the fen river is the second largest tributary of the yellow river with a length more than 710 km the yellow river water is transferred into the headwater area of the fen river f01z at a rate of 3 2 108 m3 yr to meet the domestic agricultural and industrial needs of taiyuan the largest city in the fen river basin with a population of 4 5 millions the transferred yellow river water flows through an 86 kilometer long natural river channel before flowing into the fenhe reservoir f18 the water receiving river valley is the study area fig 1 which has been recognized as the water conservation area of taiyuan the study area the north south trending narrow river valley locates at n38 15 n38 74 and e111 82 e112 12 with the valley bottom elevation changing from 1490 m to 1130 m based on our field survey the study area has a semi arid and semi humid monsoon climate the annual precipitation usually changes from 380 mm to 500 mm about 70 of the annual rainfall occurs in rainy seasons from mid june to mid september the annual average temperature is about 7 the riparian zone of the water receiving river reach is constrained by 2 meter high stone dikes unauthorized activities are prohibited in the riparian zone the land cover is grassland in the riparian zone and farmland out of the riparian zone villages scatter at the both sides of the river the pore water occurs in the valley fill sediments the fissure water occurs in the mountain blocks on the both sides of the valley bottom the valley fill sediments are mainly composed of fluvial gravels and course sands in the upper reach of f09 fine sands and loess like materials in the lower reach of f09 sandstone limestone dolomite and shale outcrop bounding the valley bottom fig 1 the yellow river water mixes with the fen river water in toumaying which is nearly 15 km away from the river source the yellow river water is injected at a rate nearly 15 m3 s which is roughly 30 times higher than the dry season flow of the fen river at this site the water transfer only shuts on periods of february march and august october to avoid freeze or the rainy season high flows tributaries of the fen river contribute a river flow around 3 m3 s yuan et al 2018 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and measurement groundwater occurring in the valley fill sediments the pore water and mountain blocks the fissure water and river water were sampled during the water transfer on june 2012 may 2014 and may 2015 and the intervals of the water transfer on august 2012 september 2014 and september 2015 the river water was sampled roughly every 5 km along the river from toumaying the pore water was sampled from boreholes 3 4 m in depth the riparian zone and domestic wells 3 4 m in depth out of the riparian zone the fissure water was sampled on the both sides of the valley wells with depth varying 6 8 m the river water was sampled using a bucket near the center of the river groundwater was sampled using a stainless steel sampler with check valve at the bottom before sampling the depth of the groundwater table was measured the water drawn by a peristaltic pump was sent to a flow through device to measure the water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec μs cm oxidation reduction potential orp in situ dkk toa corporation model wm 22ep water samples were collected in a 100 ml syringe and filtered immediately through 0 45 μm cellulose ester membranes into three 50 ml and one 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were filled to overflowing and double capped the samples in the 100 ml bottles were used for titration of bicarbonate on the sampling day the sampling sites are shown in the fig 1 the elevation differences between groundwater and river water were measured using a level gauge at the huabeitun transect f02 w02 20 and w02 and the fengrun transect f15 w15 02 w15 20 and w15 40 every two weeks for one year river flow rates and river transects on f03 f04 f05 f06 f07 f08 f13 and f17 were measured using an acoustic doppler flow profiler riversurveryor s5 sontek during the field survey on may 2014 water samples were analyzed in the laboratory of institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences cations and anions were characterized with an analytical precision of 1 mg l by an icp oes perkinelmer optime 5300dv and an ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10a respectively the saturation index si values of minerals in water samples were calculated using phreeqci ver 2 15 0 hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research usa lgr lwia 24d the δ 18o and δd values were reported as per mill deviations from the international standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water with the accuracy to 0 2 and 1 0 respectively 3 2 data analysis methods in this study we use different data analysis methods to identify the impact of the water transfer cluster analysis methods are broadly classified into hierarchical and partitional clustering methods li et al 2018 the hierarchical cluster analysis hca allows detection of spatial patterns in large datasets and enhances the understanding of physical and chemical catchment processes hca seeks to build a hierarchy tree of clusters a predefined cluster number is not needed the k means clustering is one of the most used partitional cluster analysis methods the k means clustering algorithm partitions objects that are represented by multiple variables into k clusters so as to minimize the sum of squared euclidean distances between the objects and their assigned cluster centroids kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 in addition we also employed the discriminant analysis da to predict into which of a priori defined categories an observation is most likely to fall based on a set of classification functions this approach provides insights into the similarity between groundwater and surface waters without skewing the groundwater chemistry dataset raiber et al 2019 we took ph ec orp major ions δ 18o and δd as metrics for the above data analyses which were accomplished in spss v14 employing different data analysis methods can cross validate the results reducing uncertainty of the results 4 results 4 1 δ 18o and δd in river water and groundwater as natural tracers of the water cycle water stable isotopes compositions δ 18o and δd show significant spatial and temporal differences in water cycle components across regions chiogna et al 2014 oyarzún et al 2015a acting as an ideal tool for water resource recognition and processes assessment gurumurthy et al 2015 zhan et al 2016 we collected published data of stable water isotopic composition in precipitation of taiyuan yuan et al 2018 the data spanning from 2012 to 2016 show obvious seasonal changes which is consistent with precipitation isotope characters across the monsoon climate region of china xia et al 2014 zhan et al 2016 the average δd and δ 18o of precipitation in rainy seasons mid june to mid september transition periods march to mid june and mid september to october and winter november december january and february are 60 and 8 3 29 and 5 2 and 66 and 10 5 respectively suggesting distinct different water vapor sources in the these periods meanwhile the local meteoric water lines lmwl can be defined as δd 6 7 δ 18o 3 8 l1 r2 0 99 for rainy seasons δd 6 7 δ 18o 5 2 l2 r2 0 94 for transition periods or δd 8 7 δ 18o 24 6 l3 r2 0 87 for winter obvious evaporation of rain drops occurs in the rainy seasons and transition periods revealed by the low slopes of the lmwl in the fig 2 almost all water points are plotted surrounding the averages of precipitation in rainy seasons and winter which indicates that precipitation in the rainy season and winter is the main water source moreover almost no recharge happens in the transition period valley groundwater mainly originates from local rainy season precipitation which can be validated by the groundwater points close to the rainy season mean and the l1 while a part of groundwater points are close to the winter mean and the l3 on may and june which indicates the contribution of winter precipitation the fen river water can be dominated by winter precipitation on may and june and by rainy season precipitation on august and september which is shown by the locations of water point of f01 fig 2 it should be noticed that f01 originates from precipitation of upper reaches with higher elevation which results an obvious depleted isotopic composition compared with other river water and groundwater samples the transferred yellow river water rather than winter precipitation dominates the water source in the receiving channel on may and june which makes the river water points to deviate from l3 and to approach l1 distributing around the yellow river water f01z under the influence of evaporation the river water in the receiving channel enriched heavy water isotopes gradually 4 2 major hydrochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater the hydrochemical features of the fen river water and the transferred yellow river water were stable but quite different while the valley groundwater exhibited changeable hydrogeochemical features the ph values of the fen river water and the transferred yellow river water changed between 8 4 and 8 5 the average ph value of the local groundwater was 7 7 obviously lower than that of the surface water the ec values of the fen river f01 and the transferred yellow river water f01z were stable and averaged around 530 μs cm and 1170 μs cm respectively fig 3 however the ec value of groundwater varied in a wide range of 381 1344 μs cm without a trend along the river the orders of the major cations and anions in the fen river water f01 were ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 so4 2 no3 cl respectively at the same time the orders in the yellow river water f01z were na ca2 mg2 k and cl so4 2 hco3 no3 respectively thus the water types of the fen river water and the yellow river water were ca hco3 and na ca cl so4 respectively the valley groundwater showed variable water types including ca hco3 ca hco3 so4 and na ca so4 hco3 fig 4 the water transfer imposed a great impact on the downstream river water quality first the ec value of water in the receiving river was dramatically increased by the transferred yellow river water during the water transfer compared to the intervals of the water transfer fig 3 as the inflow of the tributaries the ec value decreased gradually in the upstream of the site f10 during the water transfer with a minimum 876 μs cm in contrast at the entrance to the fenhe reservoir f18 the ec value didn t exceed 650 μs cm remaining low and stable second contents of na and cl in the water of the receiving river were greatly increased by the transferred yellow river water in the water transfer periods fig 4 the average contents of na and cl during the water transfer were 91 mg l and 110 mg l respectively which were six times and seven times higher than those in the water transfer intervals the impact of the water transfer on the valley groundwater isn t visual 4 3 river stage and groundwater level based on the one year observation of river stage and groundwater level at the huabeitun transect and the fengrun transect fig 5 the river stage was higher than groundwater level throughout the year thus the hydraulic gradient was always away from the river which is distinct with the usual bidirectional river groundwater hydraulic gradient zimmer and mcglynn 2017 moreover in basins even in a glacial catchment pu et al 2017 and a water receiving catchment kong et al 2018 groundwater typically contributes significantly to river flow however the water transfer induced a one way flow from river to groundwater in our case in addition the natural pattern of the fen river with high flows in rainy seasons mid june to mid september was inversed under the impact of the water transfer high flows of the fen river occurred during the water transfer periods low flows occurred during the intervals of the water transfer even in rainy seasons kong et al 2018 reported that the effect of transferred water on groundwater decreased with increasing distance from the surface water in our case the different trends of groundwater level regimes between the riparian zone w02 20 and the valley side w02 also indicate the decreasing impact of the water transfer in the huabeitun transect fig 5 in the study area the groundwater level was obviously higher in the riparian zone than that out of the riparian zone it is rational that the water receiving river formed a long term standing groundwater mound within the riparian zone by seepage along the river around 40 60 m to the river side in this case furthermore the maximum depth of the river channel is 1 2 m in the huabeitun transect and 1 5 m in the fengrun transect while the maximum depth to the groundwater table at sites 20 m away from the river side was no more than 0 99 m at w02 20 and 0 89 m at w15 20 in the one year observation period the groundwater mound is directly connected with the river water even in the intervals of water transfer 5 discussion 5 1 impact identification using data analysis methods based on the comprehensive hydrochemical data including ph ec orp major ions ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and water isotopes δ18o δ2h the hierarchical clustering k means clustering and the discriminant analysis were accomplished the hierarchical cluster result shows two major groups by cutting the farthest connection of the dendrogram fig 6 the group one comprises the transferred yellow river water f01z the water of the receiving river f02 f17 and groundwater w02 20 w03 30 w11l w12 w15 w15 2 w15 20 w15 40 w17l and w17r2 showing the impact of the water transfer furthermore the river water of f02 f09 and the transferred yellow river water f01z are separated as a sub cluster while the river water in the lower reaches of f09 and the affected groundwater are considered as another sub cluster the group two comprises the original fen river water f01 water from the tributaries of the fen river f03z f04z f06z f11z and f17z and unaffected groundwater including all fissure water samples in the mountain blocks the group two represents the river water and groundwater that were not hydrochemically affected by the water transfer the result of the hierarchical clustering can be cross validated by the other two data analysis methods the k means clustering result reveals the impact of the water transfer through a predefined number of clusters 2 the clustering result is basically the same with the result of the hierarchical cluster analysis besides w04 w10l and w13 which are recognized as groundwater impacted by the water transfer the original fen river water f01 and the transferred yellow river water f01z were defined as two categories in the discriminant analysis to uncover the impact of the water transfer the other water samples were classified into one of the above two categories with most likely probabilities the result shows a similar outcome with the k means cluster analysis besides f13 and f14 which are recognized as the river water without impacts of the water transfer the cross validation of the different methods suggests that the hydrochemical influence of the water transfer on valley groundwater can be identified in the riparian zone w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 and w15 40 upper reach transection on w04 and some lower reach transections on w10l w11l w12 w13 w15 and w17l w17r2 5 2 impact verification using hydrogeochemical analyses the chemical composition of natural water is the result of long term interaction of water with the surrounding environment during the water cycle drever 1997 in general the major sources of dissolved salts in surface water and groundwater include input from precipitation weathering of rocks regional geologic and anthropogenic inputs it was reported that sea salts carried in precipitation are one of the major sources in coastal regions xing et al 2016 gibbs plot is widely used to evaluate the influences of rock weathering evaporation and precipitation on water chemistry gibbs 1970 xiao et al 2012a b martinez et al 2015 based on the gibbs diagrams it is found that rock dominant processes i e water rock interaction contribute the major ion contents of surface water and groundwater in the study area fig 7 in order to distinguish the type of weathered rocks the ca2 na and mg2 na ratios were used gaillardet et al 1999 hagedorn and whittier 2015 the surface water and groundwater samples are plotted between end members of silicate rocks and carbonate rocks during the intervals of the water transfer indicating the joint contribution from the weathering of silicate rocks and carbonate rocks in the study area fig 8 however the transferred yellow river water and the river water impacted by the water transfer are plotted in the end member of silicate rocks fig 8 contributions of calcite and dolomite to water mineralization are obviously different for the transferred yellow river water and original waters in the receiving area stoichiometric relation among major ions can reveal the possible reactive minerals the equivalent ratio of dissolved hco3 and ca2 would be 1 1 for calcite dissolution and 2 1 for dolomite dissolution in the fig 9 a and 9b most of surface water and groundwater samples are distributed between lines of 1 1 and 2 1 suggesting a joint contribution of calcite and dolomite to groundwater mineralization calcite dissolution can release ca2 while dolomite dissolution can release both ca2 and mg2 thus the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 indicates the relative contributions of calcite and dolomite szramek et al 2011 dissolution of calcite produces water with an equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 greater than 10 1 the ratio is 2 1 in the case of congruent dissolution of calcite and dolomite with the same molar mass and equals to 1 when only dolomite dissolved during the intervals of the water transfer most of surface water and groundwater samples fall between the lines of 2 1 and 3 1 of the ca2 mg2 ratio fig 9d indicating that calcite and dolomite with molar mass ratio changing from 1 1 to 2 1 have dissolved into the water body in the study area during the water transfer periods the transferred yellow river water and the river water impacted by the water transfer are plotted close to the 1 1 line of the ca2 mg2 ratio fig 9c indicating dominant dolomite dissolution in the yellow river and the significant influence of the water transfer on the receiving river considering the stoichiometric relation between ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 most of the surface water and the valley groundwater samples are plotted close to the 1 1 line fig 9e and 9f indicating that the sulfide minerals or sulfuric acid is an important weathering agent for the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the study area if na comes from the dissolution of halite then na cl will be close to 1 however in fact most of surface water and groundwater samples have equivalent ratios of na cl greater than 1 in the study area fig 7g and 7h indicating sources of na from silicate weathering or other anthropogenic inputs as above results shown the transferred yellow river water dramatically increased na and cl concentrations and the ec value in the receiving river the influences of the water transfer result in a separate distribution of the transferred yellow river water and the impacted river water from the rest which has be detected in figs 7 9 once the water transfer ceases the influences on the river seem disappeared chloride ions cl are not absorbed by plants or bacteria and not adsorbed on the surface of soil particles due to the high solubility and the difficulty in precipitation chloride is considered as the most stable ion for tracing groundwater the cl contents of the fissure water in the mountain blocks fw the tributary water tw besides f17z and the original fen river water f01 were lower than 30 mg l while the transferred yellow river water f01z showed the content of cl higher than 180 mg l it is expected that the influence of the water transfer on the pore water in the valley fill sediments pw can be discovered based on the big difference in cl contents among the end members xin and li 2017 as shown in fig 10 pore water samples of w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 w5 40 in the riparian zone and w02 w04 w09l w10l w11l w12 w15 w17l w17r and w17r2 are plotted between the two end members which could be considered as the result of hydrochemical impact of the water transfer the determination of mineral phases is very important to understand hydrogeochemical processes mineral saturation indices si are widely used to determine reactive mineral phases of groundwater without collecting the samples of the solid phase deutsch and siegel 1997 according to the si result the main reactive minerals include calcite aragonite dolomite barite and talc in the study area in addition the valley groundwater including the fissure water fw in the mountain blocks and the pore water pw in the valley fill sediments are completely saturated by quartz the saturation index of quartz in valley groundwater is obviously higher than that of surface water although the transferred yellow river water inputs significant na and cl contents into the study area water isn t saturated by halite the four end members including f01 f01z fw and tw can be separated based on the saturation indices of quartz and halite fig 11 the pw samples mainly distribute close to fw points however it should be noted that w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 w5 40 in the riparian zone and w04 w09l w11l w12 w15 w17l and w17r2 are plotted between the end members of fw and f01z the result manifests that the pore water in the valley fill sediments is mainly recharged laterally by the local fissure water occurring in mountain blocks on the both sides of the valley at the same time the transferred yellow river water recharges into the riparian zone mixes with the groundwater and extends towards both sides of the valley in some river reach transections it should be noticed that the tributary water of f17z can be superficially explained as a mixture of valley groundwater and the transferred yellow river water according to the results displayed in figs 7 11 however in fact the tributary water has no chance to receive the transferred yellow river water at the sampling site f17z is just hydrochemically similar with f01z on the selected features once a comprehensive dataset of hydrochemical features is employed f17z will not be recognized as the impacted water any longer according to the result of the data analysis methods compared the results of the data analysis methods with the findings of hydrogeochemical analyses all riparian zone groundwater w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 w5 40 upper reach transection groundwater on w04 and lower reach transection groundwater on w11l w12 w15 and w17l w17r2 are confirmed to be hydrochemically impacted by the water transfer therefore the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer through the losing river on valley groundwater has been mainly confined to the riparian zone and some lower reach transections 5 3 constraining factors for the impact the transferred water could enter the adjacent aquifer and introduce impact on the groundwater first the river stage was higher than groundwater level throughout the year as the result of water transfer and rainy season high flow of the fen river second the valley groundwater table variation followed the change of the river stage suggesting the connectivity between the river and the valley groundwater finally we found that the groundwater was directly connected with the river water under the situation the hydraulic gradient was always away from the river pointing to the adjacent phreatic aquifer and the river water could continuously recharge the groundwater fig 5 similarly significant groundwater recharge induced by the south to north water transfer project of china yang et al 2012 and the water transfer in tarim river of china huang and pang 2010 were also reported all the results are rational considering that the water flow transferred into the fen river is near 30 times higher than the original flow of the fen river however our results of data analyzing and hydrogeochemical diagnosing indicate that the impact of the water transfer on groundwater was mainly confined to the riparian zone a high stream gradient should be responsible for the confined impact the fen river flows into the fenhe reservoir at the site of f18 where the base of erosion is the base line can be achieved based on the surface elevations and the average depth of the fen river at the sampling sites fig 12 the base line is obtained by fitting the points as y 0 038 x 2 7 35 x 1483 30 r 2 0 998 n 19 where x indicates the distance away from the f01 down the river km y refers to the elevation of river bottom m as shown by the lines in the fig 12 the stream gradients is much lower in the lower reach 2 8 than that in the upper reach 6 5 which is the common consequence of river degradation consequently the river flow slows down and the river width increases in the lower river channel according to our measurement in the river survey fig 13 similarly as the groundwater level gradient generally follows the topography the groundwater flow should also decelerate downstream thus the average groundwater hydraulic gradient along the river was calculated as 4 6 in the upper reach between w02 and w09l and decreases to 3 6 in the lower reach between w09l and w17l in comparison the average lateral hydraulic gradient vertical to the river side is estimated at 1 9 between the river and the valley groundwater at the huabeitun transection the upper reaches and increases to 3 3 at the fengrun transection the lower reaches obviously the groundwater hydraulic gradient along the river is much larger than the lateral hydraulic gradient in the upper reaches of the river which promotes a downstream groundwater flow rather than a lateral flow towards sides of the valley however the lateral groundwater hydraulic gradient is equivalent to the gradient along the river in the lower reaches in addition the groundwater flow along the river is decelerated due to the relative flat terrain therefore the lateral stream groundwater flow could be enhanced in lower reaches in conclusion the hydrochemical influence of the transferred yellow river water on the valley groundwater is confined to the riparian zone of the receiving river due to the great stream gradient only in the lower reaches of the river the water transfer could obviously impose hydrochemical impacts on the valley groundwater out of the riparian zone on the other hand the recharge to the pore water in the valley fill sediment from the fissure groundwater of mountain blocks at the both sides of the valley bottom also constrains the impact of the water transfer according to our results the fissure water contributes a considerable part of groundwater in the valley fill sediments figs 10 and 11 which disturbs a systematic hydrochemical evolution of the pore water by mixtures along the river however in the heihe river plain infiltrated river water mixes into groundwater which hydochemically evolves from hco3 type to so4 2 type and finally to cl dominated type wang et al 2013 moreover 18o and 2h are gradually enriched in the groundwater with increasing distance downstream and the apparent age of the groundwater increases qin et al 2012 compared to our case there isn t a strong recharge from surrounding mountain blocks in the heihe river plain which should be responsible for the difference in our study area the water receiving river valley is narrow the width of the valley bottom is usually smaller than 2 km in the upper reaches and greater than 2 km in the lower reaches the increasing valley width could facilitate the expansion of the impact from the losing river to the adjacent aquifer 6 conclusions the water transfer from the yellow river to the fen river in china has significantly changed the local hydrological processes and the interaction between groundwater and surface water resulting in water degradation in the water receiving river the hydrochemical features of the yellow river water is distinct different with the fen river due to the ion sources from different weathering rocks the water transfer dramatically increases contents of na and cl and ec values in the water receiving river the natural pattern of the fen river with high flows in rainy seasons is inversed by the water transfer high flows of the fen river occur during the water transfer periods while low flows occur during the intervals of the water transfer in addition with the impact of the water transfer the river stage is higher than groundwater level throughout the year altering the usual bidirectional river groundwater hydraulic gradient into a gradient always away from the river thus the interaction between the water receiving river and the adjacent groundwater is greatly changed by the water transfer under the one way hydraulic gradient the river water continuously recharges the adjacent groundwater while almost no groundwater flow enters the river consequently a long term standing groundwater mound is formed within the riparian zone along the river with the impact of the water transfer the groundwater mound directly connects with the river water moreover the groundwater level regime follows the changes of the river stage even in the valley side although the impact decreases away from the river sides the altered surface water groundwater interaction facilitates the expanding of the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer on groundwater however the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer on the groundwater is mainly confined to the riparian zone and some low reach transections of the water receiving river in spite of the groundwater level regime controlled by the water transfer in the upper reaches of the water receiving river high stream gradient induces that the hydraulic gradient along the river is much larger than the lateral hydraulic gradient in the adjacent aquifer thus groundwater in the riparian zone tends to flow downstream which confines the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer to the riparian zone in the lower reaches the lateral groundwater hydraulic gradient is equivalent to the gradient along the river and the groundwater flow along the river is decelerated due to the obviously decrease of the stream gradient thus the enhanced lateral groundwater flow can bring the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer out of the riparian zone we highlight that stream gradients could obviously influence the river water and groundwater interaction promoting or confining the impact of river water on groundwater besides the narrow river valley and a strong recharge from mountain blocks at the both sides of the valley bottom also play a role in confining the impact of the

5720,how the water transfer imposes impacts on the groundwater in the water receiving area is still unknown here we employed hydrometric observations hydrogeochemical analyses and data analysis methods to address this issue taking one of the yellow river water transfer project of china for example we found that the interaction between river and groundwater is totally changed by the water transfer and the impact of the water transfer on groundwater is confined by the high stream gradient with the water transfer the natural annual pattern of rainy season high river flow is inversed with low flow in rainy seasons and high flow during the water transfer moreover the river stage is always higher than the groundwater level throughout the year the usual bidirectional river groundwater hydraulic gradient is altered to be a gradient always away from the river the groundwater directly connects with the river water the regime of groundwater level follows the change of the river stage even in the valley side a long term standing groundwater mound is formed within the riparian zone due to the continuous recharge from the water receiving river the transferred yellow river water is hydrochemically featured by high ec value and concentrations of na and cl the hydrochemical features of the water receiving river are obviously changed by the transferred yellow river water the hydrochemical impact of the river on the groundwater is mainly confined to the riparian zone and some low reach transections despite of the dominated control of the river on the valley groundwater table the high stream gradient trends to produce the downstream groundwater flow and hinder the lateral groundwater flow from river to valley sides in the upper reaches responsible for the confined impact on groundwater our study highlights that the stream gradient could obviously influence the river water and groundwater interaction promoting or confining the impact of river water on groundwater keywords narrow river valley stream gradient losing river mountain block recharge anthropogenic disturbance 1 introduction water is a precious natural resource making the earth a vibrant planet however the distribution of water especially the freshwater is extremely uneven inter basin water transfer ibwt projects such as the chinese south to north water transfer project the north american water and power alliance the canadian james bay project and the lake chenghai water diversion projects balance the regional uneven distribution and meet increasing demands for freshwater by artificially reallocating surface water resources jain et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2019 recently the indian government has proposed about 30 ibwt links over 37 rivers aiming to increase water availability water quality public health status and other socioeconomic aspects by homogenizing distribution of water resources kumar and verma 2020 the portion of the global water withdrawal by ibwt projects is expected to rise to 25 percent by 2025 gohari et al 2013 the implementation of the ibwt projects may cause changes of the physical and chemical characteristics of water the local hydrological cycle and the water quality in both water supply areas and water receiving areas such changes are two sided zhuang 2016 the negative impacts such as expansion of invasive species gallardo and aldridge 2018 acceleration of biotic homogenization daga et al 2019 degradation of groundwater dependent eco environment zhu et al 2018 and so on were reported to mitigate the negative impacts hundreds of millions of dollars should be paid by water receiving basins as compensation to the water supply basin ahmadi et al 2019 and an intelligent water allocation methodology for establishing optimal inter basin water transfer schemes is needed zhou et al 2017 in addition groundwater sustainable development and management needs more attention in an ibwt strategy yao et al 2019 because groundwater as an important freshwater source tends to be impacted by the ibwt through groundwater and surface water gw sw interaction however impacts of ibwt on groundwater of receiving basins and its factors remain unclear the gw sw interaction is a key issue related to impacts of ibwt on groundwater in a hydrogeological unit groundwater and surface water are usually in hydraulic connectivity state water and the dissolved substances can exchange between groundwater and surface water under a hydraulic gradient which is the so called gw sw interaction verification of impacts of ibwt on groundwater and identification of its factors should be on the basis of the gw sw interaction study however the ibwt projects would disturb the hydrological processes of the local water cycle the impact of ibwt on the gw sw interaction and the outcome of this impact is a matter of strong scientific interest different methods have been employed to explore the gw sw interaction the current methods can be divided into three categories including direct measurements model simulations and tracer based diagnostic methods direct measurements of the amount of water exchange are usually carried out at a point of field hydrological models can draw a whole picture of gw sw interaction in various scales however the accuracy of modeling results is greatly influenced by spatial heterogeneity of sediments availability of observation data and uncertainty of the model the gw sw connectivity is often accompanied by the consistency of spatial and temporal variations of major ions compositions and concentrations brindha et al 2014 oyarzún et al 2015a therefore tracing physicochemical changes in water becomes a well recognized method to identify and quantify the gw sw interaction in recent years tracer based diagnostic methods usually combine hydrogeochemical diagnosis and data analysis methods supporting a robust identification of gw sw interaction yuan et al 2013 oyarzún et al 2015b yuan et al 2017 matiatos et al 2018 the use of multiple techniques including physicochemical parameters hydrogeochemical compositions environmental isotope analyses and data analysis methods can effectively reduce the uncertainty of analyses of the gw sw interaction burnett et al 2010 martinez et al 2015 xing et al 2016 with global population growth and economic development the issue of water resources has constrained human sustainable development the spatial mismatch of water resources and socio economic developments is common throughout the world making water transfer one of the widely adopted solutions to achieve a reliable assessment of the impact of a water transfer project on groundwater of the receiving area hydrometric observation hydrogeochemistry isotope hydrology and data analysis methods were combined and cross validated this paper aims to clarify the impact of water transfer on the gw sw interaction and its consequence in addition the influences of the stream gradient on the impact of the water transfer are also discussed this study contributes to a thorough evaluation of potential risks of the ibwt and sustainable protection of groundwater resource 2 study area the fen river is the second largest tributary of the yellow river with a length more than 710 km the yellow river water is transferred into the headwater area of the fen river f01z at a rate of 3 2 108 m3 yr to meet the domestic agricultural and industrial needs of taiyuan the largest city in the fen river basin with a population of 4 5 millions the transferred yellow river water flows through an 86 kilometer long natural river channel before flowing into the fenhe reservoir f18 the water receiving river valley is the study area fig 1 which has been recognized as the water conservation area of taiyuan the study area the north south trending narrow river valley locates at n38 15 n38 74 and e111 82 e112 12 with the valley bottom elevation changing from 1490 m to 1130 m based on our field survey the study area has a semi arid and semi humid monsoon climate the annual precipitation usually changes from 380 mm to 500 mm about 70 of the annual rainfall occurs in rainy seasons from mid june to mid september the annual average temperature is about 7 the riparian zone of the water receiving river reach is constrained by 2 meter high stone dikes unauthorized activities are prohibited in the riparian zone the land cover is grassland in the riparian zone and farmland out of the riparian zone villages scatter at the both sides of the river the pore water occurs in the valley fill sediments the fissure water occurs in the mountain blocks on the both sides of the valley bottom the valley fill sediments are mainly composed of fluvial gravels and course sands in the upper reach of f09 fine sands and loess like materials in the lower reach of f09 sandstone limestone dolomite and shale outcrop bounding the valley bottom fig 1 the yellow river water mixes with the fen river water in toumaying which is nearly 15 km away from the river source the yellow river water is injected at a rate nearly 15 m3 s which is roughly 30 times higher than the dry season flow of the fen river at this site the water transfer only shuts on periods of february march and august october to avoid freeze or the rainy season high flows tributaries of the fen river contribute a river flow around 3 m3 s yuan et al 2018 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and measurement groundwater occurring in the valley fill sediments the pore water and mountain blocks the fissure water and river water were sampled during the water transfer on june 2012 may 2014 and may 2015 and the intervals of the water transfer on august 2012 september 2014 and september 2015 the river water was sampled roughly every 5 km along the river from toumaying the pore water was sampled from boreholes 3 4 m in depth the riparian zone and domestic wells 3 4 m in depth out of the riparian zone the fissure water was sampled on the both sides of the valley wells with depth varying 6 8 m the river water was sampled using a bucket near the center of the river groundwater was sampled using a stainless steel sampler with check valve at the bottom before sampling the depth of the groundwater table was measured the water drawn by a peristaltic pump was sent to a flow through device to measure the water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec μs cm oxidation reduction potential orp in situ dkk toa corporation model wm 22ep water samples were collected in a 100 ml syringe and filtered immediately through 0 45 μm cellulose ester membranes into three 50 ml and one 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were filled to overflowing and double capped the samples in the 100 ml bottles were used for titration of bicarbonate on the sampling day the sampling sites are shown in the fig 1 the elevation differences between groundwater and river water were measured using a level gauge at the huabeitun transect f02 w02 20 and w02 and the fengrun transect f15 w15 02 w15 20 and w15 40 every two weeks for one year river flow rates and river transects on f03 f04 f05 f06 f07 f08 f13 and f17 were measured using an acoustic doppler flow profiler riversurveryor s5 sontek during the field survey on may 2014 water samples were analyzed in the laboratory of institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences cations and anions were characterized with an analytical precision of 1 mg l by an icp oes perkinelmer optime 5300dv and an ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10a respectively the saturation index si values of minerals in water samples were calculated using phreeqci ver 2 15 0 hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research usa lgr lwia 24d the δ 18o and δd values were reported as per mill deviations from the international standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water with the accuracy to 0 2 and 1 0 respectively 3 2 data analysis methods in this study we use different data analysis methods to identify the impact of the water transfer cluster analysis methods are broadly classified into hierarchical and partitional clustering methods li et al 2018 the hierarchical cluster analysis hca allows detection of spatial patterns in large datasets and enhances the understanding of physical and chemical catchment processes hca seeks to build a hierarchy tree of clusters a predefined cluster number is not needed the k means clustering is one of the most used partitional cluster analysis methods the k means clustering algorithm partitions objects that are represented by multiple variables into k clusters so as to minimize the sum of squared euclidean distances between the objects and their assigned cluster centroids kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 in addition we also employed the discriminant analysis da to predict into which of a priori defined categories an observation is most likely to fall based on a set of classification functions this approach provides insights into the similarity between groundwater and surface waters without skewing the groundwater chemistry dataset raiber et al 2019 we took ph ec orp major ions δ 18o and δd as metrics for the above data analyses which were accomplished in spss v14 employing different data analysis methods can cross validate the results reducing uncertainty of the results 4 results 4 1 δ 18o and δd in river water and groundwater as natural tracers of the water cycle water stable isotopes compositions δ 18o and δd show significant spatial and temporal differences in water cycle components across regions chiogna et al 2014 oyarzún et al 2015a acting as an ideal tool for water resource recognition and processes assessment gurumurthy et al 2015 zhan et al 2016 we collected published data of stable water isotopic composition in precipitation of taiyuan yuan et al 2018 the data spanning from 2012 to 2016 show obvious seasonal changes which is consistent with precipitation isotope characters across the monsoon climate region of china xia et al 2014 zhan et al 2016 the average δd and δ 18o of precipitation in rainy seasons mid june to mid september transition periods march to mid june and mid september to october and winter november december january and february are 60 and 8 3 29 and 5 2 and 66 and 10 5 respectively suggesting distinct different water vapor sources in the these periods meanwhile the local meteoric water lines lmwl can be defined as δd 6 7 δ 18o 3 8 l1 r2 0 99 for rainy seasons δd 6 7 δ 18o 5 2 l2 r2 0 94 for transition periods or δd 8 7 δ 18o 24 6 l3 r2 0 87 for winter obvious evaporation of rain drops occurs in the rainy seasons and transition periods revealed by the low slopes of the lmwl in the fig 2 almost all water points are plotted surrounding the averages of precipitation in rainy seasons and winter which indicates that precipitation in the rainy season and winter is the main water source moreover almost no recharge happens in the transition period valley groundwater mainly originates from local rainy season precipitation which can be validated by the groundwater points close to the rainy season mean and the l1 while a part of groundwater points are close to the winter mean and the l3 on may and june which indicates the contribution of winter precipitation the fen river water can be dominated by winter precipitation on may and june and by rainy season precipitation on august and september which is shown by the locations of water point of f01 fig 2 it should be noticed that f01 originates from precipitation of upper reaches with higher elevation which results an obvious depleted isotopic composition compared with other river water and groundwater samples the transferred yellow river water rather than winter precipitation dominates the water source in the receiving channel on may and june which makes the river water points to deviate from l3 and to approach l1 distributing around the yellow river water f01z under the influence of evaporation the river water in the receiving channel enriched heavy water isotopes gradually 4 2 major hydrochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater the hydrochemical features of the fen river water and the transferred yellow river water were stable but quite different while the valley groundwater exhibited changeable hydrogeochemical features the ph values of the fen river water and the transferred yellow river water changed between 8 4 and 8 5 the average ph value of the local groundwater was 7 7 obviously lower than that of the surface water the ec values of the fen river f01 and the transferred yellow river water f01z were stable and averaged around 530 μs cm and 1170 μs cm respectively fig 3 however the ec value of groundwater varied in a wide range of 381 1344 μs cm without a trend along the river the orders of the major cations and anions in the fen river water f01 were ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 so4 2 no3 cl respectively at the same time the orders in the yellow river water f01z were na ca2 mg2 k and cl so4 2 hco3 no3 respectively thus the water types of the fen river water and the yellow river water were ca hco3 and na ca cl so4 respectively the valley groundwater showed variable water types including ca hco3 ca hco3 so4 and na ca so4 hco3 fig 4 the water transfer imposed a great impact on the downstream river water quality first the ec value of water in the receiving river was dramatically increased by the transferred yellow river water during the water transfer compared to the intervals of the water transfer fig 3 as the inflow of the tributaries the ec value decreased gradually in the upstream of the site f10 during the water transfer with a minimum 876 μs cm in contrast at the entrance to the fenhe reservoir f18 the ec value didn t exceed 650 μs cm remaining low and stable second contents of na and cl in the water of the receiving river were greatly increased by the transferred yellow river water in the water transfer periods fig 4 the average contents of na and cl during the water transfer were 91 mg l and 110 mg l respectively which were six times and seven times higher than those in the water transfer intervals the impact of the water transfer on the valley groundwater isn t visual 4 3 river stage and groundwater level based on the one year observation of river stage and groundwater level at the huabeitun transect and the fengrun transect fig 5 the river stage was higher than groundwater level throughout the year thus the hydraulic gradient was always away from the river which is distinct with the usual bidirectional river groundwater hydraulic gradient zimmer and mcglynn 2017 moreover in basins even in a glacial catchment pu et al 2017 and a water receiving catchment kong et al 2018 groundwater typically contributes significantly to river flow however the water transfer induced a one way flow from river to groundwater in our case in addition the natural pattern of the fen river with high flows in rainy seasons mid june to mid september was inversed under the impact of the water transfer high flows of the fen river occurred during the water transfer periods low flows occurred during the intervals of the water transfer even in rainy seasons kong et al 2018 reported that the effect of transferred water on groundwater decreased with increasing distance from the surface water in our case the different trends of groundwater level regimes between the riparian zone w02 20 and the valley side w02 also indicate the decreasing impact of the water transfer in the huabeitun transect fig 5 in the study area the groundwater level was obviously higher in the riparian zone than that out of the riparian zone it is rational that the water receiving river formed a long term standing groundwater mound within the riparian zone by seepage along the river around 40 60 m to the river side in this case furthermore the maximum depth of the river channel is 1 2 m in the huabeitun transect and 1 5 m in the fengrun transect while the maximum depth to the groundwater table at sites 20 m away from the river side was no more than 0 99 m at w02 20 and 0 89 m at w15 20 in the one year observation period the groundwater mound is directly connected with the river water even in the intervals of water transfer 5 discussion 5 1 impact identification using data analysis methods based on the comprehensive hydrochemical data including ph ec orp major ions ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and water isotopes δ18o δ2h the hierarchical clustering k means clustering and the discriminant analysis were accomplished the hierarchical cluster result shows two major groups by cutting the farthest connection of the dendrogram fig 6 the group one comprises the transferred yellow river water f01z the water of the receiving river f02 f17 and groundwater w02 20 w03 30 w11l w12 w15 w15 2 w15 20 w15 40 w17l and w17r2 showing the impact of the water transfer furthermore the river water of f02 f09 and the transferred yellow river water f01z are separated as a sub cluster while the river water in the lower reaches of f09 and the affected groundwater are considered as another sub cluster the group two comprises the original fen river water f01 water from the tributaries of the fen river f03z f04z f06z f11z and f17z and unaffected groundwater including all fissure water samples in the mountain blocks the group two represents the river water and groundwater that were not hydrochemically affected by the water transfer the result of the hierarchical clustering can be cross validated by the other two data analysis methods the k means clustering result reveals the impact of the water transfer through a predefined number of clusters 2 the clustering result is basically the same with the result of the hierarchical cluster analysis besides w04 w10l and w13 which are recognized as groundwater impacted by the water transfer the original fen river water f01 and the transferred yellow river water f01z were defined as two categories in the discriminant analysis to uncover the impact of the water transfer the other water samples were classified into one of the above two categories with most likely probabilities the result shows a similar outcome with the k means cluster analysis besides f13 and f14 which are recognized as the river water without impacts of the water transfer the cross validation of the different methods suggests that the hydrochemical influence of the water transfer on valley groundwater can be identified in the riparian zone w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 and w15 40 upper reach transection on w04 and some lower reach transections on w10l w11l w12 w13 w15 and w17l w17r2 5 2 impact verification using hydrogeochemical analyses the chemical composition of natural water is the result of long term interaction of water with the surrounding environment during the water cycle drever 1997 in general the major sources of dissolved salts in surface water and groundwater include input from precipitation weathering of rocks regional geologic and anthropogenic inputs it was reported that sea salts carried in precipitation are one of the major sources in coastal regions xing et al 2016 gibbs plot is widely used to evaluate the influences of rock weathering evaporation and precipitation on water chemistry gibbs 1970 xiao et al 2012a b martinez et al 2015 based on the gibbs diagrams it is found that rock dominant processes i e water rock interaction contribute the major ion contents of surface water and groundwater in the study area fig 7 in order to distinguish the type of weathered rocks the ca2 na and mg2 na ratios were used gaillardet et al 1999 hagedorn and whittier 2015 the surface water and groundwater samples are plotted between end members of silicate rocks and carbonate rocks during the intervals of the water transfer indicating the joint contribution from the weathering of silicate rocks and carbonate rocks in the study area fig 8 however the transferred yellow river water and the river water impacted by the water transfer are plotted in the end member of silicate rocks fig 8 contributions of calcite and dolomite to water mineralization are obviously different for the transferred yellow river water and original waters in the receiving area stoichiometric relation among major ions can reveal the possible reactive minerals the equivalent ratio of dissolved hco3 and ca2 would be 1 1 for calcite dissolution and 2 1 for dolomite dissolution in the fig 9 a and 9b most of surface water and groundwater samples are distributed between lines of 1 1 and 2 1 suggesting a joint contribution of calcite and dolomite to groundwater mineralization calcite dissolution can release ca2 while dolomite dissolution can release both ca2 and mg2 thus the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 indicates the relative contributions of calcite and dolomite szramek et al 2011 dissolution of calcite produces water with an equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 greater than 10 1 the ratio is 2 1 in the case of congruent dissolution of calcite and dolomite with the same molar mass and equals to 1 when only dolomite dissolved during the intervals of the water transfer most of surface water and groundwater samples fall between the lines of 2 1 and 3 1 of the ca2 mg2 ratio fig 9d indicating that calcite and dolomite with molar mass ratio changing from 1 1 to 2 1 have dissolved into the water body in the study area during the water transfer periods the transferred yellow river water and the river water impacted by the water transfer are plotted close to the 1 1 line of the ca2 mg2 ratio fig 9c indicating dominant dolomite dissolution in the yellow river and the significant influence of the water transfer on the receiving river considering the stoichiometric relation between ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 most of the surface water and the valley groundwater samples are plotted close to the 1 1 line fig 9e and 9f indicating that the sulfide minerals or sulfuric acid is an important weathering agent for the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the study area if na comes from the dissolution of halite then na cl will be close to 1 however in fact most of surface water and groundwater samples have equivalent ratios of na cl greater than 1 in the study area fig 7g and 7h indicating sources of na from silicate weathering or other anthropogenic inputs as above results shown the transferred yellow river water dramatically increased na and cl concentrations and the ec value in the receiving river the influences of the water transfer result in a separate distribution of the transferred yellow river water and the impacted river water from the rest which has be detected in figs 7 9 once the water transfer ceases the influences on the river seem disappeared chloride ions cl are not absorbed by plants or bacteria and not adsorbed on the surface of soil particles due to the high solubility and the difficulty in precipitation chloride is considered as the most stable ion for tracing groundwater the cl contents of the fissure water in the mountain blocks fw the tributary water tw besides f17z and the original fen river water f01 were lower than 30 mg l while the transferred yellow river water f01z showed the content of cl higher than 180 mg l it is expected that the influence of the water transfer on the pore water in the valley fill sediments pw can be discovered based on the big difference in cl contents among the end members xin and li 2017 as shown in fig 10 pore water samples of w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 w5 40 in the riparian zone and w02 w04 w09l w10l w11l w12 w15 w17l w17r and w17r2 are plotted between the two end members which could be considered as the result of hydrochemical impact of the water transfer the determination of mineral phases is very important to understand hydrogeochemical processes mineral saturation indices si are widely used to determine reactive mineral phases of groundwater without collecting the samples of the solid phase deutsch and siegel 1997 according to the si result the main reactive minerals include calcite aragonite dolomite barite and talc in the study area in addition the valley groundwater including the fissure water fw in the mountain blocks and the pore water pw in the valley fill sediments are completely saturated by quartz the saturation index of quartz in valley groundwater is obviously higher than that of surface water although the transferred yellow river water inputs significant na and cl contents into the study area water isn t saturated by halite the four end members including f01 f01z fw and tw can be separated based on the saturation indices of quartz and halite fig 11 the pw samples mainly distribute close to fw points however it should be noted that w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 w5 40 in the riparian zone and w04 w09l w11l w12 w15 w17l and w17r2 are plotted between the end members of fw and f01z the result manifests that the pore water in the valley fill sediments is mainly recharged laterally by the local fissure water occurring in mountain blocks on the both sides of the valley at the same time the transferred yellow river water recharges into the riparian zone mixes with the groundwater and extends towards both sides of the valley in some river reach transections it should be noticed that the tributary water of f17z can be superficially explained as a mixture of valley groundwater and the transferred yellow river water according to the results displayed in figs 7 11 however in fact the tributary water has no chance to receive the transferred yellow river water at the sampling site f17z is just hydrochemically similar with f01z on the selected features once a comprehensive dataset of hydrochemical features is employed f17z will not be recognized as the impacted water any longer according to the result of the data analysis methods compared the results of the data analysis methods with the findings of hydrogeochemical analyses all riparian zone groundwater w02 20 w03 30 w15 2 w15 20 w5 40 upper reach transection groundwater on w04 and lower reach transection groundwater on w11l w12 w15 and w17l w17r2 are confirmed to be hydrochemically impacted by the water transfer therefore the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer through the losing river on valley groundwater has been mainly confined to the riparian zone and some lower reach transections 5 3 constraining factors for the impact the transferred water could enter the adjacent aquifer and introduce impact on the groundwater first the river stage was higher than groundwater level throughout the year as the result of water transfer and rainy season high flow of the fen river second the valley groundwater table variation followed the change of the river stage suggesting the connectivity between the river and the valley groundwater finally we found that the groundwater was directly connected with the river water under the situation the hydraulic gradient was always away from the river pointing to the adjacent phreatic aquifer and the river water could continuously recharge the groundwater fig 5 similarly significant groundwater recharge induced by the south to north water transfer project of china yang et al 2012 and the water transfer in tarim river of china huang and pang 2010 were also reported all the results are rational considering that the water flow transferred into the fen river is near 30 times higher than the original flow of the fen river however our results of data analyzing and hydrogeochemical diagnosing indicate that the impact of the water transfer on groundwater was mainly confined to the riparian zone a high stream gradient should be responsible for the confined impact the fen river flows into the fenhe reservoir at the site of f18 where the base of erosion is the base line can be achieved based on the surface elevations and the average depth of the fen river at the sampling sites fig 12 the base line is obtained by fitting the points as y 0 038 x 2 7 35 x 1483 30 r 2 0 998 n 19 where x indicates the distance away from the f01 down the river km y refers to the elevation of river bottom m as shown by the lines in the fig 12 the stream gradients is much lower in the lower reach 2 8 than that in the upper reach 6 5 which is the common consequence of river degradation consequently the river flow slows down and the river width increases in the lower river channel according to our measurement in the river survey fig 13 similarly as the groundwater level gradient generally follows the topography the groundwater flow should also decelerate downstream thus the average groundwater hydraulic gradient along the river was calculated as 4 6 in the upper reach between w02 and w09l and decreases to 3 6 in the lower reach between w09l and w17l in comparison the average lateral hydraulic gradient vertical to the river side is estimated at 1 9 between the river and the valley groundwater at the huabeitun transection the upper reaches and increases to 3 3 at the fengrun transection the lower reaches obviously the groundwater hydraulic gradient along the river is much larger than the lateral hydraulic gradient in the upper reaches of the river which promotes a downstream groundwater flow rather than a lateral flow towards sides of the valley however the lateral groundwater hydraulic gradient is equivalent to the gradient along the river in the lower reaches in addition the groundwater flow along the river is decelerated due to the relative flat terrain therefore the lateral stream groundwater flow could be enhanced in lower reaches in conclusion the hydrochemical influence of the transferred yellow river water on the valley groundwater is confined to the riparian zone of the receiving river due to the great stream gradient only in the lower reaches of the river the water transfer could obviously impose hydrochemical impacts on the valley groundwater out of the riparian zone on the other hand the recharge to the pore water in the valley fill sediment from the fissure groundwater of mountain blocks at the both sides of the valley bottom also constrains the impact of the water transfer according to our results the fissure water contributes a considerable part of groundwater in the valley fill sediments figs 10 and 11 which disturbs a systematic hydrochemical evolution of the pore water by mixtures along the river however in the heihe river plain infiltrated river water mixes into groundwater which hydochemically evolves from hco3 type to so4 2 type and finally to cl dominated type wang et al 2013 moreover 18o and 2h are gradually enriched in the groundwater with increasing distance downstream and the apparent age of the groundwater increases qin et al 2012 compared to our case there isn t a strong recharge from surrounding mountain blocks in the heihe river plain which should be responsible for the difference in our study area the water receiving river valley is narrow the width of the valley bottom is usually smaller than 2 km in the upper reaches and greater than 2 km in the lower reaches the increasing valley width could facilitate the expansion of the impact from the losing river to the adjacent aquifer 6 conclusions the water transfer from the yellow river to the fen river in china has significantly changed the local hydrological processes and the interaction between groundwater and surface water resulting in water degradation in the water receiving river the hydrochemical features of the yellow river water is distinct different with the fen river due to the ion sources from different weathering rocks the water transfer dramatically increases contents of na and cl and ec values in the water receiving river the natural pattern of the fen river with high flows in rainy seasons is inversed by the water transfer high flows of the fen river occur during the water transfer periods while low flows occur during the intervals of the water transfer in addition with the impact of the water transfer the river stage is higher than groundwater level throughout the year altering the usual bidirectional river groundwater hydraulic gradient into a gradient always away from the river thus the interaction between the water receiving river and the adjacent groundwater is greatly changed by the water transfer under the one way hydraulic gradient the river water continuously recharges the adjacent groundwater while almost no groundwater flow enters the river consequently a long term standing groundwater mound is formed within the riparian zone along the river with the impact of the water transfer the groundwater mound directly connects with the river water moreover the groundwater level regime follows the changes of the river stage even in the valley side although the impact decreases away from the river sides the altered surface water groundwater interaction facilitates the expanding of the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer on groundwater however the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer on the groundwater is mainly confined to the riparian zone and some low reach transections of the water receiving river in spite of the groundwater level regime controlled by the water transfer in the upper reaches of the water receiving river high stream gradient induces that the hydraulic gradient along the river is much larger than the lateral hydraulic gradient in the adjacent aquifer thus groundwater in the riparian zone tends to flow downstream which confines the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer to the riparian zone in the lower reaches the lateral groundwater hydraulic gradient is equivalent to the gradient along the river and the groundwater flow along the river is decelerated due to the obviously decrease of the stream gradient thus the enhanced lateral groundwater flow can bring the hydrochemical impact of the water transfer out of the riparian zone we highlight that stream gradients could obviously influence the river water and groundwater interaction promoting or confining the impact of river water on groundwater besides the narrow river valley and a strong recharge from mountain blocks at the both sides of the valley bottom also play a role in confining the impact of the

5721,precipitation risk and water management is a key challenge for densely populated urban areas applications derived from high spatio temporal resolution observation of precipitations are to make our cities more weather ready finer resolution data available from dual polarised x band radar measurements enhance engineering tools as used for urban planning policies as well as protection mitigation adaptation strategies to tackle climate change related weather events for decades engineering tools have been developed to work conveniently either with very local rain gauge networks or with mainly c band radars that have gradually been set up for space time remote sensing of precipitation most of the time the c band radars continue to be calibrated by the existing rain gauge networks inhomogeneous distributions of these networks lead to only a partial information on the rainfall fields here we show that the statistics of measured rainfall is strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks and that this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields in spite of the radar data calibration in this work we use the semi distributed hydrological modelling over the bièvre catchment to generate a virtual rain gauges network and firstly performing a fractal analysis of this network distribution we demonstrate that the semi distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the distributed weather radar rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges then with the help of the intersection theorem and multifractal theory we statistically compare the virtual rain gauges data with the rainfall data measured by the dual polarimetric x band radar operated at ecole des ponts with a spatial resolution of 250 m providing pre factors that indicate the need of a proper re normalisation of rain gauge rainfall data when comparing or calibrating

sparseness of rain gauge networks nevertheless the initial measurement of reflectivities adopted by those devices not providing direct precipitation rates such as rain gauges usually generates

conclusions are presented in section 5 2 case study and rainfall data the bièvre valley which is a 110 km2 semi urbanised area in the southwest of paris region was selected as case study the bièvre river is 33 km long tributary of the seine river and its upstream catchment is managed by two local authorities the casqy communauté d agglomération de saint quentin en yvelines saint quentin en yvelines agglomération community in the upstream portion and the siavb syndicat intercommunal d assainissement de la vallée de la bièvre inter municipal local authority for sanitation of the bièvre valley in the downstream portion the bièvre catchment was modelled using infoworks cs collection systems paz 2018 paz et al 2018 a widely used semi distributed model soft 2010 with the operation responsibility given to the company veolia since 1991 by the local authority siavb to perform a real time control of the hydrological area this hydrological model is integrated in the optim sim platform developed by veolia that mimics the actual regulation of the storage basins paz 2018 paz et al 2018 in two simulation modes the replay mode and the forecasting mode the first one extracts rainfall data from the 6 siavb rain gauges network database using the thiessen polygons technique to replay past events and the forecasting mode uses different rainfall data e g from weather radar measurements to simulate the catchment hydrological behaviour the catchment area is divided into 27 sub catchments as displayed on fig 1 this modelling had been firstly calibrated using the rainfall data from the météo france c band radar of trappes located in a direct proximity 0 20 km of the catchment see fig 1 with a resolution of 1 km 1 km 5 min these c band radar data are firstly obtained as reflectivity dbz and then after some post treatments and filtering process they are transformed into rainfall intensity r by applying the marshall palmer z r equation marshall and palmer 1948 with fixed parameters a 200 and b 1 6 eq 1 which means that the polarimetric capability of this radar of trappes has not been used in addition this catchment also contains a network of six tipping bucket rain gauges see fig 1 which had been used to calibrate the c band radar data 1 z a r b however in this study we used rainfall data from the enpc dual polarimetric x band radar of champs sur marne see

some objects of very irregular or fragmented form with unusual properties in classical geometry mandelbrot 1974 named them as fractals fractus means irregular in latin nevertheless fractal objects must not just be irregular but also scale invariant which means that their form remains unchanged at different scales of observation this brings the properties of self similarity a zoomed part of the object looks similar to the object itself with an isotropic variation and self affinity when the variation is anisotropic in classical geometry dimensions are integers characterising regular spaces as straight lines 1d planar figures 2d and volumes 3d if we take an object embedded in an euclidian dimension d of linear size l it can be covered by n small objects of linear size l with a scale ratio λ l l in the case of fractal objects and sets the dimension is no longer an integer and is called fractal dimension d f mandelbrot 1967 1977 mandelbrot and pignoni 1983 feder 1988 even if its theoretical computation is rather complex an easier way to evaluate it is through the box counting method hentschel and procaccia 1983 lovejoy et al 1987 it takes into account that when λ there is a power law relation between the fractal dimension and the number of non empty pixels of the set n λ at the scale λ 3 n λ λ d f where means the asymptotic equivalence therefore the box counting method can be easily applied considering a simple methodology to change the resolution of a given dataset let us define a as the geometrical set embedded in a space of dimension d in this paper we will consider the 2 d space to be analysed and n λ a the number of non overlapping pixels at the resolution λ necessary to cover the set a thus the method consists in firstly counting the number of non empty pixels at the smallest pixel size l then we multiply the pixel size by two at each step of process practically it means that in the 2 d case we merge 4 by 4 pixels at each scale variation step and count again the number of non empty pixels at this new size and we continue this procedure until we achieve the maximum pixel size l once we have counted the numbers of non empty pixels n λ at different scales λ we display them in a log log plot λ v s n λ then if a is a fractal set the points of this plot will be along a straight line and from eq 1 we can estimate the fractal dimension d f as its slope furthermore the codimension of a fractal set is usually geometrically defined as mandelbrot 1967 1977 feder 1988 falconer 1990 4 c d d f then it is also possible to probabilistically define the fractal codimension using eqs 3 and 4 where the probability that a cube embedded in the set r d at a scale λ is contained in the fractal set is given by 5 λ d d f λ c this last definition is more general because it enables c d which would imply d f 0 from eq 4 the concept of fractal dimension is related to the sparseness of a dataset and it is well applied to binary fields e g rainfall occurrence rain gauge network distribution many geophysical fields with different intensity levels and also irregular geometries and scale invariance can be seen as fractal fields at different thresholds singularities then for each singularity it is possible to calculate its fractal dimension which means that the field is characterised by several fractal dimensions according to the imposed threshold grassberger 1983 hentschel and procaccia 1983 schertzer and lovejoy 1984 i e for each given threshold a different fractal dimension is estimated for the field that exceeds the threshold these fields were named by parisi and frisch 1985 as multifractals multifractals rely on the assumption that a geophysical field is generated through a multiplicative cascade process schertzer and lovejoy 1987 2011 produced by random multiplicative modulation of large scale structures into small scale ones furthermore rainfall fields have been widely studied as presenting multifractal behaviour schertzer and lovejoy 1987 ladoy et al 1993 tessier et al 1993 olsson and niemczynowicz 1996 de lima and grasman 1999 deidda 2000 veneziano et al 2006 garcía marín et al 2008 serinaldi 2010 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 paz 2018 as just mentioned the multifractal fields are characterised by a hierarchy of fractal dimensions and codimensions then by referring to the notion of fractal codimension one can calculate for a given multifractal field ε λ the probability of obtaining a singularity of order greater than or equal to γ at the scale λ 6 pr ε λ λ γ λ d f γ λ d λ c γ where the codimension function c γ d d f γ is convex and increases with λ additionally multifractal fields can also be described by their statistical moments schertzer and lovejoy 1987 1991 introduced the scaling moment function k q which is also convex and characterises the various q th order statistical moments of the multifractal field ε λ 7 ε λ q λ k q where q is the statistical moments order and ε λ q is the q th moment mean of the intensities at the scale λ furthermore parisi and frisch 1985 demonstrated that the two functions c γ and k q have a one to one relationship which is highlighted by the legendre transform 8 k q max γ q γ c γ c γ max q q γ k q these related expressions bring the correspondence between the orders of moments q and the singularities γ such that 9 q γ c γ c γ q γ γ k q γ 10 γ q k q k q q γ q c γ q where at the moment of order q corresponds the singularity γ q and conversely at the singularity γ corresponds the order of moment q γ in addition it is possible to see from eq 6 that more rare rainfall events with very large singularities γ correspond to bigger values of c γ consequently due to the convexity of both c γ and k q and to the legendre transform for q 1 these extreme events also correspond to bigger values of q and k q as both statistical functions c γ and k q have the only constraint of convexity there is an infinity of parameters required to characterise a multifractal process however schertzer and lovejoy 1987 1997 explored the concept of universality usually used in physics where among an infinite number of parameters only a few would be relevant and developed the universal multifractals um see schertzer and lovejoy 2011 for a more recent review in this context c γ and k q can be fully described by only three um parameters α c 1 and h as 11 k q q h c 1 α 1 q α q α 1 c 1 q log q α 1 12 c γ h c 1 γ c 1 α 1 α α α 1 c 1 e x p γ c 1 1 α 1 where 1 α 1 α 1 for all α 1 and α is the levy s multifractality index 0 α 2 it measures the degree of multifractality of the process in particular if α 0 we observe a monofractal process also entitled β model mandelbrot 1974 and α 2 corresponds to the maximum of multifractality for a model improperly called lognormal c 1 is the codimension of the mean singularity of the field it measures the mean inhomogeneity where c 1 0 for a homogeneous field the more it increases the more the singularity of the field average is dispersed we thus observe a field rarely exceeding its mean but which can do so in an extremely strong way h is the hurst s exponent which measures the degree of non conservation of the field values of h close to zero indicate higher conservativeness of the process while performing a multifractal analysis of a rainfall field we should determine its statistical functions c γ and k q the trace moment tm method schertzer and lovejoy 1987 allows to directly determine the scaling moments function k q for any q 0 as k q 0 for q 1 ε λ q λ k q when λ then to avoid this divergence the concept of flux π λ is used given by 13 π λ ε λ d d x and the trace of the q th power of the flux is 14 t r ε λ q ε λ q d qd x λ k q d q 1 in practice the method consists in taking the q th power of each value of the field ε λ at the scale λ and then the ensemble average of q th power moments is calculated at that scale then from eq 14 the same process is repeated for different scales λ the resulting averages are displayed as a function of λ in a log log plot and a linear regression is performed to obtain the value of k q which will be estimated as the given slope finally by repeating this process also with other values of q we obtain the k q function and via legendre transform the c γ function thus once we know k q it is possible to indirectly determine the um parameters α and c 1 15 c 1 k 1 16 α k 1 c 1 in the framework of um lavallée et al 1993 developed the double trace moment dtm method to directly determine the parameters α and c 1 which means that there is no need to firstly obtain k q and c γ this technique is in fact a generalisation of the tm method and considers that the q th order moments of the renormalised η power of a conservative field ε λ remain scale invariant then the idea is to apply the tm method to this renormalised field through the k q η function 17 ε λ η q λ k q η ε λ η q ε λ η q λ k q η λ q k η λ k q η q k η where ε λ η ε λ η ε λ η then 18 k q η k q η q k η since this method is especially applied for um considering eqs 11 and 18 becomes 19 k q η η α k q from eq 19 the parameter α can be directly estimated as the slope of the linear part of k q η vs η in a log log plot for a given q and in the same log log plot the parameter c 1 can be also estimated from the interception value of the linear part and the axis l o g η 0 hoang 2011 in addition according to the intersection theorem schertzer and lovejoy 1987 considering two independent multi fractal fields ε 1 λ and ε 2 λ embedded in the same space and presuming that the intersection of both ε 1 λ ε 2 λ is not empty for the given intersection the probability of obtaining a singularity of order greater than or equal to γ at the scale λ is 20 pr ε 1 λ ε 2 λ λ γ pr ε 1 λ λ γ pr ε 2 λ λ γ therefore following eq 6 the resulting codimension is the addition of independent multi fractal processes 21 c ε 1 ε 2 γ c ε 1 γ c ε 2 γ in the following section we will use the fractal and multifractal with the help of the dtm method and the intersection theorem approaches to discuss the rain gauge networks limitations and the implications to hydrological modelling 4 results and discussion in this work the sub catchments distribution of the pilot site of bièvre catchment which had already been modelled with the semi distributed model infoworks cs paz 2018 paz et al 2018 was used to construct a network of virtual rain gauges located in the centre of mass of each sub catchment then an area of 8 km 8 km was selected using the x band radar grid fig 2 this choice corresponds to the most homogeneous distribution of virtual rain gauges over a square area of bièvre catchment containing 15 of the 27 virtual rain gauges four different rainfall fields have been analysed over the selected area fig 3 a original radar data b original radar data corresponding to each centroid pixel c sub catchment averaged rainfall radar data d sub catchment averaged rainfall radar data being concentrated at the corresponding centroid pixel as well as a e fractal distribution of the corresponding virtual rain gauges located at the centroid pixels firstly the fractal analysis of the 15 virtual rain gauge pixels distribution which will also be called rainfall support was performed using the box counting method fig 4 with a simple scilab routine gires et al 2017 2018 which applies the methodology described in the previous section see eq 3 to the dataset it is possible to identify a scaling break with two different behaviours for the small scales and the large scales at the spatial scale of 2 km which is in fact the average sub catchment s size and close to the 1 km resolution of the c band radar rainfall data that have been used for the model calibration then a relatively high fractal dimension df 1 66 obtained over the large scale range corresponds to the network of 15 virtual rain gauges at 2 km scale this number of gauges remains still reasonable although only 6 real rain gauges are available for the full bièvre catchment i e 4 over the selected area preserving the same fractal dimension df 1 66 over smaller scales up to 250 m the resolution of the x band radar rainfall would result in n 315 virtual rain gauges and or sub catchments thus a smaller number of gauges n 15 characterised by much lower fractal dimension df 0 185 significantly reduces the captivity of spatial rainfall variability over small scales and hence its representability in the model having a constant rainfall per sub catchment of 2 km characteristic scale this result from the fractal analysis of the 15 virtual rain gauge network distribution corroborates the researches from austin 1987 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 seed and austin 1990 vieux and vieux 2005 villarini et al 2008 peleg et al 2013 which identify the difficulties of sparsely distributed rain gauge networks to capture the high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation fields specially high convective ones while comparing to weather radars on the other hand when dealing with the sub catchment sizes it also confirms the findings of thorndahl et al 2017 based on a review of the state of the art about the use of weather radar rainfall data in urban hydrology schilling 1991 berne et al 2004 einfalt et al 2004 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 in which they associate the better spatial and temporal resolution of radar rainfall data to decreasing catchment sizes then to better evaluate the unfortunate consequences of sparse rain gauge networks the multifractal analyses were performed over the studied rainfall fields in conditions a b c and d and then related to the fractal analysis of the rain gauge s distribution with the help of the legendre transform firstly the dtm method was applied fig 5 following the methodology described in section 3 eq 19 on ensemble of data over the whole rainfall event each time step being considered as an independent realisation with scaling break the values obtained for α and c 1 for the six studied events are presented at tables 1 rainfall fields a 2 rainfall fields b 3 rainfall fields c and 4 rainfall fields d due to the fact that the rainfall fields condition a and the virtual rain gauge s network distribution condition e are fully independent the intersection theorem see section 3 implies that the codimension function of their product condition b will correspond to the following sum of the codimension functions 22 c b a e γ c a γ c e γ and then by legendre transform see section 3 the scaling moment function of the product condition b will correspond to the sum of the scaling moment functions of the rainfall field condition a and the virtual rain gauge network condition e 23 k b a e q k a q k e q the relationships similar to eqs 22 and 23 stand for the rainfall fields condition c virtual rain gauge network condition e and their product condition d as well figs 6 and 7 present the theoretical k q curves for all fields taking into account the estimated values from fig 4 and tables 1 4 for small scales 250 m 2 km and large scales 2 km 8 km respectively considering that α was simulated as 0 when the estimated α 0 and as 2 when the estimated α 2 from fig 6 one may note that the monofractality of fields b and d at small scales denoted by the estimated α values close to 0 in tables 2 and 4 respectively affects the suitability of the intersection theorem see section 3 and eq 23 on the other hand for the large scales in fig 7 the theoretical expression given by eq 23 works better for some of the events than for others the k a q k e q curves fit better the k b q ones for 05 06 10 2015 21 23 05 2016 28 31 05 2016 and 17 06 2016 events than those for 12 13 09 2015 and 16 09 2015 events this could be easily understood by evaluating the linear term of the eq 23 indeed the scaling moment function of the network will correspond to the β model using eq 4 24 k e q c q 1 where over the large scales c 2 1 66 0 34 and this is independently either of rainfall events or rainfall fields then 25 k b q c 1 α 1 q α q c q 1 c 1 α 1 q α c 1 α 1 c q c the resulting scaling moment function is no longer um function but still could be well approximated by it at least between statistical moments of the orders 1 3 when the pre factor c 1 α 1 c of the linear term remains positive with c 0 34 and um parameters from tables 1 and 3 over large scales one may obtain the following estimates table 5 of these pre factors for conditions a and c finally the results from the multifractal analyses presented in this section indicate a twofold discussion i the events with stronger negative values of the pre factor give less empirical agreement with the theoretical expression of eq 23 ii and on the contrary a larger positive pre factor leads to a much stronger convergence between the theoretical and empirical curves 5 conclusions in this study we performed multi fractal analysis on rain gauge network and x band radar rainfall data in the context of urban hydrological modelling the main objectives of this work are to analyse the impacts of the rainfall data spatio temporal variability on hydrological modelling presenting the limitations of sparse rain gauge networks compared to high resolution radar data and to discuss the suitability of radar rain gauge conditioning considering the fractality of rain gauge networks this paper takes the bièvre catchment which is a semi urbanised area of 110 km2 located in the southwest of paris region as a case study in this work we used the semi distributed modelling distribution of this area performed with the infoworks cs and considered a virtual rain gauge in the centre of mass of each sub catchment then we compared the rainfall data distributions of the virtual rain gauge network with those obtained from the enpc dual polarised x band radar firstly we performed a fractal analysis of the virtual rain gauge network distribution and identified a scaling break at 2 km then we took advantage of the intersection theorem associated to the multifractal theory to analyse the relationship between both rain gauge and radar data the obtained results suggest that the semi distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges and that inhomogeneous distributions of rain gauging networks lead to only partial information on the rainfall fields a scaling break is retrieved in the fractal analysis of the virtual rain gauge distribution at the scale of 2 km which is close to the average sub catchment s size the fractality of the rainfall support here represented by the fixed number of 15 virtual rain gauges over the selected 8 km 8 km area is biased by this distribution where the small scale behaviour is clearly different of the large scale one this implies that to respect the rainfall support fractality and its capability to consider the rainfall variability over the small scales the same fractality of the large scales should be found at the small scales in fact the statistics of measured rainfall are strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields in spite of the radar data calibration additionally a proper rainfall data re normalisation is needed when comparing gauged rainfall with the radar data and consequently when quantifying the impacts of space time variability within hydrological modelling one may also note that a conditioning by the rain gauges could be rather counterproductive for rainfall events with c 1 α 1 being weaker than the codimension of the fractal rain gauge networks furthermore since the bièvre catchment was calibrated to c band radar data in case of the number and distribution of the virtual rain gauges would be reliable in comparison to the c band radar resolution 1 km2 actually the siavb network has only 6 rain gauges the number of rain gauges to perform the calibration of better resolution radar data e g non polarimetric x band radar should be big enough to respect the same fractality of the big scales this also means that the size of the sub catchments should be comparable to the resolution of the rainfall data used which would drastically increase the number of sub catchments and become unmanageable funding this research was partially funded by the chair hydrology for resilient cities endowed by veolia and by the department of science

conclusions are presented in section 5 2 case study and rainfall data the bièvre valley which is a 110 km2 semi urbanised area in the southwest of paris region was selected as case study the bièvre river is 33 km long tributary of the seine river and its upstream catchment is managed by two local authorities the casqy communauté d agglomération de saint quentin en yvelines saint quentin en yvelines agglomération community in the upstream portion and the siavb syndicat intercommunal d assainissement de la vallée de la bièvre inter municipal local authority for sanitation of the bièvre valley in the downstream portion the bièvre catchment was modelled using infoworks cs collection systems paz 2018 paz et al 2018 a widely used semi distributed model soft 2010 with the operation responsibility given to the company veolia since 1991 by the local authority siavb to perform a real time control of the hydrological area this hydrological model is integrated in the optim sim platform developed by veolia that mimics the actual regulation of the storage basins paz 2018 paz et al 2018 in two simulation modes the replay mode and the forecasting mode the first one extracts rainfall data from the 6 siavb rain gauges network database using the thiessen polygons technique to replay past events and the forecasting mode uses different rainfall data e g from weather radar measurements to simulate the catchment hydrological behaviour the catchment area is divided into 27 sub catchments as displayed on fig 1 this modelling had been firstly calibrated using the rainfall data from the météo france c band radar of trappes located in a direct proximity 0 20 km of the catchment see fig 1 with a resolution of 1 km 1 km 5 min these c band radar data are firstly obtained as reflectivity dbz and then after some post treatments and filtering process they are transformed into rainfall intensity r by applying the marshall palmer z r equation marshall and palmer 1948 with fixed parameters a 200 and b 1 6 eq 1 which means that the polarimetric capability of this radar of trappes has not been used in addition this catchment also contains a network of six tipping bucket rain gauges see fig 1 which had been used to calibrate the c band radar data 1 z a r b however in this study we used rainfall data from the enpc dual polarimetric x band radar of champs sur marne see fig 1 with distances ranging between 25 and 45 km and a 250 m 250 m 3 41 min resolution the enpc x band dual polarization surface rainfall intensity dpsri product still considers the z r relationship

some objects of very irregular or fragmented form with unusual properties in classical geometry mandelbrot 1974 named them as fractals fractus means irregular in latin nevertheless fractal objects must not just be irregular but also scale invariant which means that their form remains unchanged at different scales of observation this brings the properties of self similarity a zoomed part of the object looks similar to the object itself with an isotropic variation and self affinity when the variation is anisotropic in classical geometry dimensions are integers characterising regular spaces as straight lines 1d planar figures 2d and volumes 3d if we take an object embedded in an euclidian dimension d of linear size l it can be covered by n small objects of linear size l with a scale ratio λ l l in the case of fractal objects and sets the dimension is no longer an integer and is called fractal dimension d f mandelbrot 1967 1977 mandelbrot and pignoni 1983 feder 1988 even if its theoretical computation is rather complex an easier way to evaluate it is through the box counting method hentschel and procaccia 1983 lovejoy et al 1987 it takes into account that when λ there is a power law relation between the fractal dimension and the number of non empty pixels of the set n λ at the scale λ 3 n λ λ d f where means the asymptotic equivalence therefore the box counting method can be easily applied considering a simple methodology to change the resolution of a given dataset let us define a as the geometrical set embedded in a space of dimension d in this paper we will consider the 2 d space to be analysed and n λ a the number of non overlapping pixels at the resolution λ necessary to cover the set a thus the method consists in firstly counting the number of non empty pixels at the smallest pixel size l then we multiply the pixel size by two at each step of process practically it means that in the 2 d case we merge 4 by 4 pixels at each scale variation step and count again the number of non empty pixels at this new size and we continue this procedure until we achieve the maximum pixel size l once we have counted the numbers of non empty pixels n λ at different scales λ we display them in a log log plot λ v s n λ then if a is a fractal set the points of this plot will be along a straight line and from eq 1 we can estimate the fractal dimension d f as its slope furthermore the codimension of a fractal set is usually geometrically defined as mandelbrot 1967 1977 feder 1988 falconer 1990 4 c d d f then it is also possible to probabilistically define the fractal codimension using eqs 3 and 4 where the probability that a cube embedded in the set r d at a scale λ is contained in the fractal set is given by 5 λ d d f λ c this last definition is more general because it enables c d which would imply d f 0 from eq 4 the concept of fractal dimension is related to the sparseness of a dataset and it is well applied to binary fields e g rainfall occurrence rain gauge network distribution many geophysical fields with different intensity levels and also irregular geometries and scale invariance can be seen as fractal fields at different thresholds singularities then for each singularity it is possible to calculate its fractal dimension which means that the field is characterised by several fractal dimensions according to the imposed threshold grassberger 1983 hentschel and procaccia 1983 schertzer and lovejoy 1984 i e for each given threshold a different fractal dimension is estimated for the field that exceeds the threshold these fields were named by parisi and frisch 1985 as multifractals multifractals rely on the assumption that a geophysical field is generated through a multiplicative cascade process schertzer and lovejoy 1987 2011 produced by random multiplicative modulation of large scale structures into small scale ones furthermore rainfall fields have been widely studied as presenting multifractal behaviour schertzer and lovejoy 1987 ladoy et al 1993 tessier et al 1993 olsson and niemczynowicz 1996 de lima and grasman 1999 deidda 2000 veneziano et al 2006 garcía marín et al 2008 serinaldi 2010 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 paz 2018 as just mentioned the multifractal fields are characterised by a hierarchy of fractal dimensions and codimensions then by referring to the notion of fractal codimension one can calculate for a given multifractal field ε λ the probability of obtaining a singularity of order greater than or equal to γ at the scale λ 6 pr ε λ λ γ λ d f γ λ d λ c γ where the codimension function c γ d d f γ is convex and increases with λ additionally multifractal fields can also be described by their statistical moments schertzer and lovejoy 1987 1991 introduced the scaling moment function k q which is also convex and characterises the various q th order statistical moments of the multifractal field ε λ 7 ε λ q λ k q where q is the statistical moments order and ε λ q is the q th moment mean of the intensities at the scale λ furthermore parisi and frisch 1985 demonstrated that the two functions c γ and k q have a one to one relationship which is highlighted by the legendre transform 8 k q max γ q γ c γ c γ max q q γ k q these related expressions bring the correspondence between the orders of moments q and the singularities γ such that 9 q γ c γ c γ q γ γ k q γ 10 γ q k q k q q γ q c γ q where at the moment of order q corresponds the singularity γ q and conversely at the singularity γ corresponds the order of moment q γ in addition it is possible to see from eq 6 that more rare rainfall events with very large singularities γ correspond to bigger values of c γ consequently due to the convexity of both c γ and k q and to the legendre transform for q 1 these extreme events also correspond to bigger values of q and k q as both statistical functions c γ and k q have the only constraint of convexity there is an infinity of parameters required to characterise a multifractal process however schertzer and lovejoy 1987 1997 explored the concept of universality usually used in physics where among an infinite number of parameters only a few would be relevant and developed the universal multifractals um see schertzer and lovejoy 2011 for a more recent review in this context c γ and k q can be fully described by only three um parameters α c 1 and h as 11 k q q h c 1 α 1 q α q α 1 c 1 q log q α 1 12 c γ h c 1 γ c 1 α 1 α α α 1 c 1 e x p γ c 1 1 α 1 where 1 α 1 α 1 for all α 1 and α is the levy s multifractality index 0 α 2 it measures the degree of multifractality of the process in particular if α 0 we observe a monofractal process also entitled β model mandelbrot 1974 and α 2 corresponds to the maximum of multifractality for a model improperly called lognormal c 1 is the codimension of the mean singularity of the field it measures the mean inhomogeneity where c 1 0 for a homogeneous field the more it increases the more the singularity of the field average is dispersed we thus observe a field rarely exceeding its mean but which can do so in an extremely strong way h is the hurst s exponent which measures the degree of non conservation of the field values of h close to zero indicate higher conservativeness of the process while performing a multifractal analysis of a rainfall field we should determine its statistical functions c γ and k q the trace moment tm method schertzer and lovejoy 1987 allows to directly determine the scaling moments function k q for any q 0 as k q 0 for q 1 ε λ q λ k q when λ then to avoid this divergence the concept of flux π λ is used given by 13 π λ ε λ d d x and the trace of the q th power of the flux is 14 t r ε λ q ε λ q d qd x λ k q d q 1 in practice the method consists in taking the q th power of each value of the field ε λ at the scale λ and then the ensemble average of q th power moments is calculated at that scale then from eq 14 the same process is repeated for different scales λ the resulting averages are displayed as a function of λ in a log log plot and a linear regression is performed to obtain the value of k q which will be estimated as the given slope finally by repeating this process also with other values of q we obtain the k q function and via legendre transform the c γ function thus once we know k q it is possible to indirectly determine the um parameters α and c 1 15 c 1 k 1 16 α k 1 c 1 in the framework of um lavallée et al 1993 developed the double trace moment dtm method to directly determine the parameters α and c 1 which means that there is no need to firstly obtain k q and c γ this technique is in fact a generalisation of the tm method and considers that the q th order moments of the renormalised η power of a conservative field ε λ remain scale invariant then the idea is to apply the tm method to this renormalised field through the k q η function 17 ε λ η q λ k q η ε λ η q ε λ η q λ k q η λ q k η λ k q η q k η where ε λ η ε λ η ε λ η then 18 k q η k q η q k η since this method is especially applied for um considering eqs 11 and 18 becomes 19 k q η η α k q from eq 19 the parameter α can be directly estimated as the slope of the linear part of k q η vs η in a log log plot for a given q and in the same log log plot the parameter c 1 can be also estimated from the interception value of the linear part and the axis l o g η 0 hoang 2011 in addition according to the intersection theorem schertzer and lovejoy 1987 considering two independent multi fractal fields ε 1 λ and ε 2 λ embedded in the same space and presuming that the intersection of both ε 1 λ ε 2 λ is not empty for the given intersection the probability of obtaining a singularity of order greater than or equal to γ at the scale λ is 20 pr ε 1 λ ε 2 λ λ γ pr ε 1 λ λ γ pr ε 2 λ λ γ therefore following eq 6 the resulting codimension is the addition of independent multi fractal processes 21 c ε 1 ε 2 γ c ε 1 γ c ε 2 γ in the following section we will use the fractal and multifractal with the help of the dtm method and the intersection theorem approaches to discuss the rain gauge networks limitations and the implications to hydrological modelling 4 results and discussion in this work the sub catchments distribution of the pilot site of bièvre catchment which had already been modelled with the semi distributed model infoworks cs paz 2018 paz et al 2018 was used to construct a network of virtual rain gauges located in the centre of mass of each sub catchment then an area of 8 km 8 km was selected using the x band radar grid fig 2 this choice corresponds to the most homogeneous distribution of virtual rain gauges over a square area of bièvre catchment containing 15 of the 27 virtual rain gauges four different rainfall fields have been analysed over the selected area fig 3 a original radar data b original radar data corresponding to each centroid pixel c sub catchment averaged rainfall radar data d sub catchment averaged rainfall radar data being concentrated at the corresponding centroid pixel as well as a e fractal distribution of the corresponding virtual rain gauges located at the centroid pixels firstly the fractal analysis of the 15 virtual rain gauge pixels distribution which will also be called rainfall support was performed using the box counting method fig 4 with a simple scilab routine gires et al 2017 2018 which applies the methodology described in the previous section see eq 3 to the dataset it is possible to identify a scaling break with two different behaviours for the small scales and the large scales at the spatial scale of 2 km which is in fact the average sub catchment s size and close to the 1 km resolution of the c band radar rainfall data that have been used for the model calibration then a relatively high fractal dimension df 1 66 obtained over the large scale range corresponds to the network of 15 virtual rain gauges at 2 km scale this number of gauges remains still reasonable although only 6 real rain gauges are available for the full bièvre catchment i e 4 over the selected area preserving the same fractal dimension df 1 66 over smaller scales up to 250 m the resolution of the x band radar rainfall would result in n 315 virtual rain gauges and or sub catchments thus a smaller number of gauges n 15 characterised by much lower fractal dimension df 0 185 significantly reduces the captivity of spatial rainfall variability over small scales and hence its representability in the model having a constant rainfall per sub catchment of 2 km characteristic scale this result from the fractal analysis of the 15 virtual rain gauge network distribution corroborates the researches from austin 1987 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 seed and austin 1990 vieux and vieux 2005 villarini et al 2008 peleg et al 2013 which identify the difficulties of sparsely distributed rain gauge networks to capture the high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation fields specially high convective ones while comparing to weather radars on the other hand when dealing with the sub catchment sizes it also confirms the findings of thorndahl et al 2017 based on a review of the state of the art about the use of weather radar rainfall data in urban hydrology schilling 1991 berne et al 2004 einfalt et al 2004 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 in which they associate the better spatial and temporal resolution of radar rainfall data to decreasing catchment sizes then to better evaluate the unfortunate consequences of sparse rain gauge networks the multifractal analyses were performed over the studied rainfall fields in conditions a b c and d and then related to the fractal analysis of the rain gauge s distribution with the help of the legendre transform firstly the dtm method was applied fig 5 following the methodology described in section 3 eq 19 on ensemble of data over the whole rainfall event each time step being considered as an independent realisation with scaling break the values obtained for α and c 1 for the six studied events are presented at tables 1 rainfall fields a 2 rainfall fields b 3 rainfall fields c and 4 rainfall fields d due to the fact that the rainfall fields condition a and the virtual rain gauge s network distribution condition e are fully independent the intersection theorem see section 3 implies that the codimension function of their product condition b will correspond to the following sum of the codimension functions 22 c b a e γ c a γ c e γ and then by legendre transform see section 3 the scaling moment function of the product condition b will correspond to the sum of the scaling moment functions of the rainfall field condition a and the virtual rain gauge network condition e 23 k b a e q k a q k e q the relationships similar to eqs 22 and 23 stand for the rainfall fields condition c virtual rain gauge network condition e and their product condition d as well figs 6 and 7 present the theoretical k q curves for all fields taking into account the estimated values from fig 4 and tables 1 4 for small scales 250 m 2 km and large scales 2 km 8 km respectively considering that α was simulated as 0 when the estimated α 0 and as 2 when the estimated α 2 from fig 6 one may note that the monofractality of fields b and d at small scales denoted by the estimated α values close to 0 in tables 2 and 4 respectively affects the suitability of the intersection theorem see section 3 and eq 23 on the other hand for the large scales in fig 7 the theoretical expression given by eq 23 works better for some of the events than for others the k a q k e q curves fit better the k b q ones for 05 06 10 2015 21 23 05 2016 28 31 05 2016 and 17 06 2016 events than those for 12 13 09 2015 and 16 09 2015 events this could be easily understood by evaluating the linear term of the eq 23 indeed the scaling moment function of the network will correspond to the β model using eq 4 24 k e q c q 1 where over the large scales c 2 1 66 0 34 and this is independently either of rainfall events or rainfall fields then 25 k b q c 1 α 1 q α q c q 1 c 1 α 1 q α c 1 α 1 c q c the resulting scaling moment function is no longer um function but still could be well approximated by it at least between statistical moments of the orders 1 3 when the pre factor c 1 α 1 c of the linear term remains positive with c 0 34 and um parameters from tables 1 and 3 over large scales one may obtain the following estimates table 5 of these pre factors for conditions a and c finally the results from the multifractal analyses presented in this section indicate a twofold discussion i the events with stronger negative values of the pre factor give less empirical agreement with the theoretical expression of eq 23 ii and on the contrary a larger positive pre factor leads to a much stronger convergence between the theoretical and empirical curves 5 conclusions in this study we performed multi fractal analysis on rain gauge network and x band radar rainfall data in the context of urban hydrological modelling the main objectives of this work are to analyse the impacts of the rainfall data spatio temporal variability on hydrological modelling presenting the limitations of sparse rain gauge networks compared to high resolution radar data and to discuss the suitability of radar rain gauge conditioning considering the fractality of rain gauge networks this paper takes the bièvre catchment which is a semi urbanised area of 110 km2 located in the southwest of paris region as a case study in this work we used the semi distributed modelling distribution of this area performed with the infoworks cs and considered a virtual rain gauge in the centre of mass of each sub catchment then we compared the rainfall data distributions of the virtual rain gauge network with those obtained from the enpc dual polarised x band radar firstly we performed a fractal analysis of the virtual rain gauge network distribution and identified a scaling break at 2 km then we took advantage of the intersection theorem associated to the multifractal theory to analyse the relationship between both rain gauge and radar data the obtained results suggest that the semi distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges and that inhomogeneous distributions of rain gauging networks lead to only partial information on the rainfall fields a scaling break is retrieved in the fractal analysis of the virtual rain gauge distribution at the scale of 2 km which is close to the average sub catchment s size the fractality of the rainfall support here represented by the fixed number of 15 virtual rain gauges over the selected 8 km 8 km area is biased by this distribution where the small scale behaviour is clearly different of the large scale one this implies that to respect the rainfall support fractality and its capability to consider the rainfall variability over the small scales the same fractality of the large scales should be found at the small scales in fact the statistics of measured rainfall are strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields in spite of the radar data calibration additionally a proper rainfall data re normalisation is needed when comparing gauged rainfall with the radar data and consequently when quantifying the impacts of space time variability within hydrological modelling one may also note that a conditioning by the rain gauges could be rather counterproductive for rainfall events with c 1 α 1 being weaker than the codimension of the fractal rain gauge networks furthermore since the bièvre catchment was calibrated to c band radar data in case of the number and distribution of the virtual rain gauges would be reliable in comparison to the c band radar resolution 1 km2 actually the siavb network has only 6 rain gauges the number of rain gauges to perform the calibration of better resolution radar data e g non polarimetric x band radar should be big enough to respect the same fractality of the big scales this also means that the size of the sub catchments should be comparable to the resolution of the rainfall data used which would drastically increase the number of sub catchments and become unmanageable funding this research was partially funded by the chair hydrology for resilient cities endowed by veolia and by the department of science

5722,this discussion extends published findings on the use of artificial intelligence models for time series modeling monthly streamflow forecasting at the port elgin station on the saugeen river canada published results are applied and run in autoregressive ar and moving average ma models as well as hybrids of these with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch namely ar arch and ma arch the hybrid solutions are concluded to be superior to both linear and nonlinear modeling approaches however common nonlinear methods including neural networks have a recognized defect in time series forecasting known as inappropriate time series modeling inputs the present study addresses this significant source of error in nonlinear modeling by referring to time series components via suitable time series preprocessing of particular interest in this discussion provides the novel vision for time series modeling using nonlinear approaches the nature of the hydrological variables in time series modeling has great impact on the predicted output and should thus be considered in the modeling procedure an appropriate preprocessing technique must also be considered carefully in order to attain reliable nonlinear modeling results keywords water resources time series modelling stochastic hybrid linear nonlinear 1 introduction the monthly streamflow estimations through local and external data analysis approaches that are employed in this study are acknowledged with gratitude mehdizadeh et al 2019 explored the use of autoregressive ar and moving average ma techniques as individual time series models and compared them to the same models hybridized with an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch model in estimating monthly streamflow in addition the authors compared the prediction accuracy of the hybrid and traditional stochastic methods with two artificial intelligence ai approaches namely multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep although the paper offers valuable and interesting information on monthly streamflow prediction a number of concerns require additional investigation this discussion will consequently show how a lack of time series modeling data can lead to erroneous results 2 linear modeling the linear modeling performed by mehdizadeh et al 2019 led to the introduction of the ar and ma models however the conditions for using these models are that the time series are stationary and there are no trend period and jump terms in the desired time series moeeni et al 2017b zeynoddin et al 2018 2019 ebtehaj et al 2019 2020 before modeling time series using stochastic methods the deterministic terms period jump and trend must be eliminated bonakdari et al 2019 in addition the stationarity of the time series must also be evaluated which is done with the kpss kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test the presence of the trend and jump terms is evaluated by applying the mann kendal mk and mann whitney mw tests respectively while the fisher test is employed to check the existence of a period the test results of the main time series for port elgin table 1 indicate that this series is not normal p value jarque bera jb 0 05 and also has a trend p value mann kendall mk 0 05 applying ln based normalization eq 1 mehdizadeh et al 2019 and standardization eq 2 mehdizadeh et al 2019 shows that although it is possible to normalize the newly generated time series this transformed time series does not fulfill the stationarity condition and also presents trend and jump terms moreover according to table 1 only the p value jb of 0 05 and p value in other tests are below the significant level 5 although the explanation provided suggests that under these conditions modeling is incorrect the indices of the models proposed by mehdizadeh et al 2019 for port elgin ought to be examined as well table 2 indicates that the values of the mentioned statistical indices are not correct in the testing phase furthermore it is very rare to find practical usages of ar n and ma n where n is larger than two nonetheless in table 5 of mehdizadeh et al 2019 ar 11 and ma 9 are recommended for modeling the monthly streamflow perhaps due to the strong seasonality appeared in the monthly streamflow time series a lag of eleven needed to be adopted to achieve a satisfying modeling performance however seasonal arma models do exist seasonal arma models should be taken into consideration before the applications of ar 11 and ma 9 3 nonlinear modeling a key question regarding nonlinear modeling that remains unanswered in the original article is whether the best input combination is selected for variable based nonlinear modeling with neural network methods the inputs and output s are clear and the models are applicable to the dataset time series modeling however offers numerous combinations of previous lags from which to select the most appropriate time series input combination therefore applying suitable preprocessing should lead to determining and selecting the most effective lag for modeling in monthly modeling of a hydrological variable the seasonal effect should be taken into account moeeni et al 2017b zeynoddin et al 2018 yaseen et al 2017 2018 2019 ebtehaj et al 2020 the periodic lag in monthly modeling is expected to be within 12 repetitions mehdizadeh et al 2019 mentioned that before implementing the models the data must be preprocessed however when using an artificial intelligence ai based technique to model hydrological phenomena it is not necessary to apply normality and stationarity transforms to raw data for port elgin station for example mars and gep were implemented in the current study using raw data with no preprocessing to check the necessity for stationarity or normality transforms before implementing the ai based approaches fig 1 illustrates the autocorrelation function acf of the raw data the existence of seasonal lags is clear in this figure therefore different lags are considered in predicting streamflow as eq 1 1 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 q t 12 q t 24 q t 36 q t 48 q t 60 scatter plots of the monthly streamflow at port elgin station obtained using gep and mars in the training and testing stages are provided in fig 2 the statistical indices in table 3 represent the superior performance of gep and mars in predicting monthly streamflow with no preprocessing moreover the results in fig 3 represent the relative error of mehdizadeh et al s 2019 models in comparison with the gep and mars models in this study it is clear that using seasonal parameters as inputs in the gep and mars models results in more accurate models than the preprocessed gep and mars the gep parameters indicated in table 2 of mehdizadeh et al s 2019 are the default values of gep parameters to determine the optimum model however it is necessary to find the optimum gep parameter values the optimum values obtained for the gep parameters are given in table 4 they were found through a trial and error process the relative root square error rrse is considered as fitness function in the current study it is obvious that all mentioned parameters for the optimum model except number of chromosomes are different from mehdizadeh et al s 2019 therefore the optimality of the models presented in this paper is questionable for further investigation the effect of each input seasonal and non seasonal on the gep results is examined using sensitivity analysis fig 4 indicates the changing effect of each input variable on the models indices i e r and rmse according to eq 1 nine different variables are employed for streamflow modeling by considering eight input variables constant one of those variable experiences an alteration ranges from 10 to 10 with a step of 1 20 points r and rmse of the model output are calculated as a result of the change in the desired input variables in the mentioned range finally the average of each index in the respective variation range is deemed the gep based model s sensitivity to each input variable the relative error in the fig 4 is calculated as follows 2 relative change 100 n i 1 n inde x i i n d e x r inde x r due to that alteration ranges are from 10 to 10 with a step of 1 n is equal to 20 indexi is the calculated index r or rmse for ith step and indexr is the reference index r or rmse for the reference value as illustrated in fig 4 in training q t 3 has the maximum relative error for each index compared to the observed values the gep based model s sensitivity to q t 36 is recognized as the most sensitive seasonal parameter in the testing phase the effect of the seasonal parameters is much greater whereby a change in q t 36 leads to the highest relative error for each index compared to the observed values accordingly the importance of seasonal parameters in streamflow prediction at port elgin is evident 4 comparison of the hybrid and individual models the hybrid models presented are ar arch and ma arch previous studies have shown that combining stochastic methods with gep can also yield good results table 5 mehdizadeh et al 2019 illustrates that the hybrid models are compared only with linear stochastic methods ar and ma and no results are given for arch according to a prior study zeynoddin et al 2018 lotfi et al 2019 nonlinear and hybrid model results could be similar to each other therefore using arch may provide results close to the hybrid models ar arch and ma arch in addition moeeni et al 2017a presented a hybrid of stochastic models ar and ma with gep and proved this combination performs well generally however no adequate comparisons of hybrid and individual models have been performed 5 external analysis is not a valid prediction strategy with strategy 2 external analysis q t of the adjacent station was selected as the model input table 3 mehdizadeh et al 2019 using this input is only appropriate when the purpose is to find missing data as such q t at station 2 cannot be used to predict q t at station 1 the reason is that when the aim is to predict q t time t has not yet arrived hence no value for q t at station 2 is recorded that can serve as a model input to predict q t at station 1 therefore since the title regards monthly streamflow estimation using local and external data analysis approaches the second strategy external analysis is useless 6 lack of use of aic to compare hybrid and individual models mehdizadeh et al 2019 stated that the best model was selected among ar and ma using aic but the results of this index are not presented to compare individual and hybrid models for example in table 5 mehdizadeh et al 2019 ar 1 is compared with ma 4 port elgin however since it is known that aic reflects model accuracy and complexity simultaneously it facilitates selecting the best model it is wrong to compare a model selected through aic with indicators that are purely accuracy based in addition the hybrid model results should also be compared with the single model results using this index to allow for taking into account the model s complexity and accuracy simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

5722,this discussion extends published findings on the use of artificial intelligence models for time series modeling monthly streamflow forecasting at the port elgin station on the saugeen river canada published results are applied and run in autoregressive ar and moving average ma models as well as hybrids of these with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch namely ar arch and ma arch the hybrid solutions are concluded to be superior to both linear and nonlinear modeling approaches however common nonlinear methods including neural networks have a recognized defect in time series forecasting known as inappropriate time series modeling inputs the present study addresses this significant source of error in nonlinear modeling by referring to time series components via suitable time series preprocessing of particular interest in this discussion provides the novel vision for time series modeling using nonlinear approaches the nature of the hydrological variables in time series modeling has great impact on the predicted output and should thus be considered in the modeling procedure an appropriate preprocessing technique must also be considered carefully in order to attain reliable nonlinear modeling results keywords water resources time series modelling stochastic hybrid linear nonlinear 1 introduction the monthly streamflow estimations through local and external data analysis approaches that are employed in this study are acknowledged with gratitude mehdizadeh et al 2019 explored the use of autoregressive ar and moving average ma techniques as individual time series models and compared them to the same models hybridized with an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch model in estimating monthly streamflow in addition the authors compared the prediction accuracy of the hybrid and traditional stochastic methods with two artificial intelligence ai approaches namely multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep although the paper offers valuable and interesting information on monthly streamflow prediction a number of concerns require additional investigation this discussion will consequently show how a lack of time series modeling data can lead to erroneous results 2 linear modeling the linear modeling performed by mehdizadeh et al 2019 led to the introduction of the ar and ma models however the conditions for using these models are that the time series are stationary and there are no trend period and jump terms in the desired time series moeeni et al 2017b zeynoddin et al 2018 2019 ebtehaj et al 2019 2020 before modeling time series using stochastic methods the deterministic terms period jump and trend must be eliminated bonakdari et al 2019 in addition the stationarity of the time series must also be evaluated which is done with the kpss kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test the presence of the trend and jump terms is evaluated by applying the mann kendal mk and mann whitney mw tests respectively while the fisher test is employed to check the existence of a period the test results of the main time series for port elgin table 1 indicate that this series is not normal p value jarque bera jb 0 05 and also has a trend p value mann kendall mk 0 05 applying ln based normalization eq 1 mehdizadeh et al 2019 and standardization eq 2 mehdizadeh et al 2019 shows that although it is possible to normalize the newly generated time series this transformed time series does not fulfill the stationarity condition and also presents trend and jump terms moreover according to table 1 only the p value jb of 0 05 and p value in other tests are below the significant level 5 although the explanation provided suggests that under these conditions modeling is incorrect the indices of the models proposed by mehdizadeh et al 2019 for port elgin ought to be examined as well table 2 indicates that the values of the mentioned statistical indices are not correct in the testing phase furthermore it is very rare to find practical usages of ar n and ma n where n is larger than two nonetheless in table 5 of mehdizadeh et al 2019 ar 11 and ma 9 are recommended for modeling the monthly streamflow perhaps due to the strong seasonality appeared in the monthly streamflow time series a lag of eleven needed to be adopted to achieve a satisfying modeling performance however seasonal arma models do exist seasonal arma models should be taken into consideration before the applications of ar 11 and ma 9 3 nonlinear modeling a key question regarding nonlinear modeling that remains unanswered in the original article is whether the best input combination is selected for variable based nonlinear modeling with neural network methods the inputs and output s are clear and the models are applicable to the dataset time series modeling however offers numerous combinations of previous lags from which to select the most appropriate time series input combination therefore applying suitable preprocessing should lead to determining and selecting the most effective lag for modeling in monthly modeling of a hydrological variable the seasonal effect should be taken into account moeeni et al 2017b zeynoddin et al 2018 yaseen et al 2017 2018 2019 ebtehaj et al 2020 the periodic lag in monthly modeling is expected to be within 12 repetitions mehdizadeh et al 2019 mentioned that before implementing the models the data must be preprocessed however when using an artificial intelligence ai based technique to model hydrological phenomena it is not necessary to apply normality and stationarity transforms to raw data for port elgin station for example mars and gep were implemented in the current study using raw data with no preprocessing to check the necessity for stationarity or normality transforms before implementing the ai based approaches fig 1 illustrates the autocorrelation function acf of the raw data the existence of seasonal lags is clear in this figure therefore different lags are considered in predicting streamflow as eq 1 1 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 q t 12 q t 24 q t 36 q t 48 q t 60 scatter plots of the monthly streamflow at port elgin station obtained using gep and mars in the training and testing stages are provided in fig 2 the statistical indices in table 3 represent the superior performance of gep and mars in predicting monthly streamflow with no preprocessing moreover the results in fig 3 represent the relative error of mehdizadeh et al s 2019 models in comparison with the gep and mars models in this study it is clear that using seasonal parameters as inputs in the gep and mars models results in more accurate models than the preprocessed gep and mars the gep parameters indicated in table 2 of mehdizadeh et al s 2019 are the default values of gep parameters to determine the optimum model however it is necessary to find the optimum gep parameter values the optimum values obtained for the gep parameters are given in table 4 they were found through a trial and error process the relative root square error rrse is considered as fitness function in the current study it is obvious that all mentioned parameters for the optimum model except number of chromosomes are different from mehdizadeh et al s 2019 therefore the optimality of the models presented in this paper is questionable for further investigation the effect of each input seasonal and non seasonal on the gep results is examined using sensitivity analysis fig 4 indicates the changing effect of each input variable on the models indices i e r and rmse according to eq 1 nine different variables are employed for streamflow modeling by considering eight input variables constant one of those variable experiences an alteration ranges from 10 to 10 with a step of 1 20 points r and rmse of the model output are calculated as a result of the change in the desired input variables in the mentioned range finally the average of each index in the respective variation range is deemed the gep based model s sensitivity to each input variable the relative error in the fig 4 is calculated as follows 2 relative change 100 n i 1 n inde x i i n d e x r inde x r due to that alteration ranges are from 10 to 10 with a step of 1 n is equal to 20 indexi is the calculated index r or rmse for ith step and indexr is the reference index r or rmse for the reference value as illustrated in fig 4 in training q t 3 has the maximum relative error for each index compared to the observed values the gep based model s sensitivity to q t 36 is recognized as the most sensitive seasonal parameter in the testing phase the effect of the seasonal parameters is much greater whereby a change in q t 36 leads to the highest relative error for each index compared to the observed values accordingly the importance of seasonal parameters in streamflow prediction at port elgin is evident 4 comparison of the hybrid and individual models the hybrid models presented are ar arch and ma arch previous studies have shown that combining stochastic methods with gep can also yield good results table 5 mehdizadeh et al 2019 illustrates that the hybrid models are compared only with linear stochastic methods ar and ma and no results are given for arch according to a prior study zeynoddin et al 2018 lotfi et al 2019 nonlinear and hybrid model results could be similar to each other therefore using arch may provide results close to the hybrid models ar arch and ma arch in addition moeeni et al 2017a presented a hybrid of stochastic models ar and ma with gep and proved this combination performs well generally however no adequate comparisons of hybrid and individual models have been performed 5 external analysis is not a valid prediction strategy with strategy 2 external analysis q t of the adjacent station was selected as the model input table 3 mehdizadeh et al 2019 using this input is only appropriate when the purpose is to find missing data as such q t at station 2 cannot be used to predict q t at station 1 the reason is that when the aim is to predict q t time t has not yet arrived hence no value for q t at station 2 is recorded that can serve as a model input to predict q t at station 1 therefore since the title regards monthly streamflow estimation using local and external data analysis approaches the second strategy external analysis is useless 6 lack of use of aic to compare hybrid and individual models mehdizadeh et al 2019 stated that the best model was selected among ar and ma using aic but the results of this index are not presented to compare individual and hybrid models for example in table 5 mehdizadeh et al 2019 ar 1 is compared with ma 4 port elgin however since it is known that aic reflects model accuracy and complexity simultaneously it facilitates selecting the best model it is wrong to compare a model selected through aic with indicators that are purely accuracy based in addition the hybrid model results should also be compared with the single model results using this index to allow for taking into account the model s complexity and accuracy simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

5723,river floodplain connectivity is vital to hydrological and biogeochemical processes in river corridors over multiple spatiotemporal scales in the present study an approach of particle tracking in conjunction with two dimensional hydrodynamic modeling was developed to study the dynamics of river floodplain connectivity during flood periods and applied to the study of mccarran ranch in the lower truckee river nevada u s the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated for flood events of different magnitudes of peak flow discharge the outputs of the hydrodynamic model were further applied to determine the lateral transboundary flux during high flows lagrangian particle trajectories were then performed to quantify the flow path length and residence time on floodplains the exchange frequency between the river mainstem and the floodplain were also examined the results show that the hydrodynamic model reproduce hydrographs well the river floodplain exchange is sensitive to the magnitudes of the flood events larger floods cause shorter residence times and flow path lengths on the floodplains but lead to larger transboundary flux within the river reaches the particle analysis results also show that higher discharge introduces less frequent exchange between the river channel and floodplains furthermore comparison of the river floodplain exchange properties among river reaches with different levels of sinuosity show that meandering reaches can introduce considerably higher exchange flux than a straight reach leading to complex exchange behaviors within the river floodplain system keywords river floodplain connectivity hydrodynamic modeling particle tracking floods exchange flux 1 introduction the river floodplain exchange is a main type of hydrological exchange flows bolland et al 2012 gooseff et al 2017 phelps et al 2015 it brings relatively fast moving waters of the channel s thalweg onto floodplains that can later return to the main channel this exchange is used to characterize the connectivity between the river and floodplains generally the river and the floodplains connect via overbank flow during high flow periods which establishes a bidirectional pathway for the exchange of biota and material that affect in stream water chemistry and ecology harvey and gooseff 2015 the interaction between the main river channel and floodplains has been long recognized as a key process for maintaining fluvial ecosystem as it facilitates the exchange of substantial amounts of water sediment organic material and nutrients between rivers floodplains and riparian wetlands allen et al 2016 amoros and bornette 2002 gooseff et al 2017 heiler et al 1995 mouw et al 2009 opperman et al 2010 patra and kar 2000 phelps et al 2015 rajaratnam and ahmadi 1979 thoms 2003 tockner and stanford 2002 ward et al 1999 this effect has been documented as an important component within the concept of hydrologic connectivity which is broadly defined as the transport of matter organisms and energy between distinct landscape units gooseff et al 2017 heiler et al 1995 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 tockner et al 1999 quantification of the spatial and temporal dynamics of variable lateral hydrological connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and main river channels is critical for the interpretation of how hydrologic connectivity affects the water quality and ecological processes along river corridors a majority of prior studies have focused on the response of floodplains to the changes in the frequency magnitude and duration of flood regimes and the transfer of sediments and nutrients from the main channel to floodplains asselman and middelkoop 1995 edwards et al 2006 periáñez 2004 fewer studies have explored the bidirectional movement between river and floodplains byrne et al 2019 chen et al 2015b czuba et al 2019 richey et al 1989 wilson et al 2007 zurbrugg et al 2012 for instance richey et al 1989 used muskingum routing of main channel flow and simple floodplain representation to estimate the flow volume exchanges in river floodplain systems at itapeua of amazon river their results show that the ratio of exchanging flux was approximately 30 wilson et al 2007 updated this result based on 2 dimensional modeling and found the ratio to be at least 40 between itapeua and manaus on amazon river zurbrugg et al 2012 have estimated the river floodplain exchange in kafue flats through field measurements of discharge and tracers and found this exchange ratio to be as much as 80 during peak discharge further stone et al 2017 revealed the combined effects of streamflow modifications and channel incision on reducing river floodplain exchange in the gila and rio grande rivers in the southwestern united states this river floodplain exchange flow could have a strong impact on river quality and resulting in seasonally recurring sharp changes in dissolved oxygen levels or other quality objectives however the lateral exchange in river floodplain system has proven to be very complex and highly dependent on channel morphology with filling and draining of the floodplain taking place concurrently at different locations in the system to date this highly heterogeneous connectivity over flood event scales still has not been fully understood in a quantitative manner quantifying the river floodplain exchange is difficult owing to the challenges in field observation especially during high flows previous studies tended to use satellite observations for the evaluation of the floodplain inundation extent and water level overton 2005 townsend and walsh 1998 however such satellite information is usually made available using passive microwave instruments with limited spatial resolution or synthetic aperture radars with incongruous levels in spatial and temporal resolution frappart et al 2005 hamilton et al 2002 overton 2005 townsend and walsh 1998 this approach can provide intuitive pictures of flooding in different time and stages but the details of dynamic exchange behavior in the main channel floodplain system are difficult to be characterized in such a technical framework therefore these approaches currently do not provide a practical solution for quantifying the lateral exchanges along the river floodplain interface other studies quantify the main channel floodplain exchange through in situ observations for example zurbrugg et al 2012 estimated the magnitude of river floodplain exchange for a 6500 km2 floodplain in a larger tropical river system by combining discharge measurements and natural isotope tracers 18o analysis their water sampling was conducted along 410 km of the main stem with sampling intervals generally 20 km and approximately 6 km for a certain river reach with a length of 105 km although they provided a way for estimating the lateral exchange flux within the river floodplain system the low spatial resolution ranging from 6 km to 20 km of sampling spaces made it incapable to reveal details of the exchange dynamics understanding flow interactions between different water depth units on a complex river section has long been a research hot topic in open channel hydraulics keller and rodi 1988 knight 1983 patra and kar 2000 patra et al 2004 rajaratnam and ahmadi 1979 sellin 1964 tockner and stanford 2002 yang et al 2007 since the primary flow field can be considerably modified by the lateral and vertical momentum transfer between regions of different depths the majority of studies concentrated on determining the discharge characteristics the boundary shear stress and shear force distributions in compound river sections with ultimate objectives in developing ancillary equations to describe the lateral and vertical transfer of momentum one of the common approaches is to resort to laboratory flume experiments with well controlled flow depths and regular geometric channel cross sections i e a compound channel that generally with a rectangular channel cross section that flanked symmetrically asymmetrically by a horizontal floodplain keller and rodi 1988 sellin 1964 with detailed measurement to different portions of flow field these flume studies provide fundamental understandings to the characteristics of momentum transfer between different water bodies in the channel mechanistic studies on river floodplain interaction in real rivers are still rare due to the difficulties in observing detailed flow features and in quantifying the features of the connectivity thus numerical models are broadly used as a means to resolve flow dynamics over reach scales or large basin scales aureli et al 2008 gong et al 2009 neal et al 2012 yamazaki et al 2011 the shallow water model can provide detailed hydrodynamics on reach scale without prohibitively large computational costs and memory footprints aureli et al 2008 bates et al 2010 chen et al 2015b de almeida et al 2012 mignot et al 2006 although the shallow water model cannot straightforwardly provide the flow exchange information between the main channel and the floodplain the detailed outputs in terms of water level and velocity information it provides could be further explored through other technical means e g the particle tracking method particle tracking simulations have been shown to be efficient in delineating flow fields and determining flow paths and travel times it has been used to solve various types of problems such as pollutant dispersion periáñez 2004 oil spills wang et al 2010 larval dispersion edwards et al 2006 and connectivity pattern of bay areas marinone 2006 marinone et al 2008 however this technique has rarely been used in quantifying the flow dynamics in river floodplain interactions a pioneering application of particle tracking method to explore this problem dates back to 1960 s in which sellin 1964 spread aluminum powder on the water surface in a flume to visualize the vortex structures in the region of contact between the floodplain flow and that in the channel section the momentum transfer mechanism governing the exchanging flow between the channel section and that over the floodplain was qualitatively revealed but the travel lengths and travel times of flow parcels on the floodplain could not be resolved at that time in view of the importance of the issue and the identified knowledge gaps the present study aims at quantitatively understanding the linkage between the main river channel and the floodplains within a natural river stretch of complex morphology under different magnitudes of flood events specifically the objectives of this study are to 1 provide a set of quantitative means to analyze river floodplain interaction characteristics and 2 evaluate river floodplain connectivity from the lagrangian perspective 2 methodology 2 1 study site the lower truckee river and the mccarran ranch the study was conducted at mccarran ranch on the lower truckee river nevada the truckee river starts at lake tahoe and passes through an urbanized area including the cities of reno and sparks and eventually terminated at pyramid lake fig 1 this highly regulated river is a vital resource that provides public water supplies to the cities of reno and sparks acting as a nutrient corridor for threatened aquatic and terrestrial species knust and warwick 2009 saito et al 2007 saito et al 2008 uehlinger and brock 2005 saito et al 2008 several sections of the river s channel were straightened for the sake of flood reduction in the 1960 s many of the wetlands formerly located within the floodplain of the truckee river have been lost due to flood control activities and development within the floodplain to prevent further deterioration of ecological conditions river restoration projects have been implemented including lowering of floodplain surfaces or slightly raising the river s bottom all in an effort to reconnect the river to its floodplains this river reach known as the mccarran ranch is located on the lower truckee river approximately 24 to 32 km downstream from the city of reno fig 1 mean discharge of lower truckee river within the mccarran ranch usgs gauge 10350340 is 23 m3 s the averaged width of the main channel is about 52 m and the floodplain of the study stretch is 80 to 350 m wide in most years peaks of river stage occur in april to early july and low stage starts from november chen et al 2015b 2 2 governing equations for fluid flow and particle transport the two dimensional 2 d shallow water equations swes were implemented for flood dynamics modeling because they have proven successful in describing water surface and velocity fields and have been widely accepted for studying hydrodynamics in shallow broad rivers or estuarine basins aureli et al 2008 bates et al 2010 berger and stockstill 1995 canestrelli et al 2010 chen et al 2015b de almeida et al 2012 el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 heniche et al 2000 liang and marche 2009 mignot et al 2006 song et al 2011 under the assumption that the vertical velocity component is negligible the 2 d shallow water equations read as 1 q t f x x f y y h 0 where 2 q h u h υ h 3 f x

c d h u where k is a scaling coefficient default 0 5 c d is the drag coefficient as determined by the bed friction and u is the depth averaged velocity 2 3 particle tracking model to better understand details of flow dynamics and exchange of floodplain water and stream flow we conducted a lagrangian particle tracking study to examine how flow parcels move through the study reach and how particles penetrate the river floodplain interface rfi here we consider observations of passive particles transported by the river flow the state of the flow is described in eulerian coordinates by the shallow water model the link between the lagrangian data and the classical eulerian variables of the shallow water model is made by the following transport model 10 d x dt u x t t where x is the coordinate vector of a particle as a function of time u is the velocity vector at time t integrating 10 yields 11 x t δ t x t t t δ t u x t t d t the numerical integration of 11 was performed with a fourth order runge kutta algorithm 12 a u x k t δ t 13 b u x k a 2 δ t 14 c u x k b 2 δ t 15 d u x k c δ t 16 x t δ t x t a 2 b 2 c d 6 a fortran code applying the runge kutta fourth order approach to unstructured grid for particle tracking was developed for this study which can directly work with the results of the hydrodynamic model applied in this study in a depth averaged flow field each 2 d particle released at a given location in the horizontal plane is associated with the scalar property flow depth of the location similar to other scalar properties such as solute concentration or temperature that can also be carried by the particles in other words each particle in the 2 d plane represents a vertical line or water column in the actual flow domain the aggregation of kinematics of a large number of 2 d particles weighted by their flow depths will thus be able to represent the actual dynamics of the water body in the 2 d plane therefore the analysis of scalar transport through 2 d particle trajectory and particle statistics should be corrected by the flow depth associated with these particles we can also address this issue in a different way the depth averaged 2 d flow is a reduced representation of the actual 3 d flow field which is equal to a 3 d flow field with a uniform velocity profile along each vertical line to conduct a particle tracking study we can place massless and sizeless point particles uniformly distributed within the given 3 d domain so that every particle in the 3 d domain represents the same unit volume of water therefore a 2 d particle pi released at a given location xi yi in the 2 d domain actually represents a number of particles pi j j 1 ni in the vertical water column at this location the particle number ni is proportional to the flow depth considering property f e g the mass flux for a water column that can be calculated by integrating f e g velocity along the depth of the column at location xi yi we have 17 f i 0 h f i d z using the particle method it can be expressed by 18 f i k 1 n i f i j δ h c h i f i where fi j is the property f of the jth unit volume in the profile f i is the average property f for the water column this means that an attribute of a 2 d particle can be corrected with the local depth to represent the depth integrated property it also applies to statistics of attributes of large number of 2 d particle 2 4 boundary settings and equations solving the boundary conditions for the swes domain are presented in fig 2 specified discharge times series is prescribed on the upstream while corresponding water level is assigned on the downstream boundary the right and left boundaries relative to the flow direction are considered no flow conditions the system of partial differential equations represented in eq 1 8 was solved with a finite element model fem adh adaptive hydraulics which is developed at the coastal and hydraulics laboratory chl of u s army corps of engineers it uses the approach of petrov galerkin that incorporates a combination of a galerkin test function and a non galerkin component to control numerical oscillations due to convection the surface water modeling system sms was used for linear triangle mesh generation adh uses the mesh files generated with sms directly without any modifications a higher density of elements was constructed in the vicinity of main channel to obtain a more accurate solution fig 2 a grid refinement was conducted first to ensure mesh independence of the results three meshes with element nodes of 4931 6301 and 10 306 were generated respectively each mesh was used to run the adh model with boundary inputs from the 50 year flood event water level and velocity distributions at the location of usgs gauging station 10 350 340 were extracted for comparisons results show that mesh element nodes of 6000 and above were mesh independent based on the above mesh independence analysis the final mesh generated for adh running in the present study consists of 11 793 elements and 6064 nodes which covers an area of approximately 6 8 km2 the minimum element size in the channel was 2 m and this length increased gradually from channel to floodplains up to a maximum size of 87 m the mesh has been carefully checked to maintain mesh quality and adjusted to minimize the element number while preserve the resolution adequate for resolving the main channel we carried out flood simulation work in this river stretch and the upper part of the study domain was included to minimize the potential impact introduced from the upstream boundary as shown in fig 1b compared to river segment i and iii the middle segment ii is a relatively low lying area with vast tracts of floodplains and therefore we conducted the particle tracking analysis in this middle segment ii 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation four flood events with different recurrence intervals were used for model calibration and validation fig 3 the model has been calibrated by changing bed roughness coefficients manually estimated from bed configuration and land use information with references to the tabular values in chow 1959 the 50 yr flood event happened in early 1997 was chosen for sensitivity analysis because it caused a large flood inundation area and it is more conducive to reflecting the impacts of floodplain roughness on the hydrograph the roughness coefficients of main channel and floodplains were gradually adjusted for computational runs until computed and observed discharge usgs gauging station 10350340 matched fig 4 a shows the sensitivity analysis results the discrepancies both in phase and amplitude are acceptable for flood simulation using medium roughness coefficients main channel n 0 039 floodplain n 0 048 therefore this set of roughness coefficients was used in all subsequent simulations the results also indicate that nearly two hours are required for the model to reach dynamic equilibrium from a cold start fig 4a several model runs were conducted to test the model efficiency in reproducing floods with different flood frequencies for validation the model has been applied to 10 yr 5 yr and 2 yr flood events the simulated discharges have been validated with those measurements at the usgs gauging station fig 1b fig 4b presents the validation results the results show a satisfactory agreement between the computed and observed hydrographs of discharge the root mean square error rmse of the 10 yr 5 yr and 2 yr flood events are 3 13 m3 s 1 91 m3 s and 1 77 m3 s respectively the results show reasonable agreement between the model predictions and measured data 3 2 effect of river planform morphology on lateral flow exchange the transboundary flux is calculated by integrating unit discharge uh along river bank lines 19 q int u h n d l where u is the velocity vector h is the water depth and n is the normal vector of bank line l pointing to the floodplain side the middle reach region ii was divided into three segments according to the meandering features shown in fig 1b compared to the sinuosity of segment ii 1 1 01 segment ii 2 and ii 3 have higher sinuosity values 1 26 and 1 54 respectively the transboundary flux was calculated for the 50 year flood event the normalized transboundary flux for the 50 year flood event is depicted in fig 5 the normalized flux represents the unit discharge across the boundaries thus it is more appropriate for an inter reach comparison in the three sub regions in region ii both positive flux and negative flux exist positive values represent flux toward floodplains while negative values represent flux towards the main stream positive and negative fluxes at the left and right channel boundaries are not always on the same order of magnitude indicating the asymmetry of flow feature at the two sides of the stream it is worth noting that the fluxes in segment ii 3 are both negative in the left and right channel boundaries indicating flow converging to the stream in this reach it was found that the transboundary flux was larger in the more meandering reaches and smaller in the relatively straight reaches in the three segments of region ii segment ii 2 presents the largest flux and segment ii 1 presents the smallest value consistent with their meandering properties in addition the transboundary flux followed the trend of the flow rate and the magnitude of the total transboundary flux the total discharge flowing into or out of the reach from stream floodplain boundaries was comparable to the longitudinal flow discharge the peak value of total flux at ii 2 section was about 400 m3 s while the peak longitudinal flow rate was about 525 m3 s with a ratio 400 525 of about 75 this indicates that most of overall river discharge participated in the river floodplain exchange within this reach it is important to note that this ratio is dependent of the length and the planform of the reach in question the ratio will generally increase with the length and the sinuosity of the reach however at a given river reach this ratio can be used to quantify the extent of river floodplain exchange in addition this ratio could vary over time and be used to assess the temporal variation of the exchange as can be found in fig 5 at the beginning and ending parts of the flood hydrograph the ratio was about 40 0 16 0 4 at ii 2 and even lower in the other sections this suggests that the interaction is stronger during the high flow period the convective transport of primary flow momentum by the transverse flow is an important cause of the redistribution of the primary flow velocity the velocity field at segment ii 2 and segment ii 3 are displayed in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively overall the main channel carried the primary discharge and the side floodplains always carried a low partition of the flow at lower flow stage once a river bank was overtopped the direction of velocity vector was gradually shifted from along the mainstem to pointing towards the river bank lines local circulation and flow separation occurred at certain zones due to the large shear generated by velocity gradients between the main channel and the floodplain flow in the high flow stage there was a wide variation in the distribution of longitudinal velocity from the inner to the outer bank of the meandering compound channel sections this indicates that river meanders can enhance the stream floodplain interaction 3 3 temporal and spatial characteristics of particle motions the behavior of the deterministic particles is associated with the flood stages fig 8 represents the particle movement and the inundation during the 50 year flood event at lower river stage the particles mainly remained in the main channel and they split at the upstream of the in stream bar and reconsolidated at the downstream fig 8a with an increase in discharge particles started to penetrate the river floodplain interface at meanders and the in steam bar the result shows that majority of the particles crossed the river floodplain interface at some points some of the particles moved onto the floodplain and remained there while some particles crossed the boundaries multiple times a few particles stayed in the main stream during the entire life span of the particles in the study reach these particles spent a relatively short time period traveling through the entire reach while particles moving through floodplains required a longer duration to move through the reach this result indicates that most part of the flow participate in the stream floodplain interaction and the interaction increased the travel time of the particles passing through this reach the particles lateral expansion behaviors also indirectly reflected the inundation process and hydrological connectivity between the channel and the low lying zones on floodplains at lower discharge stage there were isolated patches or patches connected to the mainstem these small wetlands could play important roles in maintaining the habitats of riverine vegetation and other biological processes allen et al 2016 amoros and bornette 2002 bates et al 2010 bolland et al 2012 heiler et al 1995 phelps et al 2015 thomaz et al 2007 thoms 2003 ward et al 1999 when the water level exceeded the bank during the rising limb of the hydrograph water left the river channel and spilled onto the floodplains by overbank flow the wetlands on floodplains were then reconnected to the mainstem river channel this process not only increased the water contained by the wetlands but also further displaced the wet dry boundary on both sides of the river rendering larger inundation areas on the floodplains during the receding stage the low lying wetlands on the floodplains gradually separated from the main channel showing an opposite process to the rising limb period the result of particle trajectory also discloses some important aspect of the floodplain stream flow exchange dynamics particle path lines fig 8 collectively with the flow field fig 6 show that most particles cross the floodplain stream boundary at a relatively small angle this indicates that the flow is dominated by longitudinal velocity component whereas the lateral component that causing the exchange is often secondary the result suggests that the longitudinal flow connectivity dictates the floodplain stream exchange and a floodplain generally does not intensely exchange with its immediate neighboring stream reach but reaches upstream and downstream the trajectory of a particle depends not only on its initial release time but also on its release location in space fig 9 shows the motion of particles with different initial positions under 50 year and 5 year flood events particles were released during the rising and falling limbs of the flood hydrographs as well as on the peak flow stages the majority of particles released on the floodplains traveled to the downstream along the outer boundary of the inundated area and then gradually moved back to the mainstem near the in stream bar constrained by the stream geomorphology particles released on the main channel revealed different behaviors along their pathways particle clouds stretched and expanded in extent and most particles escaped from the main channel and penetrated the meandering stream boundaries multiple times these particle behaviors suggest that there are chances for sediment seeds or solutes carried by the flood water to be intercepted and retained on the floodplains and not returning to the main channel if using a sink source concept to depict the particles behaviors the river channel acts as a source from the view of the particles motion whereas the floodplain often plays a role of sink similar findings have been reported by tockner et al 1999 in a study on the danube river in austria in which they showed that the floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments particulate organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen particle motions in the 5 year flood case were different from those observed under the 50 year flood condition a majority of particles released on the floodplain did not start traveling and only a few particles moved to the downstream due to the flood entrainment and then swiftly swarmed into the main channel due to less inundation area the exchanging zone mainly occurs along the river bank line with a limited belt width of about 3 m fig 9e h 3 4 particles travel statistics in the river floodplain system a statistical description of particle travel features in the river floodplain system can provide a quantitative assessment of the exchange between the river channel and floodplain within a given river reach we use three quantities to generate the particle travel statistics the particle travel distance ptd is the total distance on the floodplains that a particle traveled within the river reach in question the particle penetration number ppn here refers to the number of times that a particle penetrates the river floodplain interface to move from the main channel to the floodplains or the opposite during its travel within the concerned river reach the residence time rt is the total time a particle spent over the floodplain these indicators show different aspects of particle trajectories and are helpful to understand the river floodplain connectivity from the lagrangian standpoint to test the particle exchange frequency between the main channel and floodplains the distribution of particle travelling distance ptd particle penetration number ppn and particle residence time rt on floodplain were calculated it was conducted for the 50 year and 5 year flood events at the river segment ii fig 1 for each flood event we released a total of 3 000 particles from upstream section of region ii fig 1 in the subsequent statistical analysis only the particles that first entered and then again exited the concerned domain were considered this means that particles that moved to the upstream of released profile due to backwater or those finally stuck in the dry floodplains are excluded each particle counted in the following analysis is weighted by the initial water depth at the locations where the particles are released to represent properties of the entire water column the distributions of ptd for 5 year and 50 year flood events are presented in fig 10 a d m p with typical flooding stages respectively both the ptds of two flood events show approximately normal distributions the particles stay a longer distance on the floodplains under a smaller flood condition for instance at peak flow stage the mean value of 5 year flood ptd 1826 m was slightly larger than that of the 50 year flood event 1748 m with a difference about 1 5 times the river averaged width also particles penetrate the river floodplain boundary more frequently under smaller floods and the average ppn for 50 year and 5 year floods are 5 2 and 7 5 respectively however it is worth noting that for the 5 year flood case up to approximately 60 of the particles were rarely involved in the channel floodplain interactions and this ratio reduces to less than 20 under 50 year flood since the 5 year flood event has lower velocity the residence times were expected to be longer than that under the 50 year flood event as shown in fig 10 the mean residence time of particles of the 5 year flood case is about 1 5 times of that of the 50 year flood case which is attributed to the lower velocity and higher exchange frequency under smaller flood magnitude particle exchange frequency seems insensitive to the flood stages within each flood event to be more specific the mean ptd ppn and rt values are very close under the rising peak flow and receding stages 4 discussions there are many hydraulic and ecological implications of the results found in this study flood pulses are a main driving force for improving habitat heterogeneity and the diversity of floodplain hydrological connectivity junk et al 1989 understanding the variable lateral connectivity in river floodplain systems under high flows is propitious to interpret the biological diversity of aquatic organisms in the present study we found that larger floods introduce much higher discharges onto the floodplains and particles may travel into the floodplains farther from the channel this is expected to enhance the heterogeneity in the floodplain previous studies indicated that periodic flood events could effectively strengthen the intensity of nutrient and organic matter exchanges between the main channel and riparian floodplains and the low lying waterbody connectivity to the main stem was found positively correlated with the number of species e g the young of the year fish communities in poorly connected water bodies were reported to have less species richness bolland et al 2012 tockner et al 1999 tockner and stanford 2002 and alpha diversity ward et al 1999 we examined the impacts of the channel meandering property on the flow interactions between channel and floodplains compared to straight river reaches meandering reaches provide more variable transboundary flux and complicated velocity field during flood events this means that the lateral exchanges between the main channel and floodplains in meandering reaches are much more intense and complex this type of river morphology is likely holding many functions such as biogeochemical filters and creating favorable conditions for biodiversity glińska lewczuk and burandt 2011 however river managements such as river straightening and channelization often attenuate the intensity of the flow exchange dynamics and the lateral connectivity leading to a lower level of biological diversity and a decreased habitat heterogeneity although efforts have been done to improve the ecological status of rivers bolland et al 2012 grift et al 2001 the river rehabilitation activities mainly focus on increasing individual floodplain waterbody connectivity but rarely consider the significance of variable lateral exchanges between the main channel and floodplain bolland et al 2012 our work provides a quantitative view on how meandering reach could enhance the flow exchange in a channel floodplain system the approach presented in this study provides a means to understand and quantify the floodplain stream connectivity the flow flux across the boundary is closely linked to spatial distribution of mass and energy exchanges between floodplain and stream and habitat sustainability on floodplains the particle trajectory has implications to many aspects of the ecological geomorphological and nutrient contaminant transport processes occurring in the floodplain stream system the attributes of particle movement may inspire the development of better tools and metric for aquatic ecology studies that can enhance qualitative and or quantitative understanding of the associated processes the particle pathways are closely related to the transport and distribution of sediment and nutrient on the floodplain and their impact on aquatic habitats combined with other hydraulic and geomorphologic indicators such as flow depth microtopography and vegetation distribution the particles may be used as surrogates for many organisms and substances and their dynamic and statistic attributes may help investigate ecological issues such as fish mobility and stranding possibility zooplankton and phytoplankton migration and distribution seeds dispersal and riparian vegetation establishment on floodplains the actual application will vary depending on the nature of the concerned problem overall the mixed eularian and lagrangian analysis of the hydrodynamics in the floodplain stream system is expected to assist in ecological health assessment and prediction for stream corridors the river floodplain connectivity is often classified into different degrees based on the water levels for example when the river water level is lower than that on floodplains the degree of the connectivity may be categorized as disconnection tockner et al 1999 from the perspective of the surface water this is intuitive and apparent however the floodplain and main channel could still maintain the connection through groundwater flow flood induced water level fluctuations in the river corridors have proven to be a main driving force to enhance groundwater surface water interactions in some circumstances stream water can enter the river bank storage zone with distances from tens to hundreds of meters such processes carry dissolved oxygen and organic carbon into the storage zone that may form high potentials in many biochemical processes e g the denitrification in addition the increasing flow discharge can alter the head gradient over the stream bed resulting a dramatic change in the hyporheic flux and the volume size of hyporheic zone chen et al 2015a chen et al 2018 gooseff et al 2017 merill and tonjes 2014 mouw et al 2009 the surface subsurface connectivity manner was out of the scope of the present study however one can still expect that flood water can moderate the local groundwater hydraulic gradient through overland flow infiltration this could result in a lower groundwater hydraulic gradient and reduce the lateral hyporheic flow and the size of hyporheic zone for example using a 2 d model wroblicky et al 1998 found that the sizes of lateral hyporheic exchange zones of two first order streams were decreased by approximately 50 during high flow studies have showed that water in the floodplain and active channel interacted frequently and together served as a subsurface corridor for livings of many invertebrates mouw et al 2009 the 2 d hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking approach applied in this study may be less detailed than a 3 d hydrodynamic model and 3 d particle tracking in depicting vertical variations of the flow field for the river floodplain system especially in zones of large bed elevation changes marinone 2006 however the 3 d approaches are computationally demanding and highly time consuming which makes them less practical in large scale investigations the 2 d hydrodynamic model can provide a feasible and reliable way to generate the time varying depth averaged flow field for the system the 2 d particle tracking therefore represents the depth averaged features of particle movement and can still provide plausible lagrangian results of the flow field 5 summary and conclusions in the present study a particle tracking program was used conjunctively with a hydrodynamic model to determine the lateral flow exchanges within a river stretch with pronounced river floodplains flow paths and travel times were calculated through a velocity field that resolved from individual grid cells in a two dimensional numerical flow model we first calibrated the model with a 50 year flood event to determine the potential roughness coefficients and then validated the model with other three flood events floods with returning intervals of 2 year 5 year and 10 year our results showed that the performance of the 2 d numerical model is reasonably well for describing the floodwater dynamics within the river floodplain system we then released particles from the upstream boundary of the studied stretch to track the flow path and lateral exchange processes the particle tracing technique found to be an efficient tool to describe the hydrodynamic interaction of the main channel and floodplain it can quantitatively reveal the characteristics of the floodplain residence time and mechanical as well as statistical properties of the exchange our results suggest that larger floods introduce less cross boundary connectivity between the stream and the floodplain and shorter residence time and flow path length but a larger proportion of the discharge participating the interaction we also examined the effects of river planform curvature on the lateral exchange property and results showed that meanders can enhance the river floodplain interaction our work provides a quantitative way for understanding the lateral water exchanging behaviors within the river floodplain system during high flows which can inform process based assessment of the geomorphological and ecological evolutions in the system controlled by this exchange future studies can further explore the effects of 3 d turbulence on river floodplain exchange in

5723,river floodplain connectivity is vital to hydrological and biogeochemical processes in river corridors over multiple spatiotemporal scales in the present study an approach of particle tracking in conjunction with two dimensional hydrodynamic modeling was developed to study the dynamics of river floodplain connectivity during flood periods and applied to the study of mccarran ranch in the lower truckee river nevada u s the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated for flood events of different magnitudes of peak flow discharge the outputs of the hydrodynamic model were further applied to determine the lateral transboundary flux during high flows lagrangian particle trajectories were then performed to quantify the flow path length and residence time on floodplains the exchange frequency between the river mainstem and the floodplain were also examined the results show that the hydrodynamic model reproduce hydrographs well the river floodplain exchange is sensitive to the magnitudes of the flood events larger floods cause shorter residence times and flow path lengths on the floodplains but lead to larger transboundary flux within the river reaches the particle analysis results also show that higher discharge introduces less frequent exchange between the river channel and floodplains furthermore comparison of the river floodplain exchange properties among river reaches with different levels of sinuosity show that meandering reaches can introduce considerably higher exchange flux than a straight reach leading to complex exchange behaviors within the river floodplain system keywords river floodplain connectivity hydrodynamic modeling particle tracking floods exchange flux 1 introduction the river floodplain exchange is a main type of hydrological exchange flows bolland et al 2012 gooseff et al 2017 phelps et al 2015 it brings relatively fast moving waters of the channel s thalweg onto floodplains that can later return to the main channel this exchange is used to characterize the connectivity between the river and floodplains generally the river and the floodplains connect via overbank flow during high flow periods which establishes a bidirectional pathway for the exchange of biota and material that affect in stream water chemistry and ecology harvey and gooseff 2015 the interaction between the main river channel and floodplains has been long recognized as a key process for maintaining fluvial ecosystem as it facilitates the exchange of substantial amounts of water sediment organic material and nutrients between rivers floodplains and riparian wetlands allen et al 2016 amoros and bornette 2002 gooseff et al 2017 heiler et al 1995 mouw et al 2009 opperman et al 2010 patra and kar 2000 phelps et al 2015 rajaratnam and ahmadi 1979 thoms 2003 tockner and stanford 2002 ward et al 1999 this effect has been documented as an important component within the concept of hydrologic connectivity which is broadly defined as the transport of matter organisms and energy between distinct landscape units gooseff et al 2017 heiler et al 1995 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 tockner et al 1999 quantification of the spatial and temporal dynamics of variable lateral hydrological connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and main river channels is critical for the interpretation of how hydrologic connectivity affects the water quality and ecological processes along river corridors a majority of prior studies have focused on the response of floodplains to the changes in the frequency magnitude and duration of flood regimes and the transfer of sediments and nutrients from the main channel to floodplains asselman and middelkoop 1995 edwards et al 2006 periáñez 2004 fewer studies have explored the bidirectional movement between river and floodplains byrne et al 2019 chen et al 2015b czuba et al 2019 richey et al 1989 wilson et al 2007 zurbrugg et al 2012 for instance richey et al 1989 used muskingum routing of main channel flow and simple floodplain representation to estimate the flow volume exchanges in river floodplain systems at itapeua of amazon river their results show that the ratio of exchanging flux was approximately 30 wilson et al 2007 updated this result based on 2 dimensional modeling and found the ratio to be at least 40 between itapeua and manaus on amazon river zurbrugg et al 2012 have estimated the river floodplain exchange in kafue flats through field measurements of discharge and tracers and found this exchange ratio to be as much as 80 during peak discharge further stone et al 2017 revealed the combined effects of streamflow modifications and channel incision on reducing river floodplain exchange in the gila and rio grande rivers in the southwestern united states this river floodplain exchange flow could have a strong impact on river quality and resulting in seasonally recurring sharp changes in dissolved oxygen levels or other quality objectives however the lateral exchange in river floodplain system has proven to be very complex and highly dependent on channel morphology with filling and draining of the floodplain taking place concurrently at different locations in the system to date this highly heterogeneous connectivity over flood event scales still has not been fully understood in a quantitative manner quantifying the river floodplain exchange is difficult owing to the challenges in field observation especially during high flows previous studies tended to use satellite observations for the evaluation of the floodplain inundation extent and water level overton 2005 townsend and walsh 1998 however such satellite information is usually made available using passive microwave instruments with limited spatial resolution or synthetic aperture radars with incongruous levels in spatial and temporal resolution frappart et al 2005 hamilton et al 2002 overton 2005 townsend and walsh 1998 this approach can provide intuitive pictures of flooding in different time and stages but the details of dynamic exchange behavior in the main channel floodplain system are difficult to be characterized in such a technical framework therefore these approaches currently do not provide a practical solution for quantifying the lateral exchanges along the river floodplain interface other studies quantify the main channel floodplain exchange through in situ observations for example zurbrugg et al 2012 estimated the magnitude of river floodplain exchange for a 6500 km2 floodplain in a larger tropical river system by combining discharge measurements and natural isotope tracers 18o analysis their water sampling was conducted along 410 km of the main stem with sampling intervals generally 20 km and approximately 6 km for a certain river reach with a length of 105 km although they provided a way for estimating the lateral exchange flux within the river floodplain system the low spatial resolution ranging from 6 km to 20 km of sampling spaces made it incapable to reveal details of the exchange dynamics understanding flow interactions between different water depth units on a complex river section has long been a research hot topic in open channel hydraulics keller and rodi 1988 knight 1983 patra and kar 2000 patra et al 2004 rajaratnam and ahmadi 1979 sellin 1964 tockner and stanford 2002 yang et al 2007 since the primary flow field can be considerably modified by the lateral and vertical momentum transfer between regions of different depths the majority of studies concentrated on determining the discharge characteristics the boundary shear stress and shear force distributions in compound river sections with ultimate objectives in developing ancillary equations to describe the lateral and vertical transfer of momentum one of the common approaches is to resort to laboratory flume experiments with well controlled flow depths and regular geometric channel cross sections i e a compound channel that generally with a rectangular channel cross section that flanked symmetrically asymmetrically by a horizontal floodplain keller and rodi 1988 sellin 1964 with detailed measurement to different portions of flow field these flume studies provide fundamental understandings to the characteristics of momentum transfer between different water bodies in the channel mechanistic studies on river floodplain interaction in real rivers are still rare due to the difficulties in observing detailed flow features and in quantifying the features of the connectivity thus numerical models are broadly used as a means to resolve flow dynamics over reach scales or large basin scales aureli et al 2008 gong et al 2009 neal et al 2012 yamazaki et al 2011 the shallow water model can provide detailed hydrodynamics on reach scale without prohibitively large computational costs and memory footprints aureli et al 2008 bates et al 2010 chen et al 2015b de almeida et al 2012 mignot et al 2006 although the shallow water model cannot straightforwardly provide the flow exchange information between the main channel and the floodplain the detailed outputs in terms of water level and velocity information it provides could be further explored through other technical means e g the particle tracking method particle tracking simulations have been shown to be efficient in delineating flow fields and determining flow paths and travel times it has been used to solve various types of problems such as pollutant dispersion periáñez 2004 oil spills wang et al 2010 larval dispersion edwards et al 2006 and connectivity pattern of bay areas marinone 2006 marinone et al 2008 however this technique has rarely been used in quantifying the flow dynamics in river floodplain interactions a pioneering application of particle tracking method to explore this problem dates back to 1960 s in which sellin 1964 spread aluminum powder on the water surface in a flume to visualize the vortex structures in the region of contact between the floodplain flow and that in the channel section the momentum transfer mechanism governing the exchanging flow between the channel section and that over the floodplain was qualitatively revealed but the travel lengths and travel times of flow parcels on the floodplain could not be resolved at that time in view of the importance of the issue and the identified knowledge gaps the present study aims at quantitatively understanding the linkage between the main river channel and the floodplains within a natural river stretch of complex morphology under different magnitudes of flood events specifically the objectives of this study are to 1 provide a set of quantitative means to analyze river floodplain interaction characteristics and 2 evaluate river floodplain connectivity from the lagrangian perspective 2 methodology 2 1 study site the lower truckee river and the mccarran ranch the study was conducted at mccarran ranch on the lower truckee river nevada the truckee river starts at lake tahoe and passes through an urbanized area including the cities of reno and sparks and eventually terminated at pyramid lake fig 1 this highly regulated river is a vital resource that provides public water supplies to the cities of reno and sparks acting as a nutrient corridor for threatened aquatic and terrestrial species knust and warwick 2009 saito et al 2007 saito et al 2008 uehlinger and brock 2005 saito et al 2008 several sections of the river s channel were straightened for the sake of flood reduction in the 1960 s many of the wetlands formerly located within the floodplain of the truckee river have been lost due to flood control activities and development within the floodplain to prevent further deterioration of ecological conditions river restoration projects have been implemented including lowering of floodplain surfaces or slightly raising the river s bottom all in an effort to reconnect the river to its floodplains this river reach known as the mccarran ranch is located on the lower truckee river approximately 24 to 32 km downstream from the city of reno fig 1 mean discharge of lower truckee river within the mccarran ranch usgs gauge 10350340 is 23 m3 s the averaged width of the main channel is about 52 m and the floodplain of the study stretch is 80 to 350 m wide in most years peaks of river stage occur in april to early july and low stage starts from november chen et al 2015b 2 2 governing equations for fluid flow and particle transport the two dimensional 2 d shallow water equations swes were implemented for flood dynamics modeling because they have proven successful in describing water surface and velocity fields and have been widely accepted for studying hydrodynamics in shallow broad rivers or estuarine basins aureli et al 2008 bates et al 2010 berger and stockstill 1995 canestrelli et al 2010 chen et al 2015b de almeida et al 2012 el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 heniche et al 2000 liang and marche 2009 mignot et al 2006 song et al 2011 under the assumption that the vertical velocity component is negligible the 2 d shallow water equations read as 1 q t f x x f y y h 0 where 2 q h u h υ h 3 f x

details of flow dynamics and exchange of floodplain water and stream flow we conducted a lagrangian particle tracking study to examine how flow parcels move through the study reach and how particles penetrate the river floodplain interface rfi here we consider observations of passive particles transported by the river flow the state of the flow is described in eulerian coordinates by the shallow water model the link between the lagrangian data and the classical eulerian variables of the shallow water model is made by the following transport model 10 d x dt u x t t where x is the coordinate vector of a particle as a function of time u is the velocity vector at time t integrating 10 yields 11 x t δ t x t t t δ t u x t t d t the numerical integration of 11 was performed with a fourth order runge kutta algorithm 12 a u x k t δ t 13 b u x k a 2 δ t 14 c u x k b 2 δ t 15 d u x k c δ t 16 x t δ t x t a 2 b 2 c d 6 a fortran code applying the runge kutta fourth order approach to unstructured grid for particle tracking was developed for this study which can directly work with the results of the hydrodynamic model applied in this study in a depth averaged flow field each 2 d particle released at a given location in the horizontal plane is associated with the scalar property flow depth of the location similar to other scalar properties such as solute concentration or temperature that can also be carried by the particles in other words each particle in the 2 d plane represents a vertical line or water column in the actual flow domain the aggregation of kinematics of a large number of 2 d particles weighted by their flow depths will thus be able to represent the actual dynamics of the water body in the 2 d plane therefore the analysis of scalar transport through 2 d particle trajectory and particle statistics should be corrected by the flow depth associated with these particles we can also address this issue in a different way the depth averaged 2 d flow is a reduced representation of the actual 3 d flow field which is equal to a 3 d flow field with a uniform velocity profile along each vertical line to conduct a particle tracking study we can place massless and sizeless point particles uniformly distributed within the given 3 d domain so that every particle in the 3 d domain represents the same unit volume of water therefore a 2 d particle pi released at a given location xi yi in the 2 d domain actually represents a number of particles pi j j 1 ni in the vertical water column at this location the particle number ni is proportional to the flow depth considering property f e g the mass flux for a water column that can be calculated by integrating f e g velocity along the depth of the column at location xi yi we have 17 f i 0 h f i d z using the particle method it can be expressed by 18 f i k 1 n i f i j δ h c h i f i where fi j is the property f of the jth unit volume in the profile f i is the average property f for the water column this means that an attribute of a 2 d particle can be corrected with the local depth to represent the depth integrated property it also applies to statistics of attributes of large number of 2 d particle 2 4 boundary settings and equations solving the boundary conditions for the swes domain are presented in fig 2 specified discharge times series is prescribed on the upstream while corresponding water level is assigned on the downstream boundary the right and left boundaries relative to the flow direction are considered no flow conditions the system of partial differential equations represented in eq 1 8 was solved with a finite element model fem adh adaptive hydraulics which is developed at the coastal and hydraulics laboratory chl of u s army corps of engineers it uses the approach of petrov galerkin that incorporates a combination of a galerkin test function and a non galerkin component to control numerical oscillations due to convection the surface water modeling system sms was used for linear triangle mesh generation adh uses the mesh files generated with sms directly without any modifications a higher density of elements was constructed in the vicinity of main channel to obtain a more accurate solution fig 2 a grid refinement was conducted first to ensure mesh independence of the results three meshes with element nodes of 4931 6301 and 10 306 were generated respectively each mesh was used to run the adh model with boundary inputs from the 50 year flood event water level and velocity distributions at the location of usgs gauging station 10 350 340 were extracted for comparisons results show that mesh element nodes of 6000 and above were mesh independent based on the above mesh independence analysis the final mesh generated for adh running in the present study consists of 11 793 elements and 6064 nodes which covers an area of approximately 6 8 km2 the minimum element size in the channel was 2 m and this length increased gradually from channel to floodplains up to a maximum size of 87 m the mesh has been carefully checked to maintain mesh quality and adjusted to minimize the element number while preserve the resolution adequate for resolving the main channel we carried out flood simulation work in this river stretch and the upper part of the study domain was included to minimize the potential impact introduced from the upstream boundary as shown in fig 1b compared to river segment i and iii the middle segment ii is a relatively low lying area with vast tracts of floodplains and therefore we conducted the particle tracking analysis in this middle segment ii 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation four flood events with different recurrence intervals were used for model calibration and validation fig 3 the model has been calibrated by changing bed roughness coefficients manually estimated from bed configuration and land use information with references to the tabular values in chow 1959 the 50 yr flood event happened in early 1997 was chosen for sensitivity analysis because it caused a large flood inundation area and it is more conducive to reflecting the impacts of floodplain roughness on the hydrograph the roughness coefficients of main channel and floodplains were gradually adjusted for computational runs until computed and observed discharge usgs gauging station 10350340 matched fig 4 a shows the sensitivity analysis results the discrepancies both in phase and amplitude are acceptable for flood simulation using medium roughness coefficients main channel n 0 039 floodplain n 0 048 therefore this set of roughness coefficients was used in all subsequent simulations the results also indicate that nearly two hours are required for the model to reach dynamic equilibrium from a cold start fig 4a several model runs were conducted to test the model efficiency in reproducing floods with different flood frequencies for validation the model has been applied to 10 yr 5 yr and 2 yr flood events the simulated discharges have been validated with those measurements at the usgs gauging station fig 1b fig 4b presents the validation results the results show a satisfactory agreement between the computed and observed hydrographs of discharge the root mean square error rmse of the 10 yr 5 yr and 2 yr flood events are 3 13 m3 s 1 91 m3 s and 1 77 m3 s respectively the results show reasonable agreement between the model predictions and measured data 3 2 effect of river planform morphology on lateral flow exchange the transboundary flux is calculated by integrating unit discharge uh along river bank lines 19 q int u h n d l where u is the velocity vector h is the water depth and n is the normal vector of bank line l pointing to the floodplain side the middle reach region ii was divided into three segments according to the meandering features shown in fig 1b compared to the sinuosity of segment ii 1 1 01 segment ii 2 and ii 3 have higher sinuosity values 1 26 and 1 54 respectively the transboundary flux was calculated for the 50 year flood event the normalized transboundary flux for the 50 year flood event is depicted in fig 5 the normalized flux represents the unit discharge across the boundaries thus it is more appropriate for an inter reach comparison in the three sub regions in region ii both positive flux and negative flux exist positive values represent flux toward floodplains while negative values represent flux towards the main stream positive and negative fluxes at the left and right channel boundaries are not always on the same order of magnitude indicating the asymmetry of flow feature at the two sides of the stream it is worth noting that the fluxes in segment ii 3 are both negative in the left and right channel boundaries indicating flow converging to the stream in this reach it was found that the transboundary flux was larger in the more meandering reaches and smaller in the relatively straight reaches in the three segments of region ii segment ii 2 presents the largest flux and segment ii 1 presents the smallest value consistent with their meandering properties in addition the transboundary flux followed the trend of the flow rate and the magnitude of the total transboundary flux the total discharge flowing into or out of the reach from stream floodplain boundaries was comparable to the longitudinal flow discharge the peak value of total flux at ii 2 section was about 400 m3 s while the peak longitudinal flow rate was about 525 m3 s with a ratio 400 525 of about 75 this indicates that most of overall river discharge participated in the river floodplain exchange within this reach it is important to note that this ratio is dependent of the length and the planform of the reach in question the ratio will generally increase with the length and the sinuosity of the reach however at a given river reach this ratio can be used to quantify the extent of river floodplain exchange in addition this ratio could vary over time and be used to assess the temporal variation of the exchange as can be found in fig 5 at the beginning and ending parts of the flood hydrograph the ratio was about 40 0 16 0 4 at ii 2 and even lower in the other sections this suggests that the interaction is stronger during the high flow period the convective transport of primary flow momentum by the transverse flow is an important cause of the redistribution of the primary flow velocity the velocity field at segment ii 2 and segment ii 3 are displayed in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively overall the main channel carried the primary discharge and the side floodplains always carried a low partition of the flow at lower flow stage once a river bank was overtopped the direction of velocity vector was gradually shifted from along the mainstem to pointing towards the river bank lines local circulation and flow separation occurred at certain zones due to the large shear generated by velocity gradients between the main channel and the floodplain flow in the high flow stage there was a wide variation in the distribution of longitudinal velocity from the inner to the outer bank of the meandering compound channel sections this indicates that river meanders can enhance the stream floodplain interaction 3 3 temporal and spatial characteristics of particle motions the behavior of the deterministic particles is associated with the flood stages fig 8 represents the particle movement and the inundation during the 50 year flood event at lower river stage the particles mainly remained in the main channel and they split at the upstream of the in stream bar and reconsolidated at the downstream fig 8a with an increase in discharge particles started to penetrate the river floodplain interface at meanders and the in steam bar the result shows that majority of the particles crossed the river floodplain interface at some points some of the particles moved onto the floodplain and remained there while some particles crossed the boundaries multiple times a few particles stayed in the main stream during the entire life span of the particles in the study reach these particles spent a relatively short time period traveling through the entire reach while particles moving through floodplains required a longer duration to move through the reach this result indicates that most part of the flow participate in the stream floodplain interaction and the interaction increased the travel time of the particles passing through this reach the particles lateral expansion behaviors also indirectly reflected the inundation process and hydrological connectivity between the channel and the low lying zones on floodplains at lower discharge stage there were isolated patches or patches connected to the mainstem these small wetlands could play important roles in maintaining the habitats of riverine vegetation and other biological processes allen et al 2016 amoros and bornette 2002 bates et al 2010 bolland et al 2012 heiler et al 1995 phelps et al 2015 thomaz et al 2007 thoms 2003 ward et al 1999 when the water level exceeded the bank during the rising limb of the hydrograph water left the river channel and spilled onto the floodplains by overbank flow the wetlands on floodplains were then reconnected to the mainstem river channel this process not only increased the water contained by the wetlands but also further displaced the wet dry boundary on both sides of the river rendering larger inundation areas on the floodplains during the receding stage the low lying wetlands on the floodplains gradually separated from the main channel showing an opposite process to the rising limb period the result of particle trajectory also discloses some important aspect of the floodplain stream flow exchange dynamics particle path lines fig 8 collectively with the flow field fig 6 show that most particles cross the floodplain stream boundary at a relatively small angle this indicates that the flow is dominated by longitudinal velocity component whereas the lateral component that causing the exchange is often secondary the result suggests that the longitudinal flow connectivity dictates the floodplain stream exchange and a floodplain generally does not intensely exchange with its immediate neighboring stream reach but reaches upstream and downstream the trajectory of a particle depends not only on its initial release time but also on its release location in space fig 9 shows the motion of particles with different initial positions under 50 year and 5 year flood events particles were released during the rising and falling limbs of the flood hydrographs as well as on the peak flow stages the majority of particles released on the floodplains traveled to the downstream along the outer boundary of the inundated area and then gradually moved back to the mainstem near the in stream bar constrained by the stream geomorphology particles released on the main channel revealed different behaviors along their pathways particle clouds stretched and expanded in extent and most particles escaped from the main channel and penetrated the meandering stream boundaries multiple times these particle behaviors suggest that there are chances for sediment seeds or solutes carried by the flood water to be intercepted and retained on the floodplains and not returning to the main channel if using a sink source concept to depict the particles behaviors the river channel acts as a source from the view of the particles motion whereas the floodplain often plays a role of sink similar findings have been reported by tockner et al 1999 in a study on the danube river in austria in which they showed that the floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments particulate organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen particle motions in the 5 year flood case were different from those observed under the 50 year flood condition a majority of particles released on the floodplain did not start traveling and only a few particles moved to the downstream due to the flood entrainment and then swiftly swarmed into the main channel due to less inundation area the exchanging zone mainly occurs along the river bank line with a limited belt width of about 3 m fig 9e h 3 4 particles travel statistics in the river floodplain system a statistical description of particle travel features in the river floodplain system can provide a quantitative assessment of the exchange between the river channel and floodplain within a given river reach we use three quantities to generate the particle travel statistics the particle travel distance ptd is the total distance on the floodplains that a particle traveled within the river reach in question the particle penetration number ppn here refers to the number of times that a particle penetrates the river floodplain interface to move from the main channel to the floodplains or the opposite during its travel within the concerned river reach the residence time rt is the total time a particle spent over the floodplain these indicators show different aspects of particle trajectories and are helpful to understand the river floodplain connectivity from the lagrangian standpoint to test the particle exchange frequency between the main channel and floodplains the distribution of particle travelling distance ptd particle penetration number ppn and particle residence time rt on floodplain were calculated it was conducted for the 50 year and 5 year flood events at the river segment ii fig 1 for each flood event we released a total of 3 000 particles from upstream section of region ii fig 1 in the subsequent statistical analysis only the particles that first entered and then again exited the concerned domain were considered this means that particles that moved to the upstream of released profile due to backwater or those finally stuck in the dry floodplains are excluded each particle counted in the following analysis is weighted by the initial water depth at the locations where the particles are released to represent properties of the entire water column the distributions of ptd for 5 year and 50 year flood events are presented in fig 10 a d m p with typical flooding stages respectively both the ptds of two flood events show approximately normal distributions the particles stay a longer distance on the floodplains under a smaller flood condition for instance at peak flow stage the mean value of 5 year flood ptd 1826 m was slightly larger than that of the 50 year flood event 1748 m with a difference about 1 5 times the river averaged width also particles penetrate the river floodplain boundary more frequently under smaller floods and the average ppn for 50 year and 5 year floods are 5 2 and 7 5 respectively however it is worth noting that for the 5 year flood case up to approximately 60 of the particles were rarely involved in the channel floodplain interactions and this ratio reduces to less than 20 under 50 year flood since the 5 year flood event has lower velocity the residence times were expected to be longer than that under the 50 year flood event as shown in fig 10 the mean residence time of particles of the 5 year flood case is about 1 5 times of that of the 50 year flood case which is attributed to the lower velocity and higher exchange frequency under smaller flood magnitude particle exchange frequency seems insensitive to the flood stages within each flood event to be more specific the mean ptd ppn and rt values are very close under the rising peak flow and receding stages 4 discussions there are many hydraulic and ecological implications of the results found in this study flood pulses are a main driving force for improving habitat heterogeneity and the diversity of floodplain hydrological connectivity junk et al 1989 understanding the variable lateral connectivity in river floodplain systems under high flows is propitious to interpret the biological diversity of aquatic organisms in the present study we found that larger floods introduce much higher discharges onto the floodplains and particles may travel into the floodplains farther from the channel this is expected to enhance the heterogeneity in the floodplain previous studies indicated that periodic flood events could effectively strengthen the intensity of nutrient and organic matter exchanges between the main channel and riparian floodplains and the low lying waterbody connectivity to the main stem was found positively correlated with the number of species e g the young of the year fish communities in poorly connected water bodies were reported to have less species richness bolland et al 2012 tockner et al 1999 tockner and stanford 2002 and alpha diversity ward et al 1999 we examined the impacts of the channel meandering property on the flow interactions between channel and floodplains compared to straight river reaches meandering reaches provide more variable transboundary flux and complicated velocity field during flood events this means that the lateral exchanges between the main channel and floodplains in meandering reaches are much more intense and complex this type of river morphology is likely holding many functions such as biogeochemical filters and creating favorable conditions for biodiversity glińska lewczuk and burandt 2011 however river managements such as river straightening and channelization often attenuate the intensity of the flow exchange dynamics and the lateral connectivity leading to a lower level of biological diversity and a decreased habitat heterogeneity although efforts have been done to improve the ecological status of rivers bolland et al 2012 grift et al 2001 the river rehabilitation activities mainly focus on increasing individual floodplain waterbody connectivity but rarely consider the significance of variable lateral exchanges between the main channel and floodplain bolland et al 2012 our work provides a quantitative view on how meandering reach could enhance the flow exchange in a channel floodplain system the approach presented in this study provides a means to understand and quantify the floodplain stream connectivity the flow flux across the boundary is closely linked to spatial distribution of mass and energy exchanges between floodplain and stream and habitat sustainability on floodplains the particle trajectory has implications to many aspects of the ecological geomorphological and nutrient contaminant transport processes occurring in the floodplain stream system the attributes of particle movement may inspire the development of better tools and metric for aquatic ecology studies that can enhance qualitative and or quantitative understanding of the associated processes the particle pathways are closely related to the transport and distribution of sediment and nutrient on the floodplain and their impact on aquatic habitats combined with other hydraulic and geomorphologic indicators such as flow depth microtopography and vegetation distribution the particles may be used as surrogates for many organisms and substances and their dynamic and statistic attributes may help investigate ecological issues such as fish mobility and stranding possibility zooplankton and phytoplankton migration and distribution seeds dispersal and riparian vegetation establishment on floodplains the actual application will vary depending on the nature of the concerned problem overall the mixed eularian and lagrangian analysis of the hydrodynamics in the floodplain stream system is expected to assist in ecological health assessment and prediction for stream corridors the river floodplain connectivity is often classified into different degrees based on the water levels for example when the river water level is lower than that on floodplains the degree of the connectivity may be categorized as disconnection tockner et al 1999 from the perspective of the surface water this is intuitive and apparent however the floodplain and main channel could still maintain the connection through groundwater flow flood induced water level fluctuations in the river corridors have proven to be a main driving force to enhance groundwater surface water interactions in some circumstances stream water can enter the river bank storage zone with distances from tens to hundreds of meters such processes carry dissolved oxygen and organic carbon into the storage zone that may form high potentials in many biochemical processes e g the denitrification in addition the increasing flow discharge can alter the head gradient over the stream bed resulting a dramatic change in the hyporheic flux and the volume size of hyporheic zone chen et al 2015a chen et al 2018 gooseff et al 2017 merill and tonjes 2014 mouw et al 2009 the surface subsurface connectivity manner was out of the scope of the present study however one can still expect that flood water can moderate the local groundwater hydraulic gradient through overland flow infiltration this could result in a lower groundwater hydraulic gradient and reduce the lateral hyporheic flow and the size of hyporheic zone for example using a 2 d model wroblicky et al 1998 found that the sizes of lateral hyporheic exchange zones of two first order streams were decreased by approximately 50 during high flow studies have showed that water in the floodplain and active channel interacted frequently and together served as a subsurface corridor for livings of many invertebrates mouw et al 2009 the 2 d hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking approach applied in this study may be less detailed than a 3 d hydrodynamic model and 3 d particle tracking in depicting vertical variations of the flow field for the river floodplain system especially in zones of large bed elevation changes marinone 2006 however the 3 d approaches are computationally demanding and highly time consuming which makes them less practical in large scale investigations the 2 d hydrodynamic model can provide a feasible and reliable way to generate the time varying depth averaged flow field for the system the 2 d particle tracking therefore represents the depth averaged features of particle movement and can still provide plausible lagrangian results of the flow field 5 summary and conclusions in the present study a particle tracking program was used conjunctively with a hydrodynamic model to determine the lateral flow exchanges within a river stretch with pronounced river floodplains flow paths and travel times were calculated through a velocity field that resolved from individual grid cells in a two dimensional numerical flow model we first calibrated the model with a 50 year flood event to determine the potential roughness coefficients and then validated the model with other three flood events floods with returning intervals of 2 year 5 year and 10 year our results showed that the performance of the 2 d numerical model is reasonably well for describing the floodwater dynamics within the river floodplain system we then released particles from the upstream boundary of the studied stretch to track the flow path and lateral exchange processes the particle tracing technique found to be an efficient tool to describe the hydrodynamic interaction of the main channel and floodplain it can quantitatively reveal the characteristics of the floodplain residence time and mechanical as well as statistical properties of the exchange our results suggest that larger floods introduce less cross boundary connectivity between the stream and the floodplain and shorter residence time and flow path length but a larger proportion of the discharge participating the interaction we also examined the effects of river planform curvature on the lateral exchange property and results showed that meanders can enhance the river floodplain interaction our work provides a quantitative way for understanding the lateral water exchanging behaviors within the river floodplain system during high flows which can inform process based assessment of the geomorphological and ecological evolutions in the system controlled by this exchange future studies can further explore the effects of 3 d turbulence on river floodplain exchange in

5724,geographically isolated wetlands giws provide a portfolio of ecosystem services in low gradient coastal plain landscapes understanding how giws influence downstream waters is becoming increasingly important for conservation and management of these unique and important wetland ecosystems climatic conditions are known to be key drivers of water budgets at both individual giw and landscape scales however differences in hydrologic response across these scales may provide insights into how giws influence downstream waters in this study we use a combination of giw water level gaged streamflow and climatic data to explore linkages between seasonal climatic drivers giw hydrology and downstream discharges within the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed we first examine water balance components at the larger watershed scale where climatic drivers result in an energy limited wet season from december to may and a water limited dry season from june to november we compare long term water levels of three giws with downstream discharges giw water level and downstream discharges are correlated at seasonal r2 0 52 0 60 and daily r2 0 52 0 76 time steps however during dry seasons giw water level receded at a faster rate than downstream discharges highlighting the influence of evapotranspiration on surface and shallow subsurface water storage conversely during wet seasons giw water level receded slower than downstream discharges highlighting a potential period for surface water connectivity between giws and downstream discharges cumulatively these findings quantify the impact of seasonal climatic drivers on giw hydrology and connectivity to downstream waters keywords geographically isolated wetlands climatic drivers hydrologic connectivity 1 introduction geographically isolated wetlands giws so called non flood plain wetlands lane et al 2018 jones et al 2019 upland embedded wetlands neff and rosenberry 2018 or depressional wetlands evenson et al 2018 neff et al 2020 are defined as wetlands completely surrounded by uplands tiner 2003 giws provide a wide array of ecosystem functions that include buffering downstream baseflow mclaughlin et al 2014 improving downstream water quality cheng and basu 2017 golden et al 2019 and providing natural habitat russell and beauchamp 2017 these hydrologic biochemical and ecological functions are at least in part a result of water storage in giws jones et al 2018a evenson et al 2018 thus understanding giw hydrology is crucial for management and conservation of many aquatic ecosystems hydrological processes within watersheds are governed by a combination of climatic and hydrogeomorphic controls mcdonnell 2013 edwards et al 2015 at the watershed scale the relationship between watershed storage and climate conditions is often described mcdonnell et al 2018 as the balance of precipitation p and evapotranspiration et for example when p exceeds potential evapotranspiration pet energy limited conditions prevail and the watershed storage increases in contrast when pet exceeds p water limited conditions prevail and watershed storage decreases chen et al 2013 wang and alimohammadi 2012 notably downstream discharges are often correlated with watershed storage though storage discharge relationships often experience hysteresis and are affected by factors such as antecedent moisture conditions and hydrogeomorphic controls spence 2010 in particular hydrogeomorphic characteristics influence the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of flowpaths across watersheds in regions with steep slopes and low hydraulic conductivity either surface water or shallow subsurface flow serves as a major flow pathway mcdonnell 2013 edwards et al 2015 however in low gradient landscapes water movement is often restricted resulting in high densities of lakes ponds and wetlands thorslund et al 2017 at the individual wetland scale hydrologic processes are also strongly linked to a combination of climatic and hydrogeomorphic controls cohen et al 2016 neff et al 2020 in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw inundation extents and water levels of giws have been shown to increase during wet seasons and decrease during dry seasons lee et al 2019 yeo et al 2019a further inundation extents of giws are strongly correlated with downstream discharges yeo et al 2019a in other giw rich landscapes like the prairie pothole region in the us and canadian midwest hydrogeomorphic features such as wetland size watershed storage and watershed position also affect hydrologic processes at the individual wetland scale hayashi et al 2016 evenson et al 2018 winter and labaugh 2003 hydrogeomorphic characteristics have considerable impacts on the hydrologic connectivity of giws with downstream surface water systems e g adjacent streams and downstream discharges hydrologic connectivity is defined as the water mediated transport of matter energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle pringle 2003 and giw connectivity hydrologic connectivity between giws and other watershed components is a critical nexus for research cohen et al 2016 management golden et al 2017 and regulatory alexander et al 2015 communities giw connectivity is facilitated by both surface water and groundwater flowpaths golden et al 2014 in the prairie pothole region giw connectivity is dominated by surface water flow due to low hydraulic conductivities van der kamp and hayashi 2009 slow groundwater flow ameli and creed 2017 and water table mounds neff and rosenberry 2018 however giw connectivity via groundwater was observed in an area that included an effective transmission zone within the prairie pothole region branne et al 2015 thus giws in that region were effective at reducing peak flow by storing p and snowmelt but giws exerted minimal impacts on modulating downstream baseflow ameli and creed 2019 evenson et al 2018 in the coastal plain of the cbw giws have strong interactions with groundwater philips and shedlock 1993 lee et al 2019 and thus connectivity between giws and downstream waters is facilitated by groundwater flowpaths winter and labaugh 2003 yeo et al 2019b both episodic and sustained giw connectivity via surface water flowpaths has also been observed after rainfall events and during wet seasons respectively mcdonough et al 2015 epting et al 2018 further previous studies using a hydrologic model found that a group of giws increased baseflow contributions to downstream discharges and mitigated peak flows increasing landscape resilience lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019b in this study we explore the relationship between giw water level and downstream discharges using gaged streamflow climatic data and daily water level from three giws located on the coastal plain of the cbw in this region previous studies have highlighted climatic forces as important drivers of hydrology at both individual giw and larger watershed scales fisher et al 2010 huang et al 2014 yeo et al 2019a in addition more recent work on this region has documented seasonal variations in connectivity between individual giws and downstream discharges mcdonough et al 2015 epting et al 2018 lee et al 2018 the specific objectives of our study are to i characterize seasonal drivers of giw and watershed hydrology ii explore the relationship between seasonal climatic forces giw water level and downstream discharges and iii identify different hydrologic responses between giw water level and downstream discharge at both seasonal and individual storm event timescales understanding how giws influence downstream waters is becoming increasingly important for the conservation and management of our water resources golden et al 2017 and this study provides the context necessary to better understand seasonal drivers of giw hydrology relevant across both the coastal plain of the cbw and other low gradient coastal plain landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study explored three giws within the greensboro watershed gbw upstream of the us geological survey usgs gage station 01491000 292 km2 fig 1 which is located on the coastal plain of the cbw fig 1 the area is characterized by a humid temperate climate with an annual average p of 1200 mm ator et al 2005 approximately half of p is returned to the atmosphere via et with the remainder mostly infiltrating into the shallow groundwater ator et al 2005 the gbw has relatively flat topography with an average elevation of 26 m above sea level and is dominated by poorly drained soils lee et al 2016 yeo et al 2019a major land uses within the gbw types include forested areas 48 and croplands 36 and soils with low hydraulic conductivities account for 75 of the watershed area due to an abundance of these soils drainage ditch systems have been widely developed to support agricultural production and this drainage system is known to be a leading cause of wetland losses in this region mcavoy and bowman 2002 jones et al 2018a according to the u s fish and wildlife service usfws national wetland inventory nwi geospatial dataset approximately 3000 natural wetlands are present within the gbw and more than 95 of these wetlands are forested the nwi wetlands occupy a significant portion 52 of the total forest areas within the watershed the total area of nwi wetlands is approximately 74 km2 accounting for approximately 25 of the gbw yeo et al 2019a we examined three wetlands from the gbw in this study the first wetland is relatively pristine wetland 1 and the two remaining wetlands were recently restored wetlands 2 and 3 the wetlands range in size from 0 4 to1 2 ha their drainage areas range in size from 2 5 to 5 3 ha and they range in mean elevation from 15 8 to 16 2 m above sea level the area draining wetlands 1 and 2 is primarily forest while the area draining to wetland 3 includes both forest and cropland in all wetlands the wetland invert is approximately 0 1 m lower than the mean perimeter elevation and the mean wetland slope ranges from 0 to 0 1 m m the three study giws were each 0 1 to 0 3 km from streams indicated by the usgs high resolution national hydrography dataset nhd see fig 1 and table 1 for more details wetlands transformed to croplands have been restored by the us department of agriculture usda through various u s farm bill programs including the wetland reserve program and the conservation reserve program lang et al 2015 wetland 1 was vegetated with native tree species while wetlands 2 and 3 were dominated by herbaceous species including sedges grasses and herbs yepsen et al 2014 this difference is likely due to short post restoration periods hydrologic conditions impeding the growth of native tree species and management practices by land owners yepsen et al 2014 2 2 estimating watershed scale climatic drivers at the watershed scale multiple datasets were used to estimate water balance components at the seasonal time step this study defined two seasons i a dry season from june to november a water limited condition resulting in relatively low streamflow and groundwater levels and ii a wet season from december to may an energy limited condition resulting in relatively high streamflow and groundwater levels fisher et al 2010 climatic seasonality was first characterized by computing the seasonal aridity index the ratio of pet to p pet p the aridity index is an indicator of water balance for example when the index is lower or greater than 1 et is constrained by available energy or water supply indicating high or low water balance respectively rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 daily p was obtained from the weather station closest to the gbw fig 1 operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc us1mdcl0009 missing data n 151 were filled in with the data collected at the second closest noaa ncdc weather station usc00187806 fig s1 daily pet was estimated using the hargreeves method with the evapotranspiration package guo et al 2019 within the r programing environment r core team 2019 input temperature for the hargreeves method was obtained from nearby weather stations usc00187806 see fig s1 in the supplementary material daily p and pet were aggregated into monthly values by summation and then into seasonal values by taking a mean average we also used the budyko framework to characterize climatic seasonality this framework was developed to evaluate mean annual water balance defined as the ratio of et to p et p as a function of the aridity index budyko 1974 to consider soil vegetation and climatic seasonality in the budyko framework budyko type equations have been developed wang and tang 2014 this study applied the modified fu s equation that considers water storage δ s as water supply in conjunction with precipitation to represent both et p and pet p for non steady conditions such as a sub annual time step e g monthly or seasonal or catchment scale wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2004 eq 1 water storage δ s for wet and dry seasons was calculated using seasonal p et and streamflow q as shown in eq 2 to generate the budyko curve using the modified fu s equation 1 et p 1 pet p δ s 1 pet p δ s w 1 w 2 δ s p e t q where p and w indicate precipitation and the impacts of other factors e g land surface and climate on the water energy balance daily δ s was aggregated into seasonal values similar to p and pet daily et was estimated at 5 km resolution using the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi surface energy balance model anderson et al 2007 based on energy balance principles alexi computes an evaporative flux commensurate with the observed rate of morning land surface temperature rise derived from hourly thermal infrared imagery from the geostationary operational environmental satellites goes collective model evaluation results indicate a typical rmse of 1 mm d 1 at the daily time step in comparison with flux tower observations sun et al 2017 anderson et al 2018 the 5 km grids were aggregated to the watershed scale over the gbw daily streamflow obtained from the usgs gage station 01491000 fig 1 was used to represent downstream discharges streamflow is a flux but was converted to a daily or seasonal volume in addition streamflow was converted to a depth by dividing by the watershed area daily streamflow was aggregated to seasonal streamflow for comparison with climatic forces seasonal and daily streamflow were used to detect contrasting hydrologic responses between giws and downstream discharges for daily comparisons common log transformed streamflow with a base of 10 referred to as log sf hereafter was used 2 3 data for hydrologic characterization of giw hydrology the usda mid atlantic regional wetland conservation effects assessment project ceap wetland is focused on assessing the effects and effectiveness of wetland restoration on the provision of wetland ecosystem services lang et al 2015 in support of this objective multiple wells and piezometers were installed at the lowest elevation of the wetland bottom to monitor surface water swl and shallow groundwater levels gwl of giws respectively at a high temporal frequency both swl and gwl were collected in wetlands 1 and 2 while only gwl was monitored in wetland 3 the wells and piezometer in wetlands 1 and 2 were installed to 0 9 and 3 0 m below the wetland bottom respectively the piezometer in wetland 3 reached a depth of 2 5 m below the wetland bottom water levels measured by well and piezometer pressure transducers are reported relative to ground surface with positive values indicating above ground surface sub daily water levels were collected from each giw all water level data were aggregated into daily values by averaging sub daily data before averaging sub daily outlier values for each day were excluded using the tukey method tukey 1977 calculated as indicated below 3 o u t l i e r q 1 1 5 i q r o r q 3 1 5 i q r 4 iqr q 3 q 1 where outlier indicates a sub daily outlier value and q1 and q3 indicate the first and third quartile of sub daily values respectively outliers were detected using the r program boxplot function and details on detected outliers for individual wetlands are provided in table s1 missing data points resulting from the malfunction of sensors were not used for analyses see table s1 for missing data 3 results to examine seasonal climatic drivers of giw hydrology and connectivity to downstream discharges analyses were conducted at both seasonal and daily time steps at the seasonal time step climatic drivers were examined using the seasonal average of water balance components e g p et pet and downstream discharges fig 2 to add further context to climatic seasonality the budyko framework was used to represent the degree of energy and water limited conditions across the study period fig 3 then we compared seasonal estimates of the aridity index to seasonal swl and gwl across the three study wetlands figs 4 and 5 at a daily time step we specifically focused on comparing giw water level to downstream discharges fig 6 both similarities in the time series figs 5 and 6 and potential differences figs 7 and 8 were investigated 3 1 seasonal variation water balance components a combination of p streamflow et and pet estimates was used to examine seasonal differences in water balance components fig 2 using previously defined wet and dry seasons fisher et al 2010 we found that p was fairly uniform across wet 104 16 mm and dry 119 26 mm seasons p value 0 1 from the wilcoxon signed rank test conversely et and pet were significantly different across wet 50 3 and 71 4 mm respectively and dry 92 4 and 113 4 mm respectively seasons p value 0 01 the same seasonality was observed from the aridity index 0 7 0 1 wet seasons 1 0 2 dry seasons p value 0 01 because the index is computed using p and pet this was also consistent with significant seasonal differences in streamflow 56 19 mm wet seasons 32 22 mm dry seasons p value 0 05 to further investigate seasonal differences at the watershed scale we examined climatic drivers using the budyko framework budyko 1974 fig 3 wet and dry season values were plotted on different locations of the budyko curve where wet season values generally plotted lower on the curve due to a lower aridity index this indicated that wet seasons are generally limited by energy supply i e pet p 1 whereas dry seasons are limited by water supply i e pet p 1 similarly seasonal differences were observed when fitting seasonal values to the budyko curve using the modified fu s equation fitted lines exhibited a greater parameter value w for dry seasons relative to wet seasons which suggests that dry seasons have conditions more conducive to et relative to wet conditions padrón et al 2017 3 2 seasonal variation in downstream discharges and giw water level to examine drivers of giw water level and downstream discharges we examined how these variables respond to changes in seasonal water balance components fig 4 a significant negative correlation between downstream discharges and the aridity index was observed r2 of 0 68 fig 4a the aridity index had a negative relationship with downstream discharges since a greater aridity index indicates high et and low water storage resulting in lower downstream discharges thus seasonal values of the aridity index were greater and lower during dry and wet seasons respectively the opposite trends were observed in the seasonal values of downstream discharges when dry seasons included large p events four red points in the middle left x value aridity index 0 7 and y value downstream discharges 60 in fig 4a dry season values showed a lower aridity index and greater downstream discharges than some wet season values however a strong correlation between the aridity index and downstream discharges still existed similarly a significant negative correlation between giw water level and the aridity index was observed r2 of 0 91 and 0 88 fig 4bc only gwl data from wetland 2 and wetland 3 were used for this analysis due to large amounts of missing data in the other time series data the observed variation was consistent with seasonal trends where relatively low water levels were experienced in the dry seasons from 0 2 to 0 03 m and from 0 75 to 0 27 m in wetlands 2 and 3 respectively and relatively high water levels in the wet seasons from 0 14 to 0 19 m and from 0 20 to 0 39 m in wetlands 2 and 3 respectively the 2009 dry season gwl in wetland 3 was greater than some wet season values due to unusually large dry season p in this year the red dot within a black circle in fig 4c we also explored relationships between seasonal measures of giw water level and downstream discharges fig 5 overall we observed overall increasing trends between the two variables the relationships between gwl and downstream discharges for wetlands 2 and 3 with downstream discharges produced r2 values of 0 60 and 0 52 respectively 3 3 daily variation in downstream discharges and giw water level variations in giw water level and downstream discharges were explored at a daily time step fig 6 exhibits swl gwl and log sf across the different time periods swls in wetlands 1 and 2 ranged from 0 3 to 0 7 m and 0 9 and 0 4 m respectively gwl varied from 0 9 to 0 4 m wetland 1 from 1 1 to 0 3 m wetland 2 and from 1 3 to 0 7 m wetland 3 as shown in the previous results giw water level and downstream discharges varied seasonally with high and low values during wet and dry seasons respectively the lowest daily giw water levels and log sf were observed during the driest season i e the most water limited condition over the monitoring period aqua shaded region wetlands 1 and 2 exhibited the lowest water levels during the first dry season 2016 fig 6ab corresponding dry season aridity indices were 1 1 2016 dry season 1 0 2017 dry season and 0 7 2018 dry season fig 2 wetland 3 also exhibited the lowest gwl and log sf during the dry season from june 2008 to december 2008 when the aridity index was highest 1 6 the relationship between giw water level and downstream discharges was explored at a daily time step fig 7 in general and as also shown in fig 6 there was a correlation between giw water level i e measured as swl and gwl and downstream discharges i e measured as log sf however there are different patterns as illustrated by the aqua magenta gold green and purple periods points highlighted in both figs 6 and 7 note the aqua magenta green and gold points in fig 7a d correspond to the periods shown as aqua sep 4th sep 18th 2016 magenta sep 15th oct 28th 2017 green aug 11th sep 5th 2018 and gold feb 1st feb 20th 2018 regions in fig 6ab respectively further the aqua and purple points in fig 7e correspond to the periods shown as aqua jul 11th dec 8th 2008 and purple aug 15th sep 30th 2010 regions in fig 6c details about linear regression models used to calculate r2 are shown in table 2 in figs 6 and 7 each group of colored periods or points showed an example of different archetypal patterns observed in the time series at wetland 1 and 2 swl and gwl rapidly decreased while log sf was relatively constant during the period of no rain days magenta sep 15th oct 28th 2017 and green aug 11th sep 5th 2018 points under the condition of long consecutive no rain days swl and gwl quickly decreased owing to exposure to immediate weather condition that promote water loss via et but log sf decreased at a relatively slow rate thus log sf remained constant relative to swl and gwl during wet periods highlighted with gold points in fig 7b wetland water levels experienced threshold behavior indicating surface water storage capacity had been exceeded and the wetland was likely spilling to downstream waters mclaughlin et al 2019 fig 8a is an example of this behavior specifically highlighting a time period during the wet season when downstream discharges increased but giw water level was stationary it should be noted that log sf and giw water level were normalized to have the same minimum 0 and maximum values 1 using eq 5 and then compared in fig 8 5 v a l u e n o r v a l u e m i n max m i n where valuenor and value are the normalized and original value respectively min and max indicate the minimum and maximum values of data the green magenta and purple points in fig 7 are prolonged periods with dry seasons during these periods we observed a faster reduction in giw water level relative to downstream discharges this pattern is particularly pronounced in fig 8b which corresponds to the aqua bar shown in fig 6b and aqua points shown in fig 7b the aqua points in fig 7 highlight periods of extremely low downstream flow the driest season over the wetland monitoring period during these periods downstream discharges receded faster than giw water levels fig 8c 4 discussion 4 1 wetland water storage and downstream discharges watershed storage or the amount of water stored between bedrock and the ground surface within a given watershed is useful for predicting complex rainfall runoff relationships e g spence 2010 mcdonnell et al 2018 quantifying spatial and temporal heterogeneity of flowpaths through watersheds e g harman 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 and improving our understanding of watershed scale impacts of land use and climate changes e g evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 gebrehiwot et al 2019 the hydrology of the coastal plain of the cbw provides a unique endmember for understanding interaction between watershed storage and downstream discharges as landscapes transition from high relief montane regions to low relief coastal plain areas they lose their ability to shed water and watershed storage in soils increases fan et al 2019 as an endmember along this continuum the delmarva landscape is defined by extremely low gradient topography and poorly drained soils koskelo et al 2018 further a significant portion of the delmarva s watershed storage occurs in wetlands fenstermacher et al 2014 jones et al 2018a thus it is unsurprising that a strong correlation between giw water level and other water balance components existed and in fact similar findings have been documented in other wetland rich landscapes like the prairie pothole region e g vanderhoof et al 2018 and the southeastern coastal plain e g liu and kumar 2016 we investigated climatic seasonality that drove variations in water storage at both the individual giw and the larger watershed scale in the context of the budyko framework fig 4 we highlighted that seasonal difference between p and pet led to a wet season that is energy limited i e pet p 1 and a dry season that is slightly water limited i e pet p 1 the dry season corresponds to the summer growing season when et increases due to both increased temperatures and transpiration from plants conversely the wet season corresponds to winter and early spring when et is limited by both temperature and minimal transpiration from plants during wet seasons the region experiences shallow groundwater tables elevated giw water levels and increased streamflow philips and shedlock 1993 fisher et al 2010 lee et al 2019 previous studies have documented surface water connectivity between giws and downstream waters during this time period as well i e mcdonough et al 2015 epting et al 2018 in addition to documenting similarities between giw water level and downstream discharges we also examined the periods when they are different fig 8 in particular we observed threshold behavior in giws during energy limited periods fig 8a greater giw water level reduction rates during dry periods fig 8b and greater reduction rates in downstream discharges during extremely dry periods fig 8c the threshold behavior is an important feature of low gradient landscapes like the coastal plain of the cbw and it leads to complicated surface water flowpaths often described by spill fill merge hydrology leibowitz et al 2016 vanderhoof et al 2016 mclaughlin et al 2019 once a wetland reaches its maximum storage capacity it spills to a downstream water body often the downgradient water body is another wetland if the spill point of the downgradient wetland occurs at a higher elevation than the upgradient wetland the wetlands have the potential to merge wu and lane 2017 conceptualized this merging pattern as groups of russian nesting dolls and described patterns of nested wetlands using hierarchal graph theory wu et al 2019 notably at least in our study region our findings suggest this merging inundation pattern can occur during wet seasons future research should explore their spill fill merge hydrology via overland flow path in this region using observations with innovative merging prediction techniques wu and lane 2017 wu et al 2019 to advance our understanding of giw hydrology we also observed a 1 day lag between maximum wetland water level and maximum streamflow this observation is likely due to a combination of several covarying factors including both the watershed size and thresholds associated with spill fill hydrology and storage discharge relationships it is well established that small watersheds respond faster to rainfall than large watersheds haan et al 1994 and the drainage areas of our study wetlands are three orders of magnitude smaller than the gbw further as described above once wetlands exceed their storage capacity they spill to downstream waters and wetland water levels increase at a much slower rate if any at all thus the timing of peak surface water export from wetlands is likely obscured in the wetland water level data during dry seasons giw water levels receded faster than downstream discharges fig 8b during these seasons surface water export from wetlands is minimal epting et al 2018 and water loss substantially increase due to direct exposure to high et conditions while downstream discharges mostly stem from groundwater during dry seasons thus the faster reduction rate of giw water level was likely due to a combination of increased et and water flux from the wetland to its surrounding upland groundwater jones et al 2018b recently highlighted the connection between upland et and giw water level in pine flat wetlands another low gradient giw rich landscape found in the southeastern coastal plain in this modeling exercise an increase in upland et led to decreases in both giw water level and hydroperiod more specifically the increased upland et resulted in lower upland groundwater levels resulting in increased surface water to groundwater exchange between the wetland and surrounding upland similarly mclaughlin and cohen 2014 documented surface water to groundwater exchange between wetlands and their surrounding uplands using empirical measurements further highlighting the role of giw connectivity in low gradient wetland rich landscapes found throughout the mid atlantic and southeastern coastal plain we observed that downstream discharges receded faster than giw water levels during the driest season in the observational period fig 8c during this period the rapid reduction in downstream discharges are attributed at least in part to a restriction of deep groundwater flowpaths during dry seasons groundwater is commonly used for irrigation across this region wolman 2008 and during extremely dry seasons groundwater pumping likely further reduces downstream discharges zipper et al 2019 the observed reduction in the downstream discharges was likely due to water demand induced by a prolonged dry period exacerbated by groundwater pumping 4 2 giw connectivity in the context of climatic drivers increasingly research cohen et al 2016 management golden et al 2017 and regulatory e g alexander 2015 communities require information about connectivity between wetlands and downstream waters an interdisciplinary research effort has mobilized to fill this critical knowledge gap alexander et al 2018 jones et al 2019 resulting in advances in our understanding of giw connectivity golden et al 2019 however continued research efforts are needed to more precisely characterize giw connectivity across regions that experience divergent hydroclimatic and hydrogeomorphic conditions this study quantifies linkages between giws and downstream waters more specifically this study found that seasonal climatic drivers play a key role in controlling hydrology of giws in the mid atlantic coastal plain it is important to note that this study did not explicitly explore hydrologic connectivity between three study giws and downstream discharges more precisely this study showed that these giws represent a small portion of the total watershed storage and then explored the relationship between wetland storage and downstream discharges this study showed how climatic conditions can control hydrologic connectivity in this region giws tend to be connected to downstream waters during wet seasons i e energy limited periods but giws tend to be isolated from downstream waters during dry seasons i e water limited periods climatic drivers play an important role in giw connectivity and water storage across archetypal giw rich landscapes for example the timing and magnitude of hydrologic connectivity between prairie pothole wetlands and downstream waters is strongly influenced by the annual snowfall cycle snow accumulates in the potholes throughout the winter and then spring snowmelt initiates connectivity between groups of wetlands and to downstream waters brooks et al 2018 evenson et al 2018 however these annual cycles are superimposed onto longer term climatic trends and specific to the north dakota prairie pothole region there are decadal long climatic drivers that lead to prolonged periods of drought and deluge thus both giw connectivity and water storage are tied to those trends vanderhoof et al 2018 in the southeastern coastal plain and as shown by this study giw connectivity and water storage are a function of the seasonal balance between p and et however these seasonal patterns are also superimposed onto long term climate conditions a recent modeling study suggests that giw water storage and connectivity will decrease under current climate change predictions due to changes in the timing of precipitation and increases in pet zhu et al 2017 5 conclusions this study explored the variation in giw water level and downstream discharges in the context of seasonal climatic drivers in a low gradient coastal plain landscape we first examined watershed scale water balanced components using gaged streamflow and climatic data using these measures of water balance components we observed two dominant seasons that drive this region s hydrology i an energy limited wet season from december to may and ii a water limited dry season from june to november then we compared these climatic drivers with both giw water level and downstream discharges at seasonal time steps a strong correlation was found between the aridity index pet p and both giw water level and downstream discharges finally we compared giw water level and downstream discharges a strong correlation was found between giw water level and downstream discharges at both seasonal and daily time steps however different hydrologic responses between giw water level and downstream discharges were also observed indicating local hydrologic processes affecting giw water storage specifically during wet seasons giw water level often exhibited threshold behavior giws filled to capacity and were spilling to another downstream water body during dry seasons giw water level often decreased at a faster rate than downstream discharges this trend can at least partially be explained by increased et in both the individual giw and its surrounding upland in the driest season opposite trends were observed where downstream discharges decreased at a faster rate than giw water level this can be explained by deep groundwater flowpaths restricted by prolonged dry periods lowrance et al 1997 sanford and pope 2013 ator and denver 2015 which may have been exacerbated by agricultural groundwater withdrawals our findings highlight the impact of climatic drivers on giw water storage and downstream connectivity at both wetland and watershed scales wetlands play an important role in watershed hydrologic biogeochemical and ecological function e g evenson et al 2018 and in the coastal plain of the cbw much of this function is linked to giws ability to store water at both the individual wetland and watershed scale jones et al 2018a lee et al 2018 qi et al 2019 however more work is needed to quantify the cumulative impacts of giws on downstream waters we argue these advances should be made in the context of total watershed storage emphasizing that wetland water storage is a non trivial component of total watershed storage in wetland rich systems while our study demonstrates climatic forces that control connectivity between individual giws and downstream discharges i e energy limited periods future research is needed to quantify the cumulative impact of giws on hydrologic biogeochemical and ecological function at watershed and landscape scales this information will be critical as researchers natural resources managers and the regulatory community continue to address large scale challenges such as land use and

5724,geographically isolated wetlands giws provide a portfolio of ecosystem services in low gradient coastal plain landscapes understanding how giws influence downstream waters is becoming increasingly important for conservation and management of these unique and important wetland ecosystems climatic conditions are known to be key drivers of water budgets at both individual giw and landscape scales however differences in hydrologic response across these scales may provide insights into how giws influence downstream waters in this study we use a combination of giw water level gaged streamflow and climatic data to explore linkages between seasonal climatic drivers giw hydrology and downstream discharges within the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed we first examine water balance components at the larger watershed scale where climatic drivers result in an energy limited wet season from december to may and a water limited dry season from june to november we compare long term water levels of three giws with downstream discharges giw water level and downstream discharges are correlated at seasonal r2 0 52 0 60 and daily r2 0 52 0 76 time steps however during dry seasons giw water level receded at a faster rate than downstream discharges highlighting the influence of evapotranspiration on surface and shallow subsurface water storage conversely during wet seasons giw water level receded slower than downstream discharges highlighting a potential period for surface water connectivity between giws and downstream discharges cumulatively these findings quantify the impact of seasonal climatic drivers on giw hydrology and connectivity to downstream waters keywords geographically isolated wetlands climatic drivers hydrologic connectivity 1 introduction geographically isolated wetlands giws so called non flood plain wetlands lane et al 2018 jones et al 2019 upland embedded wetlands neff and rosenberry 2018 or depressional wetlands evenson et al 2018 neff et al 2020 are defined as wetlands completely surrounded by uplands tiner 2003 giws provide a wide array of ecosystem functions that include buffering downstream baseflow mclaughlin et al 2014 improving downstream water quality cheng and basu 2017 golden et al 2019 and providing natural habitat russell and beauchamp 2017 these hydrologic biochemical and ecological functions are at least in part a result of water storage in giws jones et al 2018a evenson et al 2018 thus understanding giw hydrology is crucial for management and conservation of many aquatic ecosystems hydrological processes within watersheds are governed by a combination of climatic and hydrogeomorphic controls mcdonnell 2013 edwards et al 2015 at the watershed scale the relationship between watershed storage and climate conditions is often described mcdonnell et al 2018 as the balance of precipitation p and evapotranspiration et for example when p exceeds potential evapotranspiration pet energy limited conditions prevail and the watershed storage increases in contrast when pet exceeds p water limited conditions prevail and watershed storage decreases chen et al 2013 wang and alimohammadi 2012 notably downstream discharges are often correlated with watershed storage though storage discharge relationships often experience hysteresis and are affected by factors such as antecedent moisture conditions and hydrogeomorphic controls spence 2010 in particular hydrogeomorphic characteristics influence the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of flowpaths across watersheds in regions with steep slopes and low hydraulic conductivity either surface water or shallow subsurface flow serves as a major flow pathway mcdonnell 2013 edwards et al 2015 however in low gradient landscapes water movement is often restricted resulting in high densities of lakes ponds and wetlands thorslund et al 2017 at the individual wetland scale hydrologic processes are also strongly linked to a combination of climatic and hydrogeomorphic controls cohen et al 2016 neff et al 2020 in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw inundation extents and water levels of giws have been shown to increase during wet seasons and decrease during dry seasons lee et al 2019 yeo et al 2019a further inundation extents of giws are strongly correlated with downstream discharges yeo et al 2019a in other giw rich landscapes like the prairie pothole region in the us and canadian midwest hydrogeomorphic features such as wetland size watershed storage and watershed position also affect hydrologic processes at the individual wetland scale hayashi et al 2016 evenson et al 2018 winter and labaugh 2003 hydrogeomorphic characteristics have considerable impacts on the hydrologic connectivity of giws with downstream surface water systems e g adjacent streams and downstream discharges hydrologic connectivity is defined as the water mediated transport of matter energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle pringle 2003 and giw connectivity hydrologic connectivity between giws and other watershed components is a critical nexus for research cohen et al 2016 management golden et al 2017 and regulatory alexander et al 2015 communities giw connectivity is facilitated by both surface water and groundwater flowpaths golden et al 2014 in the prairie pothole region giw connectivity is dominated by surface water flow due to low hydraulic conductivities van der kamp and hayashi 2009 slow groundwater flow ameli and creed 2017 and water table mounds neff and rosenberry 2018 however giw connectivity via groundwater was observed in an area that included an effective transmission zone within the prairie pothole region branne et al 2015 thus giws in that region were effective at reducing peak flow by storing p and snowmelt but giws exerted minimal impacts on modulating downstream baseflow ameli and creed 2019 evenson et al 2018 in the coastal plain of the cbw giws have strong interactions with groundwater philips and shedlock 1993 lee et al 2019 and thus connectivity between giws and downstream waters is facilitated by groundwater flowpaths winter and labaugh 2003 yeo et al 2019b both episodic and sustained giw connectivity via surface water flowpaths has also been observed after rainfall events and during wet seasons respectively mcdonough et al 2015 epting et al 2018 further previous studies using a hydrologic model found that a group of giws increased baseflow contributions to downstream discharges and mitigated peak flows increasing landscape resilience lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019b in this study we explore the relationship between giw water level and downstream discharges using gaged streamflow climatic data and daily water level from three giws located on the coastal plain of the cbw in this region previous studies have highlighted climatic forces as important drivers of hydrology at both individual giw and larger watershed scales fisher et al 2010 huang et al 2014 yeo et al 2019a in addition more recent work on this region has documented seasonal variations in connectivity between individual giws and downstream discharges mcdonough et al 2015 epting et al 2018 lee et al 2018 the specific objectives of our study are to i characterize seasonal drivers of giw and watershed hydrology ii explore the relationship between seasonal climatic forces giw water level and downstream discharges and iii identify different hydrologic responses between giw water level and downstream discharge at both seasonal and individual storm event timescales understanding how giws influence downstream waters is becoming increasingly important for the conservation and management of our water resources golden et al 2017 and this study provides the context necessary to better understand seasonal drivers of giw hydrology relevant across both the coastal plain of the cbw and other low gradient coastal plain landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study explored three giws within the greensboro watershed gbw upstream of the us geological survey usgs gage station 01491000 292 km2 fig 1 which is located on the coastal plain of the cbw fig 1 the area is characterized by a humid temperate climate with an annual average p of 1200 mm ator et al 2005 approximately half of p is returned to the atmosphere via et with the remainder mostly infiltrating into the shallow groundwater ator et al 2005 the gbw has relatively flat topography with an average elevation of 26 m above sea level and is dominated by poorly drained soils lee et al 2016 yeo et al 2019a major land uses within the gbw types include forested areas 48 and croplands 36 and soils with low hydraulic conductivities account for 75 of the watershed area due to an abundance of these soils drainage ditch systems have been widely developed to support agricultural production and this drainage system is known to be a leading cause of wetland losses in this region mcavoy and bowman 2002 jones et al 2018a according to the u s fish and wildlife service usfws national wetland inventory nwi geospatial dataset approximately 3000 natural wetlands are present within the gbw and more than 95 of these wetlands are forested the nwi wetlands occupy a significant portion 52 of the total forest areas within the watershed the total area of nwi wetlands is approximately 74 km2 accounting for approximately 25 of the gbw yeo et al 2019a we examined three wetlands from the gbw in this study the first wetland is relatively pristine wetland 1 and the two remaining wetlands were recently restored wetlands 2 and 3 the wetlands range in size from 0 4 to1 2 ha their drainage areas range in size from 2 5 to 5 3 ha and they range in mean elevation from 15 8 to 16 2 m above sea level the area draining wetlands 1 and 2 is primarily forest while the area draining to wetland 3 includes both forest and cropland in all wetlands the wetland invert is approximately 0 1 m lower than the mean perimeter elevation and the mean wetland slope ranges from 0 to 0 1 m m the three study giws were each 0 1 to 0 3 km from streams indicated by the usgs high resolution national hydrography dataset nhd see fig 1 and table 1 for more details wetlands transformed to croplands have been restored by the us department of agriculture usda through various u s farm bill programs including the wetland reserve program and the conservation reserve program lang et al 2015 wetland 1 was vegetated with native tree species while wetlands 2 and 3 were dominated by herbaceous species including sedges grasses and herbs yepsen et al 2014 this difference is likely due to short post restoration periods hydrologic conditions impeding the growth of native tree species and management practices by land owners yepsen et al 2014 2 2 estimating watershed scale climatic drivers at the watershed scale multiple datasets were used to estimate water balance components at the seasonal time step this study defined two seasons i a dry season from june to november a water limited condition resulting in relatively low streamflow and groundwater levels and ii a wet season from december to may an energy limited condition resulting in relatively high streamflow and groundwater levels fisher et al 2010 climatic seasonality was first characterized by computing the seasonal aridity index the ratio of pet to p pet p the aridity index is an indicator of water balance for example when the index is lower or greater than 1 et is constrained by available energy or water supply indicating high or low water balance respectively rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 daily p was obtained from the weather station closest to the gbw fig 1 operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc us1mdcl0009 missing data n 151 were filled in with the data collected at the second closest noaa ncdc weather station usc00187806 fig s1 daily pet was estimated using the hargreeves method with the evapotranspiration package guo et al 2019 within the r programing environment r core team 2019 input temperature for the hargreeves method was obtained from nearby weather stations usc00187806 see fig s1 in the supplementary material daily p and pet were aggregated into monthly values by summation and then into seasonal values by taking a mean average we also used the budyko framework to characterize climatic seasonality this framework was developed to evaluate mean annual water balance defined as the ratio of et to p et p as a function of the aridity index budyko 1974 to consider soil vegetation and climatic seasonality in the budyko framework budyko type equations have been developed wang and tang 2014 this study applied the modified fu s equation that considers water storage δ s as water supply in conjunction with precipitation to represent both et p and pet p for non steady conditions such as a sub annual time step e g monthly or seasonal or catchment scale wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2004 eq 1 water storage δ s for wet and dry seasons was calculated using seasonal p et and streamflow q as shown in eq 2 to generate the budyko curve using the modified fu s equation 1 et p 1 pet p δ s 1 pet p δ s w 1 w 2 δ s p e t q where p and w indicate precipitation and the impacts of other factors e g land surface and climate on the water energy balance daily δ s was aggregated into seasonal values similar to p and pet daily et was estimated at 5 km resolution using the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi surface energy balance model anderson et al 2007 based on energy balance principles alexi computes an evaporative flux commensurate with the observed rate of morning land surface temperature rise derived from hourly thermal infrared imagery from the geostationary operational environmental satellites goes collective model evaluation results indicate a typical rmse of 1 mm d 1 at the daily time step in comparison with flux tower observations sun et al 2017 anderson et al 2018 the 5 km grids were aggregated to the watershed scale over the gbw daily streamflow obtained from the usgs gage station 01491000 fig 1 was used to represent downstream discharges streamflow is a flux but was converted to a daily or seasonal volume in addition streamflow was converted to a depth by dividing by the watershed area daily streamflow was aggregated to seasonal streamflow for comparison with climatic forces seasonal and daily streamflow were used to detect contrasting hydrologic responses between giws and downstream discharges for daily comparisons common log transformed streamflow with a base of 10 referred to as log sf hereafter was used 2 3 data for hydrologic characterization of giw hydrology the usda mid atlantic regional wetland conservation effects assessment project ceap wetland is focused on assessing the effects and effectiveness of wetland restoration on the provision of wetland ecosystem services lang et al 2015 in support of this objective multiple wells and piezometers were installed at the lowest elevation of the wetland bottom to monitor surface water swl and shallow groundwater levels gwl of giws respectively at a high temporal frequency both swl and gwl were collected in wetlands 1 and 2 while only gwl was monitored in wetland 3 the wells and piezometer in wetlands 1 and 2 were installed to 0 9 and 3 0 m below the wetland bottom respectively the piezometer in wetland 3 reached a depth of 2 5 m below the wetland bottom water levels measured by well and piezometer pressure transducers are reported relative to ground surface with positive values indicating above ground surface sub daily water levels were collected from each giw all water level data were aggregated into daily values by averaging sub daily data before averaging sub daily outlier values for each day were excluded using the tukey method tukey 1977 calculated as indicated below 3 o u t l i e r q 1 1 5 i q r o r q 3 1 5 i q r 4 iqr q 3 q 1 where outlier indicates a sub daily outlier value and q1 and q3 indicate the first and third quartile of sub daily values respectively outliers were detected using the r program boxplot function and details on detected outliers for individual wetlands are provided in table s1 missing data points resulting from the malfunction of sensors were not used for analyses see table s1 for missing data 3 results to examine seasonal climatic drivers of giw hydrology and connectivity to downstream discharges analyses were conducted at both seasonal and daily time steps at the seasonal time step climatic drivers were examined using the seasonal average of water balance components e g p et pet and downstream discharges fig 2 to add further context to climatic seasonality the budyko framework was used to represent the degree of energy and water limited conditions across the study period fig 3 then we compared seasonal estimates of the aridity index to seasonal swl and gwl across the three study wetlands figs 4 and 5 at a daily time step we specifically focused on comparing giw water level to downstream discharges fig 6 both similarities in the time series figs 5 and 6 and potential differences figs 7 and 8 were investigated 3 1 seasonal variation water balance components a combination of p streamflow et and pet estimates was used to examine seasonal differences in water balance components fig 2 using previously defined wet and dry seasons fisher et al 2010 we found that p was fairly uniform across wet 104 16 mm and dry 119 26 mm seasons p value 0 1 from the wilcoxon signed rank test conversely et and pet were significantly different across wet 50 3 and 71 4 mm respectively and dry 92 4 and 113 4 mm respectively seasons p value 0 01 the same seasonality was observed from the aridity index 0 7 0 1 wet seasons 1 0 2 dry seasons p value 0 01 because the index is computed using p and pet this was also consistent with significant seasonal differences in streamflow 56 19 mm wet seasons 32 22 mm dry seasons p value 0 05 to further investigate seasonal differences at the watershed scale we examined climatic drivers using the budyko framework budyko 1974 fig 3 wet and dry season values were plotted on different locations of the budyko curve where wet season values generally plotted lower on the curve due to a lower aridity index this indicated that wet seasons are generally limited by energy supply i e pet p 1 whereas dry seasons are limited by water supply i e pet p 1 similarly seasonal differences were observed when fitting seasonal values to the budyko curve using the modified fu s equation fitted lines exhibited a greater parameter value w for dry seasons relative to wet seasons which suggests that dry seasons have conditions more conducive to et relative to wet conditions padrón et al 2017 3 2 seasonal variation in downstream discharges and giw water level to examine drivers of giw water level and downstream discharges we examined how these variables respond to changes in seasonal water balance components fig 4 a significant negative correlation between downstream discharges and the aridity index was observed r2 of 0 68 fig 4a the aridity index had a negative relationship with downstream discharges since a greater aridity index indicates high et and low water storage resulting in lower downstream discharges thus seasonal values of the aridity index were greater and lower during dry and wet seasons respectively the opposite trends were observed in the seasonal values of downstream discharges when dry seasons included large p events four red points in the middle left x value aridity index 0 7 and y value downstream discharges 60 in fig 4a dry season values showed a lower aridity index and greater downstream discharges than some wet season values however a strong correlation between the aridity index and downstream discharges still existed similarly a significant negative correlation between giw water level and the aridity index was observed r2 of 0 91 and 0 88 fig 4bc only gwl data from wetland 2 and wetland 3 were used for this analysis due to large amounts of missing data in the other time series data the observed variation was consistent with seasonal trends where relatively low water levels were experienced in the dry seasons from 0 2 to 0 03 m and from 0 75 to 0 27 m in wetlands 2 and 3 respectively and relatively high water levels in the wet seasons from 0 14 to 0 19 m and from 0 20 to 0 39 m in wetlands 2 and 3 respectively the 2009 dry season gwl in wetland 3 was greater than some wet season values due to unusually large dry season p in this year the red dot within a black circle in fig 4c we also explored relationships between seasonal measures of giw water level and downstream discharges fig 5 overall we observed overall increasing trends between the two variables the relationships between gwl and downstream discharges for wetlands 2 and 3 with downstream discharges produced r2 values of 0 60 and 0 52 respectively 3 3 daily variation in downstream discharges and giw water level variations in giw water level and downstream discharges were explored at a daily time step fig 6 exhibits swl gwl and log sf across the different time periods swls in wetlands 1 and 2 ranged from 0 3 to 0 7 m and 0 9 and 0 4 m respectively gwl varied from 0 9 to 0 4 m wetland 1 from 1 1 to 0 3 m wetland 2 and from 1 3 to 0 7 m wetland 3 as shown in the previous results giw water level and downstream discharges varied seasonally with high and low values during wet and dry seasons respectively the lowest daily giw water levels and log sf were observed during the driest season i e the most water limited condition over the monitoring period aqua shaded region wetlands 1 and 2 exhibited the lowest water levels during the first dry season 2016 fig 6ab corresponding dry season aridity indices were 1 1 2016 dry season 1 0 2017 dry season and 0 7 2018 dry season fig 2 wetland 3 also exhibited the lowest gwl and log sf during the dry season from june 2008 to december 2008 when the aridity index was highest 1 6 the relationship between giw water level and downstream discharges was explored at a daily time step fig 7 in general and as also shown in fig 6 there was a correlation between giw water level i e measured as swl and gwl and downstream discharges i e measured as log sf however there are different patterns as illustrated by the aqua magenta gold green and purple periods points highlighted in both figs 6 and 7 note the aqua magenta green and gold points in fig 7a d correspond to the periods shown as aqua sep 4th sep 18th 2016 magenta sep 15th oct 28th 2017 green aug 11th sep 5th 2018 and gold feb 1st feb 20th 2018 regions in fig 6ab respectively further the aqua and purple points in fig 7e correspond to the periods shown as aqua jul 11th dec 8th 2008 and purple aug 15th sep 30th 2010 regions in fig 6c details about linear regression models used to calculate r2 are shown in table 2 in figs 6 and 7 each group of colored periods or points showed an example of different archetypal patterns observed in the time series at wetland 1 and 2 swl and gwl rapidly decreased while log sf was relatively constant during the period of no rain days magenta sep 15th oct 28th 2017 and green aug 11th sep 5th 2018 points under the condition of long consecutive no rain days swl and gwl quickly decreased owing to exposure to immediate weather condition that promote water loss via et but log sf decreased at a relatively slow rate thus log sf remained constant relative to swl and gwl during wet periods highlighted with gold points in fig 7b wetland water levels experienced threshold behavior indicating surface water storage capacity had been exceeded and the wetland was likely spilling to downstream waters mclaughlin et al 2019 fig 8a is an example of this behavior specifically highlighting a time period during the wet season when downstream discharges increased but giw water level was stationary it should be noted that log sf and giw water level were normalized to have the same minimum 0 and maximum values 1 using eq 5 and then compared in fig 8 5 v a l u e n o r v a l u e m i n max m i n where valuenor and value are the normalized and original value respectively min and max indicate the minimum and maximum values of data the green magenta and purple points in fig 7 are prolonged periods with dry seasons during these periods we observed a faster reduction in giw water level relative to downstream discharges this pattern is particularly pronounced in fig 8b which corresponds to the aqua bar shown in fig 6b and aqua points shown in fig 7b the aqua points in fig 7 highlight periods of extremely low downstream flow the driest season over the wetland monitoring period during these periods downstream discharges receded faster than giw water levels fig 8c 4 discussion 4 1 wetland water storage and downstream discharges watershed storage or the amount of water stored between bedrock and the ground surface within a given watershed is useful for predicting complex rainfall runoff relationships e g spence 2010 mcdonnell et al 2018 quantifying spatial and temporal heterogeneity of flowpaths through watersheds e g harman 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 and improving our understanding of watershed scale impacts of land use and climate changes e g evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 gebrehiwot et al 2019 the hydrology of the coastal plain of the cbw provides a unique endmember for understanding interaction between watershed storage and downstream discharges as landscapes transition from high relief montane regions to low relief coastal plain areas they lose their ability to shed water and watershed storage in soils increases fan et al 2019 as an endmember along this continuum the delmarva landscape is defined by extremely low gradient topography and poorly drained soils koskelo et al 2018 further a significant portion of the delmarva s watershed storage occurs in wetlands fenstermacher et al 2014 jones et al 2018a thus it is unsurprising that a strong correlation between giw water level and other water balance components existed and in fact similar findings have been documented in other wetland rich landscapes like the prairie pothole region e g vanderhoof et al 2018 and the southeastern coastal plain e g liu and kumar 2016 we investigated climatic seasonality that drove variations in water storage at both the individual giw and the larger watershed scale in the context of the budyko framework fig 4 we highlighted that seasonal difference between p and pet led to a wet season that is energy limited i e pet p 1 and a dry season that is slightly water limited i e pet p 1 the dry season corresponds to the summer growing season when et increases due to both increased temperatures and transpiration from plants conversely the wet season corresponds to winter and early spring when et is limited by both temperature and minimal transpiration from plants during wet seasons the region experiences shallow groundwater tables elevated giw water levels and increased streamflow philips and shedlock 1993 fisher et al 2010 lee et al 2019 previous studies have documented surface water connectivity between giws and downstream waters during this time period as well i e mcdonough et al 2015 epting et al 2018 in addition to documenting similarities between giw water level and downstream discharges we also examined the periods when they are different fig 8 in particular we observed threshold behavior in giws during energy limited periods fig 8a greater giw water level reduction rates during dry periods fig 8b and greater reduction rates in downstream discharges during extremely dry periods fig 8c the threshold behavior is an important feature of low gradient landscapes like the coastal plain of the cbw and it leads to complicated surface water flowpaths often described by spill fill merge hydrology leibowitz et al 2016 vanderhoof et al 2016 mclaughlin et al 2019 once a wetland reaches its maximum storage capacity it spills to a downstream water body often the downgradient water body is another wetland if the spill point of the downgradient wetland occurs at a higher elevation than the upgradient wetland the wetlands have the potential to merge wu and lane 2017 conceptualized this merging pattern as groups of russian nesting dolls and described patterns of nested wetlands using hierarchal graph theory wu et al 2019 notably at least in our study region our findings suggest this merging inundation pattern can occur during wet seasons future research should explore their spill fill merge hydrology via overland flow path in this region using observations with innovative merging prediction techniques wu and lane 2017 wu et al 2019 to advance our understanding of giw hydrology we also observed a 1 day lag between maximum wetland water level and maximum streamflow this observation is likely due to a combination of several covarying factors including both the watershed size and thresholds associated with spill fill hydrology and storage discharge relationships it is well established that small watersheds respond faster to rainfall than large watersheds haan et al 1994 and the drainage areas of our study wetlands are three orders of magnitude smaller than the gbw further as described above once wetlands exceed their storage capacity they spill to downstream waters and wetland water levels increase at a much slower rate if any at all thus the timing of peak surface water export from wetlands is likely obscured in the wetland water level data during dry seasons giw water levels receded faster than downstream discharges fig 8b during these seasons surface water export from wetlands is minimal epting et al 2018 and water loss substantially increase due to direct exposure to high et conditions while downstream discharges mostly stem from groundwater during dry seasons thus the faster reduction rate of giw water level was likely due to a combination of increased et and water flux from the wetland to its surrounding upland groundwater jones et al 2018b recently highlighted the connection between upland et and giw water level in pine flat wetlands another low gradient giw rich landscape found in the southeastern coastal plain in this modeling exercise an increase in upland et led to decreases in both giw water level and hydroperiod more specifically the increased upland et resulted in lower upland groundwater levels resulting in increased surface water to groundwater exchange between the wetland and surrounding upland similarly mclaughlin and cohen 2014 documented surface water to groundwater exchange between wetlands and their surrounding uplands using empirical measurements further highlighting the role of giw connectivity in low gradient wetland rich landscapes found throughout the mid atlantic and southeastern coastal plain we observed that downstream discharges receded faster than giw water levels during the driest season in the observational period fig 8c during this period the rapid reduction in downstream discharges are attributed at least in part to a restriction of deep groundwater flowpaths during dry seasons groundwater is commonly used for irrigation across this region wolman 2008 and during extremely dry seasons groundwater pumping likely further reduces downstream discharges zipper et al 2019 the observed reduction in the downstream discharges was likely due to water demand induced by a prolonged dry period exacerbated by groundwater pumping 4 2 giw connectivity in the context of climatic drivers increasingly research cohen et al 2016 management golden et al 2017 and regulatory e g alexander 2015 communities require information about connectivity between wetlands and downstream waters an interdisciplinary research effort has mobilized to fill this critical knowledge gap alexander et al 2018 jones et al 2019 resulting in advances in our understanding of giw connectivity golden et al 2019 however continued research efforts are needed to more precisely characterize giw connectivity across regions that experience divergent hydroclimatic and hydrogeomorphic conditions this study quantifies linkages between giws and downstream waters more specifically this study found that seasonal climatic drivers play a key role in controlling hydrology of giws in the mid atlantic coastal plain it is important to note that this study did not explicitly explore hydrologic connectivity between three study giws and downstream discharges more precisely this study showed that these giws represent a small portion of the total watershed storage and then explored the relationship between wetland storage and downstream discharges this study showed how climatic conditions can control hydrologic connectivity in this region giws tend to be connected to downstream waters during wet seasons i e energy limited periods but giws tend to be isolated from downstream waters during dry seasons i e water limited periods climatic drivers play an important role in giw connectivity and water storage across archetypal giw rich landscapes for example the timing and magnitude of hydrologic connectivity between prairie pothole wetlands and downstream waters is strongly influenced by the annual snowfall cycle snow accumulates in the potholes throughout the winter and then spring snowmelt initiates connectivity between groups of wetlands and to downstream waters brooks et al 2018 evenson et al 2018 however these annual cycles are superimposed onto longer term climatic trends and specific to the north dakota prairie pothole region there are decadal long climatic drivers that lead to prolonged periods of drought and deluge thus both giw connectivity and water storage are tied to those trends vanderhoof et al 2018 in the southeastern coastal plain and as shown by this study giw connectivity and water storage are a function of the seasonal balance between p and et however these seasonal patterns are also superimposed onto long term climate conditions a recent modeling study suggests that giw water storage and connectivity will decrease under current climate change predictions due to changes in the timing of precipitation and increases in pet zhu et al 2017 5 conclusions this study explored the variation in giw water level and downstream discharges in the context of seasonal climatic drivers in a low gradient coastal plain landscape we first examined watershed scale water balanced components using gaged streamflow and climatic data using these measures of water balance components we observed two dominant seasons that drive this region s hydrology i an energy limited wet season from december to may and ii a water limited dry season from june to november then we compared these climatic drivers with both giw water level and downstream discharges at seasonal time steps a strong correlation was found between the aridity index pet p and both giw water level and downstream discharges finally we compared giw water level and downstream discharges a strong correlation was found between giw water level and downstream discharges at both seasonal and daily time steps however different hydrologic responses between giw water level and downstream discharges were also observed indicating local hydrologic processes affecting giw water storage specifically during wet seasons giw water level often exhibited threshold behavior giws filled to capacity and were spilling to another downstream water body during dry seasons giw water level often decreased at a faster rate than downstream discharges this trend can at least partially be explained by increased et in both the individual giw and its surrounding upland in the driest season opposite trends were observed where downstream discharges decreased at a faster rate than giw water level this can be explained by deep groundwater flowpaths restricted by prolonged dry periods lowrance et al 1997 sanford and pope 2013 ator and denver 2015 which may have been exacerbated by agricultural groundwater withdrawals our findings highlight the impact of climatic drivers on giw water storage and downstream connectivity at both wetland and watershed scales wetlands play an important role in watershed hydrologic biogeochemical and ecological function e g evenson et al 2018 and in the coastal plain of the cbw much of this function is linked to giws ability to store water at both the individual wetland and watershed scale jones et al 2018a lee et al 2018 qi et al 2019 however more work is needed to quantify the cumulative impacts of giws on downstream waters we argue these advances should be made in the context of total watershed storage emphasizing that wetland water storage is a non trivial component of total watershed storage in wetland rich systems while our study demonstrates climatic forces that control connectivity between individual giws and downstream discharges i e energy limited periods future research is needed to quantify the cumulative impact of giws on hydrologic biogeochemical and ecological function at watershed and landscape scales this information will be critical as researchers natural resources managers and the regulatory community continue to address large scale challenges such as land use and
