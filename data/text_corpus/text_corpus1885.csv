9425,with the growth in population over the past decades china s food demand has been increasing however crops are facing greater water stress with the rising temperature and increasing drought in future therefore identifying potential crop yield and its driving factors is necessary to ensure continued food production in the present study we estimated the potential yields of maize and wheat in china with and without water limits from 1985 to 2015 using a simple generic crop model simple we then investigated how climate factors temperature precipitation and solar radiation drove the spatial and temporal variation of yield gaps quantified as the difference between potential yields with and without water limits we found an increasing trend in the water limited yield gap of maize in northern china 3 9 4 3 kg ha 1 yr 2 and wheat in central china 2 6 2 4 kg ha 1 yr 2 the temporal trends of maize and wheat yield gaps in china were mainly related to precipitation and temperature however the spatial variation in maize yield gap trends was mainly related to the variations in precipitation whereas for wheat it was attributed to changes in temperature or solar radiation upgrading irrigation infrastructure and management techniques or spatially adjusting crop types could help closing the yield gap of wheat in some zones keywords yield gap yield potential climate change maize wheat 1 introduction the global population is projected to rise by over two billion people in the next few decades which will increase food demand foley et al 2011 smilovic et al 2015 however crops face water stress with the rising temperature and increased drought zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 which continue to increase in the future liu et al 2020 ye et al 2020 in addition the yield stagnation was observed in china chen et al 2017 grassini et al 2013 ray et al 2012 for example wheat yields have been stagnating in 32 3 of the area of china and maize in 32 4 of the area li et al 2014 tao et al 2015 thus the current grain production can hardly meet our food consumption ray et al 2013 sheng and song 2019 recent studies showed that some crop yields would effectively increase by 9 40 through irrigation mueller et al 2012 rosegrant et al 2009 siebert and döll 2010 wang et al 2021 therefore to ensure the increase in crop production exploring the crop yield gap caused by water limitation is necessary van ittersum et al 2013 currently maize and wheat china s main crops account for 57 of the total national food production csy 2016 however the crop yield gap between the crops with and without water limits ygw can reach up to 6 8 t ha 1 for maize in the northern areas and 4 1 4 4 t ha 1 for wheat in the northwest and southwest of china liu et al 2016 tao et al 2015 some studies have suggested that the increase in temperature and solar radiation can effectively improve the potential yield of maize in northeast china because low temperatures and solar radiation limit its growth liu et al 2017 however other studies have found that increased temperature and solar radiation induce drought and decrease maize yield under water limited conditions resulting in a yield gap increase bai et al 2019 li et al 2014 srivastava et al 2017 in addition rainfall can close the maize or wheat yield gap in arid areas without irrigation chen et al 2013a patrignani et al 2014 these different mechanisms are inconsistent across crops and climate zones in china and are still poorly understood chen et al 2017 liu et al 2012 therefore it is essential to explore the underlying mechanism for ygw across the whole country to increase crop yields at a national scale in this study we simulated potential yields with and without water limits for maize and wheat across china over the period 1985 2015 employing the process based general model simple zhao et al 2019 after assessing its simulation accuracy we investigated how ygw responded to climate changes temperature precipitation and solar radiation we aimed to answer two main questions 1 how does the crop yield gap change in time and space 2 how do the crop yield gaps temporally respond to climate change across china 3 how do the crop yield gaps trends spatially respond to climate change across china the results of this study can provide guidelines for the planting strategy adjustments in current climatic conditions 2 materials and method 2 1 data inputs and simple model optimization the datasets used in this research are summarized in table 1 the climate data used were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a temporal resolution of 3 h the dataset was the data fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis dataset and in situ observation data at weather stations he et al 2020 the agro zone data were obtained from the resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn based on climate similarity and provincial administrative divisions the data were used for regional statistics and analysis of crop yield changes liu et al 2014 2015 the planting area data used to map the crop distribution was 10 10 km and the data collection year was 2000 you et al 2014 the observed sowing and harvesting dates were interpolated into raster through the inverse distance weighted idw in addition all these raster data were registered in the albers coordinate system asia north albers equal area conic and resampled into 10 10 km spatial resolution since only the effect of climatic factors on water limited yield gaps in china was considered a simple generic crop model simple that can easily simulate crop yield regionally was used in the study the simple model simulates crop growth development and yield at a daily time step and considers the effects of daily temperature heat stress rainfall and atmospheric co2 concentration on yield zhao et al 2019 employing the simple model we simulated the potential yield yp and rainfed potential yield yr of maize and wheat at a spatial resolution of 10 10 km we collected data for 209 maize and 220 wheat sites from the agro meteorological experimental stations then the observed samples were randomly divided spatially into two equal parts half of the samples were used for model calibration and half for validation fig 1 to estimate the parameters in the simple model a grid search approach gao et al 2018 was applied and the initial ranges of the parameters were set according to zhao et al 2019 root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse were calculated to evaluate the model performance 1 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 2 rrmse rmse o i 100 where s i and o i were the simulated yp and corresponding observed yield at the sample i n was the total number of samples o i is the mean yield of the evaluation samples 2 2 crop yield simulation the potential yield yp and rainfed yield yr were simulated employing the simple model yp was defined as the yield achieved for a given crop in a given location with the optimal water and nutrient levels the yr was the yield achieved with the optimal nutrient level but no irrigation we then calculated the irrigated crop yield based on the ratio of irrigation the irrigation ratio showed the percentage of total area equipped with irrigation around 2005 in a raster with a spatial resolution of 1 12 produced by fao s global information system on water and agriculture siebert et al 2013 the ratio of irrigation is higher in eastern china and relatively lower in other regions fig s2 in this study the water limited potential yield ypw during 1985 2015 was calculated based on the weighted average of the irrigation area of yr and yp 3 ypw yr 1 i yp i where i is the ratio of irrigation in the given pixel based on the map of irrigated areas then the crop yield gap ygw was calculated as the difference between yp and ypw in this study we assumed soil factors and field management remain constant so that the change trends of ygw was only influenced by climate change 2 3 trend and attribution analysis the temporal variation in ygw from 1985 to 2015 was characterized using the mann kendall test and the theil sen median trend analysis to avoid the impacts of extreme climate anomalies huang et al 2020 a slope between 5 and 5 was recorded as stable slope 5 or slope 5 were recorded as slightly decreasing or slightly increasing p 0 05 and slope 5 or slope 5 were recorded as significantly decreasing or significantly increasing p 0 05 jiang et al 2015 the response of ygw to climate changes was examined using the partial correlation analysis between ygw and climate factors i e cumulative precipitation mean temperature and cumulative solar radiation during the crop growing season in addition to analyze the contribution of climate changes to the simulated crop ygw changes we assumed that changes in ygw collocated with significant changes in climate factors were attributable to climate changes we thereby first used the mann kendall test and the theil sen median trend analysis to calculate the change trends of ygw and climate factors over the past 30 years respectively we then calculated the areas for each crop trend type by summing the pixels showing a specified trend type in the crop planted areas a ygw within the area for each crop trend type we further calculated the areas where each climate factor significantly increased or decreased a both last we defined the contribution of climate changes to ygw change as the proportion of a both and a ygw huang et al 2020 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the simulated potential yields without water limits and the observed yields from the 209 maize and 220 wheat stations were compared fig 2 the comparison indicated that the simulations were reasonable for both maize rrmse 25 5 and wheat rrmse 26 7 the observed yields varied from 1 8 to 15 0 t ha 1 for maize and 0 2 12 1 t ha 1 for wheat the means of the simulated maize and wheat potential yields were close to their means of observed yields despite an underestimation in the maximum value and an overestimation in the minimum value table 2 3 2 spatial temporal variation of ygw in maize and wheat on average over the period 1985 2015 the potential yield yp and the water limited potential yield ypw for maize in china were 7 6 2 5 t ha 1 and 5 9 2 4 t ha 1 the yield gap ygw quantified as the difference between yp and ypw accounted for about 26 26 of yp fig 3a b spatially mean maize ypw ranged between 4 and 8 t ha 1 in more than 60 of the planting area whereas the mean ygw was 1 3 1 5 t ha 1 in contrast mean maize ypw was less than 4 t ha 1 in the northern and western agro zones while the mean ygw was as high as 4 8 2 9 t ha 1 fig 3a b furthermore the mean ygw accounted for 64 21 of yp in these zones the trends of the maize yield gaps over the study period differed across agro zones fig 3c on average the maize ygw increased by 0 9 4 6 kg ha 1 yr 2 nearly half 49 of the maize planted areas experienced an increasing trend in ygw over the period 1985 2015 and the significantly increasing area reached 5 of the whole planted areas these areas were mainly located in the northern agro zones where the increasing trends were 3 9 4 3 kg ha 1 yr 2 in addition significantly decreasing trends 4 1 4 0 kg ha 1 yr 2 of maize ygw were observed in the center of china accounting for 6 of the entire planted area we found that of all agro zones ssr had the highest percentage 61 of areas where the maize ygw decreased in contrast necp had the lowest percentage 29 showed a decreasing trend in the maize ygw fig 3d for wheat the average ypw over the period 1985 2015 was 3 8 1 5 t ha 1 and the yp was 4 8 1 9 t ha 1 the ygw was 1 1 1 1 t ha 1 accounting for about 23 19 of yp of the national yield fig 4a b from the detailed spatial distribution the yield gap in central and southwestern china was 2 2 0 9 t ha 1 larger than in other wheat agro zones they accounted for as much as 39 15 of the potential yields fig 4b in central china ygw showed the increasing trends of 2 6 2 4 kg ha 1 yr 2while in southwestern and northeastern china the decreasing trends of 2 5 2 3 kg ha 1 yr 2 from the scale of agro zones 81 of necp experienced a decreasing trend in ygw the highest percentage within each agro zone and 8 6 of lp lowest fig 4d the crop areas on the qinghai tibet plateau are not discussed because of their small size 3 3 temporal partial correlations between ygw and climate factors during 1985 2015 ygw of both maize and wheat were negatively associated with cumulative precipitation during the growing season fig 5a e i j for maize the mean partial correlation coefficient of the relationship between ygw and cumulative precipitation during the growing season was 0 31 0 48 correlations were negative for most of the maize planting areas and for 18 of the areas they were significant p 0 05 similar results were found for wheat the mean partial correlation coefficient for wheat ygw and cumulative precipitation was 0 39 0 48 the correlations for 31 of agro zones were significant p 0 05 in addition we found positive correlations between ygw and mean temperature or cumulative solar radiation during the growing season of maize and wheat in most agro zones fig 5 furthermore the partial correlations for ygw and cumulative solar radiation or mean temperature were weaker than those for the relationships between ygw and cumulative precipitation for maize the average partial correlation coefficients between ygw and cumulative solar radiation or mean temperature were 0 31 0 48 or 0 20 0 54 fig 5b c while for wheat they were 0 40 0 45 or 0 10 0 57 fig 5f g the ygw of maize wheat was positively correlated with solar radiation in necp nasr and hhhp most of the planting areas of which 18 22 of the areas were significant p 0 05 similarly the ygw for 20 of the maize areas and 19 of the wheat areas were significantly related to temperature p 0 05 based on the percentages of the areas with both significant ygw change and climate change in china we found that the highest proportion 29 of the areas where ygw decreased significantly for maize was located in areas with significantly increased precipitation whereas the significantly increased ygw was commonly located in areas with significantly decreased precipitation and significantly increased temperature figs 6a b s1a c furthermore as the maize ygw trend changed from significantly decreasing to increasing the proportion of areas with significantly increased precipitation declined from 29 to 4 while the area with significantly decreased precipitation increased from 0 5 to 13 fig 6a b however the proportion of areas with significantly decreased and increased ygw in significantly warming areas were almost the same 12 and 14 respectively fig 6a b for wheat the areas where ygw changed were always located in significantly warming areas followed by areas with significantly increased solar radiation figs 6c d s1e f the proportions of areas with significant warming increased from 15 to 41 as the wheat ygw trend changed from significantly decreasing to increasing fig 6d similar results were found for the areas with significantly increased solar radiation from 2 to 24 the proportions of areas with changes in wheat ygw were always higher in areas with significantly warming and increased solar radiation than those with significantly decreased precipitation fig 6c d 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the rmse between our simulated potential yield and observed yields was 2 0 t ha 1 rrmse 25 5 for maize and 1 5 t ha 1 rrmse 26 7 for wheat which are consistent with other studies wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 some other studies reported yield simulation accuracies rmse 0 9 1 1 t ha 1 for wheat or rrmse 11 12 for maize that were higher than in our simulations lin et al 2015 liu et al 2012 lv et al 2013 ye et al 2020 probably because small scale studies can reduce errors caused by climate variability and parameter adjustments overestimation and underestimation were found in our simulations common in the previous studies wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 on one hand the relatively small percentage of stations in the low or high yield areas might contribute to the bias we found only 5 and 6 of the stations for maize and wheat respectively distributed in these areas after defining the observed potential yields outside mean 2 sd as the low or high yield on the other hand the structure of the model reduced the spatial heterogeneity of the simulated yield specifically the relatively limited parameters and equations lead to lack of soil nutrient dynamics and a lack of phenology sensitivity to vernalization and photoperiod and some crop management practice such as sowing density or sowing depth are not included zhao et al 2019 to estimate the effect of the bias to ygw we assessed it by calculating the percentage of the bias to the observed ygw we found that the overestimation and underestimation of the maize ygw simulation resulted in a deviation of 11 0 4 4 mean se compared with 9 2 4 0 for wheat furthermore the uncertainty in model simulation is caused by the limited validation the limited observations and the model structure in this study 209 and 220 observations for maize and wheat were used for model parameterization and evaluation which may be an insufficient amount of field data and lead to uncertainty in the simulations the observation samples were fewer in the middle lower yangtze plain and southern china which also led to the simulation uncertainty in these two regions the simulated yields represent the yields under ideal conditions since simple does not take into account frost pest and disease impacts similarly to most other crop models zhao et al 2019 this could result in our simulated potential yield being overestimated by 5 21 compared to actual yield li et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 4 2 spatial temporal variation of ygw for maize and wheat over the past 50 years expansion china has relied on its croplands not only in the humid south but also in the arid north which accounts for more than 50 of total crop production ma et al 2006 you et al 2011 from the current whole spatial distribution ygw for maize and wheat varies greatly for maize we found that the yield gap was as high as 4 8 t ha 1 in parts of northeast china plain loess plateau and northern arid and semiarid region this is due to inadequate water with only 233 155 mm of accumulated precipitation during the growing season whereas maize requires about 552 912 mm of water for growing djaman et al 2018 zhao et al 2010 in contrast the yield gap was 0 1 t ha 1 in most southern regions because of the adequate precipitation in summer for wheat the largest yield gaps were distributed in northern and southwestern china consistent with previous work sun et al 2018 it was because wheat was planted in winter with less precipitation our study found that maize and wheat showed a large spatial difference results showed an increasing trend of maize ygw in northeastern china and north of huang huai hai plain consistent with a previous regional study tao et al 2015 while a decreasing trend in the central region for wheat the trend of ygw was increasing in huang huai hai plain and loess plateau chen et al 2017 while in northeast and southwest zones decreasing the disparity between trends may be related to climatic differences during the two crop growing seasons wang et al 2012 zhang and huang 2013 4 3 relationships between ygw and climate factors our study found that precipitation basically closes both the maize and the wheat yield gap across the agro zones especially in northern china however cumulative precipitation during the growing season 770 3500 mm increases the yield gap in southern china fig 5 probably because excessive moisture leads to anoxic soil conditions which limits root and plant function li et al 2019 van der velde et al 2012 in addition to the impact of precipitation on crop yield gap we also found that temperature and solar radiation were positively related to crop yield gap in most of the agro zones because of an increasing pressure on crop water demand through evapotranspiration fan et al 2016 in the northern regions the increase of temperature and solar radiation strongly aggravates the gap caused by drought in contrast temperature and solar radiation have no obvious positive or negative correlation with crop ygw in some southern agro zones fig 5 the abundant precipitation in the southern regions can offset transpiration due to increased temperature and solar radiation chen et al 2013a ye et al 2021 driving factors on the yield gap for maize and wheat differed spatially for maize ygw was mainly driven by precipitation especially in hhhp the significant decrease in maize ygw was mainly due to the significant increase in precipitation fig s3 and in necp nasr and lp the increase of maize ygw was due to the significant increasing in temperature other studies also reported consistent findings chen et al 2013b maitah et al 2021 waha et al 2013 although temperature and solar radiation affect maize ygw through transpiration the concentration and variability of precipitation during the maize season resulted in its dominance over maize ygw chen et al 2013a compared with maize the changes in wheat ygw was mainly attributed to significant changes in temperature and solar radiation in most of agro zones fig s3 it was due to the extremely significant increase in temperature and solar radiation along with low precipitation variability in wheat growing season 4 4 implications for planting strategy and future climate stress on ygw in this study we found that the maize ygw increased while wheat ygw decreased in northeast china plain necp and northern arid and semiarid region nasr therefore adjusting the planting strategy to reduce ygw should consider not only soil properties policy economics and field management but also the local climate conditions dharmarathna et al 2014 lu et al 2017 q wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 in addition an increasing trend of wheat ygw was observed in the agro zones of central china more irrigation and efficient agricultural water management strategies can be adopted to improve the production meanwhile more experiments are needed to explore feasible adaptive measures huang et al 2019 understanding the current driving factors of yield gaps clarifies the climate change effects on china s crop yields and their impacts on future food security in the future precipitation is projected to generally slightly increase and fluctuate greatly under each scenario during 2015 2100 however temperature and solar radiation tend to increase greatly under most scenarios kriegler et al 2014 riahi et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 which may further increase the impact of drought on crops then ygw of crops will be further widened especially under most scenarios which requires more water to mitigate the impact of climate change therefore a more scientific planting strategy or more effective irrigation methods are essential 5 conclusions these findings reveal the climate effects on the crop yield gap from both the temporal and the spatial perspectives the temporal trends of maize and wheat yield gaps in china were mainly related to precipitation and temperature therefore improving crop varieties water use efficiency is an urgent need to reduce yield gaps in a warmer and drier future different from the driving factor on the temporal scale the spatial variation of the maize yield gap trends was mainly related to the variations in precipitation while for wheat it was attributed to changes in temperature or solar radiation thus to reduce their future climate change induced yield gaps growing wheat or maize in some regions should consider not only soil properties policy economics and field management but also the future climatic conditions to promote its production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

face water stress with the rising temperature and increased drought zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 which continue to increase in the future liu et al 2020 ye et al 2020 in addition the yield stagnation was observed in china chen et al 2017 grassini et al 2013 ray et al 2012 for example wheat yields have been stagnating in 32 3 of the area of china and maize in 32 4 of the area li et al 2014 tao et al 2015 thus the current grain production can hardly meet our food consumption ray et al 2013 sheng and song 2019 recent studies showed that some crop yields would effectively increase by

these different mechanisms are inconsistent across crops and climate zones in china and are still poorly understood chen et al 2017 liu et al 2012 therefore it is essential to explore the underlying mechanism for ygw across the whole country to increase crop yields at a national scale in this study we simulated potential yields with and without water limits for maize and wheat across china over the period 1985 2015 employing the process based general model simple zhao et al 2019 after assessing its simulation accuracy we investigated how ygw responded to climate changes temperature

half 49 of the maize planted areas experienced an increasing trend in ygw over the period 1985 2015 and the significantly increasing area reached 5 of the whole planted areas these areas were mainly located in the northern agro zones where the increasing trends were 3 9 4 3 kg ha 1 yr 2 in addition significantly decreasing trends 4 1 4 0 kg ha 1 yr 2 of maize ygw were observed in the center of china accounting for 6 of the entire planted area we found that of all agro zones ssr had the highest percentage 61 of areas where the maize ygw decreased in contrast necp had the lowest percentage 29 showed a decreasing trend in the maize ygw fig 3d for wheat the average ypw over the period 1985 2015 was 3 8 1 5 t ha 1 and the yp was 4 8 1 9 t ha 1 the ygw was 1 1 1 1 t ha 1 accounting for about 23 19 of yp of the national yield fig 4a b from the detailed spatial distribution the yield gap in central and southwestern china was 2 2 0 9 t ha 1 larger than in other wheat agro zones they accounted for as much as 39 15 of the potential yields fig 4b in central china ygw showed the increasing trends of 2 6 2 4 kg ha 1 yr 2while in southwestern and northeastern china the decreasing trends of 2 5 2 3 kg ha 1 yr 2 from the scale of agro zones 81 of necp experienced a decreasing trend in ygw the highest percentage within each agro zone and 8 6 of lp lowest fig 4d the crop areas on the qinghai tibet plateau are not discussed because of their small size 3 3 temporal partial correlations between ygw and climate factors during 1985 2015 ygw of both maize and wheat were negatively associated with cumulative precipitation during the growing season fig 5a e i j for maize the mean partial correlation coefficient of the relationship between ygw and cumulative precipitation during the growing season was 0 31 0 48 correlations were negative for most of the maize planting areas and for 18 of the areas they were significant p 0 05 similar results were found for wheat the mean partial correlation coefficient for wheat ygw and cumulative precipitation was 0 39 0 48 the correlations for 31 of agro zones were significant p 0 05 in addition we found positive correlations between ygw and mean temperature or cumulative solar radiation during the growing season of maize and wheat in most agro zones fig 5 furthermore the partial correlations for ygw and cumulative solar radiation or mean temperature were weaker than those for the relationships between ygw and cumulative precipitation for maize the average partial correlation coefficients between ygw and cumulative solar radiation or mean temperature were 0 31 0 48 or 0 20 0 54 fig 5b c while for wheat they were 0 40 0 45 or 0 10 0 57 fig 5f g the ygw of maize wheat was positively correlated with solar radiation in necp nasr and hhhp most of the planting areas of which 18 22 of the areas were significant p 0 05 similarly the ygw for 20 of the maize areas and 19 of the wheat areas were significantly related to temperature p 0 05 based on the percentages of the areas with both significant ygw change and climate change in china we found that the highest proportion 29 of the areas where ygw decreased significantly for maize was located in areas with significantly increased precipitation whereas the significantly increased ygw was commonly located in areas with significantly decreased precipitation and significantly increased temperature figs 6a b s1a c furthermore as the maize ygw trend changed from significantly decreasing to increasing the proportion of areas with significantly increased precipitation declined from 29 to 4 while the area with significantly decreased precipitation increased from 0 5 to 13 fig 6a b however the proportion of areas with significantly decreased and increased ygw in significantly warming areas were almost the same 12 and 14 respectively fig 6a b for wheat the areas where ygw changed were always located in significantly warming areas followed by areas with significantly increased solar radiation figs 6c d s1e f the proportions of areas with significant warming increased from 15 to 41 as the wheat ygw trend changed from significantly decreasing to increasing fig 6d similar results were found for the areas with significantly increased solar radiation from 2 to 24 the proportions of areas with changes in wheat ygw were always higher in areas with significantly warming and increased solar radiation than those with significantly decreased precipitation fig 6c d 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the rmse between our simulated potential yield and observed yields was 2 0 t ha 1 rrmse 25 5 for maize and 1 5 t ha 1 rrmse 26 7 for wheat which are consistent with other studies wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 some other studies reported yield simulation accuracies rmse 0 9 1 1 t ha 1 for wheat or rrmse 11 12 for maize that were higher than in our simulations lin et al 2015 liu et al 2012 lv et al 2013 ye et al 2020 probably because small scale studies can reduce errors caused by climate variability and parameter adjustments overestimation and underestimation were found in our simulations common in the previous studies wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 on one hand the relatively small percentage of stations in the low or high yield areas might contribute to the bias we found only 5 and 6 of the stations for maize and wheat respectively distributed in these areas after defining the observed potential yields outside mean 2 sd as the low or high yield on the other hand the structure of the model reduced the spatial heterogeneity of the simulated yield specifically the relatively limited parameters and equations lead to lack of soil nutrient dynamics and a lack of phenology sensitivity to vernalization and photoperiod and some crop management practice such as sowing density or sowing depth are not included zhao et al 2019 to estimate the effect of the bias to ygw we assessed it by calculating the percentage of the bias to the observed ygw we found that the overestimation and underestimation of the maize ygw simulation resulted in a deviation of 11 0 4 4 mean se compared with 9 2 4 0 for wheat furthermore the uncertainty in model simulation is caused by the limited validation the limited observations and the model structure in this study 209 and 220 observations for maize and wheat were used for model parameterization and evaluation which may be an insufficient amount of field data and lead to uncertainty in the simulations the observation samples were fewer in the middle lower yangtze plain and southern china which also led to the simulation uncertainty in these two regions the simulated yields represent the yields under ideal conditions since simple does not take into account frost pest and disease impacts similarly to most other crop models zhao et al 2019 this could result in our simulated potential yield being overestimated by 5 21 compared to actual yield li et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 4 2 spatial temporal variation of ygw for maize and wheat over the past 50 years expansion china has relied on its croplands not only in the humid south but also in the arid north which accounts for more than 50 of total crop production ma et al 2006 you et al 2011 from the current whole spatial distribution ygw for maize and wheat varies greatly for maize we found that the yield gap was as high as 4 8 t ha 1 in parts of northeast china plain loess plateau and northern arid and semiarid region this is due to inadequate water with only 233 155 mm of accumulated precipitation during the growing season whereas maize requires about 552 912 mm of water for growing djaman et al 2018 zhao et al 2010 in contrast the yield gap was 0 1 t ha 1 in most southern regions because of the adequate precipitation in summer for wheat the largest yield gaps were distributed in northern and southwestern china consistent with previous work sun et al 2018 it was because wheat was planted in winter with less precipitation our study found that maize and wheat showed a large spatial difference results showed an increasing trend of maize ygw in northeastern china and north of huang huai hai plain consistent with a previous regional study tao et al 2015 while a decreasing trend in the central region for wheat the trend of ygw was increasing in huang huai hai plain and loess plateau chen et al 2017 while in northeast and southwest zones decreasing the disparity between trends may be related to climatic differences during the two crop growing seasons wang et al 2012 zhang and huang 2013 4 3 relationships between ygw and climate factors our study found that precipitation basically closes both the maize and the wheat yield gap across the agro zones especially in northern china however cumulative precipitation during the growing season 770 3500 mm increases the yield gap in southern china fig 5 probably because excessive moisture leads to anoxic soil conditions which limits root and plant function li et al 2019 van der velde et al 2012 in addition to the impact of precipitation on crop yield gap we also found that temperature and solar radiation were positively related to crop yield gap in most of the agro zones because of an increasing pressure on crop water demand through evapotranspiration fan et al 2016 in the northern regions the increase of temperature and solar radiation strongly aggravates the gap caused by drought in contrast temperature and solar radiation have no obvious positive or negative correlation with crop ygw in some southern agro zones fig 5 the abundant precipitation in the southern regions can offset transpiration due to increased temperature and solar radiation chen et al 2013a ye et al 2021 driving factors on the yield gap for maize and wheat differed spatially for maize ygw was mainly driven by precipitation especially in hhhp the significant decrease in maize ygw was mainly due to the significant increase in precipitation fig s3 and in necp nasr and lp the increase of maize ygw was due to the significant increasing in temperature other studies also reported consistent findings chen et al 2013b maitah et al 2021 waha et al 2013 although temperature and solar radiation affect maize ygw through transpiration the concentration and variability of precipitation during the maize season resulted in its dominance over maize ygw chen et al 2013a compared with maize the changes in wheat ygw was mainly attributed to significant changes in temperature and solar radiation in most of agro zones fig s3 it was due to the extremely significant increase in temperature and solar radiation along with low precipitation variability in wheat growing season 4 4 implications for planting strategy and future climate stress on ygw in this study we found that the maize ygw increased while wheat ygw decreased in northeast china plain necp and northern arid and semiarid region nasr therefore adjusting the planting strategy to reduce ygw should consider not only soil properties policy economics and field management but also the local climate conditions dharmarathna et al 2014 lu et al 2017 q wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 in addition an increasing trend of wheat ygw was observed in the agro zones of central china more irrigation and efficient agricultural water management strategies can be adopted to improve the production meanwhile more experiments are needed to explore feasible adaptive measures huang et al 2019 understanding the current driving factors of yield gaps clarifies the climate change effects on china s crop yields and their impacts on future food security in the future precipitation is projected to generally slightly increase and fluctuate greatly under each scenario during 2015 2100 however temperature and solar radiation tend to increase greatly under most scenarios kriegler et al 2014 riahi et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 which may further increase the impact of drought on crops then ygw of crops will be further widened especially under most scenarios which requires more water to mitigate the impact of climate change therefore a more scientific planting strategy or more effective irrigation methods are essential 5 conclusions these findings reveal the climate effects on the crop yield gap from both the temporal and the spatial perspectives the temporal trends of maize and wheat yield gaps in china were mainly related to precipitation and temperature therefore improving crop varieties water use efficiency is an urgent need to reduce yield gaps in a warmer and drier future different from the driving factor on the temporal scale the spatial variation of the maize yield gap trends was mainly related to the variations in precipitation while for wheat it was attributed to changes in temperature or solar radiation thus to reduce their future climate change induced yield gaps growing wheat or maize in some regions should consider not only soil properties policy economics and field management but also the future climatic conditions to promote its production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

2002 greenland et al 1997 the criticality ratio assesses water scarcity as a ratio of annual water use to total water resource availability it considers scarcity as the ratio of water withdrawals for human use to total renewable water resources among its limitations are the difficulty of distinguishing the amount of water that could be available for human use considering evapotranspiration return flows environmental requirements or the possibility of the society to adapt to water scarcity social water scarcity index swsi ohisson 2000 it reflects hydrological water scarcity in relationship to the social conditions of a country by dividing the hwsi by the hdi linking hydrological water scarcity to social conditions and it also gets rid of some annoying anomalies present in that hydrological water stress index water poverty index wpi sullivan 2002 weighted average of five components water availability access capacity use and environment the indicator has the advantage of comprehensiveness however it needs huge data system support and a large number of qualitative descriptions need to consult experts and wpi has strong regional characteristics water exploitation index wei wei eea 2005 circabc 2012 wei is obtained as the percentage of mean annual total demand for freshwater with respect to the long term mean annual freshwater resources wei is obtained as the percentage of mean annual total demand for freshwater with respect to the long term mean annual freshwater resources but wei has been developed to solve the limitations presented by the wei the index focuses on the assessment of net consumption and it is defined at monthly level green blue grey water scarcity index hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 ngo et al 2018 wsi is the ratio of the sum of blue grey and green water to the total water availability including surface water and groundwater resources blue water scarcity bws is defined per country as the total blue water footprint divided by the blue water availability in the country wsi revealed a potential applicability to sustainable water resources management corresponding to the proposed index the decision makers could determine adequate plans for initiatively using water resources bws has quantified freshwater scarcity only in terms of blue water for a complete picture of the extent of freshwater scarcity one should also consider the use and availability of green water and water pollution the future research should focus on the development of a complete picture of water scarcity including green water scarcity and water pollution levels over time agricultural indicators crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 1988 the cwsi was shown to be equal to 1 e ep the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration obtained from the penman monteith equation the cwsi is based on energy balance and fully considers the vegetation coverage of the underlying surface and meteorological factors such as ground wind speed and water vapor pressure it monitors drought from two aspects of soil moisture and farmland evapotranspiration it has the characteristics of clear physical meaning and wide application range agricultural water poverty index awpi forouzani et al 2013 in short the agricultural water poverty concept relates to quantitative or qualitative depletion in available agricultural water sources agricultural water poverty encompasses five components resources access to water use capacity and environment but there are basic differences in the definition of these components and the indicators used to assess them its most fundamental function is to take the poverty degree of agricultural water as the most important index affecting agricultural development agricultural water deficit index moursi et al 2017 the annual agricultural water deficit index it was defined as the performance indicator using basin wide annual water availability and irrigation water demand a higher it value indicates a lower agricultural water shortage and vice versa when it 0 no agricultural water deficit exists i e natural water supply meets the agricultural demand therefore the threshold of acceptable basin performance was set to it 0 green water scarcity index wsigreen shu et al 2021 wsigreen is the ratio of green water footprint to the total precipitation water resources it reflects the ability of crops to consume rainfall resources blue water scarcity index wsiblue it is defined as the ratio of blue water footprint to the sustainable blue water resource wsiblue measures the supply capacity of blue water resource availability in agricultural production grey water scarcity index wsigrey wsigery is the ratio of the grey water footprint to the difference between twr and cwf wsigrey reflects the ability of twr to absorb assimilated pollutants after satisfying the crop consumption water demand agricultural water scarcity index wsiag liu et al 2022 the wsiag was defined as a ratio of water demand to water availability in crop production it measures the extent to which the sum of green water and blue water availability can meet the crop water requirements such an assessment based on a comprehensive depiction of agricultural water scarcity would provide a better understanding of the potential impact of future climate change on food production analysis of the regional differences in

china corresponding author handling editor dr b e clothier china s agricultural water resource utilization contradiction is prominent and there are obvious differences in the distribution and utilization of water resources among regions the theory of agricultural water poverty is of great significance to promote the efficient utilization of agricultural water resources and alleviate the contradiction of agricultural water use however the definition of the existing agricultural water poverty theory is quite controversial and the mainstream agricultural water poverty index awpi for measuring agricultural water poverty has disadvantages such as complex index selection and lack of unified weights in this regard this research takes the lead in providing a more complete definition of agricultural water poverty with reference to the definition of water poverty in terms of method the research refers to the social water stress scarcity index swsi framework and proposes a new agricultural water poverty index from the two aspects of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability based on this index the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are analyzed the main findings of the study the agricultural water poverty index proposed in this study has rich connotations is easy to compare objectively between regions and is applicable in the field of agriculture the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are large the number of areas with serious agricultural water poverty problems is large and such problems last for a long time the distribution of agricultural water poverty in china has spatial autocorrelation rather than a random distribution china s relative agricultural water poverty index fluctuates around high values the gap in agricultural water poverty between regions has not narrowed and the contradiction in relative agricultural water poverty is prominent the occurrence paths of agricultural water poverty in different regions are different and the situation in different regions should be identified based on the scarcity of agricultural water resources and the development capability of agricultural production finally this study expects to improve agricultural water poverty theory to effectively alleviate the problem of agricultural water poverty in different regions and promote balanced regional development keywords agricultural water poverty index agricultural water scarcity regional differences relative agricultural water poverty 1 introduction water resources are related to human survival and development as well as social progress with global climate change and great social development the problem of water shortages has become increasingly serious and it has become one of the most common concerns in the world today naimi ait aoudia and berezowska azzag 2016 wang and zhang 2011 in particular the problem of agricultural water use has become a prominent problem in the process of water resource management and utilization seventy percent of the freshwater consumed by humans is used for agriculture balasubramanya and stifel 2020 and in some underdeveloped countries even more than 80 is used oliveira et al 2017 agricultural water shortages continue to hamper agricultural production operation and sustainable development and have become a major factor limiting agricultural output and the income of the poor rural population in many developing countries namara et al 2010 precise measurement of water scarcity is a prerequisite to effective resource management hussain et al 2022 the falkenmark indicator was the first indicator used on a national scale it calculates water availability brown and matlock 2011 hussain et al 2022 in addition the criticality ratio the water exploitation index wei wei and the blue green gray water scarcity index are all classic indicators for measuring water scarcity alcamo and henrichs 2002 greenland et al 1997 hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 eea 2005 these indicators all evaluate water scarcity from the perspective of traditional hydrology but ignore the water scarcity that may be caused by the limitation of socioeconomic capacity similar to these indicators in the evaluation of agricultural water scarcity jackson et al 1981 proposed the crop water stress index cwsi and liu et al 2022 proposed the agricultural water scarcity index wsiag in addition it also includes the green blue gray water scarcity index moursi et al 2017 shu et al 2021 etc these indicators play a certain role in evaluating agricultural water scarcity and promoting sustainable agricultural development forouzani et al 2013 rasul and thapa 2004 however they also ignore the constraints imposed by social competence in this context the social water scarcity index swsi links hydrological water scarcity to social conditions ohisson 2000 the water poverty index wpi proposed by sullivan 2002 extends the solution of water scarcity from the field of hydrology to the field of socioeconomics shao and ang 2007 based on the wpi the agricultural water poverty index proposed by forouzani and karami 2011 is applied in the measurement of agriculture since the concept of agricultural water poverty was proposed it has been developed and applied to a certain extent balasubramanya and stifel 2020 zhang and wang 2020 but it also faces many problems and challenges the first is that the concept of agricultural water poverty is not uniformly defined and different scholars have their own understandings of agricultural water poverty forouzani et al 2013 zhang and wang 2019 mehta 2001 noemdoe et al 2006 second the existing mainstream measurement method of agricultural water poverty awpi is constructed based on the wpi model forouzani and karami 2011 the wpi has huge data requirements and complex calculations and its application is hampered by its complexity and lack of information for some of the factors required for building the indicator on a large scale hussain et al 2022 rijsberman 2006 wang et al 2018 at the same time it is also highly subjective and difficult to compare between regions so it has thus far only been applied at the community level for pilot sites in a few countries liu et al 2017 therefore existing research urgently needs to fully define agricultural water poverty and propose a new measurement method for agricultural water poverty to improve the theory the contradiction in water resource utilization in china is very prominent and problems such as increasing water demand and the relative scarcity of water resources are becoming increasingly obvious liu and yang 2012 yu 2011 especially the problem of agricultural water resource utilization which has received more attention deng et al 2006 zhang et al 2022a 2022b the introduction of agricultural water poverty theory provides theoretical support for the efficient utilization and sustainable development of water resources in the agricultural production process and it alleviates the poverty problems of agriculture and farmers zhang and wang 2019 however there are significant differences in the distribution of water resources and in the agricultural and economic development levels in different regions of china the problem of inequality in water resource utilization in different regions is prominent and the contradictions between water resource management and utilization are also different he et al 2019 sun et al 2017 in this regard it is worth exploring whether there are significant differences in agricultural water poverty among different regions in china zhang and wang 2019 used the exploratory time space data analysis estda to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spatial pattern of agricultural water poverty in china from the perspective of spatiotemporal coupling and found that there are obvious spatial effects of agricultural water poverty in china therefore to effectively solve the poverty problem caused by agricultural water use in different regions and to achieve the balanced development of all regions in china the relative differences in agricultural water poverty among regions need urgent attention and resolution in this regard the research is expected to address the following two issues 1 how can the concept of agricultural water poverty be properly defined and the measurement methods of agricultural water poverty be effectively improved 2 how can the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china be analyzed the research will refer to the definition of water poverty and give a more complete definition of agricultural water poverty at the same time this study attempts to construct a new index for evaluating the degree of regional agricultural water poverty from the perspectives of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capacity and uses it to measure 31 provinces municipalities in china from 2003 to 2019 based on the calculation results the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are analyzed through the horizontal temporal and spatial distribution and a vertical comparison between regions the research provides a scientific basis for improving the theory of agricultural water poverty and realizing the effective governance of regional agricultural water poverty and has theoretical and practical significance for promoting balanced development among regions 2 definition of agricultural water poverty for a long time many scholars have had different understandings of water scarcity in the traditional sense water scarcity is the condition under which the water demands of agriculture and other economic sectors cannot be satisfied by water availability oki and kanae 2006 in addition many scholars have designed different water scarcity measures to characterize the degree of water scarcity liu et al 2017 cao et al 2017 however these definitions and indicators only reveal the degree of water scarcity from the perspective of traditional hydrology but most ignore the water scarcity caused by insufficient economic and social capability in considering the water scarcity problem caused by insufficient water resources and socioeconomic capability the water poverty theory has obvious advantages shao and ang 2007 the concept of water poverty is based on the definition by desai 1995 of poverty as capability depravation or by sen 1999 as a lack of entitlement the most commonly accepted concept today is the lack of capability to or entitlement to water cullis and o regan 2004 thus this study expects to introduce the theory of water poverty into agricultural production activities redefine agricultural water poverty and explore the problem of agricultural water poverty in this regard this study defines agricultural water poverty as follows in the process of agricultural production and operation residents lack the capability or entitlement to obtain agricultural water which leads to poverty in fact there are many definitions of agricultural water poverty and they are still under debate forouzani et al 2013 zhang and wang 2019 mehta 2001 noemdoe et al 2006 different from the concept of agricultural water poverty proposed by previous scholars our definition of agricultural water poverty makes up for two deficiencies in the existing research first we not only consider water scarcity in the traditional hydrological sense but also consider agricultural water scarcity from the perspective of social capability which is not covered by the existing definitions of agricultural water poverty second we incorporate the classical definition of poverty capability deprivation which will enrich the connotation of agricultural water poverty 3 methods and data 3 1 agricultural water poverty index since the concept of water poverty was first proposed studies on measurement methods for water poverty have emerged pérez foguet and garriga 2011 sullivan 2002 wilk and jonsson 2013 the most commonly used method is the wpi measurement method proposed by sullivan 2002 the measurement of agricultural water poverty also mainly draws on this method forouzani and karami 2011 however the agricultural water poverty index based on the wpi method has the disadvantages of a complex data system complicated calculation lack of uniform indicators and weights in the evaluation system and lack of objective authenticity of the evaluation hussain et al 2022 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the specific differences of different indicators will be developed in the discussion section by comparing the existing studies it is found that the social resource water stress scarcity index swsi proposed by ohisson 2000 has the advantages of strong objectivity and easy regional comparison and is the most easily understood indicator of social adaptability therefore this study refers to the structure of the swsi and combines it with the definition of agricultural water poverty given in the article to design indicators the indicators will cover agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability and thus we propose a new method for measuring agricultural water poverty the specific index framework is as follows 1 a w p i a w s i 1 a d i where awpi refers to the agricultural water poverty index awsi indicates agricultural water scarcity index adi stands for the regional agricultural development capability index the awpi has a uniform weight and can be compared between different scales and research objects that is under the same conditions of regional agricultural development capability the larger the awsi the more water scarcity in regional agriculture the more serious the regional agricultural water poverty problem in the case of the same regional agricultural water scarcity degree the larger the adi the weaker the regional agricultural development capability the more serious the regional agricultural water poverty problem 3 2 agricultural water scarcity index the agricultural water scarcity index was defined as a ratio of irrigation water deficit to water availability in crop production and is estimated by the following equation 2 a w s i a w d a w a where awd represents the agricultural water deficit cu m and awa is agricultural water availability cu m agricultural blue water availability is estimated by the following equation 3 a w a t w r i w u d w u where twr is the total water resource availability cu m iwu is water use for the industrial sector cu m and dwu is water use for the domestic sector cu m the amount of evaporation and transpiration that would occur if there were sufficient water available in the growth period of the crop is defined as the crop water requirement wr however that is not always satisfied due to water scarcity the gap between the actual water consumption and the crop water requirement is the water deficit for agricultural production awd this deficit reflects the degree of water scarcity the actual water consumption for regional agricultural production includes two parts the green water consumption gw originating from rainfall and the blue water consumption bw originating from conventional water resources during crop growth hoekstra et al 2011 the calculation method of water deficit for agricultural production awd is 4 a w d w r g w b w where wr is the total crop water requirement cu m gw is the total green water consumption in crop production cu m and bw is the total blue water consumption in crop production cu m the total crop water requirement wr is defined as the total crop evapotranspiration on arable land throughout the entire year 5 w r i d e t c i d a i 10 where e t c i d is the crop evapotranspiration on the dth day of the growth period for crop i mm a i represents crop i s sown area hm2 and 10 is a unit conversion coefficient cu m hm2 gw is calculated as 6 g w i d e p i d a i 10 where ep id is the effective precipitation on the dth day of the growth period for crop i mm the effective precipitation during the growth period of the crop is calculated in ten steps according to the method developed by the usda döll and siebert 2002 7 e p p 4 17 0 02 p 4 17 p 83 m m 41 7 0 1 p p 83 m m where p is the ten day precipitation mm bw is calculated as 8 b w i d m a x 0 e t c i d e p i d i a i 10 where ia i represents crop i s irrigation area hm2 for each crop et c was calculated by the following equation 9 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient of crop i which depends on the growing stage of the crop et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is calculated based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 3 3 agricultural development capability index the agricultural development capability index is based on the conceptual framework of the human development index hdi undp 1998 it is mainly used to measure the shortage or deprivation of agricultural production capability of agricultural entities in various regions the hdi originally included three indicators health and longevity knowledge and a decent life undp 1998 on this basis the united nations development programme has also developed the human poverty index hpi human poverty is an important concept to understand and define poverty from a multidimensional perspective zhang and fu 2009 according to this concept poverty is not just a physical lack it is essentially capability poverty the hpi originally included three indicators health and longevity knowledge and a decent life undp 1998 then in the human development report 1998 the united nations development programme defined the hpi 2 for industrialized countries or oecd countries zhang and fu 2009 hpi 2 adds social exclusion indicators to hpi therefore on the basis of the initial concept of the hdi this study introduces the ratio of the total power of agricultural machinery to the cultivated land area and constructs the adi with reference to the framework of hpi 2 1 1 note in the calculation of adi a 1 a 2 and a 3 are subject to positive normalization and a 4 is subject to negative normalization 10 a d i a 1 3 a 2 3 a 3 3 a 4 3 4 1 3 a 1 is survival or longevity expressed as the proportion of deaths before 65 years of age in a province municipalities excluding a 2 is knowledge expressed as the percentage of the illiterate population in a province municipalities to the total population aged 15 and over these two indicators reflect the health and education level of agricultural subjects in the region respectively jain and nagpal 2019 janez and pieter 2017 a 3 is the decent level of life expressed by the engel coefficient of rural residents in a province municipalities it reflects the living standard of agricultural subjects in the region ladi et al 2021 a 4 is the degree of agricultural development expressed by the ratio of the total power of agricultural machinery to the cultivated land area in a province municipalities kw ha agricultural machinery plays an irreplaceable role in the development of agricultural modernization houssou et al 2013 agricultural mechanization reflects the development of agricultural technology and the prospect of economic growth and the continuous development of technology is a prerequisite for realizing sustainable agriculture liu and li 2017 zhang et al 2022a 2022b therefore this index is used to reflect the development degree of agriculture in a certain area 3 4 spatial autocorrelation model of agricultural water poverty spatial autocorrelation analysis mainly reveals whether there is a significant spatial correlation and interdependence relationship between a certain attribute of a geographical spatial unit and its neighboring spatial unit this article mainly uses moran s i to measure the spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty the value range of moran s i is 1 1 an index greater than 0 indicates that there is positive spatial autocorrelation and the closer the value is to 1 the stronger the spatial dependence an index less than 0 indicates that there is negative spatial autocorrelation and the closer the value is to 1 the greater the spatial heterogeneity an index equal to 0 indicates that the attribute value is randomly distributed and that there is no spatial correlation xue and gao 2021 3 4 1 global autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty the study uses global moran s i to explore whether there is spatial dependence on the spatial attributes of regional agricultural water poverty xue and gao 2021 the calculation formula is as follows 11 i i 1 n j 1 n w i j a w p i i a w p i a w p i j a w p i s 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j 12 z 1 e i v a r i in the above formula n is the number of geographical spatial units in the study area awpi i and awpi j are the observed values awpi of a certain attribute of spatial units i and j w ij is the spatial weight matrix established based on the proximity relationship w ij of spatial units i and j s 2 is the variance in y i z is the statistic of moran s i normalization e i is the expected value of moran s i and var i is the variance in moran s i 3 4 2 local autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty whether there is a spatial association pattern in different geographical locations of the research area that is whether there is spatial agglomeration or differentiation in a local area is generally tested by the local moran s i therefore this study uses the local moran s i to analyze the local spatial aggregation of agricultural water poverty the calculation formula is as follows 13 i i a w p i i a w p i s 2 j 1 n w i j a w p i j a w p i 3 5 framework of the relative agricultural water poverty index water poverty theory is derived from poverty theory referring to the concept of water poverty this study defines agricultural water poverty as the lack of agricultural water capability or entitlement its essence also belongs to the concept of poverty sen 1976 thus relative poverty theory is still applicable to the concept of agricultural water poverty existing studies mainly discuss relative poverty measurement and governance for most regions of china agricultural water poverty is the main obstacle to regional agricultural economic development and due to the temporal and spatial distribution of water resources and the imbalance and disharmony of regional economic development there are some differences in agricultural water poverty among regions therefore it is expected that in research on the governance of agricultural water poverty the concept of relative agricultural water poverty needs to be defined then measure the relative agricultural water poverty and put forward its governance strategies the concept of relative poverty was first put forward by townsend 1979 he believes that relative poverty is based on comparison and deeper poverty after material satisfaction subsequently srinivasan and sen 1983 expanded the connotation of relative poverty on the basis of the theory of capability poverty put forward by sen 1976 combined with the existing definitions relative poverty is defined as the resources owned by an individual being significantly lower than the average resource level dominated by the social family or individual it usually does not depend on the actual living conditions of the individual but is closely related to the conditions of the reference group on this basis relative agricultural water poverty is defined as some regions in the social environment have lower power or opportunities for the utilization of agricultural water resources than the reference region thus they are in a relatively scarce state based on the concept of relative poverty relative agricultural water poverty theory draws lessons from the measurement method for relative poverty to measure relative agricultural water poverty the common measurement methods for relative poverty mainly include the average income ratio method and the median income ratio method luo and qiu 2021 this study uses the median proportion method to measure the relative agricultural water poverty of chinese provinces municipalities refers to the standards formulated by eu countries eu countries designate 60 of the median income of the whole society as the relative poverty line and sets the relative agricultural water poverty line standard as 60 of the median agricultural water poverty of the whole society in addition li and shen 2007 once constructed a relative poverty index to measure relative poverty which is a set of composite indicators that avoids some defects in ordinary measurement methods and is suitable for measuring the overall degree of relative poverty between regions in this regard this study will use the framework of the relative poverty index to construct the relative agricultural water poverty index rawpi to measure the overall relative agricultural water poverty in china 2 2 note the higher the awpi value is the more serious the agricultural water poverty which is contrary to the traditional relative poverty measurement to facilitate comparative understanding in the calculation of the relative agricultural water poverty line the awpi of each region is first converted into 1 awpi and then the measurement is further completed however the relative agricultural water poverty index was originally used to measure the difference in regional overall agricultural water poverty thus it is directly calculated by awpi after calculating the awpi this study considers the relativity of agricultural water poverty it uses the ratio between the weighted agricultural water poverty level of the 40 highest agricultural water poverty group and the weighted average agricultural water poverty level of the agricultural water poverty group below 60 to measure the relative agricultural water poverty level to facilitate the ranking and comparison calculation the reciprocal of the awpi is used to calculate the rawpi at the same time the ratio of the number of provinces municipalities that are located at 60 of the regional average agricultural water poverty level to the total number of provinces municipalities in the entire study is used to measure the relative agricultural water poverty incidence in each region and finally the product of the two is used as an index to measure relative agricultural water poverty the specific calculation formula is as follows 14 r a w p r 1 n i 1 n a w p i i 60 15 r a w p c 1 n m 1 i m n a w p i i 1 m 1 i 1 m 1 a w p i i 16 r a w p i r a w p r r a w p c rawpr rawpc and rawpi represent the incidence of relative agricultural water poverty relative agricultural water poverty degree and relative agricultural water poverty index respectively n represents the total number of provinces municipalities rank according to the agricultural water poverty index of each province municipality from low to high take the last 40 of the agricultural water poverty index group and m represents the overall ranking value of the provinces with the lowest agricultural water poverty index in this group awpi represents the agricultural water poverty index by province municipality the greater the rawpi is the greater the regional difference 3 6 data sources the study takes 31 provinces municipalities in china as examples limited by data limitations excluding hong kong macao and taiwan and all the indicators involved are the measurement of the agricultural water poverty index in each region among them the indicators used to estimate adi include survival or longevity knowledge decent level of life and degree of agricultural development the indicators used to estimate the awa include the twr iwu and dwu the data used in the above indicators come from the 2003 2019 china statistical yearbook educational statistics yearbook of china china demographic yearbook china population employment statistics yearbook china rural statistics yearbook china environment statistics yearbook and china water conservancy statistical yearbook the data used for estimating and decomposing the awd include the sown area effective irrigation area of crops precipitation data and meteorological data the sown area and effective irrigation area are obtained from the chinese national bureau of statistics 2003 2019 the precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center 2003 2019 the meteorological data for minimum temperature maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity hours of sunshine and precipitation are obtained from the china meteorological data service center 2003 2019 4 results and analysis 4 1 measurement of china s agricultural water poverty the research uses the newly constructed awpi and it takes 31 provinces municipalities and regions in china as examples to measure the awpi of each region from 2003 to 2019 then based on the division of the 7 administrative regions of china including central china east china south china north china southwest china northwest china and northeast china we draw a line chart of agricultural water poverty in corresponding provinces municipalities and describe the agricultural water poverty in each region fig 1 fig 1 h reflects the average fluctuation in china s overall agricultural water poverty from 2003 to 2019 it can be seen that the fluctuation of agricultural water poverty in china over the years is not strong and the numerical fluctuation range is between 1 0000 and 2 5000 for different regions fig 1 a shows the situation of agricultural water poverty in the four provinces of henan hubei hunan and jiangxi in central china the figure shows that the numerical curve of agricultural water poverty in henan province is significantly higher than that in the other three provinces showing an obvious fluctuating upward trend the problem of agricultural water poverty is serious henan province is an agricultural and populous province with a population of 96 4 million at the end of 2019 water for domestic and agricultural production and operations is in short supply the agricultural water poverty curves of hunan hubei and jiangxi provinces are relatively concentrated and the awpi has continued to fluctuate in the range of 0 5000 1 5000 over the years fig 1 b shows the agricultural water poverty line of the 6 provinces of shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui fujian and shandong in east china among them the overall agricultural water poverty curve of shandong province is significantly higher than the agricultural water poverty line of other provinces and the awpi value has increased significantly over the years the agricultural water poverty curve in anhui province is the second highest with strong volatility before 2014 the agricultural water poverty curves of the other four regions are relatively concentrated with consistent fluctuation trends all below 0 5000 shanghai has a relatively low level of agricultural water poverty in china the overall agricultural water poverty curves of the provinces in south china show a downward trend of fluctuation fig 1 c overall the positions of the agricultural water poverty curves of hainan and guangxi provinces are relatively high and the fluctuation trends are relatively consistent the agricultural water poverty curve of guangdong province is basically below 0 5000 and the severity of agricultural water poverty is relatively light fig 1 d reflects the agricultural water poverty curves of beijing tianjin hebei shanxi and inner mongolia in north china among them the severity of agricultural water poverty in shanxi province is significantly higher than that in other regions and the agricultural water poverty curve of shanxi province has shown alternating fluctuations over the years the agricultural water poverty in inner mongolia has been highly volatile over the years showing an increasing trend as of 2017 2019 the awpi value continued to be higher than 3 0000 in addition the awpi in hebei province is consistently above the 1 000 level the agricultural water poverty levels in beijing and tianjin are relatively low the fluctuation trend is relatively stable and the degree of agricultural water poverty is relatively light fig 1 e is the agricultural water poverty curve of 5 provinces in northwest china agricultural water poverty in gansu and shaanxi is relatively serious the overall agricultural water poverty curve in gansu province is above awpi 4 000 and the highest awpi is close to 8 0000 in some years although the agricultural water poverty value in shaanxi province has declined in recent years the overall problem is serious the agricultural water poverty situation in ningxia and qinghai is relatively close and the agricultural water poverty problem in xinjiang is slight the awpi in chongqing yunnan and guizhou in southwest china has strong alternating fluctuations fig 1 f the agricultural water poverty value in chongqing in 2006 2008 and 2011 was higher than 8 0000 and fluctuated around awpi 7 0000 in the 10 years from 2003 to 2013 and it has shown a downward trend in recent years the agricultural water poverty in yunnan and guizhou provinces is highly volatile the overall value is relatively high and the problem is more serious the agricultural water poverty value in sichuan province is relatively low showing a downward trend in recent years the problem of agricultural water poverty in tibet is relatively minor the agricultural water poverty curves of the three provinces of liaoning heilongjiang and jilin in northeast china are generally below awpi 3 5000 fig 1 g the overall fluctuation trend of the curve is relatively consistent and the severity of agricultural water poverty is relatively light on the whole the areas with severe agricultural water poverty problems in china s 31 provinces municipalities over the years are mainly shaanxi and gansu in northwest china yunnan and guizhou in southwest china and shanxi and inner mongolia in north china with relatively high awpi values among them the agricultural water poverty in shanxi henan gansu and inner mongolia has not been effectively improved in recent years and there is still an upward trend however the agricultural water poverty values in xinjiang tibet beijing tianjin and many southeastern coastal areas are relatively low and the problem of agricultural water poverty is relatively small according to the analysis results the agricultural water poverty status in different regions has a certain degree of regional differences next this paper analyzes the spatial distribution in the horizontal direction and the relative gap in agricultural water poverty in different regions in the vertical direction 4 2 spatial effect of agricultural water poverty 4 2 1 geospatial distribution to explore the differences in the spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in china according to the measurement results of agricultural water poverty this study further draws a spatial distribution map of agricultural water poverty in 31 provinces municipalities in china this study analyzes the relevant characteristics of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china from the perspective of the geographical spatial distribution and the results are shown in fig 2 this research draws a distribution map of agricultural water poverty in 31 provinces municipalities in china in 2003 2008 2014 2019 and the average year to analyze the regional differences and evolution of the distribution of china s agricultural water poverty from the temporal and spatial perspectives in terms of time trends with the passage of time the situation of agricultural water poverty within each region of china s 31 provinces municipalities has not undergone strong fluctuations and the number of regions where the problem of agricultural water poverty has worsened has not increased or decreased significantly the distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions in different years is basically the same as the distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions in china in an average year in terms of the geographical and spatial distribution there are certain similarities in the spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions over the years fig 2 a b c d show that the areas with severe agricultural water poverty in china are mainly concentrated in parts of north china northwest china and southwest china the areas with serious agricultural water poverty problems in north china are mainly inner mongolia shanxi henan shandong and other provinces along the yellow river basin those in northwest china are mainly gansu and shaanxi provinces and those in southwest china are mainly yunnan and guizhou provinces in combination with the average distribution map of agricultural water poverty in all provinces municipalities fig 2 c the average distribution is basically consistent with the distribution of agricultural water poverty in each year overall there are obvious differences in the severity of agricultural water poverty among regions and the spatial distribution of china s agricultural water poverty is characterized by low value regions surrounding high value regions 4 2 2 spatial correlation in the previous section the spatial distribution map of agricultural water poverty in china over several years such as 2003 and 2008 was drawn and the changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china were analyzed the results showed that there were certain characteristics in the geographical and spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china therefore we further explore whether there is a spatial effect of agricultural water poverty to significantly identify the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china this study uses geoda 1 8 10 arcmap 10 5 and other software as well as the method of spatial autocorrelation to further reveal the spatial distribution attributes of agricultural water poverty in fact there are few existing studies on the spatial characteristics of agricultural water poverty zhang and wang 2019 4 2 3 global spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty according to the univariate global autocorrelation model geoda 1 8 10 software was used to create a spatial weight matrix and through 999 random permutations the global moran s i of china s agricultural water poverty index awpi in 2003 2008 2014 and 2019 and the average year were obtained see table 1 table 1 shows that the global moran s i of china s agricultural water poverty in 2003 2008 2014 2014 and the average year is 0 1519 0 1662 0 1361 0 1132 and 0 1624 respectively and these values are significant at the 1 level the z values of the statistics of the normality hypothesis test passed the test and were statistically significant overall the table shows that the distribution of agricultural water poverty in china has spatial autocorrelation rather than a random distribution and this spatial correlation is negative 4 2 4 local spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty the global moran s i well explains whether there is spatial autocorrelation in the whole study area whether there is spatial autocorrelation in a certain area needs to be further analyzed by the local moran s i this study uses geoda 1 8 10 software to conduct local spatial autocorrelation analysis on the distribution of water poverty in china and obtains the local moran s i scatter plot of each region for 2003 2008 2015 2019 and the average year as shown in fig 3 there are four quadrants in the scatter plot the first to fourth quadrants represent four types of clustering trends high high h h low high l h low low l l and high low h l the regional attribute values in the first and third quadrants are positively correlated with the surrounding regional attribute values and the regional attribute values in the second and fourth quadrants are negatively correlated with the surrounding regional attribute values fig 3 shows that in the scatter plot for 2003 2008 and 2015 the corresponding points of most provinces municipalities fall in quadrants 2 and 4 indicating that there is negative spatial autocorrelation in agricultural water poverty in most areas the corresponding points in some areas fall in the third quadrant indicating that there is a positive spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty in these areas to further analyze the spatial agglomeration characteristics of agricultural water poverty among chinese provinces municipalities this study uses arcmap 10 5 to map the local spatial autocorrelation agglomeration of agricultural water poverty in chinese provinces municipalities in 2003 2008 2015 2019 and the average year the feature distribution is shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that overall the spatial correlation pattern of agricultural water poverty in very few regions of china has changed to a certain extent over the years while the spatial correlation pattern of agricultural water poverty in most regions has remained basically unchanged from 2003 2019 the number of regions with significant spatial correlation effects of agricultural water poverty did not change significantly with only the yunnan region and the guangxi region moving from the initial h l correlation mode and the l l correlation mode respectively to a state of random distribution at the same time the spatial correlation pattern of agricultural water poverty within each region has basically remained unchanged for a long time and only some regions have experienced significant changes in the spatial correlation pattern over time sichuan province changed from the l l correlation mode to the h l correlation mode and finally changed to the l l correlation mode again in the average year the agricultural water poverty correlation mode was h l henan province underwent a fluctuation change from the h h correlation model to a random distribution and then from the h l correlation model to a random distribution jilin and beijing experienced a change from the l h correlation pattern to a random distribution shandong province experienced a change in correlation pattern from l h to h h and then to l h inner mongolia and liaoning experienced a dynamic change from the initial l h correlation pattern to the final h h correlation pattern in addition tibet xinjiang zhejiang shanghai fujian jiangxi anhui jiangsu hebei and tianjin have been in the l h spatial correlation mode for a long time shaanxi shanxi gansu and chongqing have been in the h l correlation mode for a long time ningxia hubei and qinghai have long been in the l l spatial correlation mode however heilongjiang guizhou and hunan have had no significant spatial correlation for a long time and they are in a state of random distribution comparing the changes in the spatial correlation patterns of agricultural water poverty in different regions over the years with the changes in the spatial correlation patterns of agricultural water poverty in different regions in an average year this study finds that there is a significant spatial agglomeration effect in most regions and that the spatial correlation patterns in most regions remain unchanged for a long time the changes in the spatial correlation pattern of regional agricultural water poverty are related not only to a regions own agricultural water poverty status but also to the change in the agricultural water poverty correlation pattern in neighboring regions combined with the results of the spatial agglomeration distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions in the average year the provinces with the l l correlation model are mainly ningxia hubei and qinghai the agricultural water poverty coefficient in these regions is low and the severity of agricultural water poverty in each region is light the regions with the spatial correlation pattern of h l mainly include shaanxi gansu shanxi henan and chongqing the agricultural water poverty coefficient values in these regions are relatively large and the agricultural water poverty degree is serious the surrounding areas including ningxia qinghai hubei and sichuan have relatively low levels of agricultural water poverty one province has the h h agricultural water poverty correlation model inner mongolia which is under the relative agricultural water poverty line the agricultural water poverty coefficient is high and the problem of agricultural water poverty is more serious it is surrounded by areas with equally serious agricultural water poverty problems such as gansu shaanxi shanxi and henan hebei jiangsu zhejiang shanghai and fujian are in the l h spatial correlation pattern and their own agricultural water poverty levels are relatively low while those in adjacent areas are relatively high from the perspective of the geospatial distribution except for some areas in south china there is a significant spatial agglomeration effect in most areas of china showing a spatial distribution characterized by high value areas surrounded by low value areas at the same time the spatial characteristics of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china are related to their own agricultural water poverty levels and the impact of agricultural water poverty in adjacent areas overall through the spatial autocorrelation analysis of the agricultural water poverty coefficient of china s provinces municipalities it is found that in addition to the negative global spatial autocorrelation effect there is obvious spatial heterogeneity among regions the results are similar to those of zhang and wang 2019 therefore in the process of expecting to achieve effective governance of agricultural water poverty the impact of spatial heterogeneity needs to be carefully considered 4 3 relative agricultural water poverty the study reveals the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china from a horizontal perspective by mapping the geographical and spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty over multiple years and using analysis methods such as spatial autocorrelation analysis however from a vertical perspective the comparison of the differences in agricultural water poverty among different regions in china has not been well realized specifically which areas belong to the areas with relatively severe agricultural water poverty by what standard is judgment made in recent years has the relative agricultural water poverty gap between whole regions widened or narrowed or have there been no significant changes these issues need to be urgently addressed on this basis this research draws on relative poverty theory to propose the concept of relative agricultural water poverty to resolve the problem of regional differences caused by agricultural water poverty in the difference measurement of relative agricultural water poverty this research draws lessons from the general measurement method for relative poverty and uses the median income ratio method to compare the differences in relative agricultural water poverty among different regions in china luo and qiu 2021 to judge which regions in china have been below the relative agricultural water poverty line over the years the results obtained are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that among 31 provinces municipalities in china there are obviously areas below the relative agricultural water poverty line which means that the problem of relative agricultural water poverty caused by the difference in agricultural water poverty in different regions persists from 2003 2019 areas in relative agricultural water poverty included yunnan chongqing gansu shanxi hanan guizhou shanxi jiangxi shandong liaoning inner mongolia jilin hainan heilongjiang guangxi and sichuan for a total of 16 provinces from 2015 2019 the provinces municipalities that were below the relative agricultural water poverty line were mainly henan gansu yunnan inner mongolia chongqing shanxi and shaanxi since 2003 the areas below the relative agricultural water poverty line in recent years have been changing to a certain extent on the one hand intuitively the number of areas below the relative water poverty line fluctuates slightly but overall the degree of change in most regions is not obvious yunnan shaanxi shanxi gansu and henan have always been areas with relatively serious agricultural water poverty the findings also indirectly show that china s relative agricultural water poverty has not improved in a practical sense over the years on the other hand based on the relative values of agricultural water poverty in various provinces municipalities over the years the agricultural water poverty gap between regions has basically remained above 5 0000 and this gap has not been significantly narrowed in recent years the standard poverty line fluctuates between 0 5000 and 0 6000 which shows that there is an enormous gap in agricultural water poverty between regions and that the regional differences are obvious similar to the concept of relative poverty the relativity of agricultural water poverty also cannot be eliminated what can be done as much as possible is to narrow the gap between regions in agricultural water poverty so that the regions at a disadvantage in terms of agricultural water poverty can be further improved thereby improving the overall agricultural water poverty situation to solve the third problem raised at the beginning of this subsection this research calculates china s rawpi over the years based on the constructed rawpi model to analyze the overall variation in agricultural water poverty among different regional situations the results are shown in fig 5 in fig 5 the rawpi has been at a high level over the years indicating that there is a large gap in agricultural water poverty among regions according to the trendline there is a slight overall downward trend in the rawpi however in recent years the rawpi curve has continued to fluctuate steadily around rawpi 4 000 indicating that china s relative agricultural water poverty has not been significantly improved and that the relative gap in agricultural water poverty between regions is still large china s overall average rawpi is 5 1424 in 2003 the rawpi was 4 3362 as of 2019 it was 4 4146 and in 2006 and 2011 it reached high values of 7 1624 and 7 5423 respectively over the years the rawpi has never shown a continuous monotonically decreasing trend among the years the high value of the rawpi in 2006 is closely related to the high value of agricultural water poverty in chongqing in 2006 the chongqing area suffered from once in a century extremely high temperatures and dry weather hao et al 2007 this persistent dry weather increased the water gap between agricultural production and operation irrigation in chongqing and the scarcity of water resources increased aggravating regional agricultural water poverty additionally the relative degree of interregional agricultural water poverty increased the reason for the relatively high rawpi in 2011 is that the agricultural water poverty problem in guizhou and chongqing was severe in this year as the root cause extremely dry weather occurred in southwest china in 2011 guizhou chongqing yunnan and other places were significantly affected by dry weather which involved less precipitation and serious evaporation resulting in a shortage of water for agricultural production the increasing scarcity of water resources the serious problem of regional agricultural water poverty and a change in the overall relative water poverty situation in the region china is relatively vulnerable to agricultural water poverty and is easily affected by extremely dry weather therefore it is worth considering the impact of early warnings of extreme weather on agricultural water poverty the study proposes the concept of relative agricultural water poverty and refers to the measurement method for relative poverty to accurately measure the areas under the agricultural water poverty line in china over the years the regions with large differences in agricultural water poverty in china are accurately identified vertically by a quantitative method at the same time through horizontal geospatial description and spatial autocorrelation analysis this study easily finds that there are obvious regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china that show certain spatial distribution characteristics the analysis of the spatial differences in agricultural water poverty indicates the direction for the effective realization of the governance of agricultural water poverty in key and difficult areas 5 discussion this research innovated the measurement method for agricultural water poverty carried out the measurement time and space distribution analysis of agricultural water poverty in 31 regions of china and defined and measured relative agricultural water poverty an overall analysis of the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in 31 provinces municipalities in china was conducted however this research still has the following issues that warrant further discussion 1 the research successfully constructed the awpi and applied it for analysis however compared with the existing classic water scarcity indices and related agricultural water scarcity indices what are the salient features of this index and how is it applicable 2 according to the application results of the awpi there are serious agricultural water poverty problems in many regions including shanxi gansu and yunnan while the agricultural water poverty problems in zhejiang jiangsu tianjin and other regions are mild showing obvious regional differences in this regard it is of theoretical and practical significance to analyze the causes of agricultural water poverty in regions with large differences by combining the constitutive mechanism of the awpi model 3 this study defines relative agricultural water poverty according to the relevant measures of relative agricultural water poverty it is found that there are many regions in china that have been in relative agricultural water poverty for a long time with large regional gaps and serious problems therefore how can the relative governance of agricultural water poverty be effectively realized these issues require further discussion 5 1 comparison with other water scarcity indicators water scarcity has increasingly become the focus of today s society oki and kanae 2006 on this basis a large number of indicators for evaluating water scarcity have been proposed liu et al 2017 moursi et al 2017 in table 3 the study reviewed 6 general indicators and 5 indicators used to assess agricultural water scarcity among the general indicators falkenmark s indicator criticality ratio water exploitation index wei wei and blue green gray water scarcity index evaluate water scarcity from a traditional hydrological perspective the social water scarcity index swsi and water poverty index wpi include factors such as socioeconomic capacity in evaluating water scarcity among the five indicators for assessing agricultural water scarcity the crop water stress index cwsi is mainly used for drought monitoring the blue green gray water scarcity index and the agricultural water poverty index awpi are proposed based on the blue green gray water scarcity index and water poverty index wpi in general indicators and are suitable for the agricultural field meanwhile liu et al 2022 and moursi et al 2017 proposed the agricultural water scarcity index wsiag and the agricultural water deficit index respectively which were specifically used to assess the degree of agricultural water scarcity compared with the above indicators the agricultural water poverty indicator proposed in this study has the following four features 1 the awpi proposed by the study introduces indicators such as socioeconomic capacity which are different from traditional agricultural water scarcity indicators this means that it is not only the concept of hydrology but also has the connotation of poverty 2 the awpi proposed by the study places the evaluation perspective on the agricultural field and at the same time shapes the awpi framework from the two aspects of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability although the research refers to the structure of the swsi in the index design it is quite different from the specific content of the indicators involved in the swsi 3 the awpi proposed by the research has certain novelty in numerator design the study uses the ratio of irrigation water deficit to water available in crop production to characterize the agricultural water scarcity index among them agricultural water deficit awd is a gap indicator compared with the etc proposed by liu et al 2022 and the blue and green water consumption used by shu et al 2021 as the index numerator awd considers more comprehensive content in addition the awd index involves planting structure and crop irrigation which means that it takes into account changes in the adaptability of agricultural entities under water scarcity situations this will help to enrich the connotation of awpi 4 the proposed awpi by the research has the characteristics of convenient calculation and convenient data acquisition at the same time different from wpi awpi the proposed awpi also has an objective and unified weighting system which makes it easier to make intuitive comparisons between different regions 5 2 decomposition of the agricultural water poverty index according to the calculation results of the awpi and rawpi of 31 provinces municipalities in china there are obvious agricultural water poverty problems in some regions of china and there are large gaps in agricultural water poverty among different regions in this regard based on the internal logic of the awpi we decompose it based on its composition discuss in depth the practical factors affecting agricultural water poverty in these areas and indirectly confirm the reliability of the awpi proposed by research and innovation due to the large number of study areas for the sake of concision this study selects gansu shanxi jiangsu zhejiang liaoning and other regions for comparative discussion the agricultural water poverty issues in gansu and shanxi have been highlighted over the years the jiangsu and zhejiang regions have been ranked low in agricultural water poverty and have stable awpi values over the years liaoning fluctuates above and below the standard agricultural water poverty line regions with different agricultural water poverty conditions are selected to make the study representative fig 6 shows the changes in the adi of the five provinces of shanxi gansu zhejiang jiangsu and liaoning overall the adi curve of gansu province is the highest around the range of adi 0 7000 and the adi curve of zhejiang is the lowest the adi curve of liaoning province was close to that of shanxi before 2009 and then showed an increasing trend second only to the adi curve of gansu shanxi and jiangsu have alternated since 2016 the adi curve of shanxi surpassed that of jiangsu and the adi curve of jiangsu province remained within the range of adi 0 3000 that is from the perspective of agricultural development capability the agricultural development capability of zhejiang is obviously stronger than that of gansu shanxi liaoning and jiangsu and the agricultural development capability of gansu province is generally poor agricultural machinery plays an irreplaceable role in agricultural modernization houssou et al 2013 the ratio between the total power of agricultural machinery and the cultivated land area reflects the degree of development of agricultural production well as of 2019 the total power of agricultural machinery in gansu province had reached 2 1740 107 kw which is relatively large but the ratio of the total power of agricultural machinery to the cultivated land area was only 4 1730 kw ha far below the national average the ratios in liaoning and shanxi provinces are also relatively low 4 5420 and 3 9220 respectively while the ratios in jiangsu and zhejiang are relatively high 12 4997 and 14 7853 respectively based on this indicator gansu shanxi and liaoning have low levels of agricultural mechanization while jiangsu and zhejiang have relatively high levels of agricultural mechanization considering the economic structure of rural households in china s rural areas the volume of the agricultural labor force and the quality of the labor force the mortality rate of people under 60 in rural areas in gansu liaoning and jiangsu provinces was relatively high accounting for 6 04 6 02 and 5 84 in 2019 respectively the illiteracy rates were 14 85 2 63 and 7 19 respectively judging by the adi alone gansu has the worst agricultural development capability liaoning shanxi and jiangsu are relatively low and zhejiang has better development based on the analysis of the degree of agricultural water scarcity fig 7 the curve of the degree of agricultural water scarcity in shanxi and gansu provinces is significantly higher than that in liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang provinces indicating that from the perspective of agricultural water resource availability the situation in jiangsu and zhejiang is the best before 2011 the awsi in shanxi province was the largest from 2005 2011 the awsi in shanxi province fluctuated and decreased after 2011 the awsi in shanxi and gansu alternated however the degree of agricultural water scarcity in the liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang areas is relatively low the awsi curve of the liaoning area is generally higher than that of the jiangsu and zhejiang areas close to awsi 0 5000 the awsi curves of the jiangsu and zhejiang areas are very close and the overall curve is lower than awsi 0 5000 in 2019 the water available for agriculture in gansu province was close to 9 1700 109 cu m but the demand for agricultural irrigation water was as high as 1 3137 1010 cu m the water available for agriculture in shanxi province was 4 8700 109 cu m and the demand for agricultural irrigation water was 8 9360 109 cu m reflecting an enormous gap between supply and demand the agricultural water available in liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang all meet the demand for agricultural irrigation water from the perspective of supply and demand with regard to the relative awsi gansu and shanxi provinces are extremely deficient while the liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang regions have a relatively low awsi and a strong availability of agricultural water resources based on the average awpi of all regions the awpi is ranked as follows gansu shanxi liaoning jiangsu zhejiang according to the results of the index decomposition for the regions exemplified in this study there are three main paths leading to the occurrence of agricultural water poverty in various regions the first is mainly due to the lack of agricultural water resources shanxi the second is due to both water scarcity and insufficient capability for agricultural development gansu and the third is mainly due to the weak agricultural development capability liaoning finally the lack of agricultural water entitlement leads to agricultural water poverty in reality the climatic and environmental conditions economic conditions and resource endowments of different regions are different which makes the path of occurrence of agricultural water poverty different and also leads to regional differences in agricultural water poverty across china for example gansu is located in an arid and semiarid area with a large regional span and the distribution of water resources within the region is not coordinated in 2019 the total water resources in gansu were 3 2590 1010 cu m and the total per capita water resources were 1233 5000 cu m limited by climatic conditions agricultural production in gansu province requires a large amount of water and water resources have become an important factor restricting the development of regional agricultural industries shanxi province is located in the northern part of the yellow river basin and is a major province with heavy industrial development the overall water resources are in a state of shortage in 2019 the total water resources were 9 7300 109 cu m and the total per capita water resources were only 261 3000 cu m the water supply structure is irrational regardless of whether it is domestic water or agricultural production water water resources are very tight therefore facing the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in various regions of china we should realize that the occurrence of agricultural water poverty in different regions may have different paths and we should identify agricultural water poverty in combination with the scarcity of regional agricultural water resources and the development capacity of agricultural production to judge the seriousness of regional agricultural water poverty and ultimately realize the effective governance of agricultural water poverty in various regions at the same time the research and analysis results and discussion also indirectly explain the rationality of the awpi innovatively constructed in this study 5 3 relative agricultural water poverty governance based on relative poverty theory this research defines and measures relative agricultural water poverty the results show that the change trend of the rawpi of china is not obvious the differences in agricultural water poverty among regions are very large and some regions of china are still in the dilemma of relative agricultural water poverty therefore it is very important to realize the governance of agricultural water poverty in key areas narrow the regional gap and achieve regional balanced and full development the concept of relative agricultural water poverty comes from the relative poverty theory and its essence is the relative gap between regions in agricultural water poverty therefore in the hope of achieving the governance of relative agricultural water poverty the first problem to be solved is to identify those areas with severe relative agricultural water poverty the second is targeted management of agricultural water poverty in these areas among them the region identification problem has been solved in the above analysis the focus is on how to target these areas with relatively serious agricultural water poverty problems among them the discussion on the path of agricultural water poverty in 5 2 has certain enlightenment combined with the discussion results in 5 2 the occurrence path of agricultural water poverty in different regions is different which may be caused by the lack of agricultural water resources shanxi it may also be caused by the lack of agricultural development capability liaoning or due to the scarcity of water resources and the weaker agricultural development capability gansu therefore there are differences in governance models in different regions for regions with agricultural water scarcity we can improve supporting water conservancy facilities and increase farmland irrigation conditions through cross regional water resource allocation at the same time we can also adjust the agricultural planting structure accordingly to address the problem of agricultural water scarcity for areas with weak agricultural development capability we can adjust the agricultural industrial structure develop water saving agriculture increase investment in agricultural science and technology strengthen the application of agricultural technology and continuously improve agricultural development capability at the same time it is also necessary to continuously improve the relevant social security system improve the agricultural subsidy system and ensure the basic water rights and capabilities of regional farmers therefore in the final stage the effective governance of relative agricultural water poverty can be realized 6 conclusion the research takes the lead in defining agricultural water poverty constructs a new awpi from the two aspects of agricultural water resource scarcity and agricultural development capability and discusses the relevant characteristics of the awpi in addition the research proposes the concept of relative agricultural water poverty adopts methods such as spatial autocorrelation and takes china as an example to measure and analyze the regional differences in china s agricultural water poverty finally by disassembling the awpi the research also discusses and analyzes the occurrence and governance of agricultural water poverty therefore the detailed conclusions of this study are as follows 1 agricultural water poverty is completely defined as follows in the process of agricultural production and operation residents lack the capability or entitlement to obtain agricultural water which leads to poverty 2 the awpi proposed by the research focuses on the agricultural field and introduces indicators such as socioeconomic capacity which is innovative in the design of indicators moreover the awpi has a uniform weight system which makes it easy to make objective comparisons between regions and greatly enriches the connotation of agricultural water poverty 3 the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are quite large serious problems are mainly concentrated in areas such as north china northwest china and southwest china showing a spatial distribution characterized by low value areas surrounding high value areas the number of areas with severe agricultural water poverty problems is large and such problems last for a long time 4 agricultural water poverty has obvious spatial effects rather than being randomly distributed china s agricultural water poverty overall has negative global spatial autocorrelation the spatial correlation patterns of agricultural water poverty in some regions show differences and there is obvious spatial heterogeneity among regions 5 china s rawpi fluctuates around high values the gap in agricultural water poverty between regions has not narrowed and the contradiction between relative agricultural water poverty is prominent 6 the occurrence paths of agricultural water poverty in different regions are different the causes of agricultural water poverty in different regions should be identified based on the specific conditions of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability to achieve effective governance of agricultural water poverty declaration of competing interest the authors

easy to obtain and indicators are easy to understand and calculate but it does not account for the regional differences in water abailability criticality ratio alcamo et al 2000 alcamo and henrichs 2002 greenland et al 1997 the criticality ratio assesses water scarcity as a ratio of annual water use to total water resource availability it considers scarcity as the ratio of water withdrawals for human use to total renewable water resources among its limitations are the difficulty of distinguishing the amount of water that could be available for human use considering evapotranspiration return flows environmental requirements or the possibility of the society to adapt to water scarcity social water scarcity index swsi ohisson 2000 it reflects hydrological water scarcity in relationship to the social conditions of a country by dividing the hwsi by the hdi linking hydrological water scarcity to social conditions and it also gets rid of some annoying anomalies present in that hydrological water stress index water poverty index wpi sullivan 2002 weighted average of five components water availability access capacity use and environment the indicator has the advantage of comprehensiveness however it needs huge data system support and a large number of qualitative descriptions need to consult experts and wpi has strong regional characteristics water exploitation index wei wei eea 2005 circabc 2012 wei is obtained as the percentage of mean annual total demand for freshwater with respect to the long term mean annual freshwater resources wei is obtained as the percentage of mean annual total demand for freshwater with respect to the long term mean annual freshwater resources but wei has been developed to solve the limitations presented by the wei the index focuses on the assessment of net consumption and it is defined at monthly level green blue grey water scarcity index hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 ngo et al 2018 wsi is the ratio of the sum of blue grey and green water to the total water availability including surface water and groundwater resources blue water scarcity bws is defined per country as the total blue water footprint divided by the blue water availability in the country wsi revealed a potential applicability to sustainable water resources management corresponding to the proposed index the decision makers could determine adequate plans for initiatively using water resources bws has quantified freshwater scarcity only in terms of blue water for a complete picture of the extent of freshwater scarcity one should also consider the use and availability of green water and water pollution the future research should focus on the development of a complete picture of water scarcity including green water scarcity and water pollution levels over time agricultural indicators crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 1988 the cwsi was shown to be equal to 1 e ep the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration obtained from the penman monteith equation the cwsi is based on energy balance and fully considers the vegetation coverage of the underlying surface and meteorological factors such as ground wind speed and water vapor pressure it monitors drought from two aspects of soil moisture and farmland evapotranspiration it has the characteristics of clear physical meaning and wide application range agricultural water poverty index awpi forouzani et al 2013 in short the agricultural water poverty concept relates to quantitative or qualitative depletion in available agricultural water sources agricultural water poverty encompasses five components resources access to water use capacity and environment but there are basic differences in the definition of these components and the indicators used to assess them its most fundamental function is to take the poverty degree of agricultural water as the most important index affecting agricultural development agricultural water deficit index moursi et al 2017 the annual agricultural water deficit index it was defined as the performance indicator using basin wide annual water availability and irrigation water demand a higher it value indicates a lower agricultural water shortage and vice versa when it 0 no agricultural water deficit exists i e natural water supply meets the agricultural demand therefore the threshold of acceptable basin performance was set to it 0 green water scarcity index wsigreen shu et al 2021 wsigreen is the ratio of green water footprint to the total precipitation water resources it reflects the ability of crops to consume rainfall resources blue water scarcity index wsiblue it is defined as the ratio of blue water footprint to the sustainable blue water resource wsiblue measures the supply capacity of blue water resource availability in agricultural production grey water scarcity index wsigrey wsigery is the ratio of the grey water footprint to the difference between twr and cwf wsigrey reflects the ability of twr to absorb assimilated pollutants after satisfying the crop consumption water demand agricultural water scarcity index wsiag liu et al 2022 the wsiag was defined as a ratio of water demand to water availability in crop production it measures the extent to which the sum of green water and blue water availability can meet the crop water requirements such an assessment based on a comprehensive depiction of agricultural water scarcity would provide a better understanding of the potential impact of future climate change on food production analysis of the regional differences in

china corresponding author handling editor dr b e clothier china s agricultural water resource utilization contradiction is prominent and there are obvious differences in the distribution and utilization of water resources among regions the theory of agricultural water poverty is of great significance to promote the efficient utilization of agricultural water resources and alleviate the contradiction of agricultural water use however the definition of the existing agricultural water poverty theory is quite controversial and the mainstream agricultural water poverty index awpi for measuring agricultural water poverty has disadvantages such as complex index selection and lack of unified weights in this regard this research takes the lead in providing a more complete definition of agricultural water poverty with reference to the definition of water poverty in terms of method the research refers to the social water stress scarcity index swsi framework and proposes a new agricultural water poverty index from the two aspects of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability based on this index the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are analyzed the main findings of the study the agricultural water poverty index proposed in this study has rich connotations is easy to compare objectively between regions and is applicable in the field of agriculture the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are large the number of areas with serious agricultural water poverty problems is large and such problems last for a long time the distribution of agricultural water poverty in china has spatial autocorrelation rather than a random distribution china s relative agricultural water poverty index fluctuates around high values the gap in agricultural water poverty between regions has not narrowed and the contradiction in relative agricultural water poverty is prominent the occurrence paths of agricultural water poverty in different regions are different and the situation in different regions should be identified based on the scarcity of agricultural water resources and the development capability of agricultural production finally this study expects to improve agricultural water poverty theory to effectively alleviate the problem of agricultural water poverty in different regions and promote balanced regional development keywords agricultural water poverty index agricultural water scarcity regional differences relative agricultural water poverty 1 introduction water resources are related to human survival and development as well as social progress with global climate change and great social development the problem of water shortages has become increasingly serious and it has become one of the most common concerns in the world today naimi ait aoudia and berezowska azzag 2016 wang and zhang 2011 in particular the problem of agricultural water use has become a prominent problem in the process of water resource management and utilization seventy percent of the freshwater consumed by humans is used for agriculture balasubramanya and stifel 2020 and in some underdeveloped countries even more than 80 is used oliveira et al 2017 agricultural water shortages continue to hamper agricultural production operation and sustainable development and have become a major factor limiting agricultural output and the income of the poor rural population in many developing countries namara et al 2010 precise measurement of water scarcity is a prerequisite to effective resource management hussain et al 2022 the falkenmark indicator was the first indicator used on a national scale it calculates water availability brown and matlock 2011 hussain et al 2022 in addition the criticality ratio the water exploitation index wei wei and the blue green gray water scarcity index are all classic indicators for measuring water scarcity alcamo and henrichs 2002 greenland et al 1997 hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 eea 2005 these indicators all evaluate water scarcity from the perspective of traditional hydrology but ignore the water scarcity that may be caused by the limitation of socioeconomic capacity similar to these indicators in the evaluation of agricultural water scarcity jackson et al 1981 proposed the crop water stress index cwsi and liu et al 2022 proposed the agricultural water scarcity index wsiag in addition it also includes the green blue gray water scarcity index moursi et al 2017 shu et al 2021 etc these indicators play a certain role in evaluating agricultural water scarcity and promoting sustainable agricultural development forouzani et al 2013 rasul and thapa 2004 however they also ignore the constraints imposed by social competence in this context the social water scarcity index swsi links hydrological water scarcity to social conditions ohisson 2000 the water poverty index wpi proposed by sullivan 2002 extends the solution of water scarcity from the field of hydrology to the field of socioeconomics shao and ang 2007 based on the wpi the agricultural water poverty index proposed by forouzani and karami 2011 is applied in the measurement of agriculture since the concept of agricultural water poverty was proposed it has been developed and applied to a certain extent balasubramanya and stifel 2020 zhang and wang 2020 but it also faces many problems and challenges the first is that the concept of agricultural water poverty is not uniformly defined and different scholars have their own understandings of agricultural water poverty forouzani et al 2013 zhang and wang 2019 mehta 2001 noemdoe et al 2006 second the existing mainstream measurement method of agricultural water poverty awpi is constructed based on the wpi model forouzani and karami 2011 the wpi has huge data requirements and complex calculations and its application is hampered by its complexity and lack of information for some of the factors required for building the indicator on a large scale hussain et al 2022 rijsberman 2006 wang et al 2018 at the same time it is also highly subjective and difficult to compare between regions so it has thus far only been applied at the community level for pilot sites in a few countries liu et al 2017 therefore existing research urgently needs to fully define agricultural water poverty and propose a new measurement method for agricultural water poverty to improve the theory the contradiction in water resource utilization in china is very prominent and problems such as increasing water demand and the relative scarcity of water resources are becoming increasingly obvious liu and yang 2012 yu 2011 especially the problem of agricultural water resource utilization which has received more attention deng et al 2006 zhang et al 2022a 2022b the introduction of agricultural water poverty theory provides theoretical support for the efficient utilization and sustainable development of water resources in the agricultural production process and it alleviates the poverty problems of agriculture and farmers zhang and wang 2019 however there are significant differences in the distribution of water resources and in the agricultural and economic development levels in different regions of china the problem of inequality in water resource utilization in different regions is prominent and the contradictions between water resource management and utilization are also different he et al 2019 sun et al 2017 in this regard it is worth exploring whether there are significant differences in agricultural water poverty among different regions in china zhang and wang 2019 used the exploratory time space data analysis estda to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spatial pattern of agricultural water poverty in china from the perspective of spatiotemporal coupling and found that there are obvious spatial effects of agricultural water poverty in china therefore to effectively solve the poverty problem caused by agricultural water use in different regions and to achieve the balanced development of all regions in china the relative differences in agricultural water poverty among regions need urgent attention and resolution in this regard the research is expected to address the following two issues 1 how can the concept of agricultural water poverty be properly defined and the measurement methods of agricultural water poverty be effectively improved 2 how can the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china be analyzed the research will refer to the definition of water poverty and give a more complete definition of agricultural water poverty at the same time this study attempts to construct a new index for evaluating the degree of regional agricultural water poverty from the perspectives of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capacity and uses it to measure 31 provinces municipalities in china from 2003 to 2019 based on the calculation results the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are analyzed through the horizontal temporal and spatial distribution and a vertical comparison between regions the research provides a scientific basis for improving the theory of agricultural water poverty and realizing the effective governance of regional agricultural water poverty and has theoretical and practical significance for promoting balanced development among regions 2 definition of agricultural water poverty for a long time many scholars have had different understandings of water scarcity in the traditional sense water scarcity is the condition under which the water demands of agriculture and other economic sectors cannot be satisfied by water availability oki and kanae 2006 in addition many scholars have designed different water scarcity measures to characterize the degree of water scarcity liu et al 2017 cao et al 2017 however these definitions and indicators only reveal the degree of water scarcity from the perspective of traditional hydrology but most ignore the water scarcity caused by insufficient economic and social capability in considering the water scarcity problem caused by insufficient water resources and socioeconomic capability the water poverty theory has obvious advantages shao and ang 2007 the concept of water poverty is based on the definition by desai 1995 of poverty as capability depravation or by sen 1999 as a lack of entitlement the most commonly accepted concept today is the lack of capability to or entitlement to water cullis and o regan 2004 thus this study expects to introduce the theory of water poverty into agricultural production activities redefine agricultural water poverty and explore the problem of agricultural water poverty in this regard this study defines agricultural water poverty as follows in the process of agricultural production and operation residents lack the capability or entitlement to obtain agricultural water which leads to poverty in fact there are many definitions of agricultural water poverty and they are still under debate forouzani et al 2013 zhang and wang 2019 mehta 2001 noemdoe et al 2006 different from the concept of agricultural water poverty proposed by previous scholars our definition of agricultural water poverty makes up for two deficiencies in the existing research first we not only consider water scarcity in the traditional hydrological sense but also consider agricultural water scarcity from the perspective of social capability which is not covered by the existing definitions of agricultural water poverty second we incorporate the classical definition of poverty capability deprivation which will enrich the connotation of agricultural water poverty 3 methods and data 3 1 agricultural water poverty index since the concept of water poverty was first proposed studies on measurement methods for water poverty have emerged pérez foguet and garriga 2011 sullivan 2002 wilk and jonsson 2013 the most commonly used method is the wpi measurement method proposed by sullivan 2002 the measurement of agricultural water poverty also mainly draws on this method forouzani and karami 2011 however the agricultural water poverty index based on the wpi method has the disadvantages of a complex data system complicated calculation lack of uniform indicators and weights in the evaluation system and lack of objective authenticity of the evaluation hussain et al 2022 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the specific differences of different indicators will be developed in the discussion section by comparing the existing studies it is found that the social resource water stress scarcity index swsi proposed by ohisson 2000 has the advantages of strong objectivity and easy regional comparison and is the most easily understood indicator of social adaptability therefore this study refers to the structure of the swsi and combines it with the definition of agricultural water poverty given in the article to design indicators the indicators will cover agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability and thus we propose a new method for measuring agricultural water poverty the specific index framework is as follows 1 a w p i a w s i 1 a d i where awpi refers to the agricultural water poverty index awsi indicates agricultural water scarcity index adi stands for the regional agricultural development capability index the awpi has a uniform weight and can be compared between different scales and research objects that is under the same conditions of regional agricultural development capability the larger the awsi the more water scarcity in regional agriculture the more serious the regional agricultural water poverty problem in the case of the same regional agricultural water scarcity degree the larger the adi the weaker the regional agricultural development capability the more serious the regional agricultural water poverty problem 3 2 agricultural water scarcity index the agricultural water scarcity index was defined as a ratio of irrigation water deficit to water availability in crop production and is estimated by the following equation 2 a w s i a w d a w a where awd represents the agricultural water deficit cu m and awa is agricultural water availability cu m agricultural blue water availability is estimated by the following equation 3 a w a t w r i w u d w u where twr is the total water resource availability cu m iwu is water use for the industrial sector cu m and dwu is water use for the domestic sector cu m the amount of evaporation and transpiration that would occur if there were sufficient water available in the growth period of the crop is defined as the crop water requirement wr however that is not always satisfied due to water scarcity the gap between the actual water consumption and the crop water requirement is the water deficit for agricultural production awd this deficit reflects the degree of water scarcity the actual water consumption for regional agricultural production includes two parts the green water consumption gw originating from rainfall and the blue water consumption bw originating from conventional water resources during crop growth hoekstra et al 2011 the calculation method of water deficit for agricultural production awd is 4 a w d w r g w b w where wr is the total crop water requirement cu m gw is the total green water consumption in crop production cu m and bw is the total blue water consumption in crop production cu m the total crop water requirement wr is defined as the total crop evapotranspiration on arable land throughout the entire year 5 w r i d e t c i d a i 10 where e t c i d is the crop evapotranspiration on the dth day of the growth period for crop i mm a i represents crop i s sown area hm2 and 10 is a unit conversion coefficient cu m hm2 gw is calculated as 6 g w i d e p i d a i 10 where ep id is the effective precipitation on the dth day of the growth period for crop i mm the effective precipitation during the growth period of the crop is calculated in ten steps according to the method developed by the usda döll and siebert 2002 7 e p p 4 17 0 02 p 4 17 p 83 m m 41 7 0 1 p p 83 m m where p is the ten day precipitation mm bw is calculated as 8 b w i d m a x 0 e t c i d e p i d i a i 10 where ia i represents crop i s irrigation area hm2 for each crop et c was calculated by the following equation 9 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient of crop i which depends on the growing stage of the crop et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is calculated based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 3 3 agricultural development capability index the agricultural development capability index is based on the conceptual framework of the human development index hdi undp 1998 it is mainly used to measure the shortage or deprivation of agricultural production capability of agricultural entities in various regions the hdi originally included three indicators health and longevity knowledge and a decent life undp 1998 on this basis the united nations development programme has also developed the human poverty index hpi human poverty is an important concept to understand and define poverty from a multidimensional perspective zhang and fu 2009 according to this concept poverty is not just a physical lack it is essentially capability poverty the hpi originally included three indicators health and longevity knowledge and a decent life undp 1998 then in the human development report 1998 the united nations development programme defined the hpi 2 for industrialized countries or oecd countries zhang and fu 2009 hpi 2 adds social exclusion indicators to hpi therefore on the basis of the initial concept of the hdi this study introduces the ratio of the total power of agricultural machinery to the cultivated land area and constructs the adi with reference to the framework of hpi 2 1 1 note in the calculation of adi a 1 a 2 and a 3 are subject to positive normalization and a 4 is subject to negative normalization 10 a d i a 1 3 a 2 3 a 3 3 a 4 3 4 1 3 a 1 is survival or longevity expressed as the proportion of deaths before 65 years of age in a province municipalities excluding a 2 is knowledge expressed as the percentage of the illiterate population in a province municipalities to the total population aged 15 and over these two indicators reflect the health and education level of agricultural subjects in the region respectively jain and nagpal 2019 janez and pieter 2017 a 3 is the decent level of life expressed by the engel coefficient of rural residents in a province municipalities it reflects the living standard of agricultural subjects in the region ladi et al 2021 a 4 is the degree of agricultural development expressed by the ratio of the total power of agricultural machinery to the cultivated land area in a province municipalities kw ha agricultural machinery plays an irreplaceable role in the development of agricultural modernization houssou et al 2013 agricultural mechanization reflects the development of agricultural technology and the prospect of economic growth and the continuous development of technology is a prerequisite for realizing sustainable agriculture liu and li 2017 zhang et al 2022a 2022b therefore this index is used to reflect the development degree of agriculture in a certain area 3 4 spatial autocorrelation model of agricultural water poverty spatial autocorrelation analysis mainly reveals whether there is a significant spatial correlation and interdependence relationship between a certain attribute of a geographical spatial unit and its neighboring spatial unit this article mainly uses moran s i to measure the spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty the value range of moran s i is 1 1 an index greater than 0 indicates that there is positive spatial autocorrelation and the closer the value is to 1 the stronger the spatial dependence an index less than 0 indicates that there is negative spatial autocorrelation and the closer the value is to 1 the greater the spatial heterogeneity an index equal to 0 indicates that the attribute value is randomly distributed and that there is no spatial correlation xue and gao 2021 3 4 1 global autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty the study uses global moran s i to explore whether there is spatial dependence on the spatial attributes of regional agricultural water poverty xue and gao 2021 the calculation formula is as follows 11 i i 1 n j 1 n w i j a w p i i a w p i a w p i j a w p i s 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j 12 z 1 e i v a r i in the above formula n is the number of geographical spatial units in the study area awpi i and awpi j are the observed values awpi of a certain attribute of spatial units i and j w ij is the spatial weight matrix established based on the proximity relationship w ij of spatial units i and j s 2 is the variance in y i z is the statistic of moran s i normalization e i is the expected value of moran s i and var i is the variance in moran s i 3 4 2 local autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty whether there is a spatial association pattern in different geographical locations of the research area that is whether there is spatial agglomeration or differentiation in a local area is generally tested by the local moran s i therefore this study uses the local moran s i to analyze the local spatial aggregation of agricultural water poverty the calculation formula is as follows 13 i i a w p i i a w p i s 2 j 1 n w i j a w p i j a w p i 3 5 framework of the relative agricultural water poverty index water poverty theory is derived from poverty theory referring to the concept of water poverty this study defines agricultural water poverty as the lack of agricultural water capability or entitlement its essence also belongs to the concept of poverty sen 1976 thus relative poverty theory is still applicable to the concept of agricultural water poverty existing studies mainly discuss relative poverty measurement and governance for most regions of china agricultural water poverty is the main obstacle to regional agricultural economic development and due to the temporal and spatial distribution of water resources and the imbalance and disharmony of regional economic development there are some differences in agricultural water poverty among regions therefore it is expected that in research on the governance of agricultural water poverty the concept of relative agricultural water poverty needs to be defined then measure the relative agricultural water poverty and put forward its governance strategies the concept of relative poverty was first put forward by townsend 1979 he believes that relative poverty is based on comparison and deeper poverty after material satisfaction subsequently srinivasan and sen 1983 expanded the connotation of relative poverty on the basis of the theory of capability poverty put forward by sen 1976 combined with the existing definitions relative poverty is defined as the resources owned by an individual being significantly lower than the average resource level dominated by the social family or individual it usually does not depend on the actual living conditions of the individual but is closely related to the conditions of the reference group on this basis relative agricultural water poverty is defined as some regions in the social environment have lower power or opportunities for the utilization of agricultural water resources than the reference region thus they are in a relatively scarce state based on the concept of relative poverty relative agricultural water poverty theory draws lessons from the measurement method for relative poverty to measure relative agricultural water poverty the common measurement methods for relative poverty mainly include the average income ratio method and the median income ratio method luo and qiu 2021 this study uses the median proportion method to measure the relative agricultural water poverty of chinese provinces municipalities refers to the standards formulated by eu countries eu countries designate 60 of the median income of the whole society as the relative poverty line and sets the relative agricultural water poverty line standard as 60 of the median agricultural water poverty of the whole society in addition li and shen 2007 once constructed a relative poverty index to measure relative poverty which is a set of composite indicators that avoids some defects in ordinary measurement methods and is suitable for measuring the overall degree of relative poverty between regions in this regard this study will use the framework of the relative poverty index to construct the relative agricultural water poverty index rawpi to measure the overall relative agricultural water poverty in china 2 2 note the higher the awpi value is the more serious the agricultural water poverty which is contrary to the traditional relative poverty measurement to facilitate comparative understanding in the calculation of the relative agricultural water poverty line the awpi of each region is first converted into 1 awpi and then the measurement is further completed however the relative agricultural water poverty index was originally used to measure the difference in regional overall agricultural water poverty thus it is directly calculated by awpi after calculating the awpi this study considers the relativity of agricultural water poverty it uses the ratio between the weighted agricultural water poverty level of the 40 highest agricultural water poverty group and the weighted average agricultural water poverty level of the agricultural water poverty group below 60 to measure the relative agricultural water poverty level to facilitate the ranking and comparison calculation the reciprocal of the awpi is used to calculate the rawpi at the same time the ratio of the number of provinces municipalities that are located at 60 of the regional average agricultural water poverty level to the total number of provinces municipalities in the entire study is used to measure the relative agricultural water poverty incidence in each region and finally the product of the two is used as an index to measure relative agricultural water poverty the specific calculation formula is as follows 14 r a w p r 1 n i 1 n a w p i i 60 15 r a w p c 1 n m 1 i m n a w p i i 1 m 1 i 1 m 1 a w p i i 16 r a w p i r a w p r r a w p c rawpr rawpc and rawpi represent the incidence of relative agricultural water poverty relative agricultural water poverty degree and relative agricultural water poverty index respectively n represents the total number of provinces municipalities rank according to the agricultural water poverty index of each province municipality from low to high take the last 40 of the agricultural water poverty index group and m represents the overall ranking value of the provinces with the lowest agricultural water poverty index in this group awpi represents the agricultural water poverty index by province municipality the greater the rawpi is the greater the regional difference 3 6 data sources the study takes 31 provinces municipalities in china as examples limited by data limitations excluding hong kong macao and taiwan and all the indicators involved are the measurement of the agricultural water poverty index in each region among them the indicators used to estimate adi include survival or longevity knowledge decent level of life and degree of agricultural development the indicators used to estimate the awa include the twr iwu and dwu the data used in the above indicators come from the 2003 2019 china statistical yearbook educational statistics yearbook of china china demographic yearbook china population employment statistics yearbook china rural statistics yearbook china environment statistics yearbook and china water conservancy statistical yearbook the data used for estimating and decomposing the awd include the sown area effective irrigation area of crops precipitation data and meteorological data the sown area and effective irrigation area are obtained from the chinese national bureau of statistics 2003 2019 the precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center 2003 2019 the meteorological data for minimum temperature maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity hours of sunshine and precipitation are obtained from the china meteorological data service center 2003 2019 4 results and analysis 4 1 measurement of china s agricultural water poverty the research uses the newly constructed awpi and it takes 31 provinces municipalities and regions in china as examples to measure the awpi of each region from 2003 to 2019 then based on the division of the 7 administrative regions of china including central china east china south china north china southwest china northwest china and northeast china we draw a line chart of agricultural water poverty in corresponding provinces municipalities and describe the agricultural water poverty in each region fig 1 fig 1 h reflects the average fluctuation in china s overall agricultural water poverty from 2003 to 2019 it can be seen that the fluctuation of agricultural water poverty in china over the years is not strong and the numerical fluctuation range is between 1 0000 and 2 5000 for different regions fig 1 a shows the situation of agricultural water poverty in the four provinces of henan hubei hunan and jiangxi in central china the figure shows that the numerical curve of agricultural water poverty in henan province is significantly higher than that in the other three provinces showing an obvious fluctuating upward trend the problem of agricultural water poverty is serious henan province is an agricultural and populous province with a population of 96 4 million at the end of 2019 water for domestic and agricultural production and operations is in short supply the agricultural water poverty curves of hunan hubei and jiangxi provinces are relatively concentrated and the awpi has continued to fluctuate in the range of 0 5000 1 5000 over the years fig 1 b shows the agricultural water poverty line of the 6 provinces of shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui fujian and shandong in east china among them the overall agricultural water poverty curve of shandong province is significantly higher than the agricultural water poverty line of other provinces and the awpi value has increased significantly over the years the agricultural water poverty curve in anhui province is the second highest with strong volatility before 2014 the agricultural water poverty curves of the other four regions are relatively concentrated with consistent fluctuation trends all below 0 5000 shanghai has a relatively low level of agricultural water poverty in china the overall agricultural water poverty curves of the provinces in south china show a downward trend of fluctuation fig 1 c overall the positions of the agricultural water poverty curves of hainan and guangxi provinces are relatively high and the fluctuation trends are relatively consistent the agricultural water poverty curve of guangdong province is basically below 0 5000 and the severity of agricultural water poverty is relatively light fig 1 d reflects the agricultural water poverty curves of beijing tianjin hebei shanxi and inner mongolia in north china among them the severity of agricultural water poverty in shanxi province is significantly higher than that in other regions and the agricultural water poverty curve of shanxi province has shown alternating fluctuations over the years the agricultural water poverty in inner mongolia has been highly volatile over the years showing an increasing trend as of 2017 2019 the awpi value continued to be higher than 3 0000 in addition the awpi in hebei province is consistently above the 1 000 level the agricultural water poverty levels in beijing and tianjin are relatively low the fluctuation trend is relatively stable and the degree of agricultural water poverty is relatively light fig 1 e is the agricultural water poverty curve of 5 provinces in northwest china agricultural water poverty in gansu and shaanxi is relatively serious the overall agricultural water poverty curve in gansu province is above awpi 4 000 and the highest awpi is close to 8 0000 in some years although the agricultural water poverty value in shaanxi province has declined in recent years the overall problem is serious the agricultural water poverty situation in ningxia and qinghai is relatively close and the agricultural water poverty problem in xinjiang is slight the awpi in chongqing yunnan and guizhou in southwest china has strong alternating fluctuations fig 1 f the agricultural water poverty value in chongqing in 2006 2008 and 2011 was higher than 8 0000 and fluctuated around awpi 7 0000 in the 10 years from 2003 to 2013 and it has shown a downward trend in recent years the agricultural water poverty in yunnan and guizhou provinces is highly volatile the overall value is relatively high and the problem is more serious the agricultural water poverty value in sichuan province is relatively low showing a downward trend in recent years the problem of agricultural water poverty in tibet is relatively minor the agricultural water poverty curves of the three provinces of liaoning heilongjiang and jilin in northeast china are generally below awpi 3 5000 fig 1 g the overall fluctuation trend of the curve is relatively consistent and the severity of agricultural water poverty is relatively light on the whole the areas with severe agricultural water poverty problems in china s 31 provinces municipalities over the years are mainly shaanxi and gansu in northwest china yunnan and guizhou in southwest china and shanxi and inner mongolia in north china with relatively high awpi values among them the agricultural water poverty in shanxi henan gansu and inner mongolia has not been effectively improved in recent years and there is still an upward trend however the agricultural water poverty values in xinjiang tibet beijing tianjin and many southeastern coastal areas are relatively low and the problem of agricultural water poverty is relatively small according to the analysis results the agricultural water poverty status in different regions has a certain degree of regional differences next this paper analyzes the spatial distribution in the horizontal direction and the relative gap in agricultural water poverty in different regions in the vertical direction 4 2 spatial effect of agricultural water poverty 4 2 1 geospatial distribution to explore the differences in the spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in china according to the measurement results of agricultural water poverty this study further draws a spatial distribution map of agricultural water poverty in 31 provinces municipalities in china this study analyzes the relevant characteristics of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china from the perspective of the geographical spatial distribution and the results are shown in fig 2 this research draws a distribution map of agricultural water poverty in 31 provinces municipalities in china in 2003 2008 2014 2019 and the average year to analyze the regional differences and evolution of the distribution of china s agricultural water poverty from the temporal and spatial perspectives in terms of time trends with the passage of time the situation of agricultural water poverty within each region of china s 31 provinces municipalities has not undergone strong fluctuations and the number of regions where the problem of agricultural water poverty has worsened has not increased or decreased significantly the distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions in different years is basically the same as the distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions in china in an average year in terms of the geographical and spatial distribution there are certain similarities in the spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions over the years fig 2 a b c d show that the areas with severe agricultural water poverty in china are mainly concentrated in parts of north china northwest china and southwest china the areas with serious agricultural water poverty problems in north china are mainly inner mongolia shanxi henan shandong and other provinces along the yellow river basin those in northwest china are mainly gansu and shaanxi provinces and those in southwest china are mainly yunnan and guizhou provinces in combination with the average distribution map of agricultural water poverty in all provinces municipalities fig 2 c the average distribution is basically consistent with the distribution of agricultural water poverty in each year overall there are obvious differences in the severity of agricultural water poverty among regions and the spatial distribution of china s agricultural water poverty is characterized by low value regions surrounding high value regions 4 2 2 spatial correlation in the previous section the spatial distribution map of agricultural water poverty in china over several years such as 2003 and 2008 was drawn and the changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china were analyzed the results showed that there were certain characteristics in the geographical and spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china therefore we further explore whether there is a spatial effect of agricultural water poverty to significantly identify the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china this study uses geoda 1 8 10 arcmap 10 5 and other software as well as the method of spatial autocorrelation to further reveal the spatial distribution attributes of agricultural water poverty in fact there are few existing studies on the spatial characteristics of agricultural water poverty zhang and wang 2019 4 2 3 global spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty according to the univariate global autocorrelation model geoda 1 8 10 software was used to create a spatial weight matrix and through 999 random permutations the global moran s i of china s agricultural water poverty index awpi in 2003 2008 2014 and 2019 and the average year were obtained see table 1 table 1 shows that the global moran s i of china s agricultural water poverty in 2003 2008 2014 2014 and the average year is 0 1519 0 1662 0 1361 0 1132 and 0 1624 respectively and these values are significant at the 1 level the z values of the statistics of the normality hypothesis test passed the test and were statistically significant overall the table shows that the distribution of agricultural water poverty in china has spatial autocorrelation rather than a random distribution and this spatial correlation is negative 4 2 4 local spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty the global moran s i well explains whether there is spatial autocorrelation in the whole study area whether there is spatial autocorrelation in a certain area needs to be further analyzed by the local moran s i this study uses geoda 1 8 10 software to conduct local spatial autocorrelation analysis on the distribution of water poverty in china and obtains the local moran s i scatter plot of each region for 2003 2008 2015 2019 and the average year as shown in fig 3 there are four quadrants in the scatter plot the first to fourth quadrants represent four types of clustering trends high high h h low high l h low low l l and high low h l the regional attribute values in the first and third quadrants are positively correlated with the surrounding regional attribute values and the regional attribute values in the second and fourth quadrants are negatively correlated with the surrounding regional attribute values fig 3 shows that in the scatter plot for 2003 2008 and 2015 the corresponding points of most provinces municipalities fall in quadrants 2 and 4 indicating that there is negative spatial autocorrelation in agricultural water poverty in most areas the corresponding points in some areas fall in the third quadrant indicating that there is a positive spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water poverty in these areas to further analyze the spatial agglomeration characteristics of agricultural water poverty among chinese provinces municipalities this study uses arcmap 10 5 to map the local spatial autocorrelation agglomeration of agricultural water poverty in chinese provinces municipalities in 2003 2008 2015 2019 and the average year the feature distribution is shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that overall the spatial correlation pattern of agricultural water poverty in very few regions of china has changed to a certain extent over the years while the spatial correlation pattern of agricultural water poverty in most regions has remained basically unchanged from 2003 2019 the number of regions with significant spatial correlation effects of agricultural water poverty did not change significantly with only the yunnan region and the guangxi region moving from the initial h l correlation mode and the l l correlation mode respectively to a state of random distribution at the same time the spatial correlation pattern of agricultural water poverty within each region has basically remained unchanged for a long time and only some regions have experienced significant changes in the spatial correlation pattern over time sichuan province changed from the l l correlation mode to the h l correlation mode and finally changed to the l l correlation mode again in the average year the agricultural water poverty correlation mode was h l henan province underwent a fluctuation change from the h h correlation model to a random distribution and then from the h l correlation model to a random distribution jilin and beijing experienced a change from the l h correlation pattern to a random distribution shandong province experienced a change in correlation pattern from l h to h h and then to l h inner mongolia and liaoning experienced a dynamic change from the initial l h correlation pattern to the final h h correlation pattern in addition tibet xinjiang zhejiang shanghai fujian jiangxi anhui jiangsu hebei and tianjin have been in the l h spatial correlation mode for a long time shaanxi shanxi gansu and chongqing have been in the h l correlation mode for a long time ningxia hubei and qinghai have long been in the l l spatial correlation mode however heilongjiang guizhou and hunan have had no significant spatial correlation for a long time and they are in a state of random distribution comparing the changes in the spatial correlation patterns of agricultural water poverty in different regions over the years with the changes in the spatial correlation patterns of agricultural water poverty in different regions in an average year this study finds that there is a significant spatial agglomeration effect in most regions and that the spatial correlation patterns in most regions remain unchanged for a long time the changes in the spatial correlation pattern of regional agricultural water poverty are related not only to a regions own agricultural water poverty status but also to the change in the agricultural water poverty correlation pattern in neighboring regions combined with the results of the spatial agglomeration distribution of agricultural water poverty in various regions in the average year the provinces with the l l correlation model are mainly ningxia hubei and qinghai the agricultural water poverty coefficient in these regions is low and the severity of agricultural water poverty in each region is light the regions with the spatial correlation pattern of h l mainly include shaanxi gansu shanxi henan and chongqing the agricultural water poverty coefficient values in these regions are relatively large and the agricultural water poverty degree is serious the surrounding areas including ningxia qinghai hubei and sichuan have relatively low levels of agricultural water poverty one province has the h h agricultural water poverty correlation model inner mongolia which is under the relative agricultural water poverty line the agricultural water poverty coefficient is high and the problem of agricultural water poverty is more serious it is surrounded by areas with equally serious agricultural water poverty problems such as gansu shaanxi shanxi and henan hebei jiangsu zhejiang shanghai and fujian are in the l h spatial correlation pattern and their own agricultural water poverty levels are relatively low while those in adjacent areas are relatively high from the perspective of the geospatial distribution except for some areas in south china there is a significant spatial agglomeration effect in most areas of china showing a spatial distribution characterized by high value areas surrounded by low value areas at the same time the spatial characteristics of agricultural water poverty in various regions of china are related to their own agricultural water poverty levels and the impact of agricultural water poverty in adjacent areas overall through the spatial autocorrelation analysis of the agricultural water poverty coefficient of china s provinces municipalities it is found that in addition to the negative global spatial autocorrelation effect there is obvious spatial heterogeneity among regions the results are similar to those of zhang and wang 2019 therefore in the process of expecting to achieve effective governance of agricultural water poverty the impact of spatial heterogeneity needs to be carefully considered 4 3 relative agricultural water poverty the study reveals the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china from a horizontal perspective by mapping the geographical and spatial distribution of agricultural water poverty over multiple years and using analysis methods such as spatial autocorrelation analysis however from a vertical perspective the comparison of the differences in agricultural water poverty among different regions in china has not been well realized specifically which areas belong to the areas with relatively severe agricultural water poverty by what standard is judgment made in recent years has the relative agricultural water poverty gap between whole regions widened or narrowed or have there been no significant changes these issues need to be urgently addressed on this basis this research draws on relative poverty theory to propose the concept of relative agricultural water poverty to resolve the problem of regional differences caused by agricultural water poverty in the difference measurement of relative agricultural water poverty this research draws lessons from the general measurement method for relative poverty and uses the median income ratio method to compare the differences in relative agricultural water poverty among different regions in china luo and qiu 2021 to judge which regions in china have been below the relative agricultural water poverty line over the years the results obtained are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that among 31 provinces municipalities in china there are obviously areas below the relative agricultural water poverty line which means that the problem of relative agricultural water poverty caused by the difference in agricultural water poverty in different regions persists from 2003 2019 areas in relative agricultural water poverty included yunnan chongqing gansu shanxi hanan guizhou shanxi jiangxi shandong liaoning inner mongolia jilin hainan heilongjiang guangxi and sichuan for a total of 16 provinces from 2015 2019 the provinces municipalities that were below the relative agricultural water poverty line were mainly henan gansu yunnan inner mongolia chongqing shanxi and shaanxi since 2003 the areas below the relative agricultural water poverty line in recent years have been changing to a certain extent on the one hand intuitively the number of areas below the relative water poverty line fluctuates slightly but overall the degree of change in most regions is not obvious yunnan shaanxi shanxi gansu and henan have always been areas with relatively serious agricultural water poverty the findings also indirectly show that china s relative agricultural water poverty has not improved in a practical sense over the years on the other hand based on the relative values of agricultural water poverty in various provinces municipalities over the years the agricultural water poverty gap between regions has basically remained above 5 0000 and this gap has not been significantly narrowed in recent years the standard poverty line fluctuates between 0 5000 and 0 6000 which shows that there is an enormous gap in agricultural water poverty between regions and that the regional differences are obvious similar to the concept of relative poverty the relativity of agricultural water poverty also cannot be eliminated what can be done as much as possible is to narrow the gap between regions in agricultural water poverty so that the regions at a disadvantage in terms of agricultural water poverty can be further improved thereby improving the overall agricultural water poverty situation to solve the third problem raised at the beginning of this subsection this research calculates china s rawpi over the years based on the constructed rawpi model to analyze the overall variation in agricultural water poverty among different regional situations the results are shown in fig 5 in fig 5 the rawpi has been at a high level over the years indicating that there is a large gap in agricultural water poverty among regions according to the trendline there is a slight overall downward trend in the rawpi however in recent years the rawpi curve has continued to fluctuate steadily around rawpi 4 000 indicating that china s relative agricultural water poverty has not been significantly improved and that the relative gap in agricultural water poverty between regions is still large china s overall average rawpi is 5 1424 in 2003 the rawpi was 4 3362 as of 2019 it was 4 4146 and in 2006 and 2011 it reached high values of 7 1624 and 7 5423 respectively over the years the rawpi has never shown a continuous monotonically decreasing trend among the years the high value of the rawpi in 2006 is closely related to the high value of agricultural water poverty in chongqing in 2006 the chongqing area suffered from once in a century extremely high temperatures and dry weather hao et al 2007 this persistent dry weather increased the water gap between agricultural production and operation irrigation in chongqing and the scarcity of water resources increased aggravating regional agricultural water poverty additionally the relative degree of interregional agricultural water poverty increased the reason for the relatively high rawpi in 2011 is that the agricultural water poverty problem in guizhou and chongqing was severe in this year as the root cause extremely dry weather occurred in southwest china in 2011 guizhou chongqing yunnan and other places were significantly affected by dry weather which involved less precipitation and serious evaporation resulting in a shortage of water for agricultural production the increasing scarcity of water resources the serious problem of regional agricultural water poverty and a change in the overall relative water poverty situation in the region china is relatively vulnerable to agricultural water poverty and is easily affected by extremely dry weather therefore it is worth considering the impact of early warnings of extreme weather on agricultural water poverty the study proposes the concept of relative agricultural water poverty and refers to the measurement method for relative poverty to accurately measure the areas under the agricultural water poverty line in china over the years the regions with large differences in agricultural water poverty in china are accurately identified vertically by a quantitative method at the same time through horizontal geospatial description and spatial autocorrelation analysis this study easily finds that there are obvious regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china that show certain spatial distribution characteristics the analysis of the spatial differences in agricultural water poverty indicates the direction for the effective realization of the governance of agricultural water poverty in key and difficult areas 5 discussion this research innovated the measurement method for agricultural water poverty carried out the measurement time and space distribution analysis of agricultural water poverty in 31 regions of china and defined and measured relative agricultural water poverty an overall analysis of the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in 31 provinces municipalities in china was conducted however this research still has the following issues that warrant further discussion 1 the research successfully constructed the awpi and applied it for analysis however compared with the existing classic water scarcity indices and related agricultural water scarcity indices what are the salient features of this index and how is it applicable 2 according to the application results of the awpi there are serious agricultural water poverty problems in many regions including shanxi gansu and yunnan while the agricultural water poverty problems in zhejiang jiangsu tianjin and other regions are mild showing obvious regional differences in this regard it is of theoretical and practical significance to analyze the causes of agricultural water poverty in regions with large differences by combining the constitutive mechanism of the awpi model 3 this study defines relative agricultural water poverty according to the relevant measures of relative agricultural water poverty it is found that there are many regions in china that have been in relative agricultural water poverty for a long time with large regional gaps and serious problems therefore how can the relative governance of agricultural water poverty be effectively realized these issues require further discussion 5 1 comparison with other water scarcity indicators water scarcity has increasingly become the focus of today s society oki and kanae 2006 on this basis a large number of indicators for evaluating water scarcity have been proposed liu et al 2017 moursi et al 2017 in table 3 the study reviewed 6 general indicators and 5 indicators used to assess agricultural water scarcity among the general indicators falkenmark s indicator criticality ratio water exploitation index wei wei and blue green gray water scarcity index evaluate water scarcity from a traditional hydrological perspective the social water scarcity index swsi and water poverty index wpi include factors such as socioeconomic capacity in evaluating water scarcity among the five indicators for assessing agricultural water scarcity the crop water stress index cwsi is mainly used for drought monitoring the blue green gray water scarcity index and the agricultural water poverty index awpi are proposed based on the blue green gray water scarcity index and water poverty index wpi in general indicators and are suitable for the agricultural field meanwhile liu et al 2022 and moursi et al 2017 proposed the agricultural water scarcity index wsiag and the agricultural water deficit index respectively which were specifically used to assess the degree of agricultural water scarcity compared with the above indicators the agricultural water poverty indicator proposed in this study has the following four features 1 the awpi proposed by the study introduces indicators such as socioeconomic capacity which are different from traditional agricultural water scarcity indicators this means that it is not only the concept of hydrology but also has the connotation of poverty 2 the awpi proposed by the study places the evaluation perspective on the agricultural field and at the same time shapes the awpi framework from the two aspects of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability although the research refers to the structure of the swsi in the index design it is quite different from the specific content of the indicators involved in the swsi 3 the awpi proposed by the research has certain novelty in numerator design the study uses the ratio of irrigation water deficit to water available in crop production to characterize the agricultural water scarcity index among them agricultural water deficit awd is a gap indicator compared with the etc proposed by liu et al 2022 and the blue and green water consumption used by shu et al 2021 as the index numerator awd considers more comprehensive content in addition the awd index involves planting structure and crop irrigation which means that it takes into account changes in the adaptability of agricultural entities under water scarcity situations this will help to enrich the connotation of awpi 4 the proposed awpi by the research has the characteristics of convenient calculation and convenient data acquisition at the same time different from wpi awpi the proposed awpi also has an objective and unified weighting system which makes it easier to make intuitive comparisons between different regions 5 2 decomposition of the agricultural water poverty index according to the calculation results of the awpi and rawpi of 31 provinces municipalities in china there are obvious agricultural water poverty problems in some regions of china and there are large gaps in agricultural water poverty among different regions in this regard based on the internal logic of the awpi we decompose it based on its composition discuss in depth the practical factors affecting agricultural water poverty in these areas and indirectly confirm the reliability of the awpi proposed by research and innovation due to the large number of study areas for the sake of concision this study selects gansu shanxi jiangsu zhejiang liaoning and other regions for comparative discussion the agricultural water poverty issues in gansu and shanxi have been highlighted over the years the jiangsu and zhejiang regions have been ranked low in agricultural water poverty and have stable awpi values over the years liaoning fluctuates above and below the standard agricultural water poverty line regions with different agricultural water poverty conditions are selected to make the study representative fig 6 shows the changes in the adi of the five provinces of shanxi gansu zhejiang jiangsu and liaoning overall the adi curve of gansu province is the highest around the range of adi 0 7000 and the adi curve of zhejiang is the lowest the adi curve of liaoning province was close to that of shanxi before 2009 and then showed an increasing trend second only to the adi curve of gansu shanxi and jiangsu have alternated since 2016 the adi curve of shanxi surpassed that of jiangsu and the adi curve of jiangsu province remained within the range of adi 0 3000 that is from the perspective of agricultural development capability the agricultural development capability of zhejiang is obviously stronger than that of gansu shanxi liaoning and jiangsu and the agricultural development capability of gansu province is generally poor agricultural machinery plays an irreplaceable role in agricultural modernization houssou et al 2013 the ratio between the total power of agricultural machinery and the cultivated land area reflects the degree of development of agricultural production well as of 2019 the total power of agricultural machinery in gansu province had reached 2 1740 107 kw which is relatively large but the ratio of the total power of agricultural machinery to the cultivated land area was only 4 1730 kw ha far below the national average the ratios in liaoning and shanxi provinces are also relatively low 4 5420 and 3 9220 respectively while the ratios in jiangsu and zhejiang are relatively high 12 4997 and 14 7853 respectively based on this indicator gansu shanxi and liaoning have low levels of agricultural mechanization while jiangsu and zhejiang have relatively high levels of agricultural mechanization considering the economic structure of rural households in china s rural areas the volume of the agricultural labor force and the quality of the labor force the mortality rate of people under 60 in rural areas in gansu liaoning and jiangsu provinces was relatively high accounting for 6 04 6 02 and 5 84 in 2019 respectively the illiteracy rates were 14 85 2 63 and 7 19 respectively judging by the adi alone gansu has the worst agricultural development capability liaoning shanxi and jiangsu are relatively low and zhejiang has better development based on the analysis of the degree of agricultural water scarcity fig 7 the curve of the degree of agricultural water scarcity in shanxi and gansu provinces is significantly higher than that in liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang provinces indicating that from the perspective of agricultural water resource availability the situation in jiangsu and zhejiang is the best before 2011 the awsi in shanxi province was the largest from 2005 2011 the awsi in shanxi province fluctuated and decreased after 2011 the awsi in shanxi and gansu alternated however the degree of agricultural water scarcity in the liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang areas is relatively low the awsi curve of the liaoning area is generally higher than that of the jiangsu and zhejiang areas close to awsi 0 5000 the awsi curves of the jiangsu and zhejiang areas are very close and the overall curve is lower than awsi 0 5000 in 2019 the water available for agriculture in gansu province was close to 9 1700 109 cu m but the demand for agricultural irrigation water was as high as 1 3137 1010 cu m the water available for agriculture in shanxi province was 4 8700 109 cu m and the demand for agricultural irrigation water was 8 9360 109 cu m reflecting an enormous gap between supply and demand the agricultural water available in liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang all meet the demand for agricultural irrigation water from the perspective of supply and demand with regard to the relative awsi gansu and shanxi provinces are extremely deficient while the liaoning jiangsu and zhejiang regions have a relatively low awsi and a strong availability of agricultural water resources based on the average awpi of all regions the awpi is ranked as follows gansu shanxi liaoning jiangsu zhejiang according to the results of the index decomposition for the regions exemplified in this study there are three main paths leading to the occurrence of agricultural water poverty in various regions the first is mainly due to the lack of agricultural water resources shanxi the second is due to both water scarcity and insufficient capability for agricultural development gansu and the third is mainly due to the weak agricultural development capability liaoning finally the lack of agricultural water entitlement leads to agricultural water poverty in reality the climatic and environmental conditions economic conditions and resource endowments of different regions are different which makes the path of occurrence of agricultural water poverty different and also leads to regional differences in agricultural water poverty across china for example gansu is located in an arid and semiarid area with a large regional span and the distribution of water resources within the region is not coordinated in 2019 the total water resources in gansu were 3 2590 1010 cu m and the total per capita water resources were 1233 5000 cu m limited by climatic conditions agricultural production in gansu province requires a large amount of water and water resources have become an important factor restricting the development of regional agricultural industries shanxi province is located in the northern part of the yellow river basin and is a major province with heavy industrial development the overall water resources are in a state of shortage in 2019 the total water resources were 9 7300 109 cu m and the total per capita water resources were only 261 3000 cu m the water supply structure is irrational regardless of whether it is domestic water or agricultural production water water resources are very tight therefore facing the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in various regions of china we should realize that the occurrence of agricultural water poverty in different regions may have different paths and we should identify agricultural water poverty in combination with the scarcity of regional agricultural water resources and the development capacity of agricultural production to judge the seriousness of regional agricultural water poverty and ultimately realize the effective governance of agricultural water poverty in various regions at the same time the research and analysis results and discussion also indirectly explain the rationality of the awpi innovatively constructed in this study 5 3 relative agricultural water poverty governance based on relative poverty theory this research defines and measures relative agricultural water poverty the results show that the change trend of the rawpi of china is not obvious the differences in agricultural water poverty among regions are very large and some regions of china are still in the dilemma of relative agricultural water poverty therefore it is very important to realize the governance of agricultural water poverty in key areas narrow the regional gap and achieve regional balanced and full development the concept of relative agricultural water poverty comes from the relative poverty theory and its essence is the relative gap between regions in agricultural water poverty therefore in the hope of achieving the governance of relative agricultural water poverty the first problem to be solved is to identify those areas with severe relative agricultural water poverty the second is targeted management of agricultural water poverty in these areas among them the region identification problem has been solved in the above analysis the focus is on how to target these areas with relatively serious agricultural water poverty problems among them the discussion on the path of agricultural water poverty in 5 2 has certain enlightenment combined with the discussion results in 5 2 the occurrence path of agricultural water poverty in different regions is different which may be caused by the lack of agricultural water resources shanxi it may also be caused by the lack of agricultural development capability liaoning or due to the scarcity of water resources and the weaker agricultural development capability gansu therefore there are differences in governance models in different regions for regions with agricultural water scarcity we can improve supporting water conservancy facilities and increase farmland irrigation conditions through cross regional water resource allocation at the same time we can also adjust the agricultural planting structure accordingly to address the problem of agricultural water scarcity for areas with weak agricultural development capability we can adjust the agricultural industrial structure develop water saving agriculture increase investment in agricultural science and technology strengthen the application of agricultural technology and continuously improve agricultural development capability at the same time it is also necessary to continuously improve the relevant social security system improve the agricultural subsidy system and ensure the basic water rights and capabilities of regional farmers therefore in the final stage the effective governance of relative agricultural water poverty can be realized 6 conclusion the research takes the lead in defining agricultural water poverty constructs a new awpi from the two aspects of agricultural water resource scarcity and agricultural development capability and discusses the relevant characteristics of the awpi in addition the research proposes the concept of relative agricultural water poverty adopts methods such as spatial autocorrelation and takes china as an example to measure and analyze the regional differences in china s agricultural water poverty finally by disassembling the awpi the research also discusses and analyzes the occurrence and governance of agricultural water poverty therefore the detailed conclusions of this study are as follows 1 agricultural water poverty is completely defined as follows in the process of agricultural production and operation residents lack the capability or entitlement to obtain agricultural water which leads to poverty 2 the awpi proposed by the research focuses on the agricultural field and introduces indicators such as socioeconomic capacity which is innovative in the design of indicators moreover the awpi has a uniform weight system which makes it easy to make objective comparisons between regions and greatly enriches the connotation of agricultural water poverty 3 the regional differences in agricultural water poverty in china are quite large serious problems are mainly concentrated in areas such as north china northwest china and southwest china showing a spatial distribution characterized by low value areas surrounding high value areas the number of areas with severe agricultural water poverty problems is large and such problems last for a long time 4 agricultural water poverty has obvious spatial effects rather than being randomly distributed china s agricultural water poverty overall has negative global spatial autocorrelation the spatial correlation patterns of agricultural water poverty in some regions show differences and there is obvious spatial heterogeneity among regions 5 china s rawpi fluctuates around high values the gap in agricultural water poverty between regions has not narrowed and the contradiction between relative agricultural water poverty is prominent 6 the occurrence paths of agricultural water poverty in different regions are different the causes of agricultural water poverty in different regions should be identified based on the specific conditions of agricultural water scarcity and agricultural development capability to achieve effective governance of agricultural water poverty declaration of competing interest the authors

corresponding authors handling editor xiying zhang drip irrigation under film mulch diufm and subsurface pipe drainage spd are important measures to cope with water shortages and soil salinization in arid areas of northwest china to investigate the coordinated operation mode of diufm and spd a new h2dswap model was developed based on coupling the hydrus 2d with a soil water atmosphere plant model swap in the h2dswap model real time evapotranspiration simple root growth and the interaction between crops and soil water and salt are considered to improve the simulation accuracy the model was calibrated and validated using parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis software pest using field experiment datasets in 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the original hydrus 2d model the simulation accuracy of the h2dswap for soil water root mean square error rmse 0 011 cm3 cm 3 mean absolute error mae 0 008 cm3 cm 3 determinant coefficient r2 0 869 and soil salt rmse 0 296 g kg 1 mae

predict salt transport at depths of 0 100 cm and the change in maize yield under diufm the results indicated that maize yield decreased yearly and soil salinity increased yearly under diufm without spd based on the obtained results the management strategies of winter irrigation wir under different drip irrigation water amounts namely 600 mm s1 540 mm s2 480 mm s3 and 420 mm s4 were further investigated water productivity wp and yield were used as evaluation indices the wir was carried out every 4 5 years when the drip irrigation amount of the maize field was s1 and s2 was recommended however it was recommended to carry out wir every 2 and 3 years under s3 and s4 respectively overall the h2dswap model can be used as a useful tool to guide the operation mode of drip irrigation under mulch and subsurface pipe drainage in saline soils keywords drip irrigation under film mulch subsurface pipe drainage hydrus 2d swap water productivity 1 introduction water shortages are an important factor restricting agricultural development in arid and semiarid regions around the world chen et al 2010 wang et al 2011 in recent years water saving irrigation technology has been heavily developed as a new type of agricultural water saving technology drip irrigation under film mulch diufm is an important measure to address the challenge of water scarcity hou et al 2010 selecting the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china as an example the area of diufm application in xinjiang exceeded 2 million hectares up to 2019 and the types of crops applied include food crops industrial crops fruit trees and flowers tiwari et al 2003 yaghi et al 2013 steinmetz et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 compared with traditional drip irrigation diufm has the advantages of saving water and fertilizer preserving heat and moisture li et al 2010 fan et al 2017 and promoting crop growth effectively however unlike traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation border irrigation and furrow irrigation diufm has a higher frequency of irrigation but a small amount of water per irrigation which changes the soil water and salt transport characteristics li et al 2004 majumdar et al 2019 diufm mainly has a certain leaching effect on the shallow root zone cai et al 2002 but the salt in the shallow soil cannot be removed when it accumulates in the deep layer especially under brackish water irrigation there may be a risk of soil salinization dudley et al 2008 chen et al 2010 tan et al 2009 conducted diufm for 4 years and found that the salinity of the soil profile was decreasing zhang et al 2008 applied diufm for 7 years and the results indicated that the salt in the soil profile showed a trend of accumulation year by year li et al 2012 reported that after 13 years of diufm the salt content of farmland soil will stabilize at a certain level previous studies have contradictory conclusions about whether diufm will lead to salt accumulation so it is necessary to determine the salt transport mechanism under diufm in xinjiang the traditional salinization control mode is to leach soil salt through flood irrigation in winter after the harvest of crops every year he et al 2016 qian et al 2021 previous studies have shown that winter irrigation wir can remove the salt below the root zone of crops to control the soil salt and prevent the occurrence of soil salinization qadir et al 2000 liu et al 2013 li et al 2016 in particular wir also has the effect of replenishing deep soil water and eliminating pests yichun et al 2007 however wir often requires a large amount of leaching water and the leaching quota often accounts for more than 1 3 of the annual water consumption and even reaches 1 2 ali and lovatt 1996 wu et al 2020 resulting in a large wastes of water resources in addition frequent flood irrigation will also result in the risk of soil fertility decline and soil erosion to reduce the amount of leaching water and improve the salt discharge efficiency wir combined with subsurface pipe drainage spd has been widely used during the past five years yu et al 2018 qian et al 2021 liu et al 2021 in saline areas spd can alleviate soil salinization by controlling groundwater levels given the effects of salt discharge by subsurface pipes it remains to be further studied whether it is necessary to conduct wir once a year after subsurface pipes are laid however field experiments are usually time consuming and laborious forkutsa et al 2009 li and ren 2019 therefore with the continued development of computing using the model is a convenient and efficient way to predict the operation mode of diufm combined with spd at present many models can be used to simulate spd including hydrus 2d drainmod saltmod swat etc bahçeci et al 2006 askar et al 2020 liu et al 2021 however drainmod saltmod swat etc cannot simulate the process of water and soil moisture conservation under diufm because there is no mulch module in these models in contrast of these models hydrus 2d has flexible boundary conditions tang et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2018 which can be used to describe the mulch condition of diufm as a result a large number of studies have applied hydrus 2d to the simulation of water heat and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated soils hanson et al 2006 selim et al 2012 šimůnek et al 2016 liu et al 2021 for example ajdary et al 2007 used hydrus 2d to simulate the process of soil nitrogen leaching in drip irrigation fertilization li et al 2015 used hydrus 2d to evaluate the water distribution characteristics of the soil profile in intercropping farmland under diufm he et al 2018 suggested that hydrus 2d can be used to simulate the water balance in maize fields under diufm through three years of field experiments in addition hydrus 2d was also used to evaluate the effect of biodegradable plastic film mulching on soil dynamic moisture in diufm farmland chen et al 2019a 2019b however hydrus 2d has no crop module so the interaction between crop growth and dynamic soil water and salt cannot be considered it may have a significant impact on the simulation accuracy of the model especially when applied to arid areas wang et al 2014 currently there are many studies on the integrated crop model and soil water flow model for example zhou et al 2012 integrated hydrus 1d and the crop model wofost to estimate crop yield soil water dynamics evaporation and transpiration however this model is only suitable for one dimensional simulation and cannot be applied to spd and diufm wöhling and schmitz 2007 coupled hydrus 2d and a crop model to predict surface flow subsurface flow and crop water absorption under furrow irrigation however the influence of soil salinity on the simulation accuracy was not considered wang et al 2014 coupled the two dimensional flow model chain 2d with the simple crop growth model epic to simulate soil water flow and crop growth under furrow irrigation previous integrated models mostly focused on the interaction between crop growth and soil moisture and seldom considered the influence of soil salinity on crop growth dokoohaki et al 2016 liu et al 2019 chen et al 2019a 2019b however most irrigation conditions considered in the above models are furrow irrigation and there are almost no coupled models considering the interaction of diufm and spd therefore coupling a two dimensional flow model that can simulate diufm and spd with a crop model considering the interaction between crop growth and soil water and salt actual evapotranspiration and yield is a major research aim of this study given the complexity of field experiments the crop module here is the soil water atmosphere plant swap model which is a deterministic hydrological model based on hydrological chemical and biological processes van dam et al 1997 swap model is widely used to simulate dynamic soil water solute transport field management measures and crop growth tedeschi and menenti 2002 verma et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 lei et al 2021 in particular the detailed crop module embedded in swap is developed based on the wofost model which can consider the impact of crop growth on soil water and salt transport van dam and feddes 2000 it can also calculate the actual evapotranspiration according to the real time status of soil moisture and salinity in the root zone of the crop utset et al 2004 kroes et al 2008 which can make up for the shortcomings of hydrus 2d that cannot consider real time evapotranspiration moreover swap can also consider crop yields which cannot be simulated in the hydrus 2d model in addition swap has a rich database of crop parameters that can be used to simulate the growth of maize tomato wheat and other crops therefore the objectives of this paper are to 1 integrate a model based on hydrus 2d and swap to simulate the dynamic soil water soil salt and crop growth under the combined action of diufm and spd 2 calibrate and validate the coupled model using two year field experiment data 3 use the calibrated and validated coupled h2dswap model to predict the salt accumulation trend and the change in crop yield affected by soil salt under diufm and 4 introduce the water productivity wp for evaluating the water use efficiency of crops under different wir scenarios after burying pipes and then obtain the optimized wir mode under different drip irrigation amounts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and description the experiments were conducted from may 2019 to november 2020 in the yanqi basin of xinjiang china its longitude and latitude are 86 27 e and 41 51 n respectively the yanqi basin is a typical temperate continental climate area which has the characteristics of sufficient sunshine drought conditions and reduced rainfall moreover the mean annual precipitation in this area is 73 1 mm the average annual temperature is 8 4 c and the mean annual evaporation is 1890 1 mm the groundwater table at the station is 1 2 3 0 m below the ground surface during the crop growth period soil salinization and water shortages are the main problems of agricultural development in this region 2 2 experimental design the experiments were divided into two parts one was the diufm experiment during the crop growth period and the other was the spd experiment during the noncrop period to control soil salinization 2 2 1 drip irrigation under film mulch the diufm experiments were conducted from may to september in 2019 and 2020 the types of crops planted are decided by the landowner accordingly maize was planted in 2019 and tomato was planted in 2020 the experimental design was completely random including three replicates of each treatment the width and spacing of the film mulch were 70 cm and 40 cm respectively to reduce costs each plastic mulch covered two maize rows and one drip line with a 30 cm emitter spacing the seed maize tomato row spacing was 20 cm and the planting spacing was 15 cm two irrigation treatments i e 100 w1 600 mm for maize and 500 mm for tomato and 90 w2 540 mm for maize and 450 mm for tomato of the local recommended irrigation amount were set the salinity level of the irrigation water was 0 35 ds m 1 additionally the maize was sown on may 15 and harvested on september 25 in 2019 the tomatoes were planted on may 17 and harvested on september 18 in 2020 moreover the fertilization amount and time were consistent with local conditions 2 2 2 subsurface pipe drainage the spd experiment was conducted from october to november in 2019 and 2020 after the crops were harvested to remove the salt accumulated during the growth period of crops through flood irrigation subsurface drainage was applied at the field with dimensions of 86 30 m in this experiment the buried depth of subsurface pipes was set to 1 1 m and the diameters of drainage pipes were 110 mm moreover three drainpipes were installed in the plot the slope of the subsurface pipe is 2 and the opening rate is 3 to prevent the subsurface pipes from being blocked by small soil particles a layer of nonwoven fabric was wrapped around each subsurface pipe the installation cost of drainage was high and required a large area due to limited resources and land the drainage system was not replicated in addition an observation well was installed in the field to observe the groundwater level to provide evidence for improving the effect of controlling salinization by spd the leaching water quota was consistent with local standards 2 2 3 data collection daily meteorological data including wind speed air temperature wind direction relative humidity shortwave radiation longwave radiation and precipitation were recorded hourly using an automatic weather station hobo campbell scientific inc usa installed about 1000 m away from the experimental plots the irrigation amount was controlled by water meters dn15lxs 15 50 f ningbo china specifically during the growing period of crops drip irrigation was conducted on may 23 jun 2 jun 16 jul 1 jul 12 jul 22 jul 31 aug 13 aug 19 and sep 18 in the 2019 season and on may 20 may 28 jun 7 jun 24 jul 5 jul 14 aug 1 and aug 13 in the 2020 season during spd the irrigation volume was 400 mm in october 2019 and october 2020 in particular the subsurface drainage of the central line was monitored and the external drainage pipeline served as a protection line to prevent the interaction between adjacent fields the subsurface drain flow volumes were monitored continuously with a tipping flowmeter qt 100 ml beijing china and drainage samples were collected every 2 h to measure the electrical conductivity ec data about soil distribution were measured by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments co ltd uk before experiments undisturbed soil within the depth of 0 100 cm was collected using a cutting ring to determine the soil bulk density table 1 soil samples were collected using a soil auger on may 27 jun 8 jun 22 jul 5 jul 20 aug 08 aug 25 sep 6 sep 19 oct 24 and nov 13 in 2019 and on may 17 may 31 jun 13 jun 28 jul 15 aug 4 aug 24 sep 20 oct 30 and nov 12 in 2020 to measure the soil water content based on the oven drying method at 105 c for 8 h and the soluble salt estimates were determined using a conductivity meter ec1 5 chen et al 2014 based on extracts with a 1 5 soil water ratio the soil sample locations were located 5 m away from the central drain line in the horizontal direction at each field soil samples 120 cm3 were taken under film mulches at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm in the vertical direction in addition during the crop phenology period the destructive sampling method 3 repetitions was used to determine the leaf area index lai crop height and aboveground biomass the crop yield was measured before harvest with three replications 2 3 the description of h2dswap model 2 3 1 subsurface flow and solute transport in h2dswap model we simulated

swap model contains simple and detailed crop growth modules in this study the crop yield was calculated using the detailed crop module which could calculate both potential yield and actual yield due to water and or salt stress kroes et al 2008 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the coupled h2dswap model was developed to simulate water flow salt transport and crop growth the simulation domain was rectangular in this study since the groundwater table was between 0 and 2 8 m the depth of the simulation domain was set to 3 m and the length was set according to the spacing of subsurface pipes 10 m the soil profile was divided into four different layers which were 0 40 40 80 80 100 and 100 300 cm respectively the initial values of soil salinity and moisture were measured before seeding table 1 the boundaries of the model were divided into two stages namely the crop growth period and the noncrop period the first stage crop growth period as shown in fig 1 the left and right sides of the simulation area were set as no flux boundaries and the lower boundary was set as a variable head boundary according to the change in groundwater level the upper boundary was set as a mixed boundary consisting of no flux variable flux and atmospheric boundary specifically the dripper wet area was set as a variable flux boundary a no flux boundary was applied under the mulch and an atmospheric boundary was established between the mulches the second stage nocrop period the settings of left and right boundaries were consistent with those of the first stage as illustrated in fig 1 before and after the wir stage the upper boundary was set as an atmospheric boundary and the bottom boundary was set as a variable head boundary during the wir stage the upper boundary was set as a variable flux boundary according to the measured inflow data and the bottom boundary was set as no flux boundary since the groundwater level had risen to the surface qian et al 2021 in addition the boundary of the subsurface pipe was set as the resistance layer boundary which was reported in liu et al 2021 it has been proved that the resistance layer boundary can greatly improve the simulation accuracy of spd 2 3 4 calculation procedures for the coupled model the coupled model is coded in external program subroutines written in fortran 90 which integrates soil water flow solute transport water drainage salt discharge and crop growth generally hydrus 2d and swap are run independently and the external codes are applied to transfer information between the two models using their input and output files it is worth emphasizing that the external program could also make hydrus 2d run outside the graphical user interface gui and convert the output binary files including pressure heads and water and salt contents into readable text files at the end of each time step using the days of crop growth as m and the simulation periods as n as an example the specific coupling process is shown in fig 2 1 first the simulation time steps of hydru 2d and swap are both set to 1 day 2 the parameters of the soil hydraulic and crop growth parameters are initialized and the initial input files of hydrus 2d and swap are read 3 during the crop growth period the swap model is iteratively coupled with the hydrus 2d soil module at each time step the external coupling codes run swap first and then allow hydrus 2d to receive daily evaporation transpiration and rooting depth from swap to update the input files specifically daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated by the penman formula embedded in swap which is divided into potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration based on the lai at the same time the rooting depth of the crop was calculated at the end of the swap model run the output files of evaporation transpiration and rooting depth are read and written into the input file format required by hydrus 2d then the coupling codes are used to run hydrus 2d the output files of hydrus 2d including soil salt contents and pressure heads are transferred to swap as the initial conditions of the next time step concretely i the simulation area is equally divided into 30 intervals along the vertical direction and ii the water pressure heads salinity values and coordinates corresponding to all nodes in each interval are read and written iii calculate the average values of water pressure heads and salt contents for each interval according to coordinates and iv write these values into the input file of the swap model 4 step 3 is repeated until the calculated days are greater than m then the calculation process of the growth period is ended 5 hydrus 2d was run to calculate soil water and salt movement during the noncrop period in particular hydrus 2d is also used to calculate the water drainage and salt discharge of subsurface pipes in addition daily soil evaporation is calculated by swap 6 the results of output files including the water and salt distribution of the soil profile and daily crop growth output results are printed after the completion of daily calculations 7 steps 3 to 6 are repeated until the simulation period is greater than n 2 3 5 parameter sensitivity analysis since there are many input parameters of the coupling model these parameters are time consuming and labor intensive to measure conducting a sensitivity analysis can determine whether these parameters have a significant influence on the output of the model which can reduce the number of parameters of the model needing to be calibrated and can improve the parameter calibration efficiency the initial or default parameters and observation dataset of field observations are used as the basic simulation in the soil module the input parameters include the soil water flow parameters θ r θ s α n and k s and the solute transport parameters d l and d t in the crop growth module the main parameters were selected from previous studies jiang et al 2016 xue and ren 2016 specifically the input crop parameters included in this study are the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis tsumea temperature sum from anthesis to maturity tsumam initial total crop dry weight tdwi leaf area index at emergence laiem initiation specific leaf area sla0 anthesis specific leaf area sla1 maturity specific leaf area sla2 extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light kdif

rms initial rooting depth rdi and maximum daily increase in rooting depth rri they are analyzed to investigate which parameters have a significant influence on crop yield and lai the one factor at a time oat method was selected to perform parameter sensitivity analysis with the variation scale of these parameters ranging from 10 10 an indicator e g the normalized sensitivity index rs used to evaluate the sensitivity of parameters was selected the rs can be written as follows 9 r s δ y y δ x x where x is the initial value of the independent variable x is the change value of the independent variable y is the initial value of the relevant dependent variable and y is the change value of the relevant dependent variable 2 3 6 calibration and validation in this simulation the day was chosen as the unit with the simulation period lasting from may 15 to nov 13 in 2019 calibration and may 17 to nov 12 in 2020 validation based on the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis the soil hydraulic and crop growth parameters were calibrated and validated in this study in particular the calibration process was first applied for water and salt movement of the soil profile water drainage and salt discharge process of subsurface pipe then for crop growth process and yield the initial input soil hydraulic parameters were calculated by rosetta lite v1 1 in hydrus according to the measured bulk density and particle size distribution of each soil layer the initial crop growth parameters were estimated from the crop database of the swap model and previously published studies during the simulation process the simulation values of the soil water content soil salt content cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux were obtained to calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters in addition lai and crop yield were also acquired for calibrating crop growth parameters subsequently the simulated values were compared with the measured values to evaluate the performance accuracy of the coupled model in the above processes the soil hydraulic parameters were determined using the multiobjective calibration method of the pest program which was described in detail in liu et al 2021 and the crop parameters were calibrated using the trial and error method after the parameters were calibrated the original hydrus 2d model was compared with h2dswap in simulating soil salt and water contents in the original hydrus 2d rooting depth varied with time based on the logistic growth function šimůnek et al 2018 and the spatial distribution was described using eq 8 the et p was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and eq 5 then et p was divided into e p and t p using eq 6 distinct from h2dswap e p and t p for the entire simulation cycle were input into hydrus 2d at one time when modeling in addition the simulation accuracy in lai was also compared between swap and h2dswap 2 3 7 evaluation indicators of simulation accuracy the simulation performance of the coupled model was evaluated using three indices including mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r 2 10 m a e i 1 n m i s i n 11 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n 12 r 2 i 1 n m i m s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 i n s i s 2 where m i is the measured value s i is the simulated value s is the mean of measured value and n is the number of samples the mae and rmse show the difference between measured and simulated values and the closer the two values are to 0 the better simulation performance the model will be in contrast the r 2 reflects the model accuracy suggesting unaccepted model performance when the value is lower than 0 5 2 4 numerical scenarios due to the drought low amount of rain and high evaporation intensity in xinjiang water resources are scarce hao et al 2009 an unreasonable wir cycle under spd often leads to a waste of water resources in this paper 20 scenarios were designed to investigate the salt accumulation effect of drip irrigation under plastic film on the main crop and optimize the salt leaching system under spd first in our design schemes diufm was carried out for 10 years without wir to predict the changing trend of soil salt content and crop yields second according to the obtained results see section 3 3 wir modes with cycles of 2 3 4 and 5 years were set up to explore the optimal winter mode in the growth period of the crop with a 10 gradient one full irrigation and three deficit irrigations were set namely s1 600 mm s2 540 mm s3 480 mm and s4 420 mm the amount of wir was consistent with our experiment moreover the different climatic conditions were also considered every year based on meteorological data from 2006 to 2015 http data cma cn the drain depth and spacing of the subsurface pipe were 1 1 m respectively the setting of boundary conditions and the physical properties of the soil are consistent with the field experiment in addition wp is used to evaluate the benefits of different wir cycles pereira et al 2012 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity according to previous studies 19 crop parameters and 7 soil hydraulic parameters khan and abbas 2007 noory et al 2011 qian et al 2021 were selected for parameter sensitivity analysis table 2 the results showed that lai and yield were more sensitive to the change in crop parameters while plant height was only sensitive to tsumea and tsumam therefore in the process of parameter calibration we should mainly focus on the values of lai and crop yield based on the order of parameter sensitivity lai was more sensitive to tsumea sla1 and cvs the results were similar to the study of xue and ren 2016 in addition it was found that kdif kdir and tsumam were also the three import parameters that had a significant effect on lai concerning the crop yields tsumea cvo and cvs were more sensitive other crop parameters had no significant effect on lai and yield in the soil module the sensitivity of the soil water content soil salt content cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux to the soil hydraulic parameters was also calculated the results indicated that swc ssc cwf and csf were all sensitive to θ s this result suggested that k s was another sensitive parameter that can affect ssc cwf and csf additionally the parameters α l and α t also highly influenced ssc the other remaining parameters had little effect on the four reference objective variables therefore 7 crop parameters tsumea tsumam sla1 kdif kdir cvo and cvs and 4 soil hydraulic parameters θ s k s α l and α t were calibrated and the calibrated parameters are listed in table 2 the other parameters were set to default values 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water content and soil salt content fig 3a b compare the measured and simulated values of soil water content swc and soil salt content ssc at depths of 15 30 60 and 90 cm in the soil profile during the model calibration stage it was found that the swc of the upper soil profile varies more than that of deep soil during the drip irrigation period the ssc of the upper soil profile significantly decreased which reflected the leaching effect of the film mulch drip irrigation on the salt however from harvest to wir the soil salt content showed obvious signs of increase moreover the accuracy of the hydrus 2d and h2dswap for simulating changes in swc and ssc was also compared as shown in fig 3 a relatively good agreement between the measured and simulated values was found by the coupled h2dswap model compared to hydrus 2d in addition the mean overall values of the statistical results of field experiment simulations with hydrus 2d and the coupled h2dswap model were listed in table 3 three indices i e rmse mae and r2 for the swc and ssc are used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of hydrus 2d and h2dswap as shown in table 3 concerning the hydrus 2d model the maes for swc and ssc were 0 019 cm3 cm 3 and 0 933 g kg 1 respectively in contrast the mae for the swc and ssc of h2dswap were 0 008 cm3 cm 3 and 0 231 g kg 1 respectively which were lower than those of the hydrus 2d model similar results were found in the comparison of rmse with the two models the rmse values of h2dswap were generally smaller than that of hydrus 2d additionally the r2 values of h2dswap were 0 869 for swc and 0 959 for ssc which were greater than those of the hydrus 2d model r2 for swc and ssc 0 775 and 0 833 respectively these results indicated that the coupled h2dswap model performed better in predicting the changes in swc and ssc than the hydrus 2d model from the foregoing it could be seen that the simulation effect of the coupled model was better so only the coupled model was validated during the model validation stage as shown in fig 4 the coupled model can better describe the change law of the swc and ssc in the soil profile it was found that the initial values of ssc in the soil profile were generally less than those of the previous year after wir in addition the values of mae rmse and r2 for swc and ssc in the soil profile are presented in table 3 the mae values for the coupled model were 0 014 cm3 cm 3 for swc and 0 225 for ssc the rmse values were 0 016 cm3 cm 3 for swc and 0 288 g kg 1 in addition the r2 values were 0 799 for swc and 0 915 for ssc although the r2 values in the validation stage were lower than those in the calibration stage the simulation accuracy was still within a satisfactory range overall the coupled h2dswap model could be used to predict the changing trends of the swc and ssc in the soil profile 3 2 2 lai and yield due to the inconsistency of the crops planted in the two years we selected the 2019 maize growth experiments under different irrigation treatments for calibration and validation fig 5 shows that during the calibration and validation stages the predicted and simulated values of lai were in good agreement the statistical values were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model table 3 compared with the original swap model the rmse and mae of h2dswap were 0 254 0 281 and 0 193 0 232 respectively which were lower than those of swap additionally the r2 for lai of h2dswap was greater than that of swap which showed that the accuracy of the coupled model in simulating lai has been greatly improved in contrast to the original swap model in the early growth stage of maize the leaf area index showed a trend of increasing gradually and reached its peak at 70 90 days after sowing in the later period over time the leaf area index decreased gradually in addition the lai of w2 was generally smaller than that of w1 because the irrigation amount of the w2 treatment was smaller than that of the w1 treatment as shown in table 4 the simulated value of yield at the calibration stage was 9 43 t ha 1 which was smaller than the measured value and the simulated value of yield at the validation stage was 8 54 t ha 1 which was larger than the measured value however the standard deviations of the two simulation values were 0 45 and 0 68 t ha 1 respectively so the simulation accuracy of the crop yield of the coupled model was acceptable in conclusion the coupled h2dswap model could be used to predict the growth of crops 3 3 salt accumulation in different drip irrigation years fig 6 shows the dynamic changes in the soil salt content at depths of 0 40 and 40 100 cm under diufm conditions over 1 10 years in the absence of wir the soil salt content shows a trend of accumulation year by year during drip irrigation salt in shallow soil was leached to deep soil although the use of diufm during the crop growth period is beneficial to the leaching of salt the strong soil evaporation during the longer nongrowing period would still cause the phenomenon of soil return to salt with the decrease of drip irrigation water volume the accumulation rate of soil salinity in the shallow root layer of crops 0 40 cm showed an increasing trend in the first 5 years of drip irrigation s1 s4 increased at rates of 3 05 6 85 5 97 9 68 8 62 12 23 and 11 48 14 70 respectively and the average increasing rate in the latter was higher than that in the previous five years overall the growth rate of s1 was the smallest therefore increasing the amount of drip irrigation is beneficial to slow down the trend of shallow soil salinization the accumulation of soil salt has a significant impact on crop grain yield hereafter referred to as yield fig 7 depicts the change in crop grain yield under different drip irrigation years in general crop yields increase with increasing drip irrigation water with increasing time crop yields show a gradual decreasing trend during the first three years the crop yield decreased by 1 4 10 2 under each irrigation amount which was within the acceptable range in 4 5 years crop yields fell by 17 2 32 4 and there has been a serious reduction in production due to the shortage of water resources in xinjiang a large amount of water is needed for the wir to save water implementing the wir every 2 5 years is preliminarily considered 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation due to its flexible boundary conditions the hydrus 2d model is often used to simulate soil water and salt transport experiments under diufm and spd tang et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2018 evapotranspiration is an important factor affecting salt transport and salt stress also restricts water absorption by crops snapp and shennan 1992 bazihizina et al 2012 robin et al 2016 however the hydrus 2d model could not simulate crop growth and the values of evapotranspiration often depended on the initial input of users šimůnek et al 2011 so its real time dynamic changes were ignored in addition the swap model can dynamically calculate lai soil evaporation and crop transpiration according to time variation but it cannot consider the boundary of the mulch and simulate spd on a two dimensional scale therefore given the advantages of the hydrus 2d and swap models we coupled the hydrus 2d and swap models to improve the simulation accuracy of soil water and salt transport and crop growth compared with the hydrus 2d model our research results showed that the coupled h2dswap model could greatly improve the simulation accuracy of soil profile moisture and salinity from fig 3 both models could describe the changes in soil moisture and salinity well in the early stage of crop growth in the later stage hydrus 2d significantly underestimated the salt content in the soil profile the results were similar to the findings of vrugt et al 2001 the reason was that the lai would vary at different crop growth stages de willigen et al 2002 which could significantly affect the actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation variations in evapotranspiration affected the movement of soil moisture and salinity however the hydrus 2d model could not simulate the dynamic changes in lai or evapotranspiration which reduced the simulation accuracy of the model in contrast h2dswap could correct the inputs of evaporation and transpiration in time through real time calculation of lai irmak and kamble 2009 wang et al 2020 to improve the simulation accuracy of the model similar to the h2dswap model li et al 2019 modified the crop evapotranspiration of the csm cropgro cotton model based on the redistribution of evapotranspiration in a cotton field covered with plastic film the results indicated that the accuracy of the improved model in simulating soil moisture was improved wang et al 2014 also obtained good simulation results of soil moisture by coupling the two dimensional flow model with the crop growth model which could consider dynamic evapotranspiration although the above simulation results were reliable they were all based on water content ignoring the change in salt content in the soil profile however salt is an important factor affecting crop growth studies have shown that salt stress can affect crop respiration hopmans et al 2021 when the salt concentration in the root zone was too high the respiration of crops would weaken and evapotranspiration would decrease in the coupled h2dswap model hydrus 2d could transfer the real time change in the soil salt concentration to swap which would influence the change in crop evapotranspiration in turn the change in evapotranspiration would react to hydrus 2d thus affecting the movement of soil water and salt through the abovementioned real time correction process the coupled model greatly improved the simulation accuracy of soil water salt dynamics and crop growth therefore our model can provide technical guidance for the study of long term soil water and salt changes under diufm in northwest semiarid and arid areas of china 4 2 effects of drip irrigation under mulch on soil salinity and crop yield in this study there were two main sources of salt in the soil one was from brackish water irrigation and the other was from shallow groundwater in similar studies some scholars believe that long term diufm would cause a decrease in salt content within 0 100 cm and would finally be stable at a certain level li et al 2012 2021 tan et al 2009 these conclusions are contradictory to our research fig 6 they performed wir during the noncrop period but ignored the effect of wir on soil desalination our research indicated that long term diufm without wir would cause the accumulation of soil salt content this was because diufm was local irrigation and usually water only penetrated below the root zone without deep percolation in the long term soil salt would accumulate in a deeper place with the flow of irrigation water in addition film mulching could preserve soil moisture and prevent soil evaporation which could effectively reduce the salt accumulation effect caused by soil evaporation during the crop growth period therefore high frequency diufm was beneficial to control the salt content in shallow soil 0 40 cm and even achieve the effect of salt desalination and with the increase in irrigation amount the effect of salt leaching was more obvious fig 6 a similar result was also reported in phogat et al 2017 however after the crops were harvested the results showed that the soil at the 0 40 cm depth exhibited salt return fig 6 this is because to maintain a good farmland environment farmers often removed the plastic film resulting in bare land when entering the fallow period strong soil evaporation would cause the salt in soil water and groundwater to move upward resulting in the accumulation of soil salt there are many hazards caused by soil salt accumulation the most serious of which is the decrease in crop yield wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 there was a negative correlation between maize yield and drip irrigation years studies have shown that the increase in salt in soil water is the reason for the decrease in maize yield feng et al 2017 cucci et al 2019 in this study with the increase in drip irrigation years the salt content in the soil gradually increased the increase in soil salinity resulted in a decrease in maize yield overall the four irrigation treatments had no obvious yield reduction in the previous two years fig 7 with time the yield of maize greatly decreased fig 7 this was because the increase in salt in the soil decreased the water use efficiency of maize khataar et al 2018 ramezanifar et al 2021 although the irrigation amount was sufficient salt stress still caused insufficient water uptake in maize which resulted in yield reduction therefore to maintain the yield of maize at a reasonable level the necessary salt leaching and discharging measures must be implemented 4 3 operation mode of drip irrigation under film mulch and salt discharge of subsurface drainage fig 8a d show the variation in salinity in the soil at the 0 100 cm depth and the characteristics of crop wp under different wir cycles spd could effectively reduce the salt content of the soil sharma et al 2000 liu et al 2021 qian et al 2021 thereby slowing the salt accumulation trend of diufm in this study a 2 year wir allowed the salinity in the soil to be maintained at a low level between approximately 1 and 4 g kg 1 as the wir cycle became longer the soil salinity still showed a tendency to accumulate year by year this is the result of soil evaporation and groundwater salt return yimit et al 2011 yan et al 2015 under the 3 5 year wir mode although the accumulation of salts was effectively controlled the salinity of each treatment exceeded the initial value to varying degrees at the end of each wir cycle as the amount of drip irrigation water decreased therefore corresponding wir strategies should be made for different drip irrigation water quantities in similar studies where the salt control effect of diufm combined with spd was investigated heng et al 2018 indicated that spd under drip irrigation performed better than flood irrigation and xiaowen wang et al 2020 z wang et al 2020 demonstrated that a leaching amount of 1000 1230 mm with a drain spacing of 15 m was recommended for reducing salinity these studies mainly adopted the mode of irrigation once or multiple times a year which tended to waste water resources in our research different wir cycles according to various drip irrigation amounts were established based on the evaluation of wp in the mode with wir every 2 years crop wp was similar for all irrigation treatments although the yield could be maintained at a high level the crop wp was generally smaller than that of the treatments with a wir cycle of 3 5 years in the mode with a 3 year wir cycle the wp of the s3 treatment was maximum and could be maintained at a high level at a wir cycle of 4 years although s1 was close to s2 the s2 treatment obtained the best prediction compared to the other treatments when wir was conducted once every 5 years the crop wp showed a gradual decrease with increasing drip irrigation years during a wir cycle however in general the s2 treatment was higher than the other irrigation treatments therefore to obtain the best effect of saving water and increasing production we recommend that the wir be carried out once every 4 5 years under the s1 and s2 treatments once every 3 years under the s3 treatment and once every 2 years under the s4 treatment compared with the implementation of wir once a year our suggested operation mode could save water by 6 4 12 2 on average annually fig 9 4 4 limitations compared with the single hydrus 2d and swap models the accuracy of the coupled h2dswap model in simulating the dynamic changes in water and salt and crop growth has been greatly improved but there are still some limitations the change in root length in the coupled model was calculated based on the simple root growth module in swap which lacked simulation accuracy therefore the detailed root growth module will be involved in our follow up investigation in the calibration of soil water and salt there was a lack of data monitoring of soil water and salt during the fallow period of the field automatic monitoring equipment such as tdr should be set up in the follow up study to automatically monitor the changes in water and salt in this study the coupled model was calibrated and validated by drip irrigation experiments in the future the coupled model should be evaluated by different irrigation conditions such as flood irrigation furrow irrigation and border irrigation in addition it is worth considering setting more salt levels to evaluate the performance of the coupled model in simulating the growth of crops under salt stress 5 conclusion in this study we coupled a two dimensional flow model hydrus 2d with a crop model swap which could consider diufm spd and the interaction between crop growth and salinity field experimental data from 2019 to 2020 were used to calibrate and validate the coupled h2dswap model the simulated dynamic soil water content soil salt content lai and yield values were evaluated against experimental observations the calibration and validation results showed that compared with the original hydrus 2d model the accuracy of simulation in dynamic soil moisture and salinity has been greatly improved using the coupled h2dswap model after calibration and validation the coupled model was used to investigate the soil salt movement characteristics and crop yield changes under long term diufm with different irrigation amounts the results indicated that under the condition of no leaching salt in winter after the maize was harvested the soil salt under diufm increased yearly but the crop yield decreased with every passing year the yield reduction in the first year was not obvious so salt leaching can be omitted from the fifth year the yield of crops under different irrigation amounts has been reduced by 32 4 at the highest and the necessary wir leaching measures should be implemented in addition the appropriate operation mode of wirs with different drip irrigation water volumes was also investigated in this study in view of crop yield and wp we suggest that wir should be carried out every 4 5 years when the drip irrigation amount of the maize field is s1 and s2 when the irrigation amount is s3 and s4 it is recommended to conduct wir every 2 and 3 years respectively in summary the coupled h2dswap model can be used to guide the operation mode of diufm and spd in northwest china however although the simulation accuracy of the coupled model has been improved the universality of the coupled model needs further study in the future we need to conduct experimental research in different areas and further verify the model with a large amount number of field data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

corresponding authors handling editor xiying zhang drip irrigation under film mulch diufm and subsurface pipe drainage spd are important measures to cope with water shortages and soil salinization in arid areas of northwest china to investigate the coordinated operation mode of diufm and spd a new h2dswap model was developed based on coupling the hydrus 2d with a soil water atmosphere plant model swap in the h2dswap model real time evapotranspiration simple root growth and the interaction between crops and soil water and salt are considered to improve the simulation accuracy the model was calibrated and validated using parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis software pest using field experiment datasets in 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the original hydrus 2d model the simulation accuracy of the h2dswap for soil water root mean square error rmse 0 011 cm3 cm 3 mean absolute error mae 0 008 cm3 cm 3 determinant coefficient r2 0 869 and soil salt rmse 0 296 g kg 1 mae

predict salt transport at depths of 0 100 cm and the change in maize yield under diufm the results indicated that maize yield decreased yearly and soil salinity increased yearly under diufm without spd based on the obtained results the management strategies of winter irrigation wir under different drip irrigation water amounts namely 600 mm s1 540 mm s2 480 mm s3 and 420 mm s4 were further investigated water productivity wp and yield were used as evaluation indices the wir was carried out every 4 5 years when the drip irrigation amount of the maize field was s1 and s2 was recommended however it was recommended to carry out wir every 2 and 3 years under s3 and s4 respectively overall the h2dswap model can be used as a useful tool to guide the operation mode of drip irrigation under mulch and subsurface pipe drainage in saline soils keywords drip irrigation under film mulch subsurface pipe drainage hydrus 2d swap water productivity 1 introduction water shortages are an important factor restricting agricultural development in arid and semiarid regions around the world chen et al 2010 wang et al 2011 in recent years water saving irrigation technology has been heavily developed as a new type of agricultural water saving technology drip irrigation under film mulch diufm is an important measure to address the challenge of water scarcity hou et al 2010 selecting the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china as an example the area of diufm application in xinjiang exceeded 2 million hectares up to 2019 and the types of crops applied include food crops industrial crops fruit trees and flowers tiwari et al 2003 yaghi et al 2013 steinmetz et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 compared with traditional drip irrigation diufm has the advantages of saving water and fertilizer preserving heat and moisture li et al 2010 fan et al 2017 and promoting crop growth effectively however unlike traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation border irrigation and furrow irrigation diufm has a higher frequency of irrigation but a small amount of water per irrigation which changes the soil water and salt transport characteristics li et al 2004 majumdar et al 2019 diufm mainly has a certain leaching effect on the shallow root zone cai et al 2002 but the salt in the shallow soil cannot be removed when it accumulates in the deep layer especially under brackish water irrigation there may be a risk of soil salinization dudley et al 2008 chen et al 2010 tan et al 2009 conducted diufm for 4 years and found that the salinity of the soil profile was decreasing zhang et al 2008 applied diufm for 7 years and the results indicated that the salt in the soil profile showed a trend of accumulation year by year li et al 2012 reported that after 13 years of diufm the salt content of farmland soil will stabilize at a certain level previous studies have contradictory conclusions about whether diufm will lead to salt accumulation so it is necessary to determine the salt transport mechanism under diufm in xinjiang the traditional salinization control mode is to leach soil salt through flood irrigation in winter after the harvest of crops every year he et al 2016 qian et al 2021 previous studies have shown that winter irrigation wir can remove the salt below the root zone of crops to control the soil salt and prevent the occurrence of soil salinization qadir et al 2000 liu et al 2013 li et al 2016 in particular wir also has the effect of replenishing deep soil water and eliminating pests yichun et al 2007 however wir often requires a large amount of leaching water and the leaching quota often accounts for more than 1 3 of the annual water consumption and even reaches 1 2 ali and lovatt 1996 wu et al 2020 resulting in a large wastes of water resources in addition frequent flood irrigation will also result in the risk of soil fertility decline and soil erosion to reduce the amount of leaching water and improve the salt discharge efficiency wir combined with subsurface pipe drainage spd has been widely used during the past five years yu et al 2018 qian et al 2021 liu et al 2021 in saline areas spd can alleviate soil salinization by controlling groundwater levels given the effects of salt discharge by subsurface pipes it remains to be further studied whether it is necessary to conduct wir once a year after subsurface pipes are laid however field experiments are usually time consuming and laborious forkutsa et al 2009 li and ren 2019 therefore with the continued development of computing using the model is a convenient and efficient way to predict the operation mode of diufm combined with spd at present many models can be used to simulate spd including hydrus 2d drainmod saltmod swat etc bahçeci et al 2006 askar et al 2020 liu et al 2021 however drainmod saltmod swat etc cannot simulate the process of water and soil moisture conservation under diufm because there is no mulch module in these models in contrast of these models hydrus 2d has flexible boundary conditions tang et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2018 which can be used to describe the mulch condition of diufm as a result a large number of studies have applied hydrus 2d to the simulation of water heat and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated soils hanson et al 2006 selim et al 2012 šimůnek et al 2016 liu et al 2021 for example ajdary et al 2007 used hydrus 2d to simulate the process of soil nitrogen leaching in drip irrigation fertilization li et al 2015 used hydrus 2d to evaluate the water distribution characteristics of the soil profile in intercropping farmland under diufm he et al 2018 suggested that hydrus 2d can be used to simulate the water balance in maize fields under diufm through three years of field experiments in addition hydrus 2d was also used to evaluate the effect of biodegradable plastic film mulching on soil dynamic moisture in diufm farmland chen et al 2019a 2019b however hydrus 2d has no crop module so the interaction between crop growth and dynamic soil water and salt cannot be considered it may have a significant impact on the simulation accuracy of the model especially when applied to arid areas wang et al 2014 currently there are many studies on the integrated crop model and soil water flow model for example zhou et al 2012 integrated hydrus 1d and the crop model wofost to estimate crop yield soil water dynamics evaporation and transpiration however this model is only suitable for one dimensional simulation and cannot be applied to spd and diufm wöhling and schmitz 2007 coupled hydrus 2d and a crop model to predict surface flow subsurface flow and crop water absorption under furrow irrigation however the influence of soil salinity on the simulation accuracy was not considered wang et al 2014 coupled the two dimensional flow model chain 2d with the simple crop growth model epic to simulate soil water flow and crop growth under furrow irrigation previous integrated models mostly focused on the interaction between crop growth and soil moisture and seldom considered the influence of soil salinity on crop growth dokoohaki et al 2016 liu et al 2019 chen et al 2019a 2019b however most irrigation conditions considered in the above models are furrow irrigation and there are almost no coupled models considering the interaction of diufm and spd therefore coupling a two dimensional flow model that can simulate diufm and spd with a crop model considering the interaction between crop growth and soil water and salt actual evapotranspiration and yield is a major research aim of this study given the complexity of field experiments the crop module here is the soil water atmosphere plant swap model which is a deterministic hydrological model based on hydrological chemical and biological processes van dam et al 1997 swap model is widely used to simulate dynamic soil water solute transport field management measures and crop growth tedeschi and menenti 2002 verma et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 lei et al 2021 in particular the detailed crop module embedded in swap is developed based on the wofost model which can consider the impact of crop growth on soil water and salt transport van dam and feddes 2000 it can also calculate the actual evapotranspiration according to the real time status of soil moisture and salinity in the root zone of the crop utset et al 2004 kroes et al 2008 which can make up for the shortcomings of hydrus 2d that cannot consider real time evapotranspiration moreover swap can also consider crop yields which cannot be simulated in the hydrus 2d model in addition swap has a rich database of crop parameters that can be used to simulate the growth of maize tomato wheat and other crops therefore the objectives of this paper are to 1 integrate a model based on hydrus 2d and swap to simulate the dynamic soil water soil salt and crop growth under the combined action of diufm and spd 2 calibrate and validate the coupled model using two year field experiment data 3 use the calibrated and validated coupled h2dswap model to predict the salt accumulation trend and the change in crop yield affected by soil salt under diufm and 4 introduce the water productivity wp for evaluating the water use efficiency of crops under different wir scenarios after burying pipes and then obtain the optimized wir mode under different drip irrigation amounts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and description the experiments were conducted from may 2019 to november 2020 in the yanqi basin of xinjiang china its longitude and latitude are 86 27 e and 41 51 n respectively the yanqi basin is a typical temperate continental climate area which has the characteristics of sufficient sunshine drought conditions and reduced rainfall moreover the mean annual precipitation in this area is 73 1 mm the average annual temperature is 8 4 c and the mean annual evaporation is 1890 1 mm the groundwater table at the station is 1 2 3 0 m below the ground surface during the crop growth period soil salinization and water shortages are the main problems of agricultural development in this region 2 2 experimental design the experiments were divided into two parts one was the diufm experiment during the crop growth period and the other was the spd experiment during the noncrop period to control soil salinization 2 2 1 drip irrigation under film mulch the diufm experiments were conducted from may to september in 2019 and 2020 the types of crops planted are decided by the landowner accordingly maize was planted in 2019 and tomato was planted in 2020 the experimental design was completely random including three replicates of each treatment the width and spacing of the film mulch were 70 cm and 40 cm respectively to reduce costs each plastic mulch covered two maize rows and one drip line with a 30 cm emitter spacing the seed maize tomato row spacing was 20 cm and the planting spacing was 15 cm two irrigation treatments i e 100 w1 600 mm for maize and 500 mm for tomato and 90 w2 540 mm for maize and 450 mm for tomato of the local recommended irrigation amount were set the salinity level of the irrigation water was 0 35 ds m 1 additionally the maize was sown on may 15 and harvested on september 25 in 2019 the tomatoes were planted on may 17 and harvested on september 18 in 2020 moreover the fertilization amount and time were consistent with local conditions 2 2 2 subsurface pipe drainage the spd experiment was conducted from october to november in 2019 and 2020 after the crops were harvested to remove the salt accumulated during the growth period of crops through flood irrigation subsurface drainage was applied at the field with dimensions of 86 30 m in this experiment the buried depth of subsurface pipes was set to 1 1 m and the diameters of drainage pipes were 110 mm moreover three drainpipes were installed in the plot the slope of the subsurface pipe is 2 and the opening rate is 3 to prevent the subsurface pipes from being blocked by small soil particles a layer of nonwoven fabric was wrapped around each subsurface pipe the installation cost of drainage was high and required a large area due to limited resources and land the drainage system was not replicated in addition an observation well was installed in the field to observe the groundwater level to provide evidence for improving the effect of controlling salinization by spd the leaching water quota was consistent with local standards 2 2 3 data collection daily meteorological data including wind speed air temperature wind direction relative humidity shortwave radiation longwave radiation and precipitation were recorded hourly using an automatic weather station hobo campbell scientific inc usa installed about 1000 m away from the experimental plots the irrigation amount was controlled by water meters dn15lxs 15 50 f ningbo china specifically during the growing period of crops drip irrigation was conducted on may 23 jun 2 jun 16 jul 1 jul 12 jul 22 jul 31 aug 13 aug 19 and sep 18 in the 2019 season and on may 20 may 28 jun 7 jun 24 jul 5 jul 14 aug 1 and aug 13 in the 2020 season during spd the irrigation volume was 400 mm in october 2019 and october 2020 in particular the subsurface drainage of the central line was monitored and the external drainage pipeline served as a protection line to prevent the interaction between adjacent fields the subsurface drain flow volumes were monitored continuously with a tipping flowmeter qt 100 ml beijing china and drainage samples were collected every 2 h to measure the electrical conductivity ec data about soil distribution were measured by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments co ltd uk before experiments undisturbed soil within the depth of 0 100 cm was collected using a cutting ring to determine the soil bulk density table 1 soil samples were collected using a soil auger on may 27 jun 8 jun 22 jul 5 jul 20 aug 08 aug 25 sep 6 sep 19 oct 24 and nov 13 in 2019 and on may 17 may 31 jun 13 jun 28 jul 15 aug 4 aug 24 sep 20 oct 30 and nov 12 in 2020 to measure the soil water content based on the oven drying method at 105 c for 8 h and the soluble salt estimates were determined using a conductivity meter ec1 5 chen et al 2014 based on extracts with a 1 5 soil water ratio the soil sample locations were located 5 m away from the central drain line in the horizontal direction at each field soil samples 120 cm3 were taken under film mulches at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm in the vertical direction in addition during the crop phenology period the destructive sampling method 3 repetitions was used to determine the leaf area index lai crop height and aboveground biomass the crop yield was measured before harvest with three replications 2 3 the description of h2dswap model 2 3 1 subsurface flow and solute transport in h2dswap model we simulated water flow using modified richards equation which can be numerically solved using the finite element method and can be written as follows 1 θ t x i k k i j a h x j k i z a s where θ is the volumetric

equation allen et al 1998 is applied to calculate potential crop evapotranspiration et 0 which can be used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration et p as follows 5 e t p k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient which can be obtained from allen et al 1998 based on the leaf area index lai during the crop growth stages the et p is divided into potential transpiration t p and potential evaporation e p according to the input requirements of the h2dswap model as follows 6 e p 1 e k l a i e t p t p e t p e p where k is the radiation coefficient the root water uptake rate can be calculated from feddes et al 1978 7 s x z h α x z h b x z l t t p where the α x z h is the soil water stress response function which can be from the feddes model b x z is the normalized water uptake distribution l 2 l t is the width of soil surface associated with the transpiration process l t p is the potential transpiration l t 1 the root distribution function b x z can be defined as follows vrugt et al 2001 8 b x z 1 x x m t 1 z z m t e p x x m t x x p z z m t z z where x m t and z m t are the maximum rooting length and depth in a horizontal and vertical direction related to time t l x and z are the distances from the plant origin in horizontal and vertical directions respectively x and z are parameters that describe the location of maximum root water uptake in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively l p x and p z are the empirical shape parameters for the horizontal and vertical directions which are both set to 1 in this study vrugt et al 2001 additionally the swap model contains simple and detailed crop growth modules in this study the crop yield was calculated using the detailed crop module which could calculate both potential yield and actual yield due to water and or salt stress kroes et al 2008 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the coupled h2dswap model was developed to simulate water flow salt transport and crop growth the simulation domain was rectangular in this study since the groundwater table was between 0 and 2 8 m the depth of the simulation domain was set to 3 m and the length was set according to the spacing of subsurface pipes 10 m the soil profile was divided into four different layers which were 0 40 40 80 80 100 and 100 300 cm respectively the initial values of soil salinity and moisture were measured before seeding table 1 the boundaries of the model were divided into two stages namely the crop growth period and the noncrop period the first stage crop growth period as shown in fig 1 the left and right sides of the simulation area were set as no flux boundaries and the lower boundary was set as a variable head boundary according to the change in groundwater level the upper boundary was set as a mixed boundary consisting of no flux variable flux and atmospheric boundary specifically the dripper wet area was set as a variable flux boundary a no flux boundary was applied under the mulch and an atmospheric boundary was established between the mulches the second stage nocrop period the settings of left and right boundaries were consistent with those of the first stage as illustrated in fig 1 before and after the wir stage the upper boundary was set as an atmospheric boundary and the bottom boundary was set as a variable head boundary during the wir stage the upper boundary was set as a variable flux boundary according to the measured inflow data and the bottom boundary was set as no flux boundary since the groundwater level had risen to the surface qian et al 2021 in addition the boundary of the subsurface pipe was set as the resistance layer boundary which was reported in liu et al 2021 it has been proved that the resistance layer boundary can greatly improve the simulation accuracy of spd 2 3 4 calculation procedures for the coupled model the coupled model is coded in external program subroutines written in fortran 90 which integrates soil water flow solute transport water drainage salt discharge and crop growth generally hydrus 2d and swap are run independently and the external codes are applied to transfer information between the two models using their input and output files it is worth emphasizing that the external program could also make hydrus 2d run outside the graphical user interface gui and convert the output binary files including pressure heads and water and salt contents into readable text files at the end of each time step using the days of crop growth as m and the simulation periods as n as an example the specific coupling process is shown in fig 2 1 first the simulation time steps of hydru 2d and swap are both set to 1 day 2 the parameters of the soil hydraulic and crop growth parameters are initialized and the initial input files of hydrus 2d and swap are read 3 during the crop growth period the swap model is iteratively coupled with the hydrus 2d soil module at each time step the external coupling codes run swap first and then allow hydrus 2d to receive daily evaporation transpiration and rooting depth from swap to update the input files specifically daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated by the penman formula embedded in swap which is divided into potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration based on the lai at the same time the rooting depth of the crop was calculated at the end of the swap model run the output files of evaporation transpiration and rooting depth are read and written into the input file format required by hydrus 2d then the coupling codes are used to run hydrus 2d the output files of hydrus 2d including soil salt contents and pressure heads are transferred to swap as the initial conditions of the next time step concretely i the simulation area is equally divided into 30 intervals along the vertical direction and ii the water pressure heads salinity values and coordinates corresponding to all nodes in each interval are read and written iii calculate the average values of water pressure heads and salt contents for each interval according to coordinates and iv write these values into the input file of the swap model 4 step 3 is repeated until the calculated days are greater than m then the calculation process of the growth period is ended 5 hydrus 2d was run to calculate soil water and salt movement during the noncrop period in particular hydrus 2d is also used to calculate the water drainage and salt discharge of subsurface pipes in addition daily soil evaporation is calculated by swap 6 the results of output files including the water and salt distribution of the soil profile and daily crop growth output results are printed after the completion of daily calculations 7 steps 3 to 6 are repeated until the simulation period is greater than n 2 3 5 parameter sensitivity analysis since there are many input parameters of the coupling model these parameters are time consuming and labor intensive to measure conducting a sensitivity analysis can determine whether these parameters have a significant influence on the output of the model which can reduce the number of parameters of the model needing to be calibrated and can improve the parameter calibration efficiency the initial or default parameters and observation dataset of field observations are used as the basic simulation in the soil module the input parameters include the soil water flow parameters θ r θ s α n and k s and the solute transport parameters d l and d t in the crop growth module the main parameters were selected from previous studies jiang et al 2016 xue and ren 2016 specifically the input crop parameters included in this study are the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis tsumea temperature sum from anthesis to maturity tsumam initial total crop dry weight tdwi leaf area index at emergence laiem initiation specific leaf area sla0 anthesis specific leaf area sla1 maturity specific leaf area sla2 extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light kdif

rms initial rooting depth rdi and maximum daily increase in rooting depth rri they are analyzed to investigate which parameters have a significant influence on crop yield and lai the one factor at a time oat method was selected to perform parameter sensitivity analysis with the variation scale of these parameters ranging from 10 10 an indicator e g the normalized sensitivity index rs used to evaluate the sensitivity of parameters was selected the rs can be written as follows 9 r s δ y y δ x x where x is the initial value of the independent variable x is the change value of the independent variable y is the initial value of the relevant dependent variable and y is the change value of the relevant dependent variable 2 3 6 calibration and validation in this simulation the day was chosen as the unit with the simulation period lasting from may 15 to nov 13 in 2019 calibration and may 17 to nov 12 in 2020 validation based on the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis the soil hydraulic and crop growth parameters were calibrated and validated in this study in particular the calibration process was first applied for water and salt movement of the soil profile water drainage and salt discharge process of subsurface pipe then for crop growth process and yield the initial input soil hydraulic parameters were calculated by rosetta lite v1 1 in hydrus according to the measured bulk density and particle size distribution of each soil layer the initial crop growth parameters were estimated from the crop database of the swap model and previously published studies during the simulation process the simulation values of the soil water content soil salt content cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux were obtained to calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters in addition lai and crop yield were also acquired for calibrating crop growth parameters subsequently the simulated values were compared with the measured values to evaluate the performance accuracy of the coupled model in the above processes the soil hydraulic parameters were determined using the multiobjective calibration method of the pest program which was described in detail in liu et al 2021 and the crop parameters were calibrated using the trial and error method after the parameters were calibrated the original hydrus 2d model was compared with h2dswap in simulating soil salt and water contents in the original hydrus 2d rooting depth varied with time based on the logistic growth function šimůnek et al 2018 and the spatial distribution was described using eq 8 the et p was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and eq 5 then et p was divided into e p and t p using eq 6 distinct from h2dswap e p and t p for the entire simulation cycle were input into hydrus 2d at one time when modeling in addition the simulation accuracy in lai was also compared between swap and h2dswap 2 3 7 evaluation indicators of simulation accuracy the simulation performance of the coupled model was evaluated using three indices including mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r 2 10 m a e i 1 n m i s i n 11 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n 12 r 2 i 1 n m i m s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 i n s i s 2 where m i is the measured value s i is the simulated value s is the mean of measured value and n is the number of samples the mae and rmse show the difference between measured and simulated values and the closer the two values are to 0 the better simulation performance the model will be in contrast the r 2 reflects the model accuracy suggesting unaccepted model performance when the value is lower than 0 5 2 4 numerical scenarios due to the drought low amount of rain and high evaporation intensity in xinjiang water resources are scarce hao et al 2009 an unreasonable wir cycle under spd often leads to a waste of water resources in this paper 20 scenarios were designed to investigate the salt accumulation effect of drip irrigation under plastic film on the main crop and optimize the salt leaching system under spd first in our design schemes diufm was carried out for 10 years without wir to predict the changing trend of soil salt content and crop yields second according to the obtained results see section 3 3 wir modes with cycles of 2 3 4 and 5 years were set up to explore the optimal winter mode in the growth period of the crop with a 10 gradient one full irrigation and three deficit irrigations were set namely s1 600 mm s2 540 mm s3 480 mm and s4 420 mm the amount of wir was consistent with our experiment moreover the different climatic conditions were also considered every year based on meteorological data from 2006 to 2015 http data cma cn the drain depth and spacing of the subsurface pipe were 1 1 m respectively the setting of boundary conditions and the physical properties of the soil are consistent with the field experiment in addition wp is used to evaluate the benefits of different wir cycles pereira et al 2012 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity according to previous studies 19 crop parameters and 7 soil hydraulic parameters khan and abbas 2007 noory et al 2011 qian et al 2021 were selected for parameter sensitivity analysis table 2 the results showed that lai and yield were more sensitive to the change in crop parameters while plant height was only sensitive to tsumea and tsumam therefore in the process of parameter calibration we should mainly focus on the values of lai and crop yield based on the order of parameter sensitivity lai was more sensitive to tsumea sla1 and cvs the results were similar to the study of xue and ren 2016 in addition it was found that kdif kdir and tsumam were also the three import parameters that had a significant effect on lai concerning the crop yields tsumea cvo and cvs were more sensitive other crop parameters had no significant effect on lai and yield in the soil module the sensitivity of the soil water content soil salt content cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux to the soil hydraulic parameters was also calculated the results indicated that swc ssc cwf and csf were all sensitive to θ s this result suggested that k s was another sensitive parameter that can affect ssc cwf and csf additionally the parameters α l and α t also highly influenced ssc the other remaining parameters had little effect on the four reference objective variables therefore 7 crop parameters tsumea tsumam sla1 kdif kdir cvo and cvs and 4 soil hydraulic parameters θ s k s α l and α t were calibrated and the calibrated parameters are listed in table 2 the other parameters were set to default values 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water content and soil salt content fig 3a b compare the measured and simulated values of soil water content swc and soil salt content ssc at depths of 15 30 60 and 90 cm in the soil profile during the model calibration stage it was found that the swc of the upper soil profile varies more than that of deep soil during the drip irrigation period the ssc of the upper soil profile significantly decreased which reflected the leaching effect of the film mulch drip irrigation on the salt however from harvest to wir the soil salt content showed obvious signs of increase moreover the accuracy of the hydrus 2d and h2dswap for simulating changes in swc and ssc was also compared as shown in fig 3 a relatively good agreement between the measured and simulated values was found by the coupled h2dswap model compared to hydrus 2d in addition the mean overall values of the statistical results of field experiment simulations with hydrus 2d and the coupled h2dswap model were listed in table 3 three indices i e rmse mae and r2 for the swc and ssc are used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of hydrus 2d and h2dswap as shown in table 3 concerning the hydrus 2d model the maes for swc and ssc were 0 019 cm3 cm 3 and 0 933 g kg 1 respectively in contrast the mae for the swc and ssc of h2dswap were 0 008 cm3 cm 3 and 0 231 g kg 1 respectively which were lower than those of the hydrus 2d model similar results were found in the comparison of rmse with the two models the rmse values of h2dswap were generally smaller than that of hydrus 2d additionally the r2 values of h2dswap were 0 869 for swc and 0 959 for ssc which were greater than those of the hydrus 2d model r2 for swc and ssc 0 775 and 0 833 respectively these results indicated that the coupled h2dswap model performed better in predicting the changes in swc and ssc than the hydrus 2d model from the foregoing it could be seen that the simulation effect of the coupled model was better so only the coupled model was validated during the model validation stage as shown in fig 4 the coupled model can better describe the change law of the swc and ssc in the soil profile it was found that the initial values of ssc in the soil profile were generally less than those of the previous year after wir in addition the values of mae rmse and r2 for swc and ssc in the soil profile are presented in table 3 the mae values for the coupled model were 0 014 cm3 cm 3 for swc and 0 225 for ssc the rmse values were 0 016 cm3 cm 3 for swc and 0 288 g kg 1 in addition the r2 values were 0 799 for swc and 0 915 for ssc although the r2 values in the validation stage were lower than those in the calibration stage the simulation accuracy was still within a satisfactory range overall the coupled h2dswap model could be used to predict the changing trends of the swc and ssc in the soil profile 3 2 2 lai and yield due to the inconsistency of the crops planted in the two years we selected the 2019 maize growth experiments under different irrigation treatments for calibration and validation fig 5 shows that during the calibration and validation stages the predicted and simulated values of lai were in good agreement the statistical values were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model table 3 compared with the original swap model the rmse and mae of h2dswap were 0 254 0 281 and 0 193 0 232 respectively which were lower than those of swap additionally the r2 for lai of h2dswap was greater than that of swap which showed that the accuracy of the coupled model in simulating lai has been greatly improved in contrast to the original swap model in the early growth stage of maize the leaf area index showed a trend of increasing gradually and reached its peak at 70 90 days after sowing in the later period over time the leaf area index decreased gradually in addition the lai of w2 was generally smaller than that of w1 because the irrigation amount of the w2 treatment was smaller than that of the w1 treatment as shown in table 4 the simulated value of yield at the calibration stage was 9 43 t ha 1 which was smaller than the measured value and the simulated value of yield at the validation stage was 8 54 t ha 1 which was larger than the measured value however the standard deviations of the two simulation values were 0 45 and 0 68 t ha 1 respectively so the simulation accuracy of the crop yield of the coupled model was acceptable in conclusion the coupled h2dswap model could be used to predict the growth of crops 3 3 salt accumulation in different drip irrigation years fig 6 shows the dynamic changes in the soil salt content at depths of 0 40 and 40 100 cm under diufm conditions over 1 10 years in the absence of wir the soil salt content shows a trend of accumulation year by year during drip irrigation salt in shallow soil was leached to deep soil although the use of diufm during the crop growth period is beneficial to the leaching of salt the strong soil evaporation during the longer nongrowing period would still cause the phenomenon of soil return to salt with the decrease of drip irrigation water volume the accumulation rate of soil salinity in the shallow root layer of crops 0 40 cm showed an increasing trend in the first 5 years of drip irrigation s1 s4 increased at rates of 3 05 6 85 5 97 9 68 8 62 12 23 and 11 48 14 70 respectively and the average increasing rate in the latter was higher than that in the previous five years overall the growth rate of s1 was the smallest therefore increasing the amount of drip irrigation is beneficial to slow down the trend of shallow soil salinization the accumulation of soil salt has a significant impact on crop grain yield hereafter referred to as yield fig 7 depicts the change in crop grain yield under different drip irrigation years in general crop yields increase with increasing drip irrigation water with increasing time crop yields show a gradual decreasing trend during the first three years the crop yield decreased by 1 4 10 2 under each irrigation amount which was within the acceptable range in 4 5 years crop yields fell by 17 2 32 4 and there has been a serious reduction in production due to the shortage of water resources in xinjiang a large amount of water is needed for the wir to save water implementing the wir every 2 5 years is preliminarily considered 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation due to its flexible boundary conditions the hydrus 2d model is often used to simulate soil water and salt transport experiments under diufm and spd tang et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2018 evapotranspiration is an important factor affecting salt transport and salt stress also restricts water absorption by crops snapp and shennan 1992 bazihizina et al 2012 robin et al 2016 however the hydrus 2d model could not simulate crop growth and the values of evapotranspiration often depended on the initial input of users šimůnek et al 2011 so its real time dynamic changes were ignored in addition the swap model can dynamically calculate lai soil evaporation and crop transpiration according to time variation but it cannot consider the boundary of the mulch and simulate spd on a two dimensional scale therefore given the advantages of the hydrus 2d and swap models we coupled the hydrus 2d and swap models to improve the simulation accuracy of soil water and salt transport and crop growth compared with the hydrus 2d model our research results showed that the coupled h2dswap model could greatly improve the simulation accuracy of soil profile moisture and salinity from fig 3 both models could describe the changes in soil moisture and salinity well in the early stage of crop growth in the later stage hydrus 2d significantly underestimated the salt content in the soil profile the results were similar to the findings of vrugt et al 2001 the reason was that the lai would vary at different crop growth stages de willigen et al 2002 which could significantly affect the actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation variations in evapotranspiration affected the movement of soil moisture and salinity however the hydrus 2d model could not simulate the dynamic changes in lai or evapotranspiration which reduced the simulation accuracy of the model in contrast h2dswap could correct the inputs of evaporation and transpiration in time through real time calculation of lai irmak and kamble 2009 wang et al 2020 to improve the simulation accuracy of the model similar to the h2dswap model li et al 2019 modified the crop evapotranspiration of the csm cropgro cotton model based on the redistribution of evapotranspiration in a cotton field covered with plastic film the results indicated that the accuracy of the improved model in simulating soil moisture was improved wang et al 2014 also obtained good simulation results of soil moisture by coupling the two dimensional flow model with the crop growth model which could consider dynamic evapotranspiration although the above simulation results were reliable they were all based on water content ignoring the change in salt content in the soil profile however salt is an important factor affecting crop growth studies have shown that salt stress can affect crop respiration hopmans et al 2021 when the salt concentration in the root zone was too high the respiration of crops would weaken and evapotranspiration would decrease in the coupled h2dswap model hydrus 2d could transfer the real time change in the soil salt concentration to swap which would influence the change in crop evapotranspiration in turn the change in evapotranspiration would react to hydrus 2d thus affecting the movement of soil water and salt through the abovementioned real time correction process the coupled model greatly improved the simulation accuracy of soil water salt dynamics and crop growth therefore our model can provide technical guidance for the study of long term soil water and salt changes under diufm in northwest semiarid and arid areas of china 4 2 effects of drip irrigation under mulch on soil salinity and crop yield in this study there were two main sources of salt in the soil one was from brackish water irrigation and the other was from shallow groundwater in similar studies some scholars believe that long term diufm would cause a decrease in salt content within 0 100 cm and would finally be stable at a certain level li et al 2012 2021 tan et al 2009 these conclusions are contradictory to our research fig 6 they performed wir during the noncrop period but ignored the effect of wir on soil desalination our research indicated that long term diufm without wir would cause the accumulation of soil salt content this was because diufm was local irrigation and usually water only penetrated below the root zone without deep percolation in the long term soil salt would accumulate in a deeper place with the flow of irrigation water in addition film mulching could preserve soil moisture and prevent soil evaporation which could effectively reduce the salt accumulation effect caused by soil evaporation during the crop growth period therefore high frequency diufm was beneficial to control the salt content in shallow soil 0 40 cm and even achieve the effect of salt desalination and with the increase in irrigation amount the effect of salt leaching was more obvious fig 6 a similar result was also reported in phogat et al 2017 however after the crops were harvested the results showed that the soil at the 0 40 cm depth exhibited salt return fig 6 this is because to maintain a good farmland environment farmers often removed the plastic film resulting in bare land when entering the fallow period strong soil evaporation would cause the salt in soil water and groundwater to move upward resulting in the accumulation of soil salt there are many hazards caused by soil salt accumulation the most serious of which is the decrease in crop yield wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 there was a negative correlation between maize yield and drip irrigation years studies have shown that the increase in salt in soil water is the reason for the decrease in maize yield feng et al 2017 cucci et al 2019 in this study with the increase in drip irrigation years the salt content in the soil gradually increased the increase in soil salinity resulted in a decrease in maize yield overall the four irrigation treatments had no obvious yield reduction in the previous two years fig 7 with time the yield of maize greatly decreased fig 7 this was because the increase in salt in the soil decreased the water use efficiency of maize khataar et al 2018 ramezanifar et al 2021 although the irrigation amount was sufficient salt stress still caused insufficient water uptake in maize which resulted in yield reduction therefore to maintain the yield of maize at a reasonable level the necessary salt leaching and discharging measures must be implemented 4 3 operation mode of drip irrigation under film mulch and salt discharge of subsurface drainage fig 8a d show the variation in salinity in the soil at the 0 100 cm depth and the characteristics of crop wp under different wir cycles spd could effectively reduce the salt content of the soil sharma et al 2000 liu et al 2021 qian et al 2021 thereby slowing the salt accumulation trend of diufm in this study a 2 year wir allowed the salinity in the soil to be maintained at a low level between approximately 1 and 4 g kg 1 as the wir cycle became longer the soil salinity still showed a tendency to accumulate year by year this is the result of soil evaporation and groundwater salt return yimit et al 2011 yan et al 2015 under the 3 5 year wir mode although the accumulation of salts was effectively controlled the salinity of each treatment exceeded the initial value to varying degrees at the end of each wir cycle as the amount of drip irrigation water decreased therefore corresponding wir strategies should be made for different drip irrigation water quantities in similar studies where the salt control effect of diufm combined with spd was investigated heng et al 2018 indicated that spd under drip irrigation performed better than flood irrigation and xiaowen wang et al 2020 z wang et al 2020 demonstrated that a leaching amount of 1000 1230 mm with a drain spacing of 15 m was recommended for reducing salinity these studies mainly adopted the mode of irrigation once or multiple times a year which tended to waste water resources in our research different wir cycles according to various drip irrigation amounts were established based on the evaluation of wp in the mode with wir every 2 years crop wp was similar for all irrigation treatments although the yield could be maintained at a high level the crop wp was generally smaller than that of the treatments with a wir cycle of 3 5 years in the mode with a 3 year wir cycle the wp of the s3 treatment was maximum and could be maintained at a high level at a wir cycle of 4 years although s1 was close to s2 the s2 treatment obtained the best prediction compared to the other treatments when wir was conducted once every 5 years the crop wp showed a gradual decrease with increasing drip irrigation years during a wir cycle however in general the s2 treatment was higher than the other irrigation treatments therefore to obtain the best effect of saving water and increasing production we recommend that the wir be carried out once every 4 5 years under the s1 and s2 treatments once every 3 years under the s3 treatment and once every 2 years under the s4 treatment compared with the implementation of wir once a year our suggested operation mode could save water by 6 4 12 2 on average annually fig 9 4 4 limitations compared with the single hydrus 2d and swap models the accuracy of the coupled h2dswap model in simulating the dynamic changes in water and salt and crop growth has been greatly improved but there are still some limitations the change in root length in the coupled model was calculated based on the simple root growth module in swap which lacked simulation accuracy therefore the detailed root growth module will be involved in our follow up investigation in the calibration of soil water and salt there was a lack of data monitoring of soil water and salt during the fallow period of the field automatic monitoring equipment such as tdr should be set up in the follow up study to automatically monitor the changes in water and salt in this study the coupled model was calibrated and validated by drip irrigation experiments in the future the coupled model should be evaluated by different irrigation conditions such as flood irrigation furrow irrigation and border irrigation in addition it is worth considering setting more salt levels to evaluate the performance of the coupled model in simulating the growth of crops under salt stress 5 conclusion in this study we coupled a two dimensional flow model hydrus 2d with a crop model swap which could consider diufm spd and the interaction between crop growth and salinity field experimental data from 2019 to 2020 were used to calibrate and validate the coupled h2dswap model the simulated dynamic soil water content soil salt content lai and yield values were evaluated against experimental observations the calibration and validation results showed that compared with the original hydrus 2d model the accuracy of simulation in dynamic soil moisture and salinity has been greatly improved using the coupled h2dswap model after calibration and validation the coupled model was used to investigate the soil salt movement characteristics and crop yield changes under long term diufm with different irrigation amounts the results indicated that under the condition of no leaching salt in winter after the maize was harvested the soil salt under diufm increased yearly but the crop yield decreased with every passing year the yield reduction in the first year was not obvious so salt leaching can be omitted from the fifth year the yield of crops under different irrigation amounts has been reduced by 32 4 at the highest and the necessary wir leaching measures should be implemented in addition the appropriate operation mode of wirs with different drip irrigation water volumes was also investigated in this study in view of crop yield and wp we suggest that wir should be carried out every 4 5 years when the drip irrigation amount of the maize field is s1 and s2 when the irrigation amount is s3 and s4 it is recommended to conduct wir every 2 and 3 years respectively in summary the coupled h2dswap model can be used to guide the operation mode of diufm and spd in northwest china however although the simulation accuracy of the coupled model has been improved the universality of the coupled model needs further study in the future we need to conduct experimental research in different areas and further verify the model with a large amount number of field data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9428,the rapid shrinkage of lake urmia over the past two decades has raised serious environmental concerns several restoration plans have been proposed to reduce agricultural water consumption to supply a remarkable fraction of the lake s environmental flow requirement however an accurate and realistic evaluation of the effectiveness of these plans in reducing agricultural water consumption across the basin is still poorly understood this study assessed the water saving potential of agricultural alteration in a snow dominated catchment in the lake urmia basin in particular we explored the impact of crop pattern alteration via reducing the cultivation area and employing different irrigation systems we further studied the degree of extra stress on the agricultural water demand under the future trends of air temperature and precipitation due to climate change to this end we developed a three dimensional physically based hydrological model that simulated the main processes involved in the water and energy cycles in this setting a surface groundwater model was coupled to a land surface model that integratively computed the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration snowmelt groundwater and soil moisture in the root zone among other processes pumping from wells and different irrigation systems were also included in the model the results showed that a reduction in the cultivation area does not necessarily lead to a significant saving in the total water loss due to evapotranspiration which strongly depends on the trade off between the decrease in transpiration and the increase in soil evaporation we further found that saving in agricultural water consumption is partly controlled by topography and the vertical distribution of soil moisture also the drip irrigation system showed lower evapotranspiration rates than the spray irrigation system finally the study of the future impacts of climate change revealed that the agriculture sector would be under more intensive stress which poses a severe threat to the long term restoration of lake urmia if effective agricultural management practices are not taken into consideration the findings of this study highlight important issues for the lake urmia restoration plans on agricultural water management given the fragility of the lake ecosystem this study suggests a reliable modeling framework for water and agricultural managers to identify the most appropriate regions in the basin that would yield the highest saving in agricultural water consumption by improving the current crop patterns and irrigation systems graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural water consumption crop pattern irrigation land surface modeling climate change lake urmia 1 introduction many hydrological systems

where lake urmia lu lost 96 of its surface area and 91 of its volume between 1996 and 2016 the main factors that contributed to the desiccation of lu were the overexploitation of water resources due to unsustainable agricultural development as evidenced by a 400 increase in the number of wells between 1984 and 2012 doe 2014 promotion of crops with high water need ulrp 2018 and the unprovided environmental flow due to an improper operation of the reservoirs constructed on the main feeding rivers of lu since 1970 doe 2013 the climate related changes in the region have also exacerbated the influence of the above actions i e lub has experienced an 18 decrease in precipitation during the last two decades relative to the long term record ulrp 2018 this drastic shrinkage intensified desertification around the lake with adverse impacts on air quality especially on the eastern side of the basin alizade govarchin ghale et al 2021 which has threatened residential health tabrizi et al 2020 drying of lu has also degraded its water quality which endangered the lake biota life such as artemia as ecologically important species abbaspour and nazaridoust 2007 the urmia lake restoration national committee was initiated in 2013 to plan several restoration actions and provide the environmental flow need of lu these actions include intra basin water transfer to lu using treated wastewater from the nearby urban areas dredging some major rivers feeding the lake rescheduling allocations from reservoirs to provide a portion of the environmental flow need and controlling agricultural water consumption ulrp 2018 among the factors mentioned above the agricultural sector has played a vital role by accounting for almost 90 of total water consumption in the basin by contrasting the actual agricultural water consumption in the entire basin against real water need urmia lake restoration program ulrp targeted an aggressive 40 reduction in agricultural water consumption by implementing specific actions ulrp 2018 this goal has been pursued by promoting crops with a low water need slowing down the overexploitation of groundwater and surface water resources and improving irrigation efficiency although the above actions are theoretically believed to reduce agricultural water consumption considerably their actual effectiveness and distinct share in reducing water consumption are still poorly understood it is thus necessary to scrutinize the real water saving capability of different agricultural water consumption scenarios which would further elucidate the relative effectiveness of software versus hardware approaches to restore lu more realistically given the inherent complexity of systems subjected to natural and anthropogenic changes such as lub predicting their hydrological response to the above actions requires identifying and understanding the feedback between the governing hydrological processes to this end integrated physically based hydrological models can be employed to simulate the governing hydrological processes such as groundwater flow unsaturated flow surface runoff snowmelt infiltration et etc and the interactions between them keune et al 2016 kuffour et al 2020 thatch et al 2020 this study developed a three dimensional physically based hydrological model to simulate all the major physical processes involved in the water and energy cycles we calibrated the model in the 1483 km2 gadarchay subbasin located in the southwest part of the lu we validated the results against ground measurements of river hydrometry and satellite derived water storage data in particular we aimed 1 to assess the water saving capacity of different irrigation systems and reduction in the cultivation area 2 to study the impact of climate change on et snowmelt and surface runoff generation as the main components of the water cycle and 3 to explore the influence of radiation temporal resolution on the et estimation as key information to compute the actual agricultural water consumption the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrological model and the data used for model calibration and validation different agricultural alteration scenarios are also described in this section section 3 presents the results and discusses the impact of agriculture alteration

distributed subsurface flow model that uses the three dimensional richards equation to solve the transient variably saturated groundwater flow kuffour et al 2020 the initial version of parflow was developed for simulating fully saturated flow and transfer of chemicals in a three dimensional heterogeneous porous medium at lawrence livermore national laboratory ashby et al 1993 since then parflow has undergone several modifications or advancements for example woodward 1998 used the newton krylov multigrid module for variably saturated flow problems also kollet and maxwell 2006 introduced a new method for integrating surface and subsurface systems by using a two dimensional overland flow simulator as an upper boundary condition to the richards equation this resulted in a mixed form of the richards equation expressed as 1 s s s w ψ p ψ p t ϕ s w ψ p t k s x k r ψ p ψ p z q s where s s is the specific storage l 1 s w is the relative saturation ψ p is the pressure head l t is time t ϕ is the soil porosity k s lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k r is the relative permeability q s is a sink source term t 1 z is the depth below the surface l and is the del operator using the van genuchten relationships van genuchten 1980 s w and k r can be calculated as 2 s w ψ p s sat s res 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 θ s res 3 k r ψ p 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 θ 2 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 θ 2 where s sat is the relative saturation water content s res is the relative residual saturation and α l 1 and θ are the van genuchten parameters in this way the overland flow is fully integrated with the subsurface flow and is computed directly as the solution of richard s equation see kollet and maxwell 2006 and references therein for further details maxwell 2013 developed a new terrain following grid to reduce the computational cost which skips computation for the inactive cells based on the domain topography to simulate the physical processes related to the energy balance at the land surface such as et and snowmelt and to understand the interactions between the land surface and subsurface processes parflow was coupled with the common land model clm dai et al 2003 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 parflow and clm exchange information in the soil column of the root zone where the most topsoil layer in parflow corresponds to the first soil layer in the clm indeed parflow first solves the equations related to water balance in the soil layers and calculates the soil moisture and pressure for each cell then clm uses the calculated soil moisture and pressure from parflow and solves the energy balance equations for the soil and snow layers finally the calculated fluxes by clm such as infiltration and et are exchanged with parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell and kollet 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 2 2 study area the 52 000 km2 lub is located in northwestern iran between 35⁰ 41 38⁰ 29 n and 44⁰ 13 47⁰ 53 e fig 1 governed by a semi arid climate the average annual temperature precipitation and relative humidity in lub are 12 350 mm and 58 respectively doe 2013 lub encompasses the hypersaline lu that was designated as a ramsar site 1975 biosphere reserve 1976 protected area 1967 and national park 1971 the lake water is mainly supplied by river inflow from 17 permanent and 12 seasonal rivers however 72 of the water volume entering lu comes from the southern rivers of the drainage basin sharifan et al 2017 this study focused on one of the main southern subbasins i e the gadarchay subbasin 36⁰ 58 17 n and 45⁰ 23 33 e fig 1b where the gadar river accounts

includes pea lentils and beans the irrigated agriculture is composed of wheat and barley 52 8 sugar beet 20 1 and alfalfa 27 1 the topographic elevation ranges remarkably between 1205 m and 3609 m above the mean sea level the peyghaleh subbasin is considered the main headwater of the larger naghadeh subbasin during winter and spring peyghaleh is mainly covered with snow the underlying land cover is only rangeland and there are no agricultural practices in this region in this study we developed the hydrologic model for the entire extent of fig 1b the model extent was chosen to be larger than the study basin to avoid numerical issues at the basin boundary nevertheless the model results were ultimately extracted from within the study basin boundary for further analysis 2 3 ground based

the two available synoptic stations in the study area precipitation data were recorded at both synoptic stations and rain gauges other variables i e dswr dlwr and specific humidity were not measured at the stations thus we received dlwr and specific humidity data from the global land data assimilation system gldas database rodell et al 2004 we calculated dswr using the following relationship allen et al 1998 4 dswr a s b s n n r a where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 n is the actual duration of sunshine hour recorded at the synoptic station n is the maximum possible duration of sunshine and as and bs are the regression constants further details on determining the above variables parameters are provided in the appendix to account for the orographic effects on the temperature and pressure data measured at the oshanviyeh station we used the lapse rate method as 5 v pixel v station elv pixel elv station laps where v pixel is the amount of variable i e temperature or pressure in a given pixel v station is the measured data at the station elv pixel is the pixel elevation m elv station is the station elevation m and laps is the lapse rate for the variable by substituting the average value of temperature pressure and the elevation of the synoptic stations i e oshnaviyeh and naghadeh in equation 5 the number of laps for the two variables was calculated separately precipitation is highly localized unlike temperature and pressure especially in mountainous basins such as our study case therefore a constant amount of the lapse rate cannot be used for the entire basin to consider the localization effects we first delineated the subbasins of the naghadeh basin then for each subbasin s pixels we used precipitation data recorded in the nearest rain gauge to the subbasin s centroid next the following equation was used in each subbasin to generate the spatially distributed precipitation data galván et al 2014 6 r pixel r gauge 1 elv elv gauge

porosity and van genuchten parameters as input data to simulate groundwater flow in the unsaturated and saturated zones permeability and porosity data were obtained from the global dataset of soil hydraulic and thermal parameters for earth system modeling dai et al 2013 2019 these data can be received in the netcdf format with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds land atmosphere interaction research group at sun yat sen university 2021 we extracted the van genuchten parameters from the global data set of montzka et al 2017 at 0 25 degree spatial resolution finally for the manning s roughness values we used the data produced by japan international cooperation agency 2020 in lub based on the land cover map 2 3 3 gcm data the predicted precipitation and temperature data by the global climate models gcm s can be used to investigate future climate change impact on the river streamflow and water storage in the study area since the prediction of climatic variables may be inconsistent between different gcm s considering different gcm s would facilitate exploring the distinction between them to represent the mean climate state and variability however due to the high computational cost of running parflow clm under different gcm based predictions we chose the most suitable gcm model for the study area i e hadcm3 based on the findings of previous studies that successfully used this model in the same region ahmadaali et al 2018 mahsafar et al 2017 salahi et al 2017 we add that despite the lower resolution of hadcm3 predictions as compared to those obtained from the more recent models such as hadgem3 it still yields reliable results with respect to climate mean flato et al 2014 reichler and kim 2008 valdes et al 2017 which suffices for the purposes of this study former studies in lu showed that a2 a1b and b1 scenarios best represent the climatic future of the region in this study we focused on the a1b scenario as it predicts the medium level of co2 emission as compared to that from the a2 and a1b scenarios the extracted gcm data for the a1b scenario indicate that under a confidence level of 95 the temperature will experience a significant increasing trend i e 0 05 c per year at the same time precipitation will show an insignificant decreasing trend i e 4 mm per year 2 3 4 soil moisture data to validate the simulated soil moisture we compared the model results with the soil moisture data given by gldas 2 1 rodell et al 2004 at a 0 25 degree spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution since gldas provides soil moisture data in the top 2 m of the soil layer the above comparison was made in this layer 2 4 domain setup parflow was configured with a lateral resolution of 1 km with 68 pixels in the east west direction 45 pixels in the north south direction and six vertical soil layers with 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m 1 4 m 11 m and 137 m discretization for a total model dimension of 68 km 45 km 0 15 km and 18 360 cells the upper five soil layers were discretized with a finer vertical resolution to more accurately simulate the land surface atmosphere interactions the bottom and sides of the domain were all set to a no flux boundary we used the 30 m usgs digital elevation model dem to construct the domain geometry since the model grid cell is 1 km the 30 m dem layer was resampled to a 1 km resolution using bilinear interpolation we post processed the dem data using the pit filling algorithm to fill the sinks and then used it to generate the slope layers in the east west and north south directions to examine the accuracy of the slope layers we examined the parking lot test the emerged river network in the parking lot test did not completely match the actual river network this often happens due to the upscaling of a high resolution dem layer where a fraction of information especially in regions with sharp fluctuations in elevation is missed for instance if the distance between two rivers is smaller than 1 km the model cannot distinguish them from each other to address this issue we digitized the domain s existing river network and then enforced it to the slope layers which yielded an acceptable river network in the parking lot experiment given the input data in section 2 3 we warmed up the model by initializing the water table at a constant depth we then executed the model repeatedly for multiple water years until the change in groundwater storage was smaller than 1 of total annual precipitation we conducted the spin up process by using the climate data of the 2010 2011 water year a time step of one hour was used for all simulations to reach a stable solution 2 5 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the model we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 the modified form of nse i e mse muleta 2012 and the root mean square error rmse as 7 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 8 mse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i q obs 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 where q sim is the simulated streamflow q obs is the observed streamflow q obs is the average observed streamflow and n is the length of time series nse evaluates the performance of a hydrologic model by emphasizing the model s ability to reproduce the peak streamflow values we computed mse to further assess the model performance in reproducing low flows the maximum possible value for nse and mse is 1 the predictive power of a model with an nse of zero is similar to the mean of the time series while the models with negative nse have worse performance than the mean of the time series we also used rmse as an indicator of the absolute prediction error rmse ranges between zero and where the smaller rmse values indicate a more considerable prediction accuracy 2 6 agricultural alteration scenarios we designed eight scenarios to evaluate the hydrologic response of the gadarchay basin to a variety of agricultural alterations in terms of changes in the cultivation area and irrigation systems the characteristics of each scenario are summarized as follows 1 baseline the purpose of this scenario was to simulate the benchmark situation in the study area in the water year 2012 2013 due to groundwater extraction and irrigation in the region we have considered both in the model developed for this scenario the irrigation rate was calculated by dividing the annual irrigation water volume obtained from the iran ministry of energy database by the number of irrigation hours according to the land cover map irrigation was applied from may to the end of the water year from 7 am to 5 pm every day on only the irrigated agriculture grid cells parflow clm assumes that the required water for irrigation is imported from an external source e g pumping wells transferring from out of the basin etc and the volume of water pumped from wells is directly exported to outside the basin as such a simultaneous simulation of irrigation and pumping is consistent with the actual situation of the basin the drip irrigation system was used in this scenario 2 spray irrigation system irsp the purpose of this scenario was to compare the impact of spray and drip irrigation systems on the rate of et and streamflow the irrigation rate and timing were considered similar to the baseline scenario the drip irrigation system was assumed for the rest of the scenarios described below 3 10 reduction in total cultivation area ar10 the total cultivated area upstream of the naghadeh hydrometric station is 665 km2 of which 540 km2 and 125 km2 are composed of rainfed and irrigated crops respectively to investigate the impact of reduction in the cultivated area on the river streamflow and et 10 of the total cultivated area including both irrigated and rainfed agriculture was converted to rangeland the amount of irrigation and pumping volume were reduced accordingly 4 100 reduction in cultivated area ar100 this scenario aimed to investigate the extreme condition of no agricultural activity in the study area the total cultivated area was replaced by rangeland hence irrigation was allowed only in the orchard farms 5 none irrigation n ir this scenario is the same as the baseline scenario except no irrigation took place in the model the aim of this scenario and the next two ones were to investigate the mere impact of reduction in the cultivated area on the system response by turning the irrigation off the results of this scenario would enable us to directly compare the results of baseline ar10 and ar100 scenarios with the n ir n ir a10 and n ir a100 scenarios respectively 6 none irrigation and 10 reduction in cultivated area n ir ar10 in this scenario a 10 reduction of the cultivated area was implemented while irrigation was turned off the aim of this scenario was to explore the mere impact of reduction in the vegetation cover on et and other quantities of interest 7 none irrigation and 100 reduction in cultivated area n ir ar100 in this scenario the entire cultivated area was converted to rangeland and thus no irrigation took place in the model 8 climate change we explored the impact of climate change on the simulated river streamflow and water storage from 2018 to 2040 to this end parflow clm was forced with the predicted precipitation and temperature given by gcm projection described in section 2 3 3 we considered the 2011 2018 and 2019 2040 water years as the base and prediction periods respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of model performance fig 2a and b show the simulated and observed daily streamflow at the peyghaleh and naghadeh hydrometric stations respectively the results indicate a very good agreement between the observed and simulated streamflow time series as evidenced by nse 0 71 mse 0 64 and rmse 7 34 m3 s at the peyghaleh station and nse 0 67 mse 0 58 and rmse 8 57 m3 s at the naghadeh station the model could successfully capture the flashiness in the streamflow time series particularly during the extreme flood event of april 2017 we note that the accuracy of the simulated streamflow at the naghadeh station is smaller than that at the peyghaleh station especially during the low flow seasons this is because the model produces baseflow at the naghadeh station in this period while the observed streamflow was recorded zero at this station given the permanent flow in the gadar river zero baseflow recorded by the hydrometric station cannot be valid and may be attributed to the gauge error or malfunctioning during very low flows fig 2c compares the monthly averaged simulated soil moisture in the top 2 m of soil layer with that extracted from gldas we observe that both time series follow the same seasonality and fluctuations over the study period the average soil moisture simulated by the model and that obtained from gldas differs by 5 7 and the rmse of the soil moisture is 44 6 mm these measures confirm the good fit between the two time series 3 2 dynamics of water and energy cycles components fig 3a shows the daily time series of air temperature ground heat flux and ground temperature in the water year 2012 2013 as a representative of water and energy cycles in the study area the air temperature constantly decreases from october to mid january which explains the loss of energy by the ground as evidenced by the declined ground temperature the ground heat flux is thus almost always negative during this period as the air temperature rises from mid january the ground begins to gain energy leading to positive heat flux and a rise in the ground temperature the air and ground temperatures generally show an upward trend until mid july regardless of daily fluctuations with the onset of september the air temperature drops again and causes the ground heat flux to be negative fig 3b shows the time series of precipitation and snow water equivalent swe in the water year 2012 2013 since the air temperature is above the freezing limit from october until mid december precipitation occurs as rainfall and consequently swe is zero during this period therefore the input precipitation mainly contributes to runoff production or infiltrates into the subsurface from mid december to mid march a fraction of total precipitation falls as snow when the freezing temperature is reached which leads to increased swe swe slightly decreases due to snowmelt in the intervals between two consecutive snowfall events with the onset of spring from mid march snowmelt begins and keeps on with almost a constant rate until early june despite the rising air temperature from early july until the end of august the rate of snowmelt i e the slope of the swe time series declines because of the diminished spatial coverage and volume of stored snow in the region the above results indicate that snowmelt dominates runoff generation in this region mainly during spring when snowmelt peak occurs this hints at the critical role of the snow module in any hydrological modeling attempt in lub which has been ignored in several developed models in the study region e g chaudhari et al 2018 shadkam et al 2016a fig 3c shows the simulated et and its components i e soil evaporation and vegetation et where vegetation et is the sum of plant transpiration and evaporation from the vegetation leaves we observe that soil evaporation comprises 84 of total et which is expected based on the underlying land cover map in the fall and winter et is relatively low but there are still fluctuations in the et time series due to the occurrence of precipitation or increase in temperature in the late winter and spring the rate of et increases due to the rising temperature and available soil moisture with the onset of summer the rate of et decreases due to a decrease in soil moisture since no precipitation occurs in the summer the decreasing trend of et rate continues until the end of the water year in addition to the air temperature and soil moisture the time series of vegetation et depends on the area of canopy coverage in the region comparing the time series of transpiration and leaf area index not shown here reveals a tight agreement between them 3 3 exploring the water saving potential of different irrigation systems and reduction in cultivation area the results of the seven scenarios described in section 2 6 indicate that transpiration constitutes 72 85 of vegetation et in the studied scenarios also we observe that 84 88 of total et comprises soil evaporation thus we expect a maximum reduction of 16 in et due to the control of agricultural water consumption if no agricultural activities occur in the study area table 1 gives the percent change of streamflow total et and its components for the scenarios defined in section 2 6 compared to those on the baseline scenario comparison between the results of baseline and irsp scenarios shows that transpiration in the spray irrigation system was reduced by 14 as compared to that in the drip irrigation system this observation indicates that a larger volume of water is available to vegetation under the drip irrigation system also due to a larger interception by vegetation in the spray irrigation system the amount of water reaching the soil is less than that in the drip irrigation system hence soil evaporation was reduced in the spray irrigation system overall the spray irrigation system increased total et which is mainly attributed to the increased water loss due to evaporation from the intercepted water by vegetation leaves the advantages of a drip irrigation system in saving water higher crop yield and better crop health have also been highlighted by former studies kumar and palanisami 2010 tl et al 2009 the above capability of parflow clm to separate and quantify the contribution of different et components provides helpful information that can be leveraged to determine the most efficient type of irrigation system in a desired study area conditioned on the underlying vegetation type here we note that the water saving capacity of other irrigation systems such as surface and pressurized irrigation was studied by ahmadzadeh et al 2016 in the zarrinehrud basin located in the southern lu they concluded that even though the pressurized irrigation system can reduce plant water uptake and improve irrigation efficiency it may adversely decrease groundwater recharge and return flow due to the reduced percolation into the deeper soil layers by examining two pilot farms in the miandoab irrigation network located in the southern lu dehghanisanij et al 2020 also found that the average water consumption was reduced by about 29 7 by changing the planting pattern from common spacing to two row and changing the irrigation method from border to furrow given the above findings the results of the present study can thus be considered a complementary piece of information on the effectiveness of different irrigation systems in reducing agricultural water consumption in lub the results of ar10 scenario reveal that a 10 reduction in the cultivated area decreased vegetation et due to a decrease in vegetation transpiration while it increased soil evaporation slightly also in the ar100 scenario evaporation from soil and vegetation leaves increased and decreased slightly respectively indeed removing vegetation off the cultivated pixels increased the amount of energy that reached the soil surface and subsequently increased soil evaporation however the effect on total et of reduction in vegetation et was more significant than that from the increase in soil evaporation thus total et was decreased in both scenarios relative to the baseline we also observe that a reduction in streamflow has taken place in both scenarios this is because the amount of irrigation was reduced in proportion to the decrease in cultivated area in the n ir scenario soil evaporation and transpiration decreased by 5 2 and 23 1 respectively leading to a 7 5 decrease in total et this observation highlights the remarkable impact of irrigation on the water availability to vegetation in the n ir ar10 and n ir ar100 scenarios vegetation et decreased by 21 5 and 31 6 respectively while soil evaporation decreased by 4 8 and 3 1 respectively indeed it is interesting that the change in total et in the n ir ar10 and n ir ar100 scenarios is almost the same as that in the n ir scenario this is because the reduction in vegetation et due to the decrease in the cultivated area was compensated by the increase in soil evaporation the above findings point out that even though the decrease in the cultivation area reduces the amount of vegetation et it allows more energy to reach the soil due to the diminished leaf area index and thus increases the soil evaporation a comparison of the n ir and n ir ar10 scenarios shows that in the n ir ar10 scenario the amount of reduction in vegetation et is less than the amount of increase in the soil evaporation which led to an increase in total et relative to the n ir scenario however in the n ir ar100 scenario the amount of reduction in vegetation et is larger than the increase in the amount of soil evaporation resulting in a decrease in total et therefore total et does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the cultivation area instead there is a trade off between the increase in soil evaporation and a decrease in total et if the cultivation area is reduced the above findings indicate that even though reducing the cultivation area or changing the crop pattern from high to low water need crops can reduce plant transpiration total et may not change significantly by developing a swat model in the siminehrud subbasin located in the southern lu rezaei zaman et al 2016 also found that despite the effectiveness of crop pattern change to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change such activities may not save sufficient water to guarantee the long term sustainability of lu we further observe that in the n ir ar10 and n ir ar100 scenarios streamflow has decreased by 2 6 and 3 2 respectively we note that such a reduction in streamflow due to the reduced cultivation area cannot be considered a general conclusion for the whole lub this is because the trade off between soil evaporation and vegetation et may be dominant only in regions with high soil moisture conditions the spatial distribution of soil moisture not shown here indicates that this condition holds in the southern and west southern parts of lub such as the gadarchay subbasin at the same time the groundwater level is much lower in the other parts of lub as such our findings may not be consistent with the results of some previous studies which explored the effect of reduction in the cultivation area on streamflow over the entire lub for instance farokhnia et al 2019 showed that there could be a 414 mcm increase in the annual inflow to the lu if 100 k hectares reductions in the irrigated area would take place in the entire lub between 1999 and 2009 therefore the geographic location of crop pattern change should be taken into account if this practice is targeted to save agricultural water consumption as an objective our results indicate that crop pattern change in the regions with a lower groundwater level would yield a more promising outcome here we note that hamidi razi et al 2019 also attempted to quantify the impact of different scenarios on lu restoration including a 40 reduction in agricultural water use they concluded that this scenario could increase the volume of lu s stored water by 90 in comparison to the scenario in which no intervention is carried out nevertheless we emphasize that this conclusion should be considered with caution a careful examination of the methodology used in the study of hamidi razi et al 2019 reveals that the above amount of saved water from agriculture was assumed to be entirely directed towards the lake indeed their physically based hydrological model did not quantify the actual amount of savable water from agriculture alteration instead the developed 2 d shallow water hydrodynamic model evaluated the amount of change in the lake s stored volume under lake inflow augmentation therefore such approaches cannot truly evaluate the actual amount of savable water from agriculture alterations unless they are coupled with basin scale hydrological models that can simulate the underlying physical processes of et soil infiltration etc 3 4 the impact of climate change on runoff generation and et projection of climate change scenarios demonstrates that lub will experience higher temperatures and less precipitation in the next two decades karimi et al 2018 to investigate the system response to these climatic changes we simulated streamflow and water storage from 2018 to 2040 the results indicate that the average simulated streamflow in the base and prediction period is 258 mcm yr and 159 mcm yr respectively which shows a 38 reduction in the simulated streamflow under the changing climate this observation is consistent with shadkam et al 2016b findings which showed a 10 and 27 decline in inflow to lu under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios respectively moreover we observed that the average water storage in the base and prediction period is 179 454 bcm yr and 179 107 bcm yr respectively which is equivalent to a decrease of 11 33 cm in the prediction period as compared to that in the base period the above observations witness that climate change will impose further challenges on the lub water management and lu restoration despite significant practices planned and executed by ulrp over the past few years lu s restoration status has been dynamic and does not show a promising trend in the near future such uncertainty arises from the success degree of software activities that ulrp has targeted to provide the required environmental flow of lu for instance saving water from agriculture as the primary water consumer in the basin is believed to yield the largest fraction of required water for lu restoration as compared to the other activities such as inter basin water transfer treated wastewater and control of illegal withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources nevertheless controlling the cultivation area from further development has been challenging due to the conflict of interest between different stakeholders in the basin furthermore sufficient investment in alternative occupations has not been supported by the government so that farmers are encouraged to reduce the extent of their agricultural activities the above evidence underlines that serious activities in the line of reducing irrigation water in the basin must be put into action such that the adverse impact of climate change via increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation may be mitigated to a tangible extent former studies have demonstrated that even though anthropogenic activities have been the major driver of lu drying further desiccation of lu can be exacerbated by the influence of changing climate in lub abbaspour et al 2012 delju et al 2013 in the following decades the predicted trend for precipitation and temperature will undoubtedly put the agriculture sector in lub under further pressure concerning water deficiency and food security in addition the statistically significant increase in lub s average temperature as witnessed by the gcm projections abbasian et al 2021 will also change the snowmelt timing and volume towards early snowmelt and less runoff generation as a snow dominated basin where snowmelt constitutes a significant portion of annual runoff the above situation has important implications for changing water cycle dynamics in lub for instance despite the 91 increase of precipitation in all stations within lub in the spring of 2018 relative to that in the spring of 2017 the lake water volume decreased by more than 500 mcm in this period to explore the possible causes of this unexpected observation fig 4 compares the time series of the main water balance components between 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 water years i e air temperature precipitation streamflow swe et and the average soil saturation in the topsoil layer we observe that even though the amounts of precipitation in both winters are approximately equal the temperatures are quite different indeed the air temperature is often above the freezing temperature during the winter of 2018 while the opposite holds in the winter of 2017 therefore the volume of swe fig 4c in 2018 was sharply decreased relative to that in 2017 consequently despite larger precipitation depth the generated streamflow in the spring of 2018 was less than that in the spring of 2017 fig 4f which is mainly attributed to the reduction in snow storage and runoff generation through snowmelt besides the volume of swe its spatial distribution over the region plays a critical role in runoff generation by controlling the soil moisture fig 5 illustrates the snow cover spatial distribution between december and march we observe that due to a higher temperature in the winter of 2018 as compared to that in the winter of 2017 a lower number of snow covered pixels are seen only in the very high altitudes on the other hand the higher temperature in the winter of 2018 compared to that in 2017 resulted in larger et i e larger water loss fig 4d the combination of increase in winter et and decrease in snow storage caused the topsoil layer to hold less moisture in the spring of 2018 relative to that in the spring of 2017 fig 4e therefore the relatively low intensity rainfall events during the spring of 2018 could not trigger a remarkable runoff generation in fig 4e we observe that such low intensity rainfall events only caused moderate fluctuations in the soil moisture during the spring of 2018 especially in april and may without generating significant streamflow furthermore in the intervals between consecutive low intensity precipitations et reduced the soil moisture again and prevented considerable runoff generation by subsequent precipitation events as such it is clearly seen that the combination of less snowpack and low intensity rainfall events was the main reason for the decreasing volume of water entering the lake in the spring of 2018 compared to that in the spring of 2017 3 5 the significance of radiation temporal resolution on et estimates we also investigated the impact of dswr temporal resolution i e 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h and 24 h on the estimated et and streamflow in the oshnaviyeh subbasin fig 6 illustrates the total annual et and streamflow under different temporal resolutions of dswr table 2 further gives the percent change of these quantities relative to the baseline i e hourly forcing data we observe that as the temporal resolution of dswr decreases from hourly to daily the absolute percent change of estimated et volume increases from 0 5 to 37 5 also the simulated streamflow increases from 0 3 to 17 8 these observations reveal that diurnal fluctuations in dswr cause a remarkable influence on the volume of simulated et and streamflow particularly when 12 hour or daily data is used see fig 6 the considerable sensitivity of the estimated et and streamflow volumes to dswr temporal resolution is because a hydrologic system does not respond linearly to daily fluctuations in dswr when a higher resolution data i e hourly is aggregated into a lower temporal resolution data i e daily the wide variation in the et estimation error can be further explained by contrasting the time series of dswr at different temporal resolutions as indicated in the inset of fig 6 it can be inferred that by making the radiation data course in time the diurnal variation of radiation is aggregated towards a constant value this temporal coarsening disregards the influence of above average radiation values on any physical quantity that controls the et estimates such as surface temperature and ground heat flux former studies have demonstrated that among different net radiation meteorological and vegetation index data products the choice of net radiation dataset imposes the most significant influence on the terrestrial et estimates derived from either remotely sensed or physically based models badgley et al 2015 ferguson et al 2010 as such utilizing high temporal resolution data on radiation seems necessary to achieve reliable outcomes from the land surface models in this regard hourly data from geostationary satellites can be leveraged to simulate the hydrological processes that are highly dynamic at the diurnal scale like et liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 the above finding has important implications for the distributed land surface modeling where modeling temporal resolution may be compromised by a tendency to reduce computation costs in addition given the largest share of water consumption by agriculture in lub and many other regions worldwide an accurate estimate of et is critical for basin water management and accounting extraction of the actual et rate with high accuracy also makes it possible to indirectly estimate the potential of saving water in an agricultural region particularly due to the growing need for diminishing water loss and preventing the overuse of water in the agricultural sector either by changing the crop pattern or improving irrigation methods the coupled subsurface land surface models like the one developed in this study can provide valuable information to managers of water and agriculture 4 conclusion as one of the important international habitats in the ramsar convention lu has faced an endangering condition for at least two decades water and environmental experts agree that the drying of lu seriously affects human animal and plant life which threatens the region s environment and socioeconomic condition the drop in the lake water level has been attributed to several natural and anthropogenic factors one of the most important contributors to water stress in lub is the extensive agricultural activities with excessive water consumption natural factors such as climatic fluctuations in the region have further intensified it and accelerated the drying process of the lake to tackle the above issues effective management of water and agricultural resources is vital to meet the environmental and economic demands it is thus necessary to have a proper understanding of the amount of water that can be saved by altering the current agricultural pattern in this study we utilized a fully integrated hydrologic model in a headwater catchment in the southwestern lu to simulate the main components of water and energy cycles the results of this study suggest that 1 the water saving capacity of crop pattern change depends strongly on the trade off between the increase in surface evaporation and the decrease in vegetation et a reduction in the cultivation area does not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in the total et 2 topography and vertical soil moisture distribution influence the effectiveness of crop pattern change in saving agriculture water consumption 3 the drip irrigation system yields less total et than the spray irrigation system the spray irrigation system also made a lower volume of water available to vegetation decreasing total plant transpiration 4 the temporal resolution of radiation data strongly controls the et estimates from the land surface models radiation data with a temporal resolution lower than 12 hours caused the underestimation of et by 37 5 due to the climate driven decrease in precipitation and increase in air temperature the average streamflow and water storage will decrease by 38 and 11 33 cm in the next two decades respectively

9428,the rapid shrinkage of lake urmia over the past two decades has raised serious environmental concerns several restoration plans have been proposed to reduce agricultural water consumption to supply a remarkable fraction of the lake s environmental flow requirement however an accurate and realistic evaluation of the effectiveness of these plans in reducing agricultural water consumption across the basin is still poorly understood this study assessed the water saving potential of agricultural alteration in a snow dominated catchment in the lake urmia basin in particular we explored the impact of crop pattern alteration via reducing the cultivation area and employing different irrigation systems we further studied the degree of extra stress on the agricultural water demand under the future trends of air temperature and precipitation due to climate change to this end we developed a three dimensional physically based hydrological model that simulated the main processes involved in the water and energy cycles in this setting a surface groundwater model was coupled to a land surface model that integratively computed the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration snowmelt groundwater and soil moisture in the root zone among other processes pumping from wells and different irrigation systems were also included in the model the results showed that a reduction in the cultivation area does not necessarily lead to a significant saving in the total water loss due to evapotranspiration which strongly depends on the trade off between the decrease in transpiration and the increase in soil evaporation we further found that saving in agricultural water consumption is partly controlled by topography and the vertical distribution of soil moisture also the drip irrigation system showed lower evapotranspiration rates than the spray irrigation system finally the study of the future impacts of climate change revealed that the agriculture sector would be under more intensive stress which poses a severe threat to the long term restoration of lake urmia if effective agricultural management practices are not taken into consideration the findings of this study highlight important issues for the lake urmia restoration plans on agricultural water management given the fragility of the lake ecosystem this study suggests a reliable modeling framework for water and agricultural managers to identify the most appropriate regions in the basin that would yield the highest saving in agricultural water consumption by improving the current crop patterns and irrigation systems graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural water consumption crop pattern irrigation land surface modeling climate change lake urmia 1 introduction many hydrological systems

impacts imposed by many of these changes on the natural response of a hydrologic system typically emerge in the long term e g vorosmarty and sahagian 2000 lack of attention to these changes and delayed actions against them have degraded water quantity and quality the deterioration of many wetland ecosystems currently witnesses the possibly irreversible consequences e g lake chad in central africa aral sea in asia the great salt lake in north america and lake urmia in iran kingsford et al 2016 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 enhanced land subsidence rate in plains due to the overexploitation of groundwater resources motagh et al 2008 and diminished freshwater resources for food production hanjra and qureshi 2010 the lake urmia basin lub located in northwestern iran exemplifies this situation where lake urmia lu lost 96 of its surface area and 91 of its volume between 1996 and 2016 the main factors that contributed to the desiccation of lu were the overexploitation of water resources due to unsustainable agricultural development as evidenced by a 400 increase in the number of wells between 1984 and 2012 doe 2014 promotion of crops with high water need ulrp 2018 and the unprovided environmental flow due to an improper operation of the reservoirs constructed on the main feeding rivers of lu since 1970 doe 2013 the climate related changes in the region have also exacerbated the influence of the above actions i e lub has experienced an 18 decrease in precipitation during the last two decades relative to the long term record ulrp 2018 this drastic shrinkage intensified desertification around the lake with adverse impacts on air quality especially on the eastern side of the basin alizade govarchin ghale et al 2021 which has threatened residential health tabrizi et al 2020 drying of lu has also degraded its water quality which endangered the lake biota life such as artemia as ecologically important species abbaspour and nazaridoust 2007 the urmia lake restoration national committee was initiated in 2013 to plan several restoration actions and provide the environmental flow need of lu these actions include intra basin water transfer to lu using treated wastewater from the nearby urban areas dredging some major rivers feeding the lake rescheduling allocations from reservoirs to provide a portion of the environmental flow need and controlling agricultural water consumption ulrp 2018 among the factors mentioned above the agricultural sector has played a vital role by accounting for almost 90 of total water consumption in the basin by contrasting the actual agricultural water consumption in the entire basin against real water need urmia lake restoration program ulrp targeted an aggressive 40 reduction in agricultural water consumption by implementing specific actions ulrp 2018 this goal has been pursued by promoting crops with a low water need slowing down the overexploitation of groundwater and surface water resources and improving irrigation efficiency although the above actions are theoretically believed to reduce agricultural water consumption considerably their actual effectiveness and distinct share in reducing water consumption are still poorly understood it is thus necessary to scrutinize the real water saving capability of different agricultural water consumption scenarios which would further elucidate the relative effectiveness of software versus hardware approaches to restore lu more realistically given the inherent complexity of systems subjected to natural and anthropogenic changes such as lub predicting their hydrological response to the above actions requires identifying and understanding the feedback between the governing hydrological processes to this end integrated physically based hydrological models can be employed to simulate the governing hydrological processes such as groundwater flow unsaturated flow surface runoff snowmelt infiltration et etc and the interactions between them keune et al 2016 kuffour et al 2020 thatch et al 2020 this study developed a three dimensional physically based hydrological model to simulate all the major physical processes involved in the water and energy cycles we calibrated the model in the 1483 km2 gadarchay subbasin located in the southwest part of the lu we validated the results against ground measurements of river hydrometry and satellite derived water storage data in particular we aimed 1 to assess the water saving capacity of different irrigation systems and reduction in the cultivation area 2 to study the impact of climate change on et snowmelt and surface runoff generation as the main components of the water cycle and 3 to explore the influence of radiation temporal resolution on the et estimation as key information to compute the actual agricultural water consumption the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrological model and the data used for model calibration and validation different agricultural alteration scenarios are also described in this section section 3 presents the results and discusses the impact of agriculture alteration and climate change on the study area s main water and energy cycle components finally section 4 summarizes the main findings of this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrologic model parflow is a distributed subsurface flow model that uses the three dimensional richards equation to solve the transient variably saturated groundwater flow kuffour et al 2020 the initial version of parflow was developed for simulating fully saturated flow and transfer of chemicals in a three dimensional heterogeneous porous medium at lawrence livermore national laboratory ashby et al 1993 since then parflow has undergone several modifications or advancements for example woodward 1998 used the newton krylov multigrid module for variably saturated flow problems also kollet and maxwell 2006 introduced a new method for integrating surface and subsurface systems by using a two dimensional overland flow simulator as an upper boundary condition to the richards equation this resulted in a mixed form of the richards equation expressed as 1 s s s w ψ p ψ p t ϕ s w ψ p t k s x k r ψ p ψ p z q s where s s is the specific storage l 1 s w is the relative saturation ψ p is the pressure head l t is time t ϕ is the soil porosity k s lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k r is the relative permeability q s is a sink source term t 1 z is the depth below the surface l and is the del operator using the van genuchten relationships van genuchten 1980 s w and k r can be calculated as 2 s w ψ p s sat s res 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 θ s res 3 k r ψ p 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 θ 2 1 α ψ p θ 1 1 θ 2 where s sat is the relative saturation water content s res is the relative residual saturation and α l 1 and θ are the van genuchten parameters in this way the overland flow is fully integrated with the subsurface flow and is computed directly as the solution of richard s equation see kollet and maxwell 2006 and references therein for further details maxwell 2013 developed a new terrain following grid to reduce the computational cost which skips computation for the inactive cells based on the domain topography to simulate the physical processes related to the energy balance at the land surface such as et and snowmelt and to understand the interactions between the land surface and subsurface processes parflow was coupled with the common land model clm dai et al 2003 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 parflow and clm exchange information in the soil column of the root zone where the most topsoil layer in parflow corresponds to the first soil layer in the clm indeed parflow first solves the equations related to water balance in the soil layers and calculates the soil moisture and pressure for each cell then clm uses the calculated soil moisture and pressure from parflow and solves the energy balance equations for the soil and snow layers finally the calculated fluxes by clm such as infiltration and et are exchanged with parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell and kollet 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 2 2 study area the 52 000 km2 lub is located in northwestern iran between 35⁰ 41 38⁰ 29 n and 44⁰ 13 47⁰ 53 e fig 1 governed by a semi arid climate the average annual temperature precipitation and relative humidity in lub are 12 350 mm and 58 respectively doe 2013 lub encompasses the hypersaline lu that was designated as a ramsar site 1975 biosphere reserve 1976 protected area 1967 and national park 1971 the lake water is mainly supplied by river inflow from 17 permanent and 12 seasonal rivers however 72 of the water volume entering lu comes from the southern rivers of the drainage basin sharifan et al 2017 this study focused on one of the main southern subbasins i e the gadarchay subbasin 36⁰ 58 17 n and 45⁰ 23 33 e fig 1b where the gadar river accounts for 10 of the total annual flow into lu two nested hydrometric stations on the gadar river i e peyghaleh and naghadeh drain 19 and 71 of the gadarchay subbasin respectively fig 1b land cover in the naghadeh subbasin includes rangeland 60 9 rainfed agriculture 19 3 orchard 11 6 irrigated agriculture 6 7 and built ups 1 5 also 67 3 of rainfed agriculture comprises wheat and barley and the rest includes pea lentils and beans the irrigated agriculture is composed of wheat and barley 52 8 sugar beet 20 1 and alfalfa 27 1 the topographic elevation ranges remarkably between 1205 m and 3609 m above the mean sea level the peyghaleh subbasin is considered the main headwater of the larger naghadeh subbasin during winter and spring peyghaleh is mainly covered with snow the underlying land cover is only rangeland and there are no agricultural practices in this region in this study we developed the hydrologic model for the entire extent of fig 1b the model extent was chosen to be larger than the study basin to avoid numerical issues at the basin boundary nevertheless the model results were ultimately extracted from within the study basin boundary for further analysis 2 3 ground based and remote sensing data 2 3 1 meteorological data clm requires meteorological data on precipitation mm s air temperature k east west wind speed m s south to north wind speed m s atmospheric pressure pa downward shortwave radiation dswr w m2 downward longwave radiation dlwr w m2 and specific humidity kg kg air temperature wind speed and atmospheric pressure were obtained from the measured data at the two available synoptic stations in the study area precipitation data were recorded at both synoptic stations and rain gauges other variables i e dswr dlwr and specific humidity were not measured at the stations thus we received dlwr and specific humidity data from the global land data assimilation system gldas database rodell et al 2004 we calculated dswr using the following relationship allen et al 1998 4 dswr a s b s n n r a where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 n is the actual duration of sunshine hour recorded at the synoptic station n is the maximum possible duration of sunshine and as and bs are the regression constants further details on determining the above variables parameters are provided in the appendix to account for the orographic effects on the temperature and pressure data measured at the oshanviyeh station we used the lapse rate method as 5 v pixel v station elv pixel elv station laps where v pixel is the amount of variable i e temperature or pressure in a given pixel v station is the measured data at the station elv pixel is the pixel elevation m elv station is the station elevation m and laps is the lapse rate for the variable by substituting the average value of temperature pressure and the elevation of the synoptic stations i e oshnaviyeh and naghadeh in equation 5 the number of laps for the two variables was calculated separately precipitation is highly localized unlike temperature and pressure especially in mountainous basins such as our study case therefore a constant amount of the lapse rate cannot be used for the entire basin to consider the localization effects we first delineated the subbasins of the naghadeh basin then for each subbasin s pixels we used precipitation data recorded in the nearest rain gauge to the subbasin s centroid next the following equation was used in each subbasin to generate the spatially distributed precipitation data galván et al 2014 6 r pixel r gauge 1 elv elv gauge plaps pcp year in this equation r pixel is the precipitation depth in a given pixel mm r gauge is the recorded precipitation depth at the nearest gauge to the centroid of the corresponding subbasin mm plaps mm m is the precipitation lapse rate and pcp year is the annual average precipitation mm 2 3 2 soil hydrological properties parflow requires the soil hydrological properties i e permeability porosity and van genuchten parameters as input data to simulate groundwater flow in the unsaturated and saturated zones permeability and porosity data were obtained from the global dataset of soil hydraulic and thermal parameters for earth system modeling dai et al 2013 2019 these data can be received in the netcdf format with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds land atmosphere interaction research group at sun yat sen university 2021 we extracted the van genuchten parameters from the global data set of montzka et al 2017 at 0 25 degree spatial resolution finally for the manning s roughness values we used the data produced by japan international cooperation agency 2020 in lub based on the land cover map 2 3 3 gcm data the predicted precipitation and temperature data by the global climate models gcm s can be used to investigate future climate change impact on the river streamflow and water storage in the study area since the prediction of climatic variables may be inconsistent between different gcm s considering different gcm s would facilitate exploring the distinction between them to represent the mean climate state and variability however due to the high computational cost of running parflow clm under different gcm based predictions we chose the most suitable gcm model for the study area i e hadcm3 based on the findings of previous studies that successfully used this model in the same region ahmadaali et al 2018 mahsafar et al 2017 salahi et al 2017 we add that despite the lower resolution of hadcm3 predictions as compared to those obtained from the more recent models such as hadgem3 it still yields reliable results with respect to climate mean flato et al 2014 reichler and kim 2008 valdes et al 2017 which suffices for the purposes of this study former studies in lu showed that a2 a1b and b1 scenarios best represent the climatic future of the region in this study we focused on the a1b scenario as it predicts the medium level of co2 emission as compared to that from the a2 and a1b scenarios the extracted gcm data for the a1b scenario indicate that under a confidence level of 95 the temperature will experience a significant increasing trend i e 0 05 c per year at the same time precipitation will show an insignificant decreasing trend i e 4 mm per year 2 3 4 soil moisture data to validate the simulated soil moisture we compared the model results with the soil moisture data given by gldas 2 1 rodell et al 2004 at a 0 25 degree spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution since gldas provides soil moisture data in the top 2 m of the soil layer the above comparison was made in this layer 2 4 domain setup parflow was configured with a lateral resolution of 1 km with 68 pixels in the east west direction 45 pixels in the north south direction and six vertical soil layers with 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m 1 4 m 11 m and 137 m discretization for a total model dimension of 68 km 45 km 0 15 km and 18 360 cells the upper five soil layers were discretized with a finer vertical resolution to more accurately simulate the land surface atmosphere interactions the bottom and sides of the domain were all set to a no flux boundary we used the 30 m usgs digital elevation model dem to construct the domain geometry since the model grid cell is 1 km the 30 m dem layer was resampled to a 1 km resolution using bilinear interpolation we post processed the dem data using the pit filling algorithm to fill the sinks and then used it to generate the slope layers in the east west and north south directions to examine the accuracy of the slope layers we examined the parking lot test the emerged river network in the parking lot test did not completely match the actual river network this often happens due to the upscaling of a high resolution dem layer where a fraction of information especially in regions with sharp fluctuations in elevation is missed for instance if the distance between two rivers is smaller than 1 km the model cannot distinguish them from each other to address this issue we digitized the domain s existing river network and then enforced it to the slope layers which yielded an acceptable river network in the parking lot experiment given the input data in section 2 3 we warmed up the model by initializing the water table at a constant depth we then executed the model repeatedly for multiple water years until the change in groundwater storage was smaller than 1 of total annual precipitation we conducted the spin up process by using the climate data of the 2010 2011 water year a time step of one hour was used for all simulations to reach a stable solution 2 5 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the model we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 the modified form of nse i e mse muleta 2012 and the root mean square error rmse as 7 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 8 mse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i q obs 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 where q sim is the simulated streamflow q obs is the observed streamflow q obs is the average observed streamflow and n is the length of time series nse evaluates the performance of a hydrologic model by emphasizing the model s ability to reproduce the peak streamflow values we computed mse to further assess the model performance in reproducing low flows the maximum possible value for nse and mse is 1 the predictive power of a model with an nse of zero is similar to the mean of the time series while the models with negative nse have worse performance than the mean of the time series we also used rmse as an indicator of the absolute prediction error rmse ranges between zero and where the smaller rmse values indicate a more considerable prediction accuracy 2 6 agricultural alteration scenarios we designed eight scenarios to evaluate the hydrologic response of the gadarchay basin to a variety of agricultural alterations in terms of changes in the cultivation area and irrigation systems the characteristics of each scenario are summarized as follows 1 baseline the purpose of this scenario was to simulate the benchmark situation in the study area in the water year 2012 2013 due to groundwater extraction and irrigation in the region we have considered both in the model developed for this scenario the irrigation rate was calculated by dividing the annual irrigation water volume obtained from the iran ministry of energy database by the number of irrigation hours according to the land cover map irrigation was applied from may to the end of the water year from 7 am to 5 pm every day on only the irrigated agriculture grid cells parflow clm assumes that the required water for irrigation is imported from an external source e g pumping wells transferring from out of the basin etc and the volume of water pumped from wells is directly exported to outside the basin as such a simultaneous simulation of irrigation and pumping is consistent with the actual situation of the basin the drip irrigation system was used in this scenario 2 spray irrigation system irsp the purpose of this scenario was to compare the impact of spray and drip irrigation systems on the rate of et and streamflow the irrigation rate and timing were considered similar to the baseline scenario the drip irrigation system was assumed for the rest of the scenarios described below 3 10 reduction in total cultivation area ar10 the total cultivated area upstream of the naghadeh hydrometric station is 665 km2 of which 540 km2 and 125 km2 are composed of rainfed and irrigated crops respectively to investigate the impact of reduction in the cultivated area on the river streamflow and et 10 of the total cultivated area including both irrigated and rainfed agriculture was converted to rangeland the amount of irrigation and pumping volume were reduced accordingly 4 100 reduction in cultivated area ar100 this scenario aimed to investigate the extreme condition of no agricultural activity in the study area the total cultivated area was replaced by rangeland hence irrigation was allowed only in the orchard farms 5 none irrigation n ir this scenario is the same as the baseline scenario except no irrigation took place in the model the aim of this scenario and the next two ones were to investigate the mere impact of reduction in the cultivated area on the system response by turning the irrigation off the results of this scenario would enable us to directly compare the results of baseline ar10 and ar100 scenarios with the n ir n ir a10 and n ir a100 scenarios respectively 6 none irrigation and 10 reduction in cultivated area n ir ar10 in this scenario a 10 reduction of the cultivated area was implemented while irrigation was turned off the aim of this scenario was to explore the mere impact of reduction in the vegetation cover on et and other quantities of interest 7 none irrigation and 100 reduction in cultivated area n ir ar100 in this scenario the entire cultivated area was converted to rangeland and thus no irrigation took place in the model 8 climate change we explored the impact of climate change on the simulated river streamflow and water storage from 2018 to 2040 to this end parflow clm was forced with the predicted precipitation and temperature given by gcm projection described in section 2 3 3 we considered the 2011 2018 and 2019 2040 water years as the base and prediction periods respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of model performance fig 2a and b show the simulated and observed daily streamflow at the peyghaleh and naghadeh hydrometric stations respectively the results indicate a very good agreement between the observed and simulated streamflow time series as evidenced by nse 0 71 mse 0 64 and rmse 7 34 m3 s at the peyghaleh station and nse 0 67 mse 0 58 and rmse 8 57 m3 s at the naghadeh station the model could successfully capture the flashiness in the streamflow time series particularly during the extreme flood event of april 2017 we note that the accuracy of the simulated streamflow at the naghadeh station is smaller than that at the peyghaleh station especially during the low flow seasons this is because the model produces baseflow at the naghadeh station in this period while the observed streamflow was recorded zero at this station given the permanent flow in the gadar river zero baseflow recorded by the hydrometric station cannot be valid and may be attributed to the gauge error or malfunctioning during very low flows fig 2c compares the monthly averaged simulated soil moisture in the top 2 m of soil layer with that extracted from gldas we observe that both time series follow the same seasonality and fluctuations over the study period the average soil moisture simulated by the model and that obtained from gldas differs by 5 7 and the rmse of the soil moisture is 44 6 mm these measures confirm the good fit between the two time series 3 2 dynamics of water and energy cycles components fig 3a shows the daily time series of air temperature ground heat flux and ground temperature in the water year 2012 2013 as a representative of water and energy cycles in the study area the air temperature constantly decreases from october to mid january which explains the loss of energy by the ground as evidenced by the declined ground temperature the ground heat flux is thus almost always negative during this period as the air temperature rises from mid january the ground begins to gain energy leading to positive heat flux and a rise in the ground temperature the air and ground temperatures generally show an upward trend until mid july regardless of daily fluctuations with the onset of september the air temperature drops again and causes the ground heat flux to be negative fig 3b shows the time series of precipitation and snow water equivalent swe in the water year 2012 2013 since the air temperature is above the freezing limit from october until mid december precipitation occurs as rainfall and consequently swe is zero during this period therefore the input precipitation mainly contributes to runoff production or infiltrates into the subsurface from mid december to mid march a fraction of total precipitation falls as snow when the freezing temperature is reached which leads to increased swe swe slightly decreases due to snowmelt in the intervals between two consecutive snowfall events with the onset of spring from mid march snowmelt begins and keeps on with almost a constant rate until early june despite the rising air temperature from early july until the end of august the rate of snowmelt i e the slope of the swe time series declines because of the diminished spatial coverage and volume of stored snow in the region the above results indicate that snowmelt dominates runoff generation in this region mainly during spring when snowmelt peak occurs this hints at the critical role of the snow module in any hydrological modeling attempt in lub which has been ignored in several developed models in the study region e g chaudhari et al 2018 shadkam et al 2016a fig 3c shows the simulated et and its components i e soil evaporation and vegetation et where vegetation et is the sum of plant transpiration and evaporation from the vegetation leaves we observe that soil evaporation comprises 84 of total et which is expected based on the underlying land cover map in the fall and winter et is relatively low but there are still fluctuations in the et time series due to the occurrence of precipitation or increase in temperature in the late winter and spring the rate of et increases due to the rising temperature and available soil moisture with the onset of summer the rate of et decreases due to a decrease in soil moisture since no precipitation occurs in the summer the decreasing trend of et rate continues until the end of the water year in addition to the air temperature and soil moisture the time series of vegetation et depends on the area of canopy coverage in the region comparing the time series of transpiration and leaf area index not shown here reveals a tight agreement between them 3 3 exploring the water saving potential of different irrigation systems and reduction in cultivation area the results of the seven scenarios described in section 2 6 indicate that transpiration constitutes 72 85 of vegetation et in the studied scenarios also we observe that 84 88 of total et comprises soil evaporation thus we expect a maximum reduction of 16 in et due to the control of agricultural water consumption if no agricultural activities occur in the study area table 1 gives the percent change of streamflow total et and its components for the scenarios defined in section 2 6 compared to those on the baseline scenario comparison between the results of baseline and irsp scenarios shows that transpiration in the spray irrigation system was reduced by 14 as compared to that in the drip irrigation system this observation indicates that a larger volume of water is available to vegetation under the drip irrigation system also due to a larger interception by vegetation in the spray irrigation system the amount of water reaching the soil is less than that in the drip irrigation system hence soil evaporation was reduced in the spray irrigation system overall the spray irrigation system increased total et which is mainly attributed to the increased water loss due to evaporation from the intercepted water by vegetation leaves the advantages of a drip irrigation system in saving water higher crop yield and better crop health have also been highlighted by former studies kumar and palanisami 2010 tl et al 2009 the above capability of parflow clm to separate and quantify the contribution of different et components provides helpful information that can be leveraged to determine the most efficient type of irrigation system in a desired study area conditioned on the underlying vegetation type here we note that the water saving capacity of other irrigation systems such as surface and pressurized irrigation was studied by ahmadzadeh et al 2016 in the zarrinehrud basin located in the southern lu they concluded that even though the pressurized irrigation system can reduce plant water uptake and improve irrigation efficiency it may adversely decrease groundwater recharge and return flow due to the reduced percolation into the deeper soil layers by examining two pilot farms in the miandoab irrigation network located in the southern lu dehghanisanij et al 2020 also found that the average water consumption was reduced by about 29 7 by changing the planting pattern from common spacing to two row and changing the irrigation method from border to furrow given the above findings the results of the present study can thus be considered a complementary piece of information on the effectiveness of different irrigation systems in reducing agricultural water consumption in lub the results of ar10 scenario reveal that a 10 reduction in the cultivated area decreased vegetation et due to a decrease in vegetation transpiration while it increased soil evaporation slightly also in the ar100 scenario evaporation from soil and vegetation leaves increased and decreased slightly respectively indeed removing vegetation off the cultivated pixels increased the amount of energy that reached the soil surface and subsequently increased soil evaporation however the effect on total et of reduction in vegetation et was more significant than that from the increase in soil evaporation thus total et was decreased in both scenarios relative to the baseline we also observe that a reduction in streamflow has taken place in both scenarios this is because the amount of irrigation was reduced in proportion to the decrease in cultivated area in the n ir scenario soil evaporation and transpiration decreased by 5 2 and 23 1 respectively leading to a 7 5 decrease in total et this observation highlights the remarkable impact of irrigation on the water availability to vegetation in the n ir ar10 and n ir ar100 scenarios vegetation et decreased by 21 5 and 31 6 respectively while soil evaporation decreased by 4 8 and 3 1 respectively indeed it is interesting that the change in total et in the n ir ar10 and n ir ar100 scenarios is almost the same as that in the n ir scenario this is because the reduction in vegetation et due to the decrease in the cultivated area was compensated by the increase in soil evaporation the above findings point out that even though the decrease in the cultivation area reduces the amount of vegetation et it allows more energy to reach the soil due to the diminished leaf area index and thus increases the soil evaporation a comparison of the n ir and n ir ar10 scenarios shows that in the n ir ar10 scenario the amount of reduction in vegetation et is less than the amount of increase in the soil evaporation which led to an increase in total et relative to the n ir scenario however in the n ir ar100 scenario the amount of reduction in vegetation et is larger than the increase in the amount of soil evaporation resulting in a decrease in total et therefore total et does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the cultivation area instead there is a trade off between the increase in soil evaporation and a decrease in total et if the cultivation area is reduced the above findings indicate that even though reducing the cultivation area or changing the crop pattern from high to low water need crops can reduce plant transpiration total et may not change significantly by developing a swat model in the siminehrud subbasin located in the southern lu rezaei zaman et al 2016 also found that despite the effectiveness of crop pattern change to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change such activities may not save sufficient water to guarantee the long term sustainability of lu we further observe that in the n ir ar10 and n ir ar100 scenarios streamflow has decreased by 2 6 and 3 2 respectively we note that such a reduction in streamflow due to the reduced cultivation area cannot be considered a general conclusion for the whole lub this is because the trade off between soil evaporation and vegetation et may be dominant only in regions with high soil moisture conditions the spatial distribution of soil moisture not shown here indicates that this condition holds in the southern and west southern parts of lub such as the gadarchay subbasin at the same time the groundwater level is much lower in the other parts of lub as such our findings may not be consistent with the results of some previous studies which explored the effect of reduction in the cultivation area on streamflow over the entire lub for instance farokhnia et al 2019 showed that there could be a 414 mcm increase in the annual inflow to the lu if 100 k hectares reductions in the irrigated area would take place in the entire lub between 1999 and 2009 therefore the geographic location of crop pattern change should be taken into account if this practice is targeted to save agricultural water consumption as an objective our results indicate that crop pattern change in the regions with a lower groundwater level would yield a more promising outcome here we note that hamidi razi et al 2019 also attempted to quantify the impact of different scenarios on lu restoration including a 40 reduction in agricultural water use they concluded that this scenario could increase the volume of lu s stored water by 90 in comparison to the scenario in which no intervention is carried out nevertheless we emphasize that this conclusion should be considered with caution a careful examination of the methodology used in the study of hamidi razi et al 2019 reveals that the above amount of saved water from agriculture was assumed to be entirely directed towards the lake indeed their physically based hydrological model did not quantify the actual amount of savable water from agriculture alteration instead the developed 2 d shallow water hydrodynamic model evaluated the amount of change in the lake s stored volume under lake inflow augmentation therefore such approaches cannot truly evaluate the actual amount of savable water from agriculture alterations unless they are coupled with basin scale hydrological models that can simulate the underlying physical processes of et soil infiltration etc 3 4 the impact of climate change on runoff generation and et projection of climate change scenarios demonstrates that lub will experience higher temperatures and less precipitation in the next two decades karimi et al 2018 to investigate the system response to these climatic changes we simulated streamflow and water storage from 2018 to 2040 the results indicate that the average simulated streamflow in the base and prediction period is 258 mcm yr and 159 mcm yr respectively which shows a 38 reduction in the simulated streamflow under the changing climate this observation is consistent with shadkam et al 2016b findings which showed a 10 and 27 decline in inflow to lu under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios respectively moreover we observed that the average water storage in the base and prediction period is 179 454 bcm yr and 179 107 bcm yr respectively which is equivalent to a decrease of 11 33 cm in the prediction period as compared to that in the base period the above observations witness that climate change will impose further challenges on the lub water management and lu restoration despite significant practices planned and executed by ulrp over the past few years lu s restoration status has been dynamic and does not show a promising trend in the near future such uncertainty arises from the success degree of software activities that ulrp has targeted to provide the required environmental flow of lu for instance saving water from agriculture as the primary water consumer in the basin is believed to yield the largest fraction of required water for lu restoration as compared to the other activities such as inter basin water transfer treated wastewater and control of illegal withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources nevertheless controlling the cultivation area from further development has been challenging due to the conflict of interest between different stakeholders in the basin furthermore sufficient investment in alternative occupations has not been supported by the government so that farmers are encouraged to reduce the extent of their agricultural activities the above evidence underlines that serious activities in the line of reducing irrigation water in the basin must be put into action such that the adverse impact of climate change via increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation may be mitigated to a tangible extent former studies have demonstrated that even though anthropogenic activities have been the major driver of lu drying further desiccation of lu can be exacerbated by the influence of changing climate in lub abbaspour et al 2012 delju et al 2013 in the following decades the predicted trend for precipitation and temperature will undoubtedly put the agriculture sector in lub under further pressure concerning water deficiency and food security in addition the statistically significant increase in lub s average temperature as witnessed by the gcm projections abbasian et al 2021 will also change the snowmelt timing and volume towards early snowmelt and less runoff generation as a snow dominated basin where snowmelt constitutes a significant portion of annual runoff the above situation has important implications for changing water cycle dynamics in lub for instance despite the 91 increase of precipitation in all stations within lub in the spring of 2018 relative to that in the spring of 2017 the lake water volume decreased by more than 500 mcm in this period to explore the possible causes of this unexpected observation fig 4 compares the time series of the main water balance components between 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 water years i e air temperature precipitation streamflow swe et and the average soil saturation in the topsoil layer we observe that even though the amounts of precipitation in both winters are approximately equal the temperatures are quite different indeed the air temperature is often above the freezing temperature during the winter of 2018 while the opposite holds in the winter of 2017 therefore the volume of swe fig 4c in 2018 was sharply decreased relative to that in 2017 consequently despite larger precipitation depth the generated streamflow in the spring of 2018 was less than that in the spring of 2017 fig 4f which is mainly attributed to the reduction in snow storage and runoff generation through snowmelt besides the volume of swe its spatial distribution over the region plays a critical role in runoff generation by controlling the soil moisture fig 5 illustrates the snow cover spatial distribution between december and march we observe that due to a higher temperature in the winter of 2018 as compared to that in the winter of 2017 a lower number of snow covered pixels are seen only in the very high altitudes on the other hand the higher temperature in the winter of 2018 compared to that in 2017 resulted in larger et i e larger water loss fig 4d the combination of increase in winter et and decrease in snow storage caused the topsoil layer to hold less moisture in the spring of 2018 relative to that in the spring of 2017 fig 4e therefore the relatively low intensity rainfall events during the spring of 2018 could not trigger a remarkable runoff generation in fig 4e we observe that such low intensity rainfall events only caused moderate fluctuations in the soil moisture during the spring of 2018 especially in april and may without generating significant streamflow furthermore in the intervals between consecutive low intensity precipitations et reduced the soil moisture again and prevented considerable runoff generation by subsequent precipitation events as such it is clearly seen that the combination of less snowpack and low intensity rainfall events was the main reason for the decreasing volume of water entering the lake in the spring of 2018 compared to that in the spring of 2017 3 5 the significance of radiation temporal resolution on et estimates we also investigated the impact of dswr temporal resolution i e 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h and 24 h on the estimated et and streamflow in the oshnaviyeh subbasin fig 6 illustrates the total annual et and streamflow under different temporal resolutions of dswr table 2 further gives the percent change of these quantities relative to the baseline i e hourly forcing data we observe that as the temporal resolution of dswr decreases from hourly to daily the absolute percent change of estimated et volume increases from 0 5 to 37 5 also the simulated streamflow increases from 0 3 to 17 8 these observations reveal that diurnal fluctuations in dswr cause a remarkable influence on the volume of simulated et and streamflow particularly when 12 hour or daily data is used see fig 6 the considerable sensitivity of the estimated et and streamflow volumes to dswr temporal resolution is because a hydrologic system does not respond linearly to daily fluctuations in dswr when a higher resolution data i e hourly is aggregated into a lower temporal resolution data i e daily the wide variation in the et estimation error can be further explained by contrasting the time series of dswr at different temporal resolutions as indicated in the inset of fig 6 it can be inferred that by making the radiation data course in time the diurnal variation of radiation is aggregated towards a constant value this temporal coarsening disregards the influence of above average radiation values on any physical quantity that controls the et estimates such as surface temperature and ground heat flux former studies have demonstrated that among different net radiation meteorological and vegetation index data products the choice of net radiation dataset imposes the most significant influence on the terrestrial et estimates derived from either remotely sensed or physically based models badgley et al 2015 ferguson et al 2010 as such utilizing high temporal resolution data on radiation seems necessary to achieve reliable outcomes from the land surface models in this regard hourly data from geostationary satellites can be leveraged to simulate the hydrological processes that are highly dynamic at the diurnal scale like et liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 the above finding has important implications for the distributed land surface modeling where modeling temporal resolution may be compromised by a tendency to reduce computation costs in addition given the largest share of water consumption by agriculture in lub and many other regions worldwide an accurate estimate of et is critical for basin water management and accounting extraction of the actual et rate with high accuracy also makes it possible to indirectly estimate the potential of saving water in an agricultural region particularly due to the growing need for diminishing water loss and preventing the overuse of water in the agricultural sector either by changing the crop pattern or improving irrigation methods the coupled subsurface land surface models like the one developed in this study can provide valuable information to managers of water and agriculture 4 conclusion as one of the important international habitats in the ramsar convention lu has faced an endangering condition for at least two decades water and environmental experts agree that the drying of lu seriously affects human animal and plant life which threatens the region s environment and socioeconomic condition the drop in the lake water level has been attributed to several natural and anthropogenic factors one of the most important contributors to water stress in lub is the extensive agricultural activities with excessive water consumption natural factors such as climatic fluctuations in the region have further intensified it and accelerated the drying process of the lake to tackle the above issues effective management of water and agricultural resources is vital to meet the environmental and economic demands it is thus necessary to have a proper understanding of the amount of water that can be saved by altering the current agricultural pattern in this study we utilized a fully integrated hydrologic model in a headwater catchment in the southwestern lu to simulate the main components of water and energy cycles the results of this study suggest that 1 the water saving capacity of crop pattern change depends strongly on the trade off between the increase in surface evaporation and the decrease in vegetation et a reduction in the cultivation area does not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in the total et 2 topography and vertical soil moisture distribution influence the effectiveness of crop pattern change in saving agriculture water consumption 3 the drip irrigation system yields less total et than the spray irrigation system the spray irrigation system also made a lower volume of water available to vegetation decreasing total plant transpiration 4 the temporal resolution of radiation data strongly controls the et estimates from the land surface models radiation data with a temporal resolution lower than 12 hours caused the underestimation of et by 37 5 due to the climate driven decrease in precipitation and increase in air temperature the average streamflow and water storage will decrease by 38 and 11 33 cm in the next two decades respectively

9429,quantification of actual crop evapotranspiration eta over large areas is a critical issue to manage water resources particularly in semi arid regions in this study four models driven by high resolution remote sensing data were intercompared and evaluated over an heterogeneous and complex traditional irrigated area located in the piedmont of the high atlas mountain morocco during the 2017 and 2018 seasons 1 satellite monitoring of irrigation samir which is a software based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient water balance model fed with sentinel 2 high resolution normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to derive the basal crop coefficient k cb 2 soil plant atmosphere and remote sensing evapotranspiration sparse which is a surface energy balance model fed with land surface temperature lst derived from thermal data provided from landsat 7 and 8 3 a modified version of the shuttleworth wallace sw model which uses the lst to compute surface resistances and 4 metric gee which is a version of metric model mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration that operates on the google earth engine platform also driven by lst actual evapotranspiration eta measurements from two eddy covariance ec systems and a large aperture scintillometer las were used to evaluate the four models one ec was used to calibrate samir and sparse ec1 which were validated using the second one ec2 providing a root mean square error rmse and a determination coefficient r of 0 53 mm day r 0 82 and 0 66 mm day r 0 74 respectively sw and metric gee simulations were obtained respectively from a previous study and google earth engine gee therefore no calibration was performed in this study the four models predict well the seasonal course of eta during two successive growing seasons 2017 and 2018 however their performances were contrasted and varied depending on the seasons the water stress conditions and the vegetation development by comparing the statistical results between the simulation and the measurements of eta it has been shown that samir and metric gee are the less scattered and the better in agreement with the las measurements rmse equal to 0 73 and 0 68 mm day and r equal to 0 74 and 0 82 respectively on the other hand sparse is less scattered rmse 0 90 mm day r 0 54 than sw which is slightly better correlated rmse 0 98 mm day r 0 60 with the observations this study contributes to explore the complementarities between these approaches in order to improve the evapotranspiration mapping monitored with high resolution remote sensing data keywords evapotranspiration modeling remote sensing energy balance fao 56 irrigation 1 introduction the mediterranean region suffers from drought and increasing depletion of water resources due to the effect of climate change and of the increasing anthropic water demand le page et al 2012 however agricultural production continues to increase and is the largest consumer of available water resources boukhari et al 2015 in order to achieve a balance between agricultural production and water availability a good monitoring of the crop hydric conditions is necessary numerous studies have been conducted on the measurement and estimation of the water balance components of the crops in the semi arid region of tensift al haouz but most of these studies were carried out in the plain amazirh et al 2017 aouade et al 2020 diarra et al 2017 er raki et al 2010 ezzahar et al 2007a hssaine merlin et al 2018 ouaadi et al 2020 rafi et al 2019 by contrast the mountain foothills in semi arid regions are potential recharge areas for the groundwater table blasch and bryson 2007 bouimouass et al 2020 liu and yamanaka 2012 martinez et al 2017 this recharge is poorly known but could be quantified by residual balance term however the uncertainty on the water balance variables in these regions such as the precipitation and evapotranspiration et increase the uncertainty on the estimation of recharge hence there is a need for an accurate estimate of et in the last decades a number of studies focused on developing several methods for measuring and estimating eta based on remote sensing that provides valuable data to assess its spatial and temporal variation there is a variety of methods allowing direct or indirect eta measurement in the field with variable spatial and temporal representativeness allen et al 2011 er raki et al 2013 the most used methods are the lysimeter sánchez et al 2019 widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 and the eddy covariance system anapalli et al 2020 fang et al 2020 both provide typically hectometric scale measurements and the scintillometer allowing measurements over transects of several kilometers duchemin et al 2008 elfarkh et al 2020 ezzahar et al 2007a 2007b 2009a 2009b 2009c isabelle et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 while these devices are the most accurate way to measure et their use over large areas is limited due to their cost and their limited spatial representativity especially in mediterranean landscapes known by heterogenous crops and water status major efforts to develop methods for eta mapping have been undertaken during the last decades particularly with the development of remote sensing data providing land surface characteristics using multi spectral data from optical bands the most physical approaches are based on soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models coupling the soil water balance and the surface energy balance for soil plant atmosphere system and to quantify the amount of eta released in the atmosphere montes et al 2014 these models offer an accurate estimates of eta but are complex because in addition to meteorological forcing i e air temperature and humidity wind speed incident radiation rainfall they require a large number of parameters such as information on vegetation structure i e leaf area index lai height and vegetation functioning i e stomatal conductance on thermal and hydraulic properties of the soil olioso et al 1999 to overcome these constraints simplified water balance models have been proposed like the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 this model requires a lower number of parameters and some of the main ones the crop coefficients can be related to the amount of active vegetation present in the surface so that they can be estimated from remote sensing using vegetation indices on the other hand another category of eta estimation method is based on the surface energy balance seb seb type models are usually constrained by satellite land surface temperature observations which are considered as a good indicator of the water status of the surface allowing to take into consideration the stress condition in estimating actual et they calculate the sensible heat flux h from which the latent heat flux le associated with eta is estimated as a residual term of the energy balance equation chirouze et al 2014 these models are a good indicator of the crop water status but they basically provide instantaneous estimates of eta at the time of the satellite acquisition seb models can be divided into two levels of complexity li et al 2009 1 single source models that consider the surface as a big leaf allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 roerink et al 2000 su 2002 and 2 dual source models distinguishing between soil and vegetation processes anderson et al 1997 boulet et al 2015 norman et al 1995 numerous authors have compared these two approaches showing that dual source models show better performance over sparse vegetation however several authors have also found that with a correct calibration even a single source model can properly simulate the energy fluxes bastiaanssen et al 1998 kustas and norman 1996 the main objective of this study was to test the performance of different approaches used for estimating eta over a heterogeneous landscape of traditional irrigated agriculture in a semi arid area located in the piedmont of the high atlas mountains morocco a simplified water balance model samir simonneaux et al 2009 sparse model boulet et al 2015 the modified shuttleworth wallace model elfarkh et al 2021 and metric model allen et al 2007 were compared during two seasons 2017 and 2018 this study is a preliminary step to build an hybrid approach that could benefit from both the continuity of water budget based estimates and the accuracy of thermal based ones 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was carried out over the piedmont of the high atlas mountain near the marrakech city in the center of morocco 31 22 1 19 n 7 56 47 21 o fig 1 the climate in this area is semi arid with irregular and low rainfall especially during the study period with a total rainfall of 157 mm for 2017 and 384 mm for 2018 the study site is characterized mainly by traditional olive trees of various ages with some other species apple apricot plum orange peach eta and a frequent understory of annual crops below the trees mainly cereals crops are irrigated by the traditional flooding technique using water diverted from the river issued from the mountains some patches of bare soils are also present especially at the surrounding of the irrigated area 2 2 experimental data both ec stations ec1 and ec2 were equipped by meteorological instruments to measure the net radiation components cnr4 radiometer campbell scientific at a height of 17 m air temperature and humidity vaisala hmp155 campbell scientific at height of 16 m fig 1 also the soil heat flux was measured at a depth of 5 cm using two heat flux plates hpf 01 campbell scientific one shaded by trees and the other one exposed to solar radiation the rainfall was recorded using a rain gauge arg100 ec installed close to the scintillometer receiver fig 1 flux stations were installed during 2017 and 2018 over two olive tree plots located in the study area on 17 5 m height towers ec1 and ec2 sites elfarkh et al 2020 the land cover of these two sites is supposed to be representative of the entire site namely traditional olive plantations of 7 10 m height with an understory of herbaceous vegetation mainly wheat ec2 shows more heterogeneity than ec1 since it includes olive trees other fruit trees mainly apple trees and annual crops elfarkh et al 2020 they measured the sensible and latent heat fluxes using the eddy correlation method consisting of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific ltd and a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific ltd the raw data were sampled at a rate of 20 hz and then used to calculate sensible h and latent le heat fluxes offline using the ec processing software ecpack van dijk et al 2004 the energy balance closure analysis showed that the sum of the turbulent fluxes only reaches 60 of the available energy elfarkh et al 2020 which can be considered acceptable due to the complexity of the study sites therefore the correction of ec data was performed using the approach suggested by twine et al 2000 which assumes the non closure energy balance is due to underestimates from ec measurements while the corresponding bowen ratio h le is correctly estimated however the reliability of eta after this correction still affected by some uncertainty given the assumptions taken in the bowen correction namely the assumption that the difference between the net radiation rn and the soil heat flux g is equal to the sum of h and le neglecting the energy stored in the canopy in addition the footprint of the devices that measure both energy quantity rn g and h le are different and that can generate an error especially in heterogeneous areas such as our study site in addition to the ec towers a large aperture scintillometer las was installed over a 1464 m transect consisting of a receiver installed on a tower of about 10 m and a transmitter over a building of about 10 5 m in the city elfarkh et al 2020 due to topography the height between the las path and the ground varied between 10 and 50 m and the effective height computed was around 26 m hartogensis et al 2003 the measurement of the refraction phenomena produced by the air turbulence allow the calculation of the variation of the structure parameter of the refractive index c n 2 along the path wesely 1976 the sensible heat flux h was calculated iteratively based on the monin obukhov theory de bruin et al 1993 the latent heat flux le was obtained as the residual term of the energy balance where available energy was computed from the ground measurements elfarkh et al 2020 for the le computation we used the rn and g measured at the ec1 site which is considered representative of the land cover present in the las footprint however this remains an approximation and one possible improvement would be to multiply measurements of rn and g along the las path but this is operationally difficult to achieve for the sake of simplicity we also didn t compute modis estimates of daily rn saadi et al 2015 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 sentinel 2 data the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was computed using sentinel 2 red r band 4 and near infrared nir band 8 reflectances at 10 m resolution eq 1 the sentinel 2 images were downloaded from the theia web site a french open source land data service center https www theia land fr providing cloud free and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance images ndvi is closely related to vegetation cover tucker 1979 sentinel 2 images have the advantage of constant viewing angles limiting its impact on the same site in addition as images used were radiometrically corrected the effect of atmosphere was very limited although ndvi saturates regarding leaf area index lai this is less of a problem regarding crop coefficient which also saturates with lai due to shading effect as a result it has been shown in many studies that crop coefficient can be linearly related to ndvi choudhury et al 1994 this index has been widely used in the region of our study area to characterize vegetation development and crop coefficients amazirh et al 2022 rafi et al 2019 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 2010 1 ndvi nir r nir r 2 3 2 landsat data both landsat 7 and 8 satellites data were used in this study for the period 2017 and 2018 with a revisit time up to 8 days thanks to their shifted overpasses the area is located in the center of the landsat 7 scene not affected by the slc off problem land surface temperature lst data was acquired from the web application http rslab gr downloads landsatlst html developed by parastatidis et al 2017 this application provides lst estimates using the single channel algorithm the landsat lst values were compared to measurement values from the cnr4 instrument over both stations ec1 and ec2 this comparison displayed in fig 2a shows acceptable agreement between measured and landsat lst with an rmse of about 5 k for ec1 and 6 6 k for ec2 with a moderate but significant bias however despite the good correlation between ground and satellite data we chose not to correct satellite data considering the low representativity of our local measurements as compared to satellite pixels 30 m in this heterogeneous land cover context the optical landsat bands were downloaded in level 2 from the web site https earthexplorer usgs gov with atmospheric correction included surface emissivity albedo and the leaf area index lai were computed using the optical landsat data the surface emissivity was calculated based on tardy et al 2016 as follows 2 ε ε v ε v ε s ndvi ndvi max ndvi min ndvi max k ε v and ε s are the soil and the vegetation emissivity their values are 0 96 and 0 99 respectively sobrino et al 2004 tardy et al 2016 the ndvi min is the minimum value of ndvi representing bare soil and the ndvi max is the maximum value of ndvi representing dense vegetation determined by examination of the images ndvi distribution the k parameter was fixed arbitrarily to 2 according to tardy et al 2016 lai was computed based on landsat ndvi following wang et al 2008 3 lai ndvi 1 ndvi 1 ndvi the visible and the near infrared bands are used to retrieve the albedo α from landsat data the best combinations compared to in situ measurement were obtained from the red r and the near infrared nir bands which is in line with results obtained with other sensors including spot4 diarra et al 2017 and formosat courault et al 2008 4 α 4 16 10 5 r 3 28 10 5 nir for landsat 7 5 α 2 72 10 5 r 3 80 10 5 nir for landsat 8 fig 2b shows a large discrepancy between measured and estimated albedo the errors can be explained by the high heterogeneity of the pixel area while point scale albedo is measured by the stations as long as the regression linear equation obtained from satellites data was not good a fixed value of about 0 12 was adopted for the study site 2 4 evapotranspiration modeling four models are used in this study samir is a software simulating crop water budget and evapotranspiration at daily scale based on the fao 56 approach it is fed with sentinel 2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi images used to compute both the basal crop coefficient k cb and the vegetation fraction cover fc a soil water budget allows to automatically trigger irrigations based on simulated soil moisture the sparse model solves the surface energy budget to provide instantaneous latent heat flux le estimates using the landsat 7 and 8 thermal data both models were tested over different crops and climates and have shown acceptable performance in estimating eta boulet et al 2015 delogu et al 2018 saadi et al 2015 simonneaux et al 2009 the shuttleworth wallace and metric models have been added to this study to enrich the comparison of different approaches to estimating eta using the same input data for the shuttleworth wallace model the version used here is the modification proposed by elfarkh et al 2021 where they use thermal remote sensing data to spatialize et sparse sw and samir were calibrated and validated over the same study area using eddy covariance and scintillometer measurements regarding metric its automated version featured on the google earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux platform is used more details on each model are presented in the appendix a summary of the inputs required and the parameters calibrated for each model is depicted in table 1 2 5 models evaluation the evaluation of results was achieved using standard criteria namely the correlation coefficient r the bias and the root mean square error rmse 6 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 7 bias 1 n i 1 n y i x i 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where x i is the measured values y i is the estimated values and n is the number of observations 2 6 extrapolation of instantaneous eta to daily value thermal remote sensing based eta models like sparse and sw basically provide an instantaneous eta value at the satellite overpass time however these instantaneous values are not useful for practical purposes which support water resources management such as irrigation scheduling many authors evaluated different temporal upscaling methods from instantaneous to daily eta values xu et al 2015 saadi et al 2018 one of the methods widely used is the evaporative fraction ef this latter supposes that the evaporative fraction remains almost constant during the day however gentine et al 2007 reported that ef depends on soil moisture and is not always satisfied for a fully vegetated surface here we applied the method parametrized by delogu et al 2012 based on an improvement of ef method this improvement is based on the diurnal variations of ef derived by hoedjes et al 2008 using an empirical relationship this relation parameterized ef diurnal trend as a function of incoming solar radiation and relative humidity as follows 9 le day ef a e day 10 a e day a e inst r g day r g inst 11 ef 1 2 0 4 r g day 1000 0 5 r h day 100 ef sat inst ef base inst 12 ef sat inst le inst a e inst 13 ef base inst 1 2 0 4 r g inst 1000 0 5 r h inst 100 where ae is the available energy rn g rg is the solar radiation w m2 rh is the relative humidity ef is the evaporative fraction and ef sat inst and ef base inst are the evaporative fraction observed at the satellite overpass time and calculated at the satellite overpass with the first part of the eq 11 respectively 2 7 footprint computation the las or ec measurements are influenced by an area or footprint where the contribution of each point is determined by its position the wind speed and direction numerous models of footprint have been developed horst and weil 1992 rannik et al 2000 schuepp et al 1990 in our case horst and weil 1992 model was used for the ec measurements where the measured f flux is related to the surface elementary fluxes distribution eq 14 14 f x y z m x f 0 x y f x x y y z m d x dy where f is the footprint function figuring the spatial weighting of elementary surface fluxes f x y z 0 f 0 x y x and y are the downwind and crosswind distances m from the measurement s points respectively for the las the spatial weighting function is used to weight each point meijninger 2003 eq 15 15 f las x y z las i 1 n f x y z las g d i where f las x y z las is the las integrated measurement and f x y z las and g d are the equivalent ec footprint and the scintillometer path weighting function respectively for a given point distanced from the transmitter by d i the ec and las footprints were calculated for each half hour fig 3a to compare the measured flux with daily model outputs daily footprints were calculated as the sum of the half hourly footprints weighted by the net radiation values as shown on the fig 3b the daily footprint has a more complex form than the instantaneous ones because half hourly footprints have different direction and form depending on the wind 3 results in this section the eta estimations by the four models are presented only the calibration and the validation of samir and sparse are shown here the calibration of sw is detailed over the same site in elfarkh et al 2021 metric is downloaded from a google earth engine platform after that the four models estimations are evaluated and compared with the las and the ec measurements and the errors and domains of validity are discussed 3 1 samir calibration the main parameters of samir are basically related to crop types and to the soil thus a land cover map of the study area was generated from the ndvi time series using the algorithm developed by simonneaux et al 2007 the main classes were trees annual crops and bare soil a sentinel 2 ndvi time series was extracted by averaging pixel values in a 50 50 m area centered on the ec1 site the meteorological forcing namely precipitation and et0 were obtained from our in situ measurements the samir model was calibrated for the tree class using latent heat flux measured over ec1 for the two seasons 2017 and 2018 through minimizing the root mean square error rmse computed between measured and modeled et the main calibrated parameters are listed in table 2 the rooting depth zr max obtained after calibration 4 9 m is much larger than usual values proposed in the fao 56 paper 1 6 m for irrigated olive trees this is not surprising considering that these trees are very old and periodically under stress which causes deep rooting the olive tree root system is adapted to water scarcity frequent in the mediterranean areas fernández 2014 in aerated soils of light texture olive trees roots may reach depths of 7 m lavee 1996 for the annual crops no calibration was possible since no ec station was installed over such class instead we used the parameters obtained by saadi et al 2015 after calibration of samir over wheat plots in central tunisia that we consider similar to our site irrigation was simulated assuming that the farmer avoid stress triggering input just before stress and bringing the water amount required to fill the soil holding capacity the irrigation simulations were stopped from 16 july to 30 november 2017 and from 21 may to 26 september 2018 according to ground observation fig 4 shows the temporal variations of the computed basal crop coefficient k cb and the fraction cover fc values using the ndvi relationships with ndvi averaged over the ec1 station peak k cb and fc values were observed at the beginning of spring for both years 2017 and 2018 while minimum k cb and fc values were recorded in summer and early autumn these variations are linked to the vegetative cycle of the olive tree itself but they may be amplified by the understory of annual crops often observed in this area in spring and early summer when water is available from the river conversely the k e values don t exhibit the same seasonality and are only linked to water inputs irrigation or rainfall it is remarkable to note that the resistance to evaporation is much increased as compared to fao standards with rew 0 and m 0 185 which is coherent with previous studies saadi et al 2015 torres and calera 2010 thus k e values are on the whole quite low below 0 2 which can be explained by the important canopy shading modifying significantly the meteorological forcing at the soil level the k s values show non stressed conditions during vegetation developments i e k s 1 while stress appears in late summer and autumn justified by the insufficient irrigation due to water shortage in the river the samir eta simulations are in good agreement with observed values with an rmse bias and r of about 0 50 mm day 0 11 mm day and 0 87 respectively fig 5 the simulated values reproduce well the seasonal cycle during the development stage of wheat in spring eta was higher in the dry season 2017 than the wet one 2018 which is strongly related to the higher reference evapotranspiration in 2017 despite the lack of rainfall water is still available for irrigation in spring because water comes from the mountains and is not affected directly by drought occurring downstream however the gap between eta and et0 during summer and autumn can be related to the water supply this gap is large in 2017 when compared to 2018 since the first year is dry with 157 mm whereas 2018 is wetter with 384 mm however even in these stressed conditions the olive trees managed to keep a high level of transpiration due to the deep rooting of the trees 3 2 samir validation using the calibrated parameters table 1 samir was run over the study area using the sentinel 2 ndvi time series the simulated samir eta values were validated using measurements provided by the ec2 and the las for the latter samir daily eta outputs were weighted according to the daily footprint computed as explained previously the comparison between samir daily eta and eta measured by ec2 in 2017 and 2018 shows a good agreement with an rmse bias and r of about 0 53 mm day 0 12 mm day and 0 82 fig 6 very close to the values obtained during the calibration stage on ec1 however in 2017 samir overestimated eta during the dry period from july to november this is because a spatialized version of the samir tools is used in this study and it doesn t allow to stop irrigation while no water is available at this time of the season by contrast no overestimation of eta was observed in summer 2018 as the year was wet and there was less water shortage in the root zone despite the lack of irrigation the comparison between samir daily eta and the las measurements in 2017 and 2018 is presented on fig 7 due to technical problems the las measurements are lacking from june to august 2018 on average a good concordance is noticed between the simulations and the measurements with an rmse bias and r of 0 73 mm day 0 45 mm day and 0 74 respectively however between january and june 2017 samir underestimated eta one possible explanation for this gap is that during this period since there is enough rainfall and no stress samir doesn t apply any irrigation which is not the case for the farmers who do not hesitate to bring water when it is available in the river indeed as shown by bouimouass et al 2020 who studied irrigation in a very similar watershed neighboring the study site overirrigation is very frequent as is driven by water availability and not by the crop requirements in 2018 this discrepancy between simulated and measured eta is also visible but to a lesser extent possibly because the precipitation was relatively high and consequently the impact of irrigation on eta was lower 3 3 sparse calibration as for samir the sparse model was calibrated over the ec1 station by minimizing the rmse between simulated and observed le the sparse results were weighted by the ec and las instantaneous footprints at the time of landsat overpass from a sensitivity study boulet et al 2015 five parameters of sparse having a significant impact on simulated eta were calibrated the minimum stomatal resistance rst min which was set to 260 s m as reported by zhu et al 2014 rst min varies for many natural and cultivated plants it ranges considerably from 20 to 100 s m for crops and from 200 to 300 s m for many types of trees zhu et al 2014 leaf width w set to 0 03 m is within the range found in the literature saadi et al 2018 hssaine et al 2018 braud et al 1995 the ratio relating the net radiation of the soil to the heat soil flux ξ set to 0 13 in fact kustas et al 1993 pointed that ξ is driven by several factors namely the time of day the soil moisture and the thermal properties as well as the vegetation density and its value ranges between 0 05 and 0 5 the extinction coefficient k in the equation where the fraction cover is calculated in term of lai which is set to 0 6 which is in conformity with the values found by connor et al 2012 and srinet et al 2019 the empirical coefficient in the aerodynamic resistance n sw set to 2 5 which is the same value stated by boulet et al 2015 the calibration shows an acceptable agreement with an rmse and r of about 81 3 w m2 and 0 58 respectively fig 8 3 4 sparse validation the parameters obtained over ec1 were validated locally over ec2 and spatially using the las measurements scatter plots of modeled available energy sensible and latent heat fluxes for landsat overpass dates averaged over the ec2 and las footprints versus measurements are displayed at figs 9 and 10 net radiation values were accurately estimated by sparse with rmse of about 69 8 w m2 for ec2 however they show an underestimation compared to the two stations measurements which is expected since the landsat lst overestimates the surface temperature as shown in fig 2 this is in line with the same bias observed in the calibration phase rn measurement over a complex surface is a difficult task as many authors reported anthoni et al 2000 byun et al 2014 due to the influence of the vegetation structure on the albedo comparison between observed and simulated soil heat flux shows lower agreement than for rn which can be explained in one hand by the accuracy of the measurements since it gathers several difficulties as reported in the literature ezzahar et al 2009b hssaine et al 2018 these difficulties lay in the plate protection from direct sunlight especially for the one at 5 cm and choosing the representative position which takes into consideration the vegetation intercept of the incoming radiation on the other hand sparse calculates g as a fraction of rns inducing the transmission of the error on rns to g furthermore for ease of implementation a constant fraction value was adopted in this study whereas many studies have related the value of this fraction to the variation of the surface cover diarra et al 2017 kustas 1990 saadi et al 2018 sensible heat flux simulations show acceptable agreement over ec2 and las with an rmse of about 116 w m2 and 68 w m2 respectively the discrepancy showed in the figures between modeled and observed h can be attributed to numerous factors particularly the accuracy of lst data in addition the calculation errors on the surface resistances are strongly affecting the h estimation also one potential source of error is the accuracy of the displacement height d and roughness length z0 which were estimated in this work as a fraction of the vegetation height using the rule of thumb z0 0 14 hveg and d 0 66 hveg hveg is the vegetation height following brutsaert and kustas 1987 the method used to approximate these parameters are adapted to dense and homogeneous areas whereas the experimental field is heterogeneous and sparse finally the model provides good estimates of le over ec2 and las with an rmse of about 52 7 w m2 and 78 8 w m2 respectively the discrepancy in le can be related to the uncertainty on h and ae rn g which is directly transmitted to le values since it s a residual term of the energy balance kalma et al 2008 morillas et al 2013 saadi et al 2018 moreover using constant parameters during the whole year despite vegetation and environmental changes can causes some errors especially for the minimum stomatal resistance rst min as reported by boulet et al 2015 an inadequate value of rst min increases automatically h and le errors 3 5 model s validation and intercomparison the comparison of the four models and las and ec2 measurements was done at the daily scale the instantaneous eta estimates provided by sparse and sw were extrapolated to a daily value using the ef method presented in section 2 5 then daily eta maps provided by all models were weighted using the daily footprint of the las and ec2 measurements in order to be compared with them figs 11 and 12 presents the scatterplots of the four models eta estimates compared to the ec2 and las measurements respectively the four models underestimate the las measurements which is strange and raises the question on the las accuracy however the las values were validated while comparing them with the ec1 and ec2 values in a previous study elfarkh et al 2020 and the results were good sparse and sw are more scattered which can be related to the large number of their parameters that are taken constant throughout the season nevertheless these parameters are variable in space depending on the soil and vegetation characteristics in addition the sensibility of both models to the lst data errors can also generate this bias the metric and samir eta estimates are less scattered and show better statistical results compared to sparse and to sw the time series of the daily eta values obtained with the las and the four models are illustrated in fig 13 overall the las and the four models eta show similar seasonal dynamics they increase with the begin of the growing season in january reach maximum values during growth peak in april may and then decrease until december since precipitation and canopy development greatly affect et its rates decrease during dry conditions and increase immediately after each rainfall event the eta values of winter are higher in 2018 than in 2017 due to the higher precipitations in 2018 however the eta spring values are low in 2018 compared to 2017 which can be attributed to the low available energy received due to more frequent cloudy days during summer 2017 sw was close to the las measurements sparse underestimates eta values which may be due to the already observed overestimation of landsat lst fig 2 that signify stress conditions for the model in contrast the effect of the lst error on the sw estimations was not as strong as for sparse which can be attributed to fact that the absolute values of lst are used in sparse whereas lst was used in a relative manner in sw model to compute stress indexes related to the resistances of vegetation and soil regarding samir the estimated eta values were overestimated which is expected since samir doesn t stop irrigation in summer despite the water shortage metric in this period shows a slight overestimation that can be linked to wet edge detection error under these stress conditions the rmse and the r of the models show that samir and metric gee are the least scattered and the most correlated to the measurements on the other hand sparse shows less bias and dispersion than sw while the latter is better correlated in order to further compare the models and illustrate the discrepancies eta images of the four models are shown for three dates illustrating contrasted conditions fig 14 the accuracy of each image is assessed through the bias with the las measurements fig 15 keeping in mind that the las measurements represent only the irrigated area in the center of the image for the 16th of january 2017 the model providing the best estimates is sparse and the other models strongly underestimate eta 1 5 to 1 mm bias samir shows low values of et especially over the bare soil supposedly not irrigated and also over the wheat plots which were bare soil at this time fig 14 sw model also underestimates eta which can be explained by the non representativeness of the relation established between the stress indexes and the resistances over the bare soil since these relations were calibrated over olive trees ec1 in contrast thanks to the thermal information which is highly correlated to the soil moisture sparse shows less bias compared to the las finally metric gee underestimates the most eta although it is based on thermal remote sensing that should capture soil moisture conditions indeed the metric approach forces the flux computation to be bounded between wet and dry extreme conditions although these extreme conditions are not always present on every image and may thus induce a wrong scaling for the summer date of 20 august 2017 sw and samir models provide the best results metric gee shows the higher bias which can be explained by the error on determining the wet and dry temperatures which are not well identified in such dry uniform conditions sparse also underestimates eta measurements which may be related to the lst reliability on first april 2018 during the development stage of annuals and no stress conditions samir model is close to the las observations whereas sw shows a strong underestimation the sw and sparse underestimation can be explained by the fact that several parameters especially the minimal stomatal conductance are set constant during the entire season regardless of the seasonal changes this assumption can lead to erroneous eta estimates in fact zhu et al 2013 and hu et al 2009 noted that over underestimation of eta can occur when using constant parameters for long term simulations using sw over different vegetation and environmental conditions finally for metric gee we observe a strong contrast between vegetation area with very high eta and bare soil areas with low et which is a characteristic of metric always stretching eta between dry bare soil and wet vegetated areas tasumi 2019 however despite a strong eta in vegetated areas the model predictions are still underestimated at the scale of the las footprint due to the underestimation of evaporation in the riverbeds see below another difference between the models is linked to riverbed samir shows low eta for all dates in the river assuming a non irrigated bare soil without taking into consideration the evaporation due to capillary rise from the shallow aquifer associated with riverbeds this is well visible on the april image and to a lesser extent in january in contrast sparse accounts for the soil moisture related to surface temperature and shows higher eta in riverbeds for these two dates although based on thermal data sw also underestimates eta in this area which is explained by the fact that the resistance calibrations were done mainly on olive trees ec1 this calibration may not be representative of the entire study area in particular the fields of annual crops calibration of the resistance s equation in the sw model on different land uses is necessary to improve its performance on the whole the accuracy of the four approaches for predicting eta was acceptable despite some discrepancies observed in specific conditions but not at the same time depending on the model there is no unique method for evaluating models so there is no easy answer to the question of which model is most accurate it seems that the sparse model like other models based on thermal remote sensing even if it is based on physical assumptions remains sensitive to the quality of the input variables on one hand e g the accuracy of the surface temperature and on the other hand to the setting of the different physical parameters required by the model the latter parameters are very variable in space and their calibration may suffer from equifinality problems as shown by the calibration of sparse the errors of the three energy balance models sparse sw and metric gee seem uncorrelated which lead to a logical hypothesis of testing the potential benefit of computing their average value as shown in fig 16 the correlation coefficient obtained between this average eta value and the measurements shows an improvement of 36 29 and 3 as compared to sparse sw and metric gee respectively however this average is underestimated with a bias of about 0 63 mm day which is expected since the three model estimations are underestimated given that the bias can be corrected based on the linear relation obtained the improvement in the correlation between eta values average and the las measurements may be exploited for operational eta estimates in this area this approach of averaging different methods is a technique that has been used in different works such as the evaspa model that includes several algorithms for calculating eta in order to assess the uncertainties in eta estimates gallego elvira et al 2013 in comparison with thermal approaches samir provides a good eta because it is computed on a robust base which is the slowly changing ndvi and accurately measured et0 however it suffers from a major drawback which is the lack of control of soil water conditions thus water stress affecting both transpiration k s and evaporation k e is poorly represented models do not have the same advantages and weaknesses and each may be suitable under certain conditions table 3 the major constraint is the need of user calibration each time the environmental conditions are different except for metric gee for which there are achieved automatically in addition the availability of the model s input is a paramount element to choose a model especially in traditional complex areas for instance it is impossible to have spatial information about the irrigation of each plot consequently samir is not the best choice in stress conditions where soil moisture strongly influences et on the other hand the difficulty to calculate accurate lst from the satellite s thermal bands is an issue for the energy balance models due to their high sensitivity to this variable however these models are not equally affected by lst accuracy sparse is highly sensitive to lst accuracy since the error directly impacts h and le in contrast the contextual approach of metric gee scaling lst relatively to extreme values of the image reduces problems also for sw the relative variation of lst between its maximum and minimum is used to calculate the soil and the vegetation resistances this means that the error on lst will not have the same effect on metric gee and sw as compared to sparse one advantage of samir is to produce continuous daily eta estimates which is valuable in assessing the basin water budget simonneaux et al 2007 le page et al 2012 diarra et al 2017 sparse is a model that can be used accurately to detect stress conditions if properly calibrated boulet et al 2015 consequently eta estimated by sparse can be used to calculate stress indices the modified sw model is a new approach that must be tested under different conditions in order to find a robust relationship that accurately represents the variation in resistance as a function of stress indices finally metric gee showed a good agreement with the las measurements which is very good news since it is available freely and it does not require in depth technical knowledge 4 conclusion the objective of this study was to map distributed actual crop evapotranspiration eta at high resolution using different approaches based on different remote sensing data we used the samir model based on water budget as proposed by the fao 56 approach and three approaches based on thermal remote sensing namely the sparse model a modified version of shuttleworth wallace sw model and an operational version of metric available on google earth engine metric gee the comparison has been performed over an heterogeneous and complex irrigated agricultural area landsat 7 and 8 products were used for sparse sw and metric gee and sentinel 2 products were used for samir the models performance is evaluated using two eddy covariance ec systems and scintillometer las measurements the seasonal variability of eta is correctly predicted by the four models throughout 2017 and 2018 agricultural seasons however samir and metric gee with an rmse of 0 73 and 0 68 mm day respectively as compared to las measurements showed slightly better performances in estimating eta than sparse and sw which show an rmse of 0 90 and 0 98 mm day compared to las measurements respectively finally when averaging the estimates of the three thermal based models the correlation coefficient with measurements was improved by 36 29 and 3 compared to sparse sw and metric gee respectively this study has shown the accuracy of different approaches and highlights the importance of remote sensing data which allow highly spatial and temporal resolution of eta estimation samir has represented good estimation of eta but its dependence for water input data irrigation and rainfall limit its applicability especially over traditional irrigated areas on the other hand thermal approaches may detect water stress but they have shown to be very sensitive to parameterization and to uncertainties in input data this is the case for the remotely sensed surface temperature and for parameters like the stomatal resistance sensitive to environmental conditions interestingly enough metric gee eta products showed good agreement with the las measurements without any calibration and are freely available online these results confirm the idea that to move forward the combination of these models can be applied for instance assimilating the eta estimates of metric gee sw or sparse into samir which showed a good temporal consistency but whose widespread application may be limited by lack of available spatially explicit data on irrigation amount this potential synergy is expected to be improved in the next few years with the lstm mission of esa and the trishna mission lagouarde et al 2018 which will provide high spatial temporal resolution land surface temperature at a resolution of 50 m every 3 days which is a significant step forward as compared to the actual landsat data 100 m every 16 days this will allow accurate monitoring of spatio temporal changes in the water status of surfaces including crop stress detection and will open great opportunities to improve these models to be more adapted for assessing crops water demand at field scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

compute eta and water budget at the daily time step using the fao method allen et al 1998 the soil model has been slightly modified to include three compartments namely the evaporation root and deep soil compartments saadi et al 2015 between these compartments water can move down by gravity or up and down by diffusion processes these fluxes are linked to the soil moisture of the compartments in this work fao dual crop approach implemented in the samir tool was used to calculate eta as follows a 1 eta k s k cb k e et 0 the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated using meteorological measurements based on the fao penman monteith equation and the crop coefficient k cb was estimated using a ndvi k cb relationship based on satellite time series imagery a 2 k cb a ndvi b parameters a and b are related mainly to land cover type and climatic conditions and can be calibrated or and taken from previous studies duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 saadi et al 2015 k e is the evaporation coefficient when the depletion in the evaporation layer i e void volume de exceeds a threshold i e readily evaporable water rew a reduction factor k r is applied to reduce evaporation following eq a 4 a 3 k e min k r kc max k cb f ew kc max a 4 k r m tew de tew rew 1 where kc max and f ew are the maximum capacity of water evacuation by atmosphere and the fraction of soil wetted respectively tew is the total evaporable water in the evaporation layer in order to estimate kr we used the formalism proposed by torres and calera 2010 namely the introduction of the m parameter which allows more reduction of evaporation as compared to the original fao 56 formalism the m coefficient initially set to 1 allows to further reduce the evaporation level with m values potentially decreasing until 0 this choice was made because like torres et al we observed a strong overestimation of eta especially after wetting events which was supposed to be due to higher evaporation saadi et al 2015 after introducing the m parameter and calibration better estimates of eta were obtained saadi et al 2015 the combination of rew and m are functionally defining the surface resistance to the soil evaporation the stress coefficient k s is computed when depletion in the root compartment dr is higher than the readily available water raw limiting the root uptake eq a 5 raw is a fraction of the taw the total available water available for vegetation a 5 k s taw dr taw raw 1 in addition to ndvi time series samir uses as forcing the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 values and water input in fact rainfall can be measured using the meteorological station whereas irrigation cannot be easily observed for each plot in an area thus samir simulated the water inputs based on an assumed behavior of the farmer regarding the threshold in soil moisture to trigger irrigation and the water depth brought a detailed explanation of samir functioning may be found in saadi et al 2015 some parameters were fixed according to the guideline of the fao 56 paper the depth of the soil evaporation layer ze the root zone water depletion fraction before stress p and the maximum value of crop coefficient following rain or irrigation which is determined by the energy available for eta at the soil surface kc max or were based on ground data the volumetric water content at field capacity ω fc and the volumetric water content at wilting point ω wp vegetation fraction cover values were computed based on a linear relationship with ndvi where the slope a fc and the intercept b fc were set assuming an ndvi value for the bare soil fc 0 and full coverage fc 1 equal to 0 15 and 0 9 respectively fc was used to calculate the root zone depth zr using a linear relation and assuming that the crop will reach its full rooting depth at maximum fc the remaining parameters the slope and the intercept of the ndvi k cb linear relationship a kcb and b kcb the readily evaporable water rew the root depth zr max and the diffusion between surface and root layers dif er were calibrated using the flux data table 2 appendix 2 sparse model the sparse model is a two source model solving separately the energy budget of the soil and the vegetation boulet et al 2015 where both of them are connected to the atmosphere separately the model solves a system of equations regarding sensible and latent heat flux for soil and vegetation respectively eq a 6 and a 7 and the energy balance of the soil and the vegetation eq a 8 and a 9 eq a 10 describes the link between the average surface temperature and

radiation lst is the radiative surface temperature k and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant to solve these equations the model is first run in prescribed mode for two extreme configurations namely fully unstressed and fully stressed vegetation i e for a minimum and a maximum surface resistances computing theoretical evaporation and transpiration fluxes based on the same method as the tseb model kustas and norman 1999 these potential fluxes are then used as thresholds in the retrieval mode in this mode le v is calculated first considering unstressed conditions deducting le s using the measured surface temperature if the obtained le s value is negative the unstressed vegetation assumption is invalid in that case the vegetation is assumed to suffer from water stress and the soil surface is assumed to be dry consequently le s is set to 30 w m2 to account for the remaining slow vapor diffusion within the soil boulet et al 1997 and the vegetation latent heat ﬂux le v is recalculated if le v is also negative both le s and le v components are given zero independently of lst appendix 3 shuttleworth wallace model this model is developed by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 it estimates two separate fluxes one for soil and the other for the vegetation using the following formulas a 11 eta e t c s pm s c v pm v a 12 pm s a ρ c p d r a s a a s r a r a s γ 1 r s s r a r a s

model is used this version used the thermal data to provide spatial eta estimation as described by elfarkh et al 2021 in this approach the vegetation and soil resistances were related to the stress indexes as follow a 14 r s s a e b si ss a 15 r s v c e d si sv where a c b and d are the calibration parameters set to 160 25 and 36 02 s m 2 62 and 1 30 respectively r s s and r s v are the resistances for soil and for vegetation respectively si ss and si sv are the stress indexes for soil and vegetation respectively this approach was calibrated and validated in the same study area elfarkh et al 2021 appendix 4 metric gee model metric gee is a version of metric allen et al 2007 that operates on the google earth engine system https eeflux level1 appspot com the surface energy balance in this model is derived by landsat thermal band while the surface roughness vegetation amounts and albedo are retrieved from short wave bands the instantaneous evaporative fraction estimated at the time of satellite overpass is extrapolated at daily scale to provide daily eta value using reference et computed by the penman monteith and gridmet weather data sets 
9429,quantification of actual crop evapotranspiration eta over large areas is a critical issue to manage water resources particularly in semi arid regions in this study four models driven by high resolution remote sensing data were intercompared and evaluated over an heterogeneous and complex traditional irrigated area located in the piedmont of the high atlas mountain morocco during the 2017 and 2018 seasons 1 satellite monitoring of irrigation samir which is a software based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient water balance model fed with sentinel 2 high resolution normalized difference

temperature lst derived from thermal data provided from landsat 7 and 8 3 a modified version of the shuttleworth wallace sw model which uses the lst to compute surface resistances and 4 metric gee which is a version of metric model mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration that operates on the google earth engine platform also driven by lst actual evapotranspiration eta measurements from two eddy covariance ec systems and a large aperture scintillometer las were used to evaluate the four models one ec was used to calibrate samir and sparse ec1 which were validated using the second one ec2 providing a root mean square error rmse and a determination coefficient r of 0 53 mm day r 0 82 and 0 66 mm day r 0 74 respectively sw and metric gee simulations were obtained respectively from a previous study and google earth engine gee therefore no calibration was performed in this study the four models predict well the seasonal course of eta during two successive growing seasons 2017 and 2018 however their performances were contrasted and varied depending on the seasons the water stress conditions and the vegetation development by comparing the statistical results between the simulation and the measurements of eta it has been shown that samir and metric gee are the less scattered and the better in agreement with the las measurements rmse equal to 0 73 and 0 68 mm day and r equal to 0 74 and 0 82 respectively on the other hand sparse is less scattered rmse 0 90 mm day r 0 54 than sw which is slightly better correlated rmse 0 98 mm day r 0 60 with the observations this study contributes to explore the complementarities between these approaches in order to improve the evapotranspiration mapping monitored with high

is necessary numerous studies have been conducted on the measurement and estimation of the water balance components of the crops in the semi arid region of tensift al haouz but most of these studies were carried out in the plain amazirh et al 2017 aouade et al 2020 diarra et al 2017 er raki et al 2010 ezzahar et al 2007a hssaine merlin et al 2018 ouaadi et al 2020 rafi et al 2019 by contrast the mountain foothills in semi arid regions are potential recharge areas for the groundwater table blasch and bryson 2007 bouimouass et al 2020 liu and yamanaka 2012 martinez et al 2017 this recharge is poorly known but could be quantified by residual balance term however the uncertainty on the water balance variables in these regions such as the precipitation and evapotranspiration et increase the uncertainty on the estimation of recharge hence there is a need for an accurate estimate of et in the last decades a number of studies focused on developing several methods for measuring and estimating eta based on remote sensing that provides valuable data to assess its spatial and temporal variation there is a variety of methods allowing direct or indirect eta measurement in the field with variable spatial and temporal representativeness allen et al 2011 er raki et al 2013 the most used methods are the lysimeter sánchez et al 2019 widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 and the eddy covariance system anapalli et al 2020 fang et al 2020 both provide typically hectometric scale measurements and the scintillometer allowing measurements over transects of several kilometers duchemin et al 2008 elfarkh et al 2020 ezzahar et al 2007a 2007b 2009a 2009b 2009c isabelle et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 while these devices are the most accurate way to measure et their use over large areas is limited due to their cost and their limited spatial representativity especially in mediterranean landscapes known by heterogenous crops and water status major efforts to develop methods for eta mapping have been undertaken during the last decades particularly with the development of remote sensing data providing land surface characteristics using multi spectral data from optical bands the most physical approaches are based on soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models coupling the soil water balance and the surface energy balance for soil plant atmosphere system and to quantify the amount of eta released in the atmosphere montes et al 2014 these models offer an accurate estimates of eta but are complex because in addition to meteorological forcing i e air temperature and humidity wind speed incident radiation rainfall they require a large number of parameters such as information on vegetation structure i e leaf area index lai height and vegetation functioning i e stomatal conductance on thermal and hydraulic properties of the soil olioso et al 1999 to overcome these constraints simplified water balance models have been proposed like the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 this model requires a lower number of parameters and some of the main ones the crop coefficients can be related to the amount of active vegetation present in the surface so that they can be estimated from remote sensing using vegetation indices on the other hand another category of eta estimation method is based on the surface energy balance seb seb type models are usually constrained by satellite land surface temperature observations which are considered as a good indicator of the water status of the surface allowing to take into consideration the stress condition in estimating actual et they calculate the sensible heat flux h from which the latent heat flux le associated with eta is estimated as a residual term of the energy balance equation chirouze et al 2014 these models are a good indicator of the crop water status but they basically provide instantaneous estimates of eta at the time of the satellite acquisition seb models can be divided into two levels of complexity li et al 2009 1 single source models that consider the surface as a big leaf allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 roerink et al 2000 su 2002 and 2 dual source models distinguishing between soil and vegetation processes anderson et al 1997 boulet et al 2015 norman et al 1995 numerous authors have compared these two approaches showing that dual source models show better performance over sparse vegetation however several authors have also found that with a correct calibration even a single source model can properly simulate the energy fluxes bastiaanssen et al 1998 kustas and norman 1996 the main objective of this study was to test the performance of different approaches used for estimating eta over a heterogeneous landscape of traditional irrigated agriculture in a semi arid area located in the piedmont of the high atlas mountains morocco a simplified water balance model samir simonneaux et al 2009 sparse model boulet et al 2015 the modified shuttleworth wallace model elfarkh et al 2021 and metric model allen et al 2007 were compared during two seasons 2017 and 2018 this study is a preliminary step to build an hybrid approach that could benefit from both the continuity of water budget based estimates and the accuracy of thermal based ones 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was carried out over the piedmont of the high atlas mountain near the marrakech city in the center of morocco 31 22 1 19 n 7 56 47 21 o fig 1 the climate in this area is semi arid with irregular and low rainfall especially during the study period with a total rainfall of 157 mm for 2017 and 384 mm for 2018 the study site is characterized mainly by traditional olive trees of various ages with some other species apple apricot plum orange peach eta and a frequent understory of annual crops below the trees mainly cereals crops are irrigated by the traditional flooding technique using water diverted from the river issued from the mountains some patches of bare soils are also present especially at the surrounding of the irrigated area 2 2 experimental data both ec stations ec1 and ec2 were equipped by meteorological instruments to measure the net radiation components cnr4 radiometer campbell scientific at a height of 17 m air temperature and humidity vaisala hmp155 campbell scientific at height of 16 m fig 1 also the soil heat flux was measured at a depth of 5 cm using two heat flux plates hpf 01 campbell scientific one shaded by trees and the other one exposed to solar radiation the rainfall was recorded using a rain gauge arg100 ec installed close to the scintillometer receiver fig 1 flux stations were installed during 2017 and 2018 over two olive tree plots located in the study area on 17 5 m height towers ec1 and ec2 sites elfarkh et al 2020 the land cover of these two sites is supposed to be representative of the entire site namely traditional olive plantations of 7 10 m height with an understory of herbaceous vegetation mainly wheat ec2 shows more heterogeneity than ec1 since it includes olive trees other fruit trees mainly apple trees and annual crops elfarkh et al 2020 they measured the sensible and latent heat fluxes using the eddy correlation method consisting of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific ltd and a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific ltd the raw data were sampled at a rate of 20 hz and then used to calculate sensible h and latent le heat fluxes offline using the ec processing software ecpack van dijk et al 2004 the energy balance closure analysis showed that the sum of the turbulent fluxes only reaches 60 of the available energy elfarkh et al 2020 which can be considered acceptable due to the complexity of the study sites therefore the correction of ec data was performed using the approach suggested by twine et al 2000 which assumes the non closure energy balance is due to underestimates from ec measurements while the corresponding bowen ratio h le is correctly estimated however the reliability of eta after this correction still affected by some uncertainty given the assumptions taken in the bowen correction namely the assumption that the difference between the net radiation rn and the soil heat flux g is equal to the sum of h and le neglecting the energy stored in the canopy in addition the footprint of the devices that measure both energy quantity rn g and h le are different and that can generate an error especially in heterogeneous areas such as our study site in addition to the ec towers a large aperture scintillometer las was installed over a 1464 m transect consisting of a receiver installed on a tower of about 10 m and a transmitter over a building of about 10 5 m in the city elfarkh et al 2020 due to topography the height between the las path and the ground varied between 10 and 50 m and the effective height computed was around 26 m hartogensis et al 2003 the measurement of the refraction phenomena produced by the air turbulence allow the calculation of the variation of the structure parameter of the refractive index c n 2 along the path wesely 1976 the sensible heat flux h was calculated iteratively based on the monin obukhov theory de bruin et al 1993 the latent heat flux le was obtained as the residual term of the energy balance where available energy was computed from the ground measurements elfarkh et al 2020 for the le computation we used the rn and g measured at the ec1 site which is considered representative of the land cover present in the las footprint however this remains an approximation and one possible improvement would be to multiply measurements of rn and g along the las path but this is operationally difficult to achieve for the sake of simplicity we also didn t compute modis estimates of daily rn saadi et al 2015 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 sentinel 2 data the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was computed using sentinel 2 red r band 4 and near infrared nir band 8 reflectances at 10 m resolution eq 1 the sentinel 2 images were downloaded from the theia web site a french open source land data service center https www theia land fr providing cloud free and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance images ndvi is closely related to vegetation cover tucker 1979 sentinel 2 images have the advantage of constant viewing angles limiting its impact on the same site in addition as images used were radiometrically corrected the effect of atmosphere was very limited although ndvi saturates regarding leaf area index lai this is less of a problem regarding crop coefficient which also saturates with lai due to shading effect as a result it has been shown in many studies that crop coefficient can be linearly related to ndvi choudhury et al 1994 this index has been widely used in the region of our study area to characterize vegetation development and crop coefficients amazirh et al 2022 rafi et al 2019 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 2010 1 ndvi nir r nir r 2 3 2 landsat data both landsat 7 and 8 satellites data were used in this study for the period 2017 and 2018 with a revisit time up to 8 days thanks to their shifted overpasses the area is located in the center of the landsat 7 scene not affected by the slc off problem land surface temperature lst data was acquired from the web application http rslab gr downloads landsatlst html developed by parastatidis et al 2017 this application provides lst estimates using the single channel algorithm the landsat lst values were compared to measurement values from the cnr4 instrument over both stations ec1 and ec2 this comparison displayed in fig 2a shows acceptable agreement between measured and landsat lst with an rmse of about 5 k for ec1 and 6 6 k for ec2 with a moderate but significant bias however despite the good correlation between ground and satellite data we chose not to correct satellite data considering the low representativity of our local measurements as compared to satellite pixels 30 m in this heterogeneous land cover context the optical landsat bands were downloaded in level 2 from the web site https earthexplorer usgs gov with atmospheric correction included surface emissivity albedo and the leaf area index lai were computed using the optical landsat data the surface emissivity was calculated based on tardy et al 2016 as follows 2 ε ε v ε v ε s ndvi ndvi max ndvi min ndvi max k ε v and ε s are the soil and the vegetation emissivity their values are 0 96 and 0 99 respectively sobrino et al 2004 tardy et al 2016 the ndvi min is the minimum value of ndvi representing bare soil and the ndvi max is the maximum value of ndvi representing dense vegetation determined by examination of the images ndvi distribution the k parameter was fixed arbitrarily to 2 according to tardy et al 2016 lai was computed based on landsat ndvi following wang et al 2008 3 lai ndvi 1 ndvi 1 ndvi the visible and the near infrared bands are used to retrieve the albedo α from landsat data the best combinations compared to in situ measurement were obtained from the red r and the near infrared nir bands which is in line with results obtained with other sensors including spot4 diarra et al 2017 and formosat courault et al 2008 4 α 4 16 10 5 r 3 28 10 5 nir for landsat 7 5 α 2 72 10 5 r 3 80 10 5 nir for landsat 8 fig 2b shows a large discrepancy between measured and estimated albedo the errors can be explained by the high heterogeneity of the pixel area while point scale albedo is measured by the stations as long as the regression linear equation obtained from satellites data was not good a fixed value of about 0 12 was adopted for the study site 2 4 evapotranspiration modeling four models are used in this study samir is a software simulating crop water budget and evapotranspiration at daily scale based on the fao 56 approach it is fed with sentinel 2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi images used to compute both the basal crop coefficient k cb and the vegetation fraction cover fc a soil water budget allows to automatically trigger irrigations based on simulated soil moisture the sparse model solves the surface energy budget to provide instantaneous latent heat flux le estimates using the landsat 7 and 8 thermal data both models were tested over different crops and climates and have shown acceptable performance in estimating eta boulet et al 2015 delogu et al 2018 saadi et al 2015 simonneaux et al 2009 the shuttleworth wallace and metric models have been added to this study to enrich the comparison of different approaches to estimating eta using the same input data for the shuttleworth wallace model the version used here is the modification proposed by elfarkh et al 2021 where they use thermal remote sensing data to spatialize et sparse sw and samir were calibrated and validated over the same study area using eddy covariance and scintillometer measurements regarding metric its automated version featured on the google earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux platform is used more details on each model are presented in the appendix a summary of the inputs required and the parameters calibrated for each model is depicted in table 1 2 5 models evaluation the evaluation of results was achieved using standard criteria namely the correlation coefficient r the bias and the root mean square error rmse 6 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 7 bias 1 n i 1 n y i x i 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where x i is the measured values y i is the estimated values and n is the number of observations 2 6 extrapolation of instantaneous eta to daily value thermal remote sensing based eta models like sparse and sw basically provide an instantaneous eta value at the satellite overpass time however these instantaneous values are not useful for practical purposes which support water resources management such as irrigation scheduling many authors evaluated different temporal upscaling methods from instantaneous to daily eta values xu et al 2015 saadi et al 2018 one of the methods widely used is the evaporative fraction ef this latter supposes that the evaporative fraction remains almost constant during the day however gentine et al 2007 reported that ef depends on soil moisture and is not always satisfied for a fully vegetated surface here we applied the method parametrized by delogu et al 2012 based on an improvement of ef method this improvement is based on the diurnal variations of ef derived by hoedjes et al 2008 using an empirical relationship this relation parameterized ef diurnal trend as a function of incoming solar radiation and relative humidity as follows 9 le day ef a e day 10 a e day a e inst r g day r g inst 11 ef 1 2 0 4 r g day 1000 0 5 r h day 100 ef sat inst ef base inst 12 ef sat inst le inst a e inst 13 ef base inst 1 2 0 4 r g inst 1000 0 5 r h inst 100 where ae is the available energy rn g rg is the solar radiation w m2 rh is the relative humidity ef is the evaporative fraction and ef sat inst and ef base inst are the evaporative fraction observed at the satellite overpass time and calculated at the satellite overpass with the first part of the eq 11 respectively 2 7 footprint computation the las or ec measurements are influenced by an area or footprint where the contribution of each point is determined by its position the wind speed and direction numerous models of footprint have been developed horst and weil 1992 rannik et al 2000 schuepp et al 1990 in our case horst and weil 1992 model was used for the ec measurements where the measured f flux is related to the surface elementary fluxes distribution eq 14 14 f x y z m x f 0 x y f x x y y z m d x dy where f is the footprint function figuring the spatial weighting of elementary surface fluxes f x y z 0 f 0 x y x and y are the downwind and crosswind distances m from the measurement s points respectively for the las the spatial weighting function is used to weight each point meijninger 2003 eq 15 15 f las x y z las i 1 n f x y z las g d i where f las x y z las is the las integrated measurement and f x y z las and g d are the equivalent ec footprint and the scintillometer path weighting function respectively for a given point distanced from the transmitter by d i the ec and las footprints were calculated for each half hour fig 3a to compare the measured flux with daily model outputs daily footprints were calculated as the sum of the half hourly footprints weighted by the net radiation values as shown on the fig 3b the daily footprint has a more complex form than the instantaneous ones because half hourly footprints have different direction and form depending on the wind 3 results in this section the eta estimations by the four models are presented only the calibration and the validation of samir and sparse are shown here the calibration of sw is detailed over the same site in elfarkh et al 2021 metric is downloaded from a google earth engine platform after that the four models estimations are evaluated and compared with the las and the ec measurements and the errors and domains of validity are discussed 3 1 samir calibration the main parameters of samir are basically related to crop types and to the soil thus a land cover map of the study area was generated from the ndvi time series using the algorithm developed by simonneaux et al 2007 the main classes were trees annual crops and bare soil a sentinel 2 ndvi time series was extracted by averaging pixel values in a 50 50 m area centered on the ec1 site the meteorological forcing namely precipitation and et0 were obtained from our in situ measurements the samir model was calibrated for the tree class using latent heat flux measured over ec1 for the two seasons 2017 and 2018 through minimizing the root mean square error rmse computed between measured and modeled et the main calibrated parameters are listed in table 2 the rooting depth zr max obtained after calibration 4 9 m is much larger than usual values proposed in the fao 56 paper 1 6 m for irrigated olive trees this is not surprising considering that these trees are very old and periodically under stress which causes deep rooting the olive tree root system is adapted to water scarcity frequent in the mediterranean areas fernández 2014 in aerated soils of light texture olive trees roots may reach depths of 7 m lavee 1996 for the annual crops no calibration was possible since no ec station was installed over such class instead we used the parameters obtained by saadi et al 2015 after calibration of samir over wheat plots in central tunisia that we consider similar to our site irrigation was simulated assuming that the farmer avoid stress triggering input just before stress and bringing the water amount required to fill the soil holding capacity the irrigation simulations were stopped from 16 july to 30 november 2017 and from 21 may to 26 september 2018 according to ground observation fig 4 shows the temporal variations of the computed basal crop coefficient k cb and the fraction cover fc values using the ndvi relationships with ndvi averaged over the ec1 station peak k cb and fc values were observed at the beginning of spring for both years 2017 and 2018 while minimum k cb and fc values were recorded in summer and early autumn these variations are linked to the vegetative cycle of the olive tree itself but they may be amplified by the understory of annual crops often observed in this area in spring and early summer when water is available from the river conversely the k e values don t exhibit the same seasonality and are only linked to water inputs irrigation or rainfall it is remarkable to note that the resistance to evaporation is much increased as compared to fao standards with rew 0 and m 0 185 which is coherent with previous studies saadi et al 2015 torres and calera 2010 thus k e values are on the whole quite low below 0 2 which can be explained by the important canopy shading modifying significantly the meteorological forcing at the soil level the k s values show non stressed conditions during vegetation developments i e k s 1 while stress appears in late summer and autumn justified by the insufficient irrigation due to water shortage in the river the samir eta simulations are in good agreement with observed values with an rmse bias and r of about 0 50 mm day 0 11 mm day and 0 87 respectively fig 5 the simulated values reproduce well the seasonal cycle during the development stage of wheat in spring eta was higher in the dry season 2017 than the wet one 2018 which is strongly related to the higher reference evapotranspiration in 2017 despite the lack of rainfall water is still available for irrigation in spring because water comes from the mountains and is not affected directly by drought occurring downstream however the gap between eta and et0 during summer and autumn can be related to the water supply this gap is large in 2017 when compared to 2018 since the first year is dry with 157 mm whereas 2018 is wetter with 384 mm however even in these stressed conditions the olive trees managed to keep a high level of transpiration due to the deep rooting of the trees 3 2 samir validation using the calibrated parameters table 1 samir was run over the study area using the sentinel 2 ndvi time series the simulated samir eta values were validated using measurements provided by the ec2 and the las for the latter samir daily eta outputs were weighted according to the daily footprint computed as explained previously the comparison between samir daily eta and eta measured by ec2 in 2017 and 2018 shows a good agreement with an rmse bias and r of about 0 53 mm day 0 12 mm day and 0 82 fig 6 very close to the values obtained during the calibration stage on ec1 however in 2017 samir overestimated eta during the dry period from july to november this is because a spatialized version of the samir tools is used in this study and it doesn t allow to stop irrigation while no water is available at this time of the season by contrast no overestimation of eta was observed in summer 2018 as the year was wet and there was less water shortage in the root zone despite the lack of irrigation the comparison between samir daily eta and the las measurements in 2017 and 2018 is presented on fig 7 due to technical problems the las measurements are lacking from june to august 2018 on average a good concordance is noticed between the simulations and the measurements with an rmse bias and r of 0 73 mm day 0 45 mm day and 0 74 respectively however between january and june 2017 samir underestimated eta one possible explanation for this gap is that during this period since there is enough rainfall and no stress samir doesn t apply any irrigation which is not the case for the farmers who do not hesitate to bring water when it is available in the river indeed as shown by bouimouass et al 2020 who studied irrigation in a very similar watershed neighboring the study site overirrigation is very frequent as is driven by water availability and not by the crop requirements in 2018 this discrepancy between simulated and measured eta is also visible but to a lesser extent possibly because the precipitation was relatively high and consequently the impact of irrigation on eta was lower 3 3 sparse calibration as for samir the sparse model was calibrated over the ec1 station by minimizing the rmse between simulated and observed le the sparse results were weighted by the ec and las instantaneous footprints at the time of landsat overpass from a sensitivity study boulet et al 2015 five parameters of sparse having a significant impact on simulated eta were calibrated the minimum stomatal resistance rst min which was set to 260 s m as reported by zhu et al 2014 rst min varies for many natural and cultivated plants it ranges considerably from 20 to 100 s m for crops and from 200 to 300 s m for many types of trees zhu et al 2014 leaf width w set to 0 03 m is within the range found in the literature saadi et al 2018 hssaine et al 2018 braud et al 1995 the ratio relating the net radiation of the soil to the heat soil flux ξ set to 0 13 in fact kustas et al 1993 pointed that ξ is driven by several factors namely the time of day the soil moisture and the thermal properties as well as the vegetation density and its value ranges between 0 05 and 0 5 the extinction coefficient k in the equation where the fraction cover is calculated in term of lai which is set to 0 6 which is in conformity with the values found by connor et al 2012 and srinet et al 2019 the empirical coefficient in the aerodynamic resistance n sw set to 2 5 which is the same value stated by boulet et al 2015 the calibration shows an acceptable agreement with an rmse and r of about 81 3 w m2 and 0 58 respectively fig 8 3 4 sparse validation the parameters obtained over ec1 were validated locally over ec2 and spatially using the las measurements scatter plots of modeled available energy sensible and latent heat fluxes for landsat overpass dates averaged over the ec2 and las footprints versus measurements are displayed at figs 9 and 10 net radiation values were accurately estimated by sparse with rmse of about 69 8 w m2 for ec2 however they show an underestimation compared to the two stations measurements which is expected since the landsat lst overestimates the surface temperature as shown in fig 2 this is in line with the same bias observed in the calibration phase rn measurement over a complex surface is a difficult task as many authors reported anthoni et al 2000 byun et al 2014 due to the influence of the vegetation structure on the albedo comparison between observed and simulated soil heat flux shows lower agreement than for rn which can be explained in one hand by the accuracy of the measurements since it gathers several difficulties as reported in the literature ezzahar et al 2009b hssaine et al 2018 these difficulties lay in the plate protection from direct sunlight especially for the one at 5 cm and choosing the representative position which takes into consideration the vegetation intercept of the incoming radiation on the other hand sparse calculates g as a fraction of rns inducing the transmission of the error on rns to g furthermore for ease of implementation a constant fraction value was adopted in this study whereas many studies have related the value of this fraction to the variation of the surface cover diarra et al 2017 kustas 1990 saadi et al 2018 sensible heat flux simulations show acceptable agreement over ec2 and las with an rmse of about 116 w m2 and 68 w m2 respectively the discrepancy showed in the figures between modeled and observed h can be attributed to numerous factors particularly the accuracy of lst data in addition the calculation errors on the surface resistances are strongly affecting the h estimation also one potential source of error is the accuracy of the displacement height d and roughness length z0 which were estimated in this work as a fraction of the vegetation height using the rule of thumb z0 0 14 hveg and d 0 66 hveg hveg is the vegetation height following brutsaert and kustas 1987 the method used to approximate these parameters are adapted to dense and homogeneous areas whereas the experimental field is heterogeneous and sparse finally the model provides good estimates of le over ec2 and las with an rmse of about 52 7 w m2 and 78 8 w m2 respectively the discrepancy in le can be related to the uncertainty on h and ae rn g which is directly transmitted to le values since it s a residual term of the energy balance kalma et al 2008 morillas et al 2013 saadi et al 2018 moreover using constant parameters during the whole year despite vegetation and environmental changes can causes some errors especially for the minimum stomatal resistance rst min as reported by boulet et al 2015 an inadequate value of rst min increases automatically h and le errors 3 5 model s validation and intercomparison the comparison of the four models and las and ec2 measurements was done at the daily scale the instantaneous eta estimates provided by sparse and sw were extrapolated to a daily value using the ef method presented in section 2 5 then daily eta maps provided by all models were weighted using the daily footprint of the las and ec2 measurements in order to be compared with them figs 11 and 12 presents the scatterplots of the four models eta estimates compared to the ec2 and las measurements respectively the four models underestimate the las measurements which is strange and raises the question on the las accuracy however the las values were validated while comparing them with the ec1 and ec2 values in a previous study elfarkh et al 2020 and the results were good sparse and sw are more scattered which can be related to the large number of their parameters that are taken constant throughout the season nevertheless these parameters are variable in space depending on the soil and vegetation characteristics in addition the sensibility of both models to the lst data errors can also generate this bias the metric and samir eta estimates are less scattered and show better statistical results compared to sparse and to sw the time series of the daily eta values obtained with the las and the four models are illustrated in fig 13 overall the las and the four models eta show similar seasonal dynamics they increase with the begin of the growing season in january reach maximum values during growth peak in april may and then decrease until december since precipitation and canopy development greatly affect et its rates decrease during dry conditions and increase immediately after each rainfall event the eta values of winter are higher in 2018 than in 2017 due to the higher precipitations in 2018 however the eta spring values are low in 2018 compared to 2017 which can be attributed to the low available energy received due to more frequent cloudy days during summer 2017 sw was close to the las measurements sparse underestimates eta values which may be due to the already observed overestimation of landsat lst fig 2 that signify stress conditions for the model in contrast the effect of the lst error on the sw estimations was not as strong as for sparse which can be attributed to fact that the absolute values of lst are used in sparse whereas lst was used in a relative manner in sw model to compute stress indexes related to the resistances of vegetation and soil regarding samir the estimated eta values were overestimated which is expected since samir doesn t stop irrigation in summer despite the water shortage metric in this period shows a slight overestimation that can be linked to wet edge detection error under these stress conditions the rmse and the r of the models show that samir and metric gee are the least scattered and the most correlated to the measurements on the other hand sparse shows less bias and dispersion than sw while the latter is better correlated in order to further compare the models and illustrate the discrepancies eta images of the four models are shown for three dates illustrating contrasted conditions fig 14 the accuracy of each image is assessed through the bias with the las measurements fig 15 keeping in mind that the las measurements represent only the irrigated area in the center of the image for the 16th of january 2017 the model providing the best estimates is sparse and the other models strongly underestimate eta 1 5 to 1 mm bias samir shows low values of et especially over the bare soil supposedly not irrigated and also over the wheat plots which were bare soil at this time fig 14 sw model also underestimates eta which can be explained by the non representativeness of the relation established between the stress indexes and the resistances over the bare soil since these relations were calibrated over olive trees ec1 in contrast thanks to the thermal information which is highly correlated to the soil moisture sparse shows less bias compared to the las finally metric gee underestimates the most eta although it is based on thermal remote sensing that should capture soil moisture conditions indeed the metric approach forces the flux computation to be bounded between wet and dry extreme conditions although these extreme conditions are not always present on every image and may thus induce a wrong scaling for the summer date of 20 august 2017 sw and samir models provide the best results metric gee shows the higher bias which can be explained by the error on determining the wet and dry temperatures which are not well identified in such dry uniform conditions sparse also underestimates eta measurements which may be related to the lst reliability on first april 2018 during the development stage of annuals and no stress conditions samir model is close to the las observations whereas sw shows a strong underestimation the sw and sparse underestimation can be explained by the fact that several parameters especially the minimal stomatal conductance are set constant during the entire season regardless of the seasonal changes this assumption can lead to erroneous eta estimates in fact zhu et al 2013 and hu et al 2009 noted that over underestimation of eta can occur when using constant parameters for long term simulations using sw over different vegetation and environmental conditions finally for metric gee we observe a strong contrast between vegetation area with very high eta and bare soil areas with low et which is a characteristic of metric always stretching eta between dry bare soil and wet vegetated areas tasumi 2019 however despite a strong eta in vegetated areas the model predictions are still underestimated at the scale of the las footprint due to the underestimation of evaporation in the riverbeds see below another difference between the models is linked to riverbed samir shows low eta for all dates in the river assuming a non irrigated bare soil without taking into consideration the evaporation due to capillary rise from the shallow aquifer associated with riverbeds this is well visible on the april image and to a lesser extent in january in contrast sparse accounts for the soil moisture related to surface temperature and shows higher eta in riverbeds for these two dates although based on thermal data sw also underestimates eta in this area which is explained by the fact that the resistance calibrations were done mainly on olive trees ec1 this calibration may not be representative of the entire study area in particular the fields of annual crops calibration of the resistance s equation in the sw model on different land uses is necessary to improve its performance on the whole the accuracy of the four approaches for predicting eta was acceptable despite some discrepancies observed in specific conditions but not at the same time depending on the model there is no unique method for evaluating models so there is no easy answer to the question of which model is most accurate it seems that the sparse model like other models based on thermal remote sensing even if it is based on physical assumptions remains sensitive to the quality of the input variables on one hand e g the accuracy of the surface temperature and on the other hand to the setting of the different physical parameters required by the model the latter parameters are very variable in space and their calibration may suffer from equifinality problems as shown by the calibration of sparse the errors of the three energy balance models sparse sw and metric gee seem uncorrelated which lead to a logical hypothesis of testing the potential benefit of computing their average value as shown in fig 16 the correlation coefficient obtained between this average eta value and the measurements shows an improvement of 36 29 and 3 as compared to sparse sw and metric gee respectively however this average is underestimated with a bias of about 0 63 mm day which is expected since the three model estimations are underestimated given that the bias can be corrected based on the linear relation obtained the improvement in the correlation between eta values average and the las measurements may be exploited for operational eta estimates in this area this approach of averaging different methods is a technique that has been used in different works such as the evaspa model that includes several algorithms for calculating eta in order to assess the uncertainties in eta estimates gallego elvira et al 2013 in comparison with thermal approaches samir provides a good eta because it is computed on a robust base which is the slowly changing ndvi and accurately measured et0 however it suffers from a major drawback which is the lack of control of soil water conditions thus water stress affecting both transpiration k s and evaporation k e is poorly represented models do not have the same advantages and weaknesses and each may be suitable under certain conditions table 3 the major constraint is the need of user calibration each time the environmental conditions are different except for metric gee for which there are achieved automatically in addition the availability of the model s input is a paramount element to choose a model especially in traditional complex areas for instance it is impossible to have spatial information about the irrigation of each plot consequently samir is not the best choice in stress conditions where soil moisture strongly influences et on the other hand the difficulty to calculate accurate lst from the satellite s thermal bands is an issue for the energy balance models due to their high sensitivity to this variable however these models are not equally affected by lst accuracy sparse is highly sensitive to lst accuracy since the error directly impacts h and le in contrast the contextual approach of metric gee scaling lst relatively to extreme values of the image reduces problems also for sw the relative variation of lst between its maximum and minimum is used to calculate the soil and the vegetation resistances this means that the error on lst will not have the same effect on metric gee and sw as compared to sparse one advantage of samir is to produce continuous daily eta estimates which is valuable in assessing the basin water budget simonneaux et al 2007 le page et al 2012 diarra et al 2017 sparse is a model that can be used accurately to detect stress conditions if properly calibrated boulet et al 2015 consequently eta estimated by sparse can be used to calculate stress indices the modified sw model is a new approach that must be tested under different conditions in order to find a robust relationship that accurately represents the variation in resistance as a function of stress indices finally metric gee showed a good agreement with the las measurements which is very good news since it is available freely and it does not require in depth technical knowledge 4 conclusion the objective of this study was to map distributed actual crop evapotranspiration eta at high resolution using different approaches based on different remote sensing data we used the samir model based on water budget as proposed by the fao 56 approach and three approaches based on thermal remote sensing namely the sparse model a modified version of shuttleworth wallace sw model and an operational version of metric available on google earth engine metric gee the comparison has been performed over an heterogeneous and complex irrigated agricultural area landsat 7 and 8 products were used for sparse sw and metric gee and sentinel 2 products were used for samir the models performance is evaluated using two eddy covariance ec systems and scintillometer las measurements the seasonal variability of eta is correctly predicted by the four models throughout 2017 and 2018 agricultural seasons however samir and metric gee with an rmse of 0 73 and 0 68 mm day respectively as compared to las measurements showed slightly better performances in estimating eta than sparse and sw which show an rmse of 0 90 and 0 98 mm day compared to las measurements respectively finally when averaging the estimates of the three thermal based models the correlation coefficient with measurements was improved by 36 29 and 3 compared to sparse sw and metric gee respectively this study has shown the accuracy of different approaches and highlights the importance of remote sensing data which allow highly spatial and temporal resolution of eta estimation samir has represented good estimation of eta but its dependence for water input data irrigation and rainfall limit its applicability especially over traditional irrigated areas on the other hand thermal approaches may detect water stress but they have shown to be very sensitive to parameterization and to uncertainties in input data this is the case for the remotely sensed surface temperature and for parameters like the stomatal resistance sensitive to environmental conditions interestingly enough metric gee eta products showed good agreement with the las measurements without any calibration and are freely available online these results confirm the idea that to move forward the combination of these models can be applied for instance assimilating the eta estimates of metric gee sw or sparse into samir which showed a good temporal consistency but whose widespread application may be limited by lack of available spatially explicit data on irrigation amount this potential synergy is expected to be improved in the next few years with the lstm mission of esa and the trishna mission lagouarde et al 2018 which will provide high spatial temporal resolution land surface temperature at a resolution of 50 m every 3 days which is a significant step forward as compared to the actual landsat data 100 m every 16 days this will allow accurate monitoring of spatio temporal changes in the water status of surfaces including crop stress detection and will open

compute eta and water budget at the daily time step using the fao method allen et al 1998 the soil model has been slightly modified to include three compartments namely the evaporation root and deep soil compartments saadi et al 2015 between these compartments water can move down by gravity or up and down by diffusion processes these fluxes are linked to the soil moisture of the compartments in this work fao dual crop approach implemented in the samir tool was used to calculate eta as follows a 1 eta k s k cb k e et 0 the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated using meteorological measurements based on the fao penman monteith equation and the crop coefficient k cb was estimated using a ndvi k cb relationship based on satellite time series imagery a 2 k cb a ndvi b parameters a and b are related mainly to land cover type and climatic conditions and can be calibrated or and taken from previous studies duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 saadi et al 2015 k e is the evaporation coefficient when the depletion in the evaporation layer i e void volume de exceeds a threshold i e readily evaporable water rew a reduction factor k r is applied to reduce evaporation following eq a 4 a 3 k e min k r kc max k cb f ew kc max a 4 k r m tew de tew rew 1 where kc max and f ew are the maximum capacity of water evacuation by atmosphere and the fraction of soil wetted respectively tew is the total evaporable water in the evaporation layer in order to estimate kr we used the formalism proposed by torres and calera 2010 namely the introduction of the m parameter which allows more reduction of evaporation as compared to the original fao 56 formalism the m coefficient initially set to 1 allows to further reduce the evaporation level with m values potentially decreasing until 0 this choice was made because like torres et al we observed a strong overestimation of eta especially after wetting events which was supposed to be due to higher evaporation saadi et al 2015 after introducing the m parameter and calibration better estimates of eta were obtained saadi et al 2015 the combination of rew and m are functionally defining the surface resistance to the soil evaporation the stress coefficient k s is computed when depletion in the root compartment dr is higher than the readily available water raw limiting the root uptake eq a 5 raw is a fraction of the taw the total available water available for vegetation a 5 k s taw dr taw raw 1 in addition to ndvi time series samir uses as forcing the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 values and water input in fact rainfall can be measured using the meteorological station whereas irrigation cannot be easily observed for each plot in an area thus samir simulated the water inputs based on an assumed behavior of the farmer regarding the threshold in soil moisture to trigger irrigation and the water depth brought a detailed explanation of samir functioning may be found in saadi et al 2015 some parameters were fixed according to the guideline of the fao 56 paper the depth of the soil evaporation layer ze the root zone water depletion fraction before stress p and the maximum value of crop coefficient following rain or irrigation which is determined by the energy available for eta at the soil surface kc max or were based on ground data the volumetric water content at field capacity ω fc and the volumetric water content at wilting point ω wp vegetation fraction cover values were computed based on a linear relationship with ndvi where the slope a fc and the intercept b fc were set assuming an ndvi value for the bare soil fc 0 and full coverage fc 1 equal to 0 15 and 0 9 respectively fc was used to calculate the root zone depth zr using a linear relation and assuming that the crop will reach its full rooting depth at maximum fc the remaining parameters the slope and the intercept of the ndvi k cb linear relationship a kcb and b kcb the readily evaporable water rew the root depth zr max and the diffusion between surface and root layers dif er were calibrated using the flux data table 2 appendix 2 sparse model the sparse model is a two source model solving separately the energy budget of the soil and the vegetation boulet et al 2015 where both of them are connected to the atmosphere separately the model solves a system of equations regarding sensible and latent heat flux for soil and vegetation respectively eq a 6 and a 7 and the energy balance of the soil and the vegetation eq a 8 and a 9 eq a 10 describes the link between the average surface temperature and longwave radiative ﬂuxes a 6 h h s h v a 7 le le s le v a 8 rn s g h s le s a 9 rn v h v le v a 10 σ ε lst 4 ε r atm r an h is the sensible heat ﬂux le is the latent heat ﬂux rn is the net radiation

radiation lst is the radiative surface temperature k and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant to solve these equations the model is first run in prescribed mode for two extreme configurations namely fully unstressed and fully stressed vegetation i e for a minimum and a maximum surface resistances computing theoretical evaporation and transpiration fluxes based on the same method as the tseb model kustas and norman 1999 these potential fluxes are then used as thresholds in the retrieval mode in this mode le v is calculated first considering unstressed conditions deducting le s using the measured surface temperature if the obtained le s value is negative the unstressed vegetation assumption is invalid in that case the vegetation is assumed to suffer from water stress and the soil surface is assumed to be dry consequently le s is set to 30 w m2 to account for the remaining slow vapor diffusion within the soil boulet et al 1997 and the vegetation latent heat ﬂux le v is recalculated if le v is also negative both le s and le v components are given zero independently of lst appendix 3 shuttleworth wallace model this model is developed by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 it estimates two separate fluxes one for soil and the other for the vegetation using the following formulas a 11 eta e t c s pm s c v pm v a 12 pm s a ρ c p d r a s a a s r a r a s γ 1 r s s r a r a s

model is used this version used the thermal data to provide spatial eta estimation as described by elfarkh et al 2021 in this approach the vegetation and soil resistances were related to the stress indexes as follow a 14 r s s a e b si ss a 15 r s v c e d si sv where a c b and d are the calibration parameters set to 160 25 and 36 02 s m 2 62 and 1 30 respectively r s s and r s v are the resistances for soil and for vegetation respectively si ss and si sv are the stress indexes for soil and vegetation respectively this approach was calibrated and validated in the same study area elfarkh et al 2021 appendix 4 metric gee model metric gee is a version of metric allen et al 2007 that operates on the google earth engine system https eeflux level1 appspot com the surface energy balance in this model is derived by landsat thermal band while the surface roughness vegetation amounts and albedo are retrieved from short wave bands the instantaneous evaporative fraction estimated at the time of satellite overpass is extrapolated at daily scale to provide daily eta value using reference et computed by the penman monteith and gridmet weather data sets
