18170,recovering and reusing treated wastewater effluent is a sustainable and cost effective practice for addressing global water sustainability to date most potable reuse advanced water treatment awt solutions are based on reverse osmosis ro which generates a continuous reject stream of concentrated brine waste ozone biofiltration based solutions have been investigated as a potential alternative for ro however implementation of ozone biofiltration for potable reuse projects around the world has been limited the goal of this study was to conduct an extended field investigation of ozone biofiltration treatment to address regulatory design and operational hurdles that may hinder implementation in water short areas for 16 months two parallel biological activated carbon bac filters were operated at empty bed contact times ebcts of 10 min and 20 min treating up to 60 000 and 30 000 bed volumes bvs respectively of sand filtered effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment process bac 1 ebct 10 min and bac 2 ebct 20 min used calgon filtrasorb 400 granular activated carbon gac as filter media with equal bed depths of 0 8 m increasing the specific ozone dose from 0 9 to 2 0 provided a muted response with respect to oxidation of contaminants of emerging concern cecs that are resistive to ozonation n nitrosodimethylamine ndma was generated during ozonation with the average concentration of ndma in ozonated effluent being 40 4 ng l in bac 1 ebct 10 min ndma was fully removed during the first month of study 2000 bvs partially removed between 2000 and 20 000 bvs and completely removed when monitored between 57 000 and 62 000 bvs these trends clearly reveal time dependent interactions between carbon based e g adsorption and non carbon based e g biodegradation removal mechanisms in bac 2 ebct 20 min almost all cecs excluding ndma were removed consistently throughout the study through 30 000 bvs this indicates a somewhat different interaction between carbon based and non carbon based removal in the more lightly loaded bac 2 compared to bac 1 after 482 days of operation bac 1 ebct 10 min produced effluent with lower ndma concentration 2 ng l than bac 2 10 ng l confirming prior evidence of cometabolic ndma biodegradation pathways operable in more heavily loaded bacs these findings emphasize the need for extended field testing 50 000 bvs or greater bac 1 removed toc in effluent until it plateaued at around 6 mg l after 60 000 bvs whereas bac 2 effluent plateaued at around 4 mg l under plateau conditions bac 1 and bac 2 with sand filter pretreatment and ozonation appear to have a gross toc removal potential of around 0 2 0 3 kg of toc removed per day per cubic meter of carbon media kg d m3 a comparative analysis of findings from this study and results from a past ozone bac study in the reno area termed bac 3 operated downstream of membrane filter with an ebct of 30 min shows that higher toc removal was observed in bac with shorter ebct and upstream sand filter compared to bac with longer ebct and upstream membrane filter the present study addresses the regulatory and financial concerns associated with ozone bac performance in potable reuse applications improved comprehension of ozone bac performance coupled with its reduced capital and operations and maintenance o m costs compared to ro may accelerate the full scale implementation of ozone bac treatment as a sustainable solution for the rapidly emerging potable reuse market graphical abstract image 1 keywords potable reuse trace organics ozonation biofiltration biological activated carbon contaminants of emerging concern 1 introduction a shortage of clean affordable water is a growing threat to many people and societies around the world according to the united nations un world s cities report global water demand is expected to increase by 50 by 2030 which is greater than the anticipated increase in demand for energy un habitat 2016 communities are rethinking their current drinking water wastewater and stormwater management paradigm to achieve water sustainability resilience and water security recovering and reusing treated wastewater effluent i e water reuse is one of the key strategies for meeting future water demand and water management needs the water reuse roadmap wef 2018 lists potential benefits of water reuse which include but are not limited to a reliable new water source enhanced resiliency and water security control of seawater intrusion and land subsidence and preservation of pristine water sources and their ecologies these benefits if realized will have a significant positive impact on global water sustainability water reuse takes many forms including agricultural irrigation landscape irrigation cooling water industrial process water etc all these forms require the construction and maintenance of a dedicated non potable distribution system such as purple pipe however with advances in wastewater treatment reuse of potable water or potable reuse is now possible this is the highest beneficial use of water and would not necessitate the construction and maintenance of a purple pipe distribution system potable reuse has several advantages over non potable reuse including 1 no purple pipe system to build 2 no risk of cross connection between a purple pipe system and a potable water distribution system 3 possibility of using effluent year round thereby eliminating seasonal storage and retreatment needs and 4 potential long term environmental benefits such as water banking preservation of aquatic ecologies control of seawater intrusion and or land subsidence etc when it comes to implementing potable reuse projects studies have shown that public and regulatory communities are concerned about pathogens regulated drinking water contaminants contaminants of emerging concern cecs which include pharmaceuticals personal care products flame retardants hormones etc and reliability wef 2018 most potable reuse technologies currently rely on reverse osmosis ro an expensive process that primarily removes salt by filtering out almost all organic and inorganic contaminants from water two key elements drive the higher cost of ro the cost to build and operate the ro facility and ancillary equipment and the cost to dispose of ro reject or brine waste which represents about 15 20 of the process flow for coastal communities brine waste may be discharged to the ocean at a low cost however for inland communities brine disposal may be as costly as the ro process itself because many potable reuse projects need little to no salt removal ro may not be necessary if alternative reliable more cost effective means are developed to remove pathogens drinking water contaminants and cecs ozone biofiltration and ancillary processes has now been shown to be as effective as ro in potable reuse project applications and at a much lower cost particularly for inland communities with brine disposal concerns sundaram et al 2014 however regulatory barriers currently hinder widespread use of non ro solutions for potable reuse projects for example the state of california has effectively mandated the use of ro treatment for subsurface application injection well of groundwater augmentation projects state of california 2018a consequently in california several ro based injection well groundwater augmentation projects are either planned or implemented in coastal communities but no injection well projects are planned for inland communities without access to oceanic brine disposal facilities watereuse 2019 in 2017 63 of the global population lived inland united nations 2017 development and implementation of non ro based solutions for inland potable reuse could reshape urban water cycles globally for example during california s 2015 drought some smaller inland communities e g east porterville faced serious potable water shortages that would have been reduced if potable reuse facilities were affordable greene 2018 swain 2015 for inland communities potable reuse treatment using ozone biofiltration appears to be the best apparent alternative because compared to ro capital costs are lower about 33 of ro and energy requirements are lower 25 of ro additionally since ozone biofiltration does not produce brine this non ro process helps conserve nearly 20 of the influent water lee et al 2012 sundaram et al 2014 past ozone biofiltration investigations have addressed several questions related to ozone biofiltration performance in terms of removing bulk organics arnold et al 2018 reaume et al 2015 reungoat et al 2012 ozonation byproducts bacaro et al 2019 sundaram et al 2014 and cecs bourgin et al 2018 blackbeard et al 2015 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2012 maidrand and ohlinger 2013 reungoat et al 2012 sundaram and emerick 2010 with regards to ozone biofiltration design and operational parameters several studies have explored the role of preozonation bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2012 biofilter media types reaume et al 2015 sun et al 2018 and biofilter empty bed contact time ebct arnold et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 reungoat et al 2011 however a comprehensive literature review conducted by the authors shows that most full scale wastewater ozone biofiltration facilities are not designed based on recently identified potable reuse project goals related to cecs a summary of full scale ozone biofiltration facilities is presented in table 1 the literature review also shows that several pilot scale and demonstration scale ozone biofiltration investigations were terminated early with relatively low throughput i e less than 15 000 bed volumes bvs treated and that there were still outstanding ozone biofiltration performance questions about cause and effect of design parameters such as upstream treatment steps bvs treated may not be critical for biofilters with granular media e g sand anthracite because transition from gac to bac is mainly a function of volume treated bvs treated are critical for biofilters with gac media bvs treated provide insights into how far along a bed with virgin gac media has transitioned into a bac for example ozone biofiltration performance investigations were terminated after less than 14 000 bvs of operation which is too short to quantify long term effects or without reporting the bvs treated arnold et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 reaume et al 2015 sundaram et al 2014 however one study of longer duration 60 000 bvs reported cec removals even after two years of operation and more than 50 000 bvs of flow bourgin et al 2018 water use and reuse practitioners have used various types and configurations of biofiltration to achieve different goals relevant to potable water production biofilters are used as 1 a cec barrier to remove a wide range of chemicals 2 a membrane pretreatment step to improve membrane flux 3 an ndma barrier and 4 a step to remove other readily biodegradable ozonation byproducts such as aldehydes and glyoxals however no clear guidelines currently exist for determining design and operational parameters based on potable reuse project specific goals and regulations biofilter media type and upstream treatment steps could have a significant impact on biofilter performance secondary effluent quality e g toc can impact ozone demand level of organics present in secondary effluent which are made up of soluble microbial products recalcitrant organics and residual organic particulates depend on the type of biological treatment and to a certain extent the solids retention time srt of the treatment process barker and stuckey 1999 clara et al 2005 ozone biofiltration performance may be different if the influent water undergoes ultrafiltration rather than sand filtration past investigations indicate that toc removal across biofilters is influenced by the upstream filtration process bourgin et al 2018 lee et al 2012 reungoat et al 2012 sundaram et al 2014 however the relationship between the nature of the upstream treatment e g filter pore size and the biofilter s performance e g with regards to toc removal and fate of cecs such as ndma and flame retardants through the biofilters after extended operation have not been reported elsewhere results from existing ozone biofiltration design and operational practices are ambiguous regarding ozone biofiltration performance reliability and capital and o m costs demonstrating efficacy meeting regulatory requirements lack of familiarity to wastewater operators and ambiguity related to capital and o m costs of ozone biofiltration are all challenges that add a significant burden for communities that are considering ozone bac i e ozonation followed by biofiltration in which the filter medium is granular activated carbon gac for their potable reuse projects the potential of ozone biofiltration and other non ro technologies has therefore not been fully tapped and the technology has not yet been accepted for widespread worldwide implementation when considering the range of ozone biofiltration technologies i e biofilters with sand anthracite gac etc as media ozone bac shows the greatest potential for near term implementation for potable reuse projects from review of previous wastewater ozone bac studies by the project team and by others the specific ozone dose is in the range of 0 8 2 bac ebct is in the range of 10 20 min transition from gac to bac in terms of biomass development is about 70 days and biodiversity develops over a substantial period of time arnold et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2012 reungoat et al 2011 sundaram et al 2014 sundaram and emerick 2010 based on the foregoing literature chemical indicators for assessing ozone bac performance and process control include ndma pfas cecs such as tcep tcpp and tdcpp toc and suva ozone bac process reliability in terms of contaminant removal over time is of great importance to the potable reuse regulatory community field verification of ozone bac performance from startup to achieving steady state based on real time tools is necessary for regulatory approval and operational protocols consequently this study involved 19 months of continuous field scale demonstration of two ozone bac systems with different ebcts at an operating water resource recovery facility wrrf with observations of removal of a range of contaminants this experimental design and associated results of two parallel identical biofilters including same media type and bed depth operated continuously under different ebcts and loading rates for the extended period is believed to be unique focus of the study was to develop deeper understanding of process reliability in terms of cec removal when ozone bac is utilized as a primary cec barrier within the potable reuse awt train therefore ozone bac process reliability in terms of contaminant removal was evaluated over an extended period 473 days of continuous operation processing real world filtered secondary effluent while all ozone bac process variables were maintained constant specifically findings from this effort are aimed to fill the gap in the literature regarding transition of gac to bac in potable reuse applications as an example ndma is one of the biodegradable cecs this investigation reports on acclimation time required for ndma removal in bac potential operational strategies such as suva for verifying field performance and reliability of ozone and bac systems were evaluated emphasis was given to parameters such as toc and uvt that can be measured using continuous online analyzers finally this study adds to the body of literature regarding toc removal across ozone bac systems in potable reuse applications and the impact of upstream treatment on toc removal with a future goal of developing potable reuse ozone bac design guidelines 2 materials and methods 2 1 field testing of ozone bac system field testing of ozone bac system performance occurred from march 2017 to january 2019 the ozone bac system was operated continuously throughout the testing period without any interruption testing was conducted at south truckee meadows water reclamation facility stmwrf owned by washoe county nevada stmwrf serves a largely residential and commercial area its treatment process train includes nitrification denitrification secondary biological process average srt 10 days followed by a continuous backwash sand filtration system provided by dynasand parkson corporation fort lauderdale florida usa during the test period the effluent from the sand filter served as the influent to the ozone bac pilot system at a constant flow rate 2 2 ozone bac pilot system approximately 71 m3 d 13 gpm of stmwrf sand filtered effluent was conveyed to an oxelia ozone bac system provided by xylem rye brook new york usa pictures of the pilot system taken during testing are included in the supplemental text figs s1 and s2 ozone was generated on site by an air operated ozone generator wedeco rye brook new york usa equipped with an oxygen concentrator and chiller the influent toc to pilot system was monitored continuously with a toc analyzer ysi rye brook new york usa during field testing the specific ozone dose i e ratio of ozone dose mg l to influent toc mg l was maintained at the desired value by an automated process control system this mode of operation resulted in a consistent specific ozone dose being delivered to the ozone bac process day to day and season to season field performance testing was conducted at a specific ozone dose of 0 9 during the last two months of operation the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 and then to 2 0 after injecting ozone in the liquid stream ozonated water was conveyed to two stainless steel ozone contactors then to the ozonated effluent tank the pilot system was equipped with two identical parallel gravity fed bac filters referred to as bac 1 and bac 2 each filter contained a 0 8 m deep bed of filtrasorb 400 f 400 calgon corporation pittsburgh pennsylvania usa gac media the bed depth chosen for this study was close to the minimum bed depth recommended by the gac manufacturer this media type and bed depth were maintained in both bac 1 and bac 2 throughout the test period each bac received ozonated effluent from the break tank at a constant rate via its feed pump the bac 1 flow was 44 m3 d 8 gpm whereas the bac 2 flow was 22 m3 d 4 gpm half of bac 1 s loading rate these flow rates resulted in an ebct of 10 min in bac 1 and 20 min in bac 2 thus bac 1 operated under twice the hydraulic loading rate and contaminant loading rate of bac 2 head loss across each bac bed was monitored continuously bac 1 was backwashed approximately every 36 h while bac 2 was backwashed weekly with regards to biomass control the trigger for backwashing both bac 1 and bac 2 was based on a preventative maintenance approach geared towards avoiding excessive accumulation of solids and or biological growth the backwash procedure was the same for both biofilters which starts with an air scour followed by a low flow rate water backwash then ramped up to a high flow rate backwash and ending with a low flow rate water backwash the pilot system was equipped with several online analyzers and instrumentation a detailed summary of monitors and instrumentation is provided in the supplemental text table s1 2 3 operational sampling and monitoring summary to evaluate the long term reliability of ozone bac operation and to determine the impact of ebct on bac performance the specific ozone dose and ebct were maintained for over 450 days operational details including temperature and ph ranges are included in supplemental text table s2 water quality parameters such as toc ph temperature and ammonia were quantified for process monitoring using standard methods apha 2017 dissolved ozone residual was quantified with the online monitor and verified by hach ampules hach loveland colorado usa bromide and bromate were quantified using epa method 300 0 usepa 1993 and epa method 317 usepa 2001 respectively nine sampling events were conducted after a backwash to quantify levels of ndma cecs per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas toc and other water quality parameters supplemental text table s3 presents a detailed analyte list along with details of the analytical methods used the first seven sampling events occurred when the specific ozone dose was maintained at 0 9 and bac ebcts were maintained at 10 min and 20 min for bac 1 and bac 2 respectively bac ebcts remained the same throughout the study the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 leading up to the eighth sampling event and then increased to 2 0 leading up to the ninth and final sampling event with regards to frequency of sample collection initial samples i e first 6 of 9 samples were taken within 142 days with the goal of capturing gac to bac transition until steady state was reached seventh sample at 450 days was collected to assess long term reliability the final two samples were collected to investigate the effect of higher specific ozone dose the intermediate period between sixth and seventh sampling events was considered as a steady state operational period 2 4 targeted contaminant quantification after each treatment process sampled cecs were quantified either by american water belleville illinois usa with a method developed in house or by eurofins eaton analytical laboratory monrovia california usa the methodology employed by american water included analytes preconcentration by solid phase extraction followed by quantitation by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight lc qtof eurofins eaton analytical laboratory utilized a fully automated method based on online solid phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography hplc mass spectrometry mass spectrometry spe lc ms ms according to eea 9609 method oppenheimer et al 2011 ndma was quantified utilizing a modified version of epa method 521 usepa 2004 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa were quantified utilizing epa method 537 usepa 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndma ndma was measured in ozone bac process influent after ozonation and after biofiltration in bac 1 10 min ebct and bac 2 20 min ebct results over time are shown in fig 1 while the percentage of ndma removal post ozonation in bac 1 and bac 2 as a function of bvs treated is shown in fig 2 formation of ndma during ozonation and removal of ndma across biofilters were observed in the past hollender et al 2009 and was confirmed by this research ndma was consistently formed during ozonation the average concentration of ndma in ozonated effluent was 40 4 15 1 ng l with a maximum of 80 ng l in the fifth sampling event day 104 this elevated ndma concentration may have been caused by increased concentrations of precursors in the influent such as secondary tertiary or quaternary amines with at least one dimethylamine dma functional group certain pharmaceuticals personal care products herbicides and water treatment polymers roback et al 2019 other studies have observed elevated ndma formation during ozonation as a function of precursor concentrations but not of ozone dose bacaro et al 2019 hollender et al 2009 however the formation of ndma does not appear to be significantly affected by the ozone dose when precursors are limited as evidenced by the results of this study when the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 then 2 0 during the last two sampling events see fig 1 3 1 1 ndma removal in bac 1 10 min ebct over 60 000 bvs process operation three distinct phases were observed for ndma removal across bac 1 the first phase was a steady initial decrease in ndma removal over the first 70 days of operation 10 000 bvs treated potentially dominated by carbon based mechanisms the second phase is a transition state from 70 to 140 days of operation i e between 10 000 and 20 000 bvs influenced by both carbon and non carbon based mechanisms such as biodegradation sorption to biofilm and others the third phase 140 days or 20 000 bvs was dominated by non carbon based mechanisms leading to the nearly complete removal of ndma these three phases are shown in fig 2 several researchers have reported ndma removals in biofilters bacaro et al 2019 hollender et al 2009 sundaram et al 2014 sun et al 2018 and have postulated that a cometabolic pathway involving monooxygenase enzymes could be responsible for ndma biodegradation hatzinger et al 2017 however few studies have reported a material increase in ndma removal over time which confirms the importance of biofilter acclimation time relative to biofilter performance sun et al 2018 trussell et al 2018 bourgin et al 2018 reported an 83 ndma removal across virgin gac with upstream ozonation a past study in the reno area using virgin f 400 gac biofilter media reported the complete removal of ndma through treatment of 13 000 bvs sundaram et al 2014 fleming et al 1996 conducted ndma bench scale and adsorption column studies using bituminous coal based f 400 coconut shell and carbonaceous resin based media they reported f 400 s ndma adsorption capacity at liquid concentration of 50 ng l closer to the average ozone effluent ndma concentration of 40 4 ng l in this study to be around 5 10 6 kg kg and f 400 was found to have the lowest adsorption capacity among the media tested bacaro et al 2019 reported a maximum 90 removal of ndma in both bac and an anthracite biofilter when 10 min or higher ebct was maintained it can therefore be assumed that ndma removal across bac biofilters involves both carbon based and non carbon based mechanisms however how these mechanisms interact over time is poorly understood which is just one of the current challenges to ozone bac implementation ndma results from this study clearly show a transition between carbon based and non carbon based mechanisms during the test duration and an acclimation time of around 140 days 20 000 bvs which underscores the benefit of performing extended field testing a much shorter acclimation time around 55 days was observed for ethyl glyoxal in a previous potable reuse ozone bac study sundaram and emerick 2010 zearley 2012 reported a similar removal trend for 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d in drinking water biofilters and attributed the phenomena to biodegradation that occurred with longer acclimation time if this study had terminated after 120 days of operation 17 300 bvs the conclusion on ndma removal in bac 1 would have been completely different analyzing the results of ndma removal in bac 1 in light of observations made by previous studies bacaro et al 2019 confirms that an ebct of 10 min could be a suitable for ndma removal 3 1 2 ndma removal in bac 2 20 min ebct over 30 000 bvs treated bac 2 was operated at twice the ebct of bac 1 and therefore had half the hydraulic and contaminant loads compared to bac 1 the carbon based removal capacity of bac 2 should have been available for a longer period of time than bac 1 because of the lower ndma loading rate and the reduced organic loading rate and associated reduced biofouling plugging of adsorption sites trends shown in figs 1 and 2 illustrate that ndma removal mechanisms in bac 2 over time were not as distinctive as bac 1 ndma removal in bac 2 was consistently better than in bac 1 during the initial phase of operation when carbon based mechanisms were more prevalent over time as non carbon based mechanisms e g biodegradation developed fully limited results see fig 1 day 132 and forward suggest that effluent ndma concentrations are relatively independent of ebct within the ranges and loads studied 3 1 3 discussion bac 1 and bac 2 biological activity reached a plateau on or about day 69 as evidenced by atp results presented in fig 3 the bac mechanisms for removing ndma are diverse and vary over the course of bac maturity initially ndma appeared to be removed primarily by carbon based mechanisms this is shown in results on day 19 for both bac 1 and bac 2 as time progressed particularly for the more heavily loaded bac 1 ndma became more prevalent in the bac 1 effluent both for concentration and percent removal in the context of this study the concentration of ndma in the bac 1 effluent peaked on day 104 and then reduced to very low concentrations for the remainder of the study day 482 the reduction in ndma levels in effluent up to day 104 is believed to result from deterioration of carbon based treatment mechanisms the subsequent increase in ndma removal could be from non carbon based treatment mechanisms previous studies have reported enhanced biodiversity of biomass on bac media over time sundaram et al 2009 zearley 2012 reported a similar phenomenon for the herbicide 2 4 d in a study of bac performance in a potable water treatment process though bac mitigates ndma generated during ozonation ndma concentrations in bac effluent are still higher than the ndma levels observed in potable sources 3 2 pfas among the pfas monitored only pfoa was consistently detected during each sampling event concentrations of pfoa in bac 1 and bac 2 effluents are shown in fig 4 the average concentration of pfoa influent to the ozone bac process was 26 6 ng l which is below the epa drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l usepa 2016 but above the california notification level of 5 1 ng l state of california 2019 pfoa concentrations were largely unchanged during ozonation even when the specific ozone doses were increased during the last two sampling events sun et al 2018 have also reported a similar trend of almost no pfoa removal during ozonation both bac 1 and bac 2 provided almost complete removal of pfoa during the first sampling event which was mainly driven by adsorption a carbon based mechanism the f 400 media used for this study was effective in providing carbon based treatment for pfoa ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 subsequently pfoa removals in bac 1 were less than in bac 2 presumably because of the reduced carbon based removal capacity biodegradation of pfoa does not appear to be a major removal mechanism comparing bac 1 and bac 2 results based on an equal number of bvs treated i e identical total pfoa and organic loads suggests that bac 2 retains more overall carbon based removal capacity than bac 1 whether it is on the carbon or on the biofilm that formed on the lightly loaded carbon bac 2 with higher ebct and reduced loading rate had lesser biological activity than bac 1 previous studies have reported benefits of pre ozonation including conversion of a wide range of refractory organics with longer carbon carbon chains into biodegradable compounds with smaller chains thereby reducing the risk of saturation of adsorption capacity with refractory materials simpson 2008 considering the pfoa and ndma results a 20 min ebct appears to be superior to a 10 min ebct for bac serving as a wide spectrum cec barrier because it allows for both longer term carbon based and non carbon based removal mechanisms results show that bac treatment with appropriate media adequate ebct and situation specific limits on bvs treated can provide reliable removal of pfoa bac 1 and bac 2 trends from this study agree with sun et al 2018 who reported that adsorption was found to be an effective treatment for pfoa additionally the f 400 media used in this study has been reported to be effective in providing adsorption based treatment for pfoa ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 however in this study pfoa removals in bac 1 were considerably less than in bac 2 presumably due to pore plugging that may have reduced the carbo based removal capacity ma et al 2018 the pfoa breakthrough observed in bac 1 is further analyzed based on a linearized thomas model several models have been developed and are used to evaluate and size adsorption processes the thomas model is one of these models it is used to analyze the removal of contaminants in fixed bed adsorption units xu et al 2013 patel 2019 thomas model calculations are shown in supplemental text the estimated bac 1 pfoa removal capacity is 5 14 10 7 kg kg based on an influent with 25 85 ng l of pfoa the average ozone effluent pfoa concentration and 121 kg of carbon the mass in bac 1 the estimated bac 2 removal capacity is 2 5 10 6 kg kg the estimated capacity is four orders of magnitude lower than the reported adsorption capacity of f 400 media in clean water experiments ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 this lower removal pfoa removal capacity in bac 1 and in bac 2 to a lesser extent may be attributed to very high levels of competitive adsorbates e g other contaminants and bulk organics that use the adsorption capacity higher surface loading and particulate initiated blinding and pore plugging due to biological growth the results of the final sampling event day 482 show an increase in pfoa concentration in the bac 1 effluent compared to advanced water treatment awt influents and ozonated effluents this anomalous result could be due to desorption of pfoa and or variabilities in laboratory analysis 3 3 cecs the water research foundation formerly watereuse research foundation published the framework of direct potable reuse tchobanoglous et al 2015 which lists various indicator cecs the cec levels were measured across ozonation bac 1 and bac 2 these results are shown in figs 5 7 a summary of cec concentrations after each treatment step is also presented in supplemental text table s3 although numerous cecs were monitored during this study many were not detected in the influent to the ozone bac process 3 3 1 cec removal during ozonation the efficiency of cec removal across ozonation is presented by days of operation and specific ozone dose in fig 5 during the first seven of nine sampling events i e through day 446 the specific ozone dose was maintained at 0 9 during the eighth event the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 and then to 2 0 for the ninth and final sampling event though chemicals such as peroxide were not added to generate hydroxyl radicals during ozonation i e advanced oxidation indirect formation of hydroxyl radicals is more prevalent in wastewater ozonation than drinking water ozonation because of higher concentrations of organic matter in the former buffle et al 2006 the study results provide three key insights 1 the fate of cecs during ozonation over an extended time i e 446 days of continuous operation with a specific ozone dose of 0 9 b the cause and effect relationship when the specific ozone dose is increased to 1 5 and 2 0 and c the categorization of cecs based on their reactivities with ozone and incidentally formed hydroxyl radicals three general categories of cecs as shown in figs 5 7 were identified based on their reactivity levels during ozonation 1 cecs that are readily oxidized 2 cecs that are marginally oxidized and 3 cecs that are oxidized proportionally with the ozone dose in this context increasing the specific ozone dose from 0 9 to 2 0 improved the removal of some cecs with the exception of flame retardants this relatively muted cec oxidation improvement may be attributed to most cecs being fully oxidized by a specific ozone dose of 0 9 and that some cecs are not amenable to oxidation at reasonable specific ozone doses such as flame retardants i e tcep tdcpp and tcpp additionally the ozonation influent may have contained compounds that scavenge ozone and or hydroxyl radicals such as nitrites and carbonates finally the type of pretreatment used before ozonation can affect cec oxidation in fact previous studies report greater cec removals when the pretreatment process uses either membrane filtration or non membrane filtration with chemical pretreatment rather than sand filtration without chemical pretreatment bourgin et al 2018 lee et al 2012 this is because membrane filters or granular media filters with chemical pretreatment reduce organic fractions that exert instantaneous ozone demand consequently more oxidant is available for cec oxidation the extended field testing and monitoring conducted in this study have confirmed that except for a few instances ozonation provides consistent removal of cecs that are amenable to oxidation increasing the specific ozone dose in this study increased the removal efficiencies of atenolol sulfamethoxazole deet and sucralose in a previous investigation sulfamethoxazole was completely eliminated during ozonation hollender et al 2009 hollender et al 2009 also attributed the removal of sucralose during ozonation to secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals which suggests incidental formation of hydroxyl radicals the results of this study show that organophosphate flame retardants e g tdcpp tcep and tcpp were marginally oxidized even when the specific ozone dose was increased to 2 0 these results were expected since these compounds tend to resist oxidation in summary the levels of cec removal during ozonation observed in this study confirm and validate the cec groupings and predictive model results published elsewhere blackbeard et al 2015 hollender et al 2009 sun et al 2018 3 3 2 cec abatement across bac 1 10 min ebct over 60 000 bvs treated the performance of bac 1 in removing cecs as a function of bvs treated is shown in fig 6 in previous bac studies cec removals were observed long after biofilter results showed bulk organics breakthrough indicating that the general carbon based organic removal capacity of the bac had been exhausted more importantly general increases in cec removals were reported over extended bac operation bourgin et al 2018 reungoat et al 2011 this study confirms this finding since both bac 1 and bac 2 were in continuous operation for over 482 days the study results challenge previous conclusions that biofiltration is often inconsequential in terms of long term cec removals except for ndma bacaro et al 2019 maidrand and ohlinger 2013 the following discussion focuses on ozone bac removal of two categories of cecs those that are oxidized proportionally to ozone dose e g atenolol sulfamethoxazole deet and sucralose and those that are marginally oxidized during ozonation e g organophosphate flame retardants bac effectively removed atenolol during the initial months of operation e g sampling events 1 and 2 presumably via carbon based removal mechanism for days 41 through 446 when the specific ozone dose was maintained at 0 9 the efficiency of atenolol removal across bac 1 reduced from 95 to 75 during sampling events 8 and 9 when the specific ozone doses were 1 5 and 2 0 respectively substantial amounts of atenolol were oxidized 89 and 100 respectively during ozonation since most of the atenolol was oxidized by ozonation little was left for removal by bac in this situation bac 1 served as a polishing step during the last two events which explains the decrease in the percent removal performance limited atenolol was available for treatment relative to the analytical laboratory s detection limits for atenolol hollender et al 2009 also reported increased atenolol removal with increased ozone doses while blackbeard et al 2015 reported almost no atenolol removal in a biofilter using sand media i e no carbon based removal capacity it is therefore likely that biodegradation of atenolol by bac is limited yet bac 1 continued to remove atenolol long after bac 1 s carbon based removal capacity for doc and pfoa seemed largely exhausted day 132 pfoa removal 13 atenolol removal 82 this observation underscores that the carbon based adsorptive capacity of bac is contaminant specific because of the extended field investigation considerable desorption of cecs such as sulfamethoxazole deet and sucralose from bac 1 a significant reliability concern was observed during the last three sampling events removal of sulfamethoxazole and deet in bac 1 followed a similar trend both cecs were removed by bac during the early days of operation presumably by adsorption with removal efficiencies slowly decreasing as the bvs treated increased in this study the potential significant desorption of these specific cecs was observed during the last three sampling events with specific ozone doses of 0 9 1 5 and 2 0 increasing the specific ozone dose led to increased sulfamethoxazole and deet removal across ozonation during the last two sampling events the concentration gradients across bac 1 for these cecs was therefore reduced thereby worsening the desorption mechanism past studies have noted a similar cec desorption phenomenon in bac when there is a change in concentration gradient bacaro et al 2019 reungoat et al 2011 sun et al 2018 however this does not explain the desorption observed during the seventh sampling event with the specific ozone dose of 0 9 although sucralose removal in bac 1 was similar to sulfamethoxazole and deet desorption of sucralose was only observed during the last sampling event when the specific ozone dose was increased to 2 0 a possible explanation for this observed desorption is that the concentration of sucralose in the bac influent decreased enough to trigger desorption when the efficiency of sucralose removal increased from 20 during sampling events 1 through 7 to 43 during the last event sampling event 9 tcep tdcpp and tcpp results show a decline in removal efficiencies through the first 132 days 19 059 bvs of operation which is attributed to carbon based removal of these flame retardants as shown in fig 5 a previous study that used the same f 400 media reported significant tcep and tcpp removals in bac sundaram et al 2014 researchers who have investigated cec removal in bac installed downstream of ozonation have postulated that cecs in ozonated water have fewer competitor compounds for adsorption sites because organic matter is transformed into smaller hydrophilic compounds with poor adsorbability but high biodegradability compared to non ozonated wastewater resulting in later breakthrough of cecs bourgin et al 2018 tcpp results from the last two sampling events show significant increases in removal efficiencies which could be attributed to reduced cec load to bac 1 with the increased ozone dose mechanisms increasing tcep removal at the end of testing could not be clearly inferred however biodegradation of tcep has been reported by other studies zhang et al 2017 3 3 3 cec removal across bac 2 20 min ebct over 30 000 bvs treated results show that cecs oxidized as a function of ozone dose as well as those marginally oxidized by ozone were fully removed by bac 2 even after 32 000 bvs reungoat et al 2012 compared cec removals in bacs operated at ebct of 9 min and 18 min they observed a clear increase in cec removal with increased ebct when normalized to an equal bv treated through each bac filter however the same study reported that increasing the ebct from 18 min to 45 min did not show any clear benefit comparing bac 2 results with cec removal data from previous reports it appears that carbon based removal was a dominant mechanism involved in bac 2 trends observed in bac 2 confirm the following conclusions from studies that investigated cec removal in bac 1 preozonation extends the cec adsorption life of bac sun et al 2018 2 bac has adsorption capacity for cecs even after the bed is exhausted for general wide spectrum adsorption of doc reungoat et al 2011 and 3 bac can be effective in removing cecs by adsorption even after 50 000 bvs treated bourgin et al 2018 ma et al 2018 have reported a similar phenomenon of higher cec removals when the bac loading rate was reduced by half in a drinking water treatment application a decrease in deet removal was observed during sampling event 8 once bac 2 had treated 31 981 bvs however deet was not detected in the bac 2 effluent during sampling event 9 comparing the bac 1 and bac 2 deet results biodegradation does not appear to be a dominant mechanism for deet removal in bac therefore the observed drop in deet removal efficiency in bac 2 during sampling event 8 could be due to variability in laboratory quantification 3 4 toc toc is considered a key indicator parameter for potable reuse projects this is because toc levels affect the production of chlorinated disinfection byproduct dbps when the purified water is subsequently treated with chlorine as a primary or secondary disinfectant in the drinking water distribution system marfil vega et al 2017 no single nationwide toc standard has been established for potable reuse projects in the united states at the time of publication however both florida and california have established a toc limit in their potable reuse regulation florida s toc limit is 3 mg l florida department of environmental protection 2010 while california s toc limit is 0 5 mg l state of california 2018a california also requires the use of ro or diluent water to meet this requirement concentrations of toc over time across bac 1 10 min ebct and bac 2 20 min ebct from this study are shown in fig 8 a results from a past ozone bac study in the reno area termed bac 3 with an ebct of 30 min are shown in fig 8b concentrations of toc as a function of bac 1 bac 2 and bac 3 bvs treated are shown in fig 9 both bac 1 and bac 2 were operated downstream of the stmwrf s secondary treatment average srt 10 days influent temperature 12 2 28 c continuous backwash sand filters and ozonation with a specific ozone dose of 0 9 except during the last month of operation when higher specific ozone doses of 1 5 and 2 0 were investigated bac 3 was operated downstream of the reno stead water reclamation facility average srt 15 days influent temperature range 12 8 23 3 c ultrafiltration and ozonation with a specific ozone dose of 0 8 secondary effluent toc is a function of biological treatment process type srt biomass concentration temperature food to microorganism ratio and other factors barker and stuckey 1999 bvs treated in bac 1 bac 2 and bac 3 over time are shown in fig 9 in figs 8a and 9 bac 1 appears to have an effluent toc concentration plateau of around 4 5 mg l compared to the influent toc of around 6 mg l from 200 to 400 days of operation after 450 days of operation corresponding to winter conditions the influent toc increased to around 8 mg l and the bac 1 effluent toc plateau increased to around 6 mg l these observations suggest that under these conditions the toc mass removal potential of bac 1 was being exceeded by the load therefore any load that exceeded the removal potential of bac 1 simply passed through similar phenomena were observed for bac 2 and bac 3 consequently the apparent toc mass removed rate kg d for all three bac units was calculated per cubic meter of carbon bed volume the results of these calculations are presented in fig 10 as shown bac 1 and bac 2 with sand filter pretreatment and ozonation appear to have a gross toc removal potential plateau of around 0 2 0 3 kg of toc removed per day per cubic meter of carbon media kg d m3 the water temperature and specific ozone dose may also have some impact bac 3 with ultrafiltration pretreatment has a lower toc removal rate plateau at around 0 1 kg d m3 presumably due to a lower toc load on the bac other potential causes for this lower plateau may be attributed to reduced pore plugging and availability of adsorption sites for toc removal i e lower levels of influent toc that are subject to removal by non carbon treatment mechanisms comparably 0 1 kg d m3 of doc removal is expected in drinking water biofilters with upstream ozonation with a specific ozone dose of 0 8 1 0 mwh 2005 a comparison of fig 8a bac 2 fig 8b bac 3 and fig 9 shows that both filters after start up having similar effluent toc concentrations in the 2 4 mg l range although the specific ozone dose and temperature both affect the toc concentrations the overall phenomenon appears to agree with the typical bac design and operation where effluent toc generally stays in the 2 4 mg l range this suggests that the lower plateau for effluent toc concentrations in typical bac filters is expected to be in the 2 4 mg l range and that a 30 min ebct as used for bac 3 is not needed reducing the required ebct from 30 min to 20 min in bac will lead to substantial cost savings for potable reuse projects bac toc plateaus in the 3 4 mg l range have been reported by others arnold et al 2018 water research foundation 2016 however cause and effect factors that affect the toc plateau in ozone bac systems have not been explored elsewhere since the ozone bac effluent toc plateau concentration is a function of process design it can be designed to be in the 3 4 mg l range required by some regulatory agencies without supplemental treatment the authors propose using a toc mass removal rate per unit volume of carbon or a specific toc mass removal rate for bac sizing purposes this approach accounts for both volume of bac media and influent toc mass loading and has been used in the design of drinking water bac biofilters mwh 2005 these are important steps towards technology implementation the toc mass removal rates observed in bac 1 and bac 2 with upstream sand filter were significantly higher than the rates observed in bac 3 with upstream membrane filter after 13 000 bvs the bac 3 toc mass removal rate was in the range of 0 08 0 13 kg d m3 with is significantly lower than the 0 2 0 3 kg d m3 observed in bac 1 and bac 2 the influent toc to bac is expected to have a direct impact on the mass of toc removed and the specific toc mass removal rate the average influent toc to bac 3 was 5 9 mg l which was substantially lower than the bac 1 and bac 2 influent toc of 7 5 mg l however the bac 3 trendline shown in fig 9 indicates a steady decrease in toc removal rate over time with a steeper slope than bac 1 and 2 indicating that toc removal in bac 3 could be resulting predominantly from carbon based mechanisms the authors postulate that a substantial amount of microbiology must be present in the bac to achieve its full non carbon based toc removal rate once the carbon based removal capacity is largely exhausted and pore plugging has occurred due to biological growth for example atp levels in heavily loaded bac 1 are about four times higher than lightly loaded bac 2 bac 3 appears to have been so lightly loaded with biodegradable substrate that it never achieved its full non carbon based toc removal rate however pore plugging from biological growth is also expected to be significantly lower in bac 3 compared to bac 2 which increases the competition for toc from available adsorption sites with significant carbon based toc removal in bac 3 the biology needed to maximize non carbon based toc removal never developed it is important to consider the differences in pretreatment pore plugging and the limitations of biofilters with regards to toc removal biofilters are relatively high rate filtration and biodegradation treatment processes that therefore have finite filtration and biodegradation capacities based on design and loading rate the important point regarding toc removal is that toc biodegradation continues long after bac carbon based removal capacity is largely exhausted and that upstream treatment steps have a significant impact on biofilter performance 3 5 suva specific uv absorbance suva is calculated based on uv absorbance and doc of the water and occasionally based on toc of the water though doc based suva analysis is more common toc based suva has advantages because it can be measured real time and therefore be utilized for operations and control doc based and toc based suva data for influent ozone effluent and bac 1 and bac 2 effluents are shown in fig 11 a bac 1 and 11 b bac 2 suva is considered to be an indicator of aromatic carbon content recalcitrance in water and is well correlated to dbp yields zearley 2012 results show that suva reduction was achieved either by increasing the specific ozone dose or by increasing the bac ebct the bac 1 effluent suva trend reveals considerable reduction in suva and aromatic compounds during the initial days of operation potentially due to carbon based removal mechanisms the transition of bac 1 operation to non carbon based removal resulted in almost negligible suva removal which coincided with the improved ndma removals presented in figs 1 and 2 tracking and monitoring a bac s influent and effluent suva could potentially be used as an operational indicator of bac performance in terms of ndma removal additional investigation is warranted to further test and validate this strategy more pronounced and sustained suva reduction was observed in bac 2 compared to bac 1 comparing bac 2 and bac 1 suva data over the study duration it is evident that bac 2 was potentially influenced by both carbon and non carbon removal mechanisms while bac 1 was dominated by non carbon based removal mechanisms a comparison of doc based and toc based suva trends shows that toc based suva could potentially be used as a critical control parameter by operators and regulators of potable reuse projects these data could be measured in real time via online analyzers 3 6 implications of study findings for commercial implementation studies and investigations conducted so far have identified four key hurdles for ozone biofiltration based potable reuse solutions 1 ndma formation 2 inability to remove cecs such as pfas and flame retardants 3 bromate formation and 4 meeting effluent toc requirements findings from this study confirm that acclimation time is required for non carbon based removal of ndma in bac biofiltration bromate formation during this study was 50 lower than the primary drinking water maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 ppb in specific potable reuse situations where bromate is problematic mitigation strategies such as peroxide and or ammonia addition have been developed sundaram and emerick 2010 this study has developed a deeper understanding of ozone bac performance in terms of toc removal and design based effluent toc plateaus reducing the bac ebct while achieving project goals and objectives has a direct and significant impact on lifecycle costs of these treatment processes plumlee et al 2014 the results of this study show that an ebct of 20 min appears to be sufficient for cec removal cec and toc removal across bac and gac systems can be further optimized by having a bac for toc removal followed by a gac for additional cec and toc removal as needed an ozone bac based non ro awt train is shown in fig 12 if salt removal is needed a side stream ro process should be considered as an alternative to full stream ro treatment almost all treatment steps along with uv disinfection should be considered for pathogen inactivation collectively concerns related to ozone bac based potable reuse solutions have either been addressed or resolved via mitigation measures the authors believe that these optimization efforts make ozone bac based solutions more economical for implementation in communities around the globe particularly for inland communities a paradigm shift is needed when considering potable water resource management and planning the cost of ozone bac should be compared to either the cost of developing other water supply alternatives or to the estimated damages resulting from not having a reliable potable water supply during a protracted drought a recent case study on sustainable water management planning in reno has shown that potable reuse solutions based on ozone bac would provide multiple benefits to the community haak et al 2018 the use of ozone bac in potable reuse applications has been gaining momentum in recent years information available from this study augments the ozone bac body of knowledge for full scale implementation 4 conclusions presence of ndma is a limitation of ozone biofiltration technology evidence of ndma removal across bac during transition period i e conversion of gac to bac was captured an acclimation period of 140 days or 20 000 bed volumes was observed in heavily loaded bac bac 1 this period is much longer than acclimation times needed for readily biodegradable organics findings from this study show the interactions between carbon based and non carbon based mechanisms involved in the removal of ndma and thereby directly address the perceived limitations pfoa removal across bac appears to be heavily influenced by carbon based removal mechanisms study results indicate that ozonation upstream of bac along with longer ebct extends bac bed life for pfoa removal lightly loaded bac with longer ebct bac 2 contained lower biomass density and demonstrated higher pfoa removal capacity than heavily loaded bac with shorter ebct bac 1 increasing the specific ozone dose resulted in muted improvement in oxidation of cecs that are resistive to ozonation higher ebct yielded higher overall cec removals while lower ebct resulted in significant desorption of sulfamethoxazole and deet most of the reductions across bac are believed to be from carbon based treatment mechanisms therefore higher ebct is required when ozone bac is used as the primary cec treatment barrier potable reuse bac specific toc mass removal rate reached a plateau over time and it was higher than values observed in drinking water bac systems bac units with an upstream sand filter have significantly higher specific toc mass removal rates compared to bac units with an upstream membrane filter suva i e organic aromaticity was decreased by higher specific ozone dose and or longer bac ebct toc based suva appeared to be comparable to doc based suva therefore toc based suva is proposed for real time ozone bac performance monitoring and gac to bac transition monitoring operators can implement the proposed tool using online toc and uva analyzers funding this work was supported by the water research foundation wrf reuse 15 10 project entitled optimization of ozone bac treatment processes for

18170,recovering and reusing treated wastewater effluent is a sustainable and cost effective practice for addressing global water sustainability to date most potable reuse advanced water treatment awt solutions are based on reverse osmosis ro which generates a continuous reject stream of concentrated brine waste ozone biofiltration based solutions have been investigated as a potential alternative for ro however implementation of ozone biofiltration for potable reuse projects around the world has been limited the goal of this study was to conduct an extended field investigation of ozone biofiltration treatment to address regulatory design and operational hurdles that may hinder implementation in water short areas for 16 months two parallel biological activated carbon bac filters were operated at empty bed contact times ebcts of 10 min and 20 min treating up to 60 000 and 30 000 bed volumes bvs respectively of sand filtered effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment process bac 1 ebct 10 min and bac 2 ebct 20 min used calgon filtrasorb 400 granular activated carbon gac as filter media with equal bed depths of 0 8 m increasing the specific ozone dose from 0 9 to 2 0 provided a muted response with respect to oxidation of contaminants of emerging concern cecs that are resistive to ozonation n nitrosodimethylamine ndma was generated during ozonation with the average concentration of ndma in ozonated effluent being 40 4 ng l in bac 1 ebct 10 min ndma was fully removed during the first month of study 2000 bvs partially removed between 2000 and 20 000 bvs and completely removed when monitored between 57 000 and 62 000 bvs these trends clearly reveal time dependent interactions between carbon based e g adsorption and non carbon based e g biodegradation removal mechanisms in bac 2 ebct 20 min almost all cecs excluding ndma were removed consistently throughout the study through 30 000 bvs this indicates a somewhat different interaction between carbon based and non carbon based removal in the more lightly loaded bac 2 compared to bac 1 after 482 days of operation bac 1 ebct 10 min produced effluent with lower ndma concentration 2 ng l than bac 2 10 ng l confirming prior evidence of cometabolic ndma biodegradation pathways operable in more heavily loaded bacs these findings emphasize the need for extended field testing 50 000 bvs or greater bac 1 removed toc in effluent until it plateaued at around 6 mg l after 60 000 bvs whereas bac 2 effluent plateaued at around 4 mg l under plateau conditions bac 1 and bac 2 with sand filter pretreatment and ozonation appear to have a gross toc removal potential of around 0 2 0 3 kg of toc removed per day per cubic meter of carbon media kg d m3 a comparative analysis of findings from this study and results from a past ozone bac study in the reno area termed bac 3 operated downstream of membrane filter with an ebct of 30 min shows that higher toc removal was observed in bac with shorter ebct and upstream sand filter compared to bac with longer ebct and upstream membrane filter the present study addresses the regulatory and financial concerns associated with ozone bac performance in potable reuse applications improved comprehension of ozone bac performance coupled with its reduced capital and operations and maintenance o m costs compared to ro may accelerate the full scale implementation of ozone bac treatment as a sustainable solution for the rapidly emerging potable reuse market graphical abstract image 1 keywords potable reuse trace organics ozonation biofiltration biological activated carbon contaminants of emerging concern 1 introduction a shortage of clean affordable water is a growing threat to many people and societies around the world according to the united nations un world s cities report global water demand is expected to increase by 50 by 2030 which is greater than the anticipated increase in demand for energy un habitat 2016 communities are rethinking their current drinking water wastewater and stormwater management paradigm to achieve water sustainability resilience and water security recovering and reusing treated wastewater effluent i e water reuse is one of the key strategies for meeting future water demand and water management needs the water reuse roadmap wef 2018 lists potential benefits of water reuse which include but are not limited to a reliable new water source enhanced resiliency and water security control of seawater intrusion and land subsidence and preservation of pristine water sources and their ecologies these benefits if realized will have a significant positive impact on global water sustainability water reuse takes many forms including agricultural irrigation landscape irrigation cooling water industrial process water etc all these forms require the construction and maintenance of a dedicated non potable distribution system such as purple pipe however with advances in wastewater treatment reuse of potable water or potable reuse is now possible this is the highest beneficial use of water and would not necessitate the construction and maintenance of a purple pipe distribution system potable reuse has several advantages over non potable reuse including 1 no purple pipe system to build 2 no risk of cross connection between a purple pipe system and a potable water distribution system 3 possibility of using effluent year round thereby eliminating seasonal storage and retreatment needs and 4 potential long term environmental benefits such as water banking preservation of aquatic ecologies control of seawater intrusion and or land subsidence etc when it comes to implementing potable reuse projects studies have shown that public and regulatory communities are concerned about pathogens regulated drinking water contaminants contaminants of emerging concern cecs which include pharmaceuticals personal care products flame retardants hormones etc and reliability wef 2018 most potable reuse technologies currently rely on reverse osmosis ro an expensive process that primarily removes salt by filtering out almost all organic and inorganic contaminants from water two key elements drive the higher cost of ro the cost to build and operate the ro facility and ancillary equipment and the cost to dispose of ro reject or brine waste which represents about 15 20 of the process flow for coastal communities brine waste may be discharged to the ocean at a low cost however for inland communities brine disposal may be as costly as the ro process itself because many potable reuse projects need little to no salt removal ro may not be necessary if alternative reliable more cost effective means are developed to remove pathogens drinking water contaminants and cecs ozone biofiltration and ancillary processes has now been shown to be as effective as ro in potable reuse project applications and at a much lower cost particularly for inland communities with brine disposal concerns sundaram et al 2014 however regulatory barriers currently hinder widespread use of non ro solutions for potable reuse projects for example the state of california has effectively mandated the use of ro treatment for subsurface application injection well of groundwater augmentation projects state of california 2018a consequently in california several ro based injection well groundwater augmentation projects are either planned or implemented in coastal communities but no injection well projects are planned for inland communities without access to oceanic brine disposal facilities watereuse 2019 in 2017 63 of the global population lived inland united nations 2017 development and implementation of non ro based solutions for inland potable reuse could reshape urban water cycles globally for example during california s 2015 drought some smaller inland communities e g east porterville faced serious potable water shortages that would have been reduced if potable reuse facilities were affordable greene 2018 swain 2015 for inland communities potable reuse treatment using ozone biofiltration appears to be the best apparent alternative because compared to ro capital costs are lower about 33 of ro and energy requirements are lower 25 of ro additionally since ozone biofiltration does not produce brine this non ro process helps conserve nearly 20 of the influent water lee et al 2012 sundaram et al 2014 past ozone biofiltration investigations have addressed several questions related to ozone biofiltration performance in terms of removing bulk organics arnold et al 2018 reaume et al 2015 reungoat et al 2012 ozonation byproducts bacaro et al 2019 sundaram et al 2014 and cecs bourgin et al 2018 blackbeard et al 2015 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2012 maidrand and ohlinger 2013 reungoat et al 2012 sundaram and emerick 2010 with regards to ozone biofiltration design and operational parameters several studies have explored the role of preozonation bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2012 biofilter media types reaume et al 2015 sun et al 2018 and biofilter empty bed contact time ebct arnold et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 reungoat et al 2011 however a comprehensive literature review conducted by the authors shows that most full scale wastewater ozone biofiltration facilities are not designed based on recently identified potable reuse project goals related to cecs a summary of full scale ozone biofiltration facilities is presented in table 1 the literature review also shows that several pilot scale and demonstration scale ozone biofiltration investigations were terminated early with relatively low throughput i e less than 15 000 bed volumes bvs treated and that there were still outstanding ozone biofiltration performance questions about cause and effect of design parameters such as upstream treatment steps bvs treated may not be critical for biofilters with granular media e g sand anthracite because transition from gac to bac is mainly a function of volume treated bvs treated are critical for biofilters with gac media bvs treated provide insights into how far along a bed with virgin gac media has transitioned into a bac for example ozone biofiltration performance investigations were terminated after less than 14 000 bvs of operation which is too short to quantify long term effects or without reporting the bvs treated arnold et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 reaume et al 2015 sundaram et al 2014 however one study of longer duration 60 000 bvs reported cec removals even after two years of operation and more than 50 000 bvs of flow bourgin et al 2018 water use and reuse practitioners have used various types and configurations of biofiltration to achieve different goals relevant to potable water production biofilters are used as 1 a cec barrier to remove a wide range of chemicals 2 a membrane pretreatment step to improve membrane flux 3 an ndma barrier and 4 a step to remove other readily biodegradable ozonation byproducts such as aldehydes and glyoxals however no clear guidelines currently exist for determining design and operational parameters based on potable reuse project specific goals and regulations biofilter media type and upstream treatment steps could have a significant impact on biofilter performance secondary effluent quality e g toc can impact ozone demand level of organics present in secondary effluent which are made up of soluble microbial products recalcitrant organics and residual organic particulates depend on the type of biological treatment and to a certain extent the solids retention time srt of the treatment process barker and stuckey 1999 clara et al 2005 ozone biofiltration performance may be different if the influent water undergoes ultrafiltration rather than sand filtration past investigations indicate that toc removal across biofilters is influenced by the upstream filtration process bourgin et al 2018 lee et al 2012 reungoat et al 2012 sundaram et al 2014 however the relationship between the nature of the upstream treatment e g filter pore size and the biofilter s performance e g with regards to toc removal and fate of cecs such as ndma and flame retardants through the biofilters after extended operation have not been reported elsewhere results from existing ozone biofiltration design and operational practices are ambiguous regarding ozone biofiltration performance reliability and capital and o m costs demonstrating efficacy meeting regulatory requirements lack of familiarity to wastewater operators and ambiguity related to capital and o m costs of ozone biofiltration are all challenges that add a significant burden for communities that are considering ozone bac i e ozonation followed by biofiltration in which the filter medium is granular activated carbon gac for their potable reuse projects the potential of ozone biofiltration and other non ro technologies has therefore not been fully tapped and the technology has not yet been accepted for widespread worldwide implementation when considering the range of ozone biofiltration technologies i e biofilters with sand anthracite gac etc as media ozone bac shows the greatest potential for near term implementation for potable reuse projects from review of previous wastewater ozone bac studies by the project team and by others the specific ozone dose is in the range of 0 8 2 bac ebct is in the range of 10 20 min transition from gac to bac in terms of biomass development is about 70 days and biodiversity develops over a substantial period of time arnold et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2012 reungoat et al 2011 sundaram et al 2014 sundaram and emerick 2010 based on the foregoing literature chemical indicators for assessing ozone bac performance and process control include ndma pfas cecs such as tcep tcpp and tdcpp toc and suva ozone bac process reliability in terms of contaminant removal over time is of great importance to the potable reuse regulatory community field verification of ozone bac performance from startup to achieving steady state based on real time tools is necessary for regulatory approval and operational protocols consequently this study involved 19 months of continuous field scale demonstration of two ozone bac systems with different ebcts at an operating water resource recovery facility wrrf with observations of removal of a range of contaminants this experimental design and associated results of two parallel identical biofilters including same media type and bed depth operated continuously under different ebcts and loading rates for the extended period is believed to be unique focus of the study was to develop deeper understanding of process reliability in terms of cec removal when ozone bac is utilized as a primary cec barrier within the potable reuse awt train therefore ozone bac process reliability in terms of contaminant removal was evaluated over an extended period 473 days of continuous operation processing real world filtered secondary effluent while all ozone bac process variables were maintained constant specifically findings from this effort are aimed to fill the gap in the literature regarding transition of gac to bac in potable reuse applications as an example ndma is one of the biodegradable cecs this investigation reports on acclimation time required for ndma removal in bac potential operational strategies such as suva for verifying field performance and reliability of ozone and bac systems were evaluated emphasis was given to parameters such as toc and uvt that can be measured using continuous online analyzers finally this study adds to the body of literature regarding toc removal across ozone bac systems in potable reuse applications and the impact of upstream treatment on toc removal with a future goal of developing potable reuse ozone bac design guidelines 2 materials and methods 2 1 field testing of ozone bac

includes nitrification denitrification secondary biological process average srt 10 days followed by a continuous backwash sand filtration system provided by dynasand parkson corporation fort lauderdale florida usa during the test period the effluent from the sand filter served as the influent to the ozone bac pilot system at a constant flow rate 2 2 ozone bac pilot system approximately 71 m3 d 13 gpm of stmwrf sand filtered effluent was conveyed to an oxelia ozone bac system provided by xylem rye brook new york usa pictures of the pilot system taken during testing are included in the supplemental text figs s1 and s2 ozone was generated on site by an air operated ozone generator wedeco rye brook new york usa equipped with an oxygen concentrator and chiller the influent toc to pilot system was monitored continuously with a toc analyzer ysi rye brook new york usa during field testing the specific ozone dose i e ratio of ozone dose mg l to influent toc mg l was maintained at the desired value by an automated process control system this mode of operation resulted in a consistent specific ozone dose being delivered to the ozone bac process day to day and season to season field performance testing was conducted at a specific ozone dose of 0 9 during the last two months of operation the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 and then to 2 0 after injecting ozone in the liquid stream ozonated water was conveyed to two stainless steel ozone contactors then to the ozonated effluent tank the pilot system was equipped with two identical parallel gravity fed bac filters referred to as bac 1 and bac 2 each filter contained a 0 8 m deep bed of filtrasorb 400 f 400 calgon corporation pittsburgh pennsylvania usa gac media the bed depth chosen for this study was close to the minimum bed depth recommended by the gac manufacturer this media type and bed depth were maintained in both bac 1 and bac 2 throughout the test period each bac received ozonated effluent from the break tank at a constant rate via its feed pump the bac 1 flow was 44 m3 d 8 gpm whereas the bac 2 flow was 22 m3 d 4 gpm half of bac 1 s loading rate these flow rates resulted in an ebct of 10 min in bac 1 and 20 min in bac 2 thus bac 1 operated under twice the hydraulic loading rate and contaminant loading rate of bac 2 head loss across each bac bed was monitored continuously bac 1 was backwashed approximately every 36 h while bac 2 was backwashed weekly with regards to biomass control the trigger for backwashing both bac 1 and bac 2 was based on a preventative maintenance approach geared towards avoiding excessive accumulation of solids and or biological growth the backwash procedure was the same for both biofilters which starts with an air scour followed by a low flow rate water backwash then ramped up to a high flow rate backwash and ending with a low flow rate water backwash the pilot system was equipped with several online analyzers and instrumentation a detailed summary of monitors and instrumentation is provided in the supplemental text table s1 2 3 operational sampling and monitoring summary to evaluate the long term reliability of ozone bac operation and to determine the impact of ebct on bac performance the specific ozone dose and ebct were maintained for over 450 days operational details including temperature and ph ranges are included in supplemental text table s2 water quality parameters such as toc ph temperature and ammonia were quantified for process monitoring using standard methods apha 2017 dissolved ozone residual was quantified with the online monitor and verified by hach ampules hach loveland colorado usa bromide and bromate were quantified using epa method 300 0 usepa 1993 and epa method 317 usepa 2001 respectively nine sampling events were conducted after a backwash to quantify levels of ndma cecs per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas toc and other water quality parameters supplemental text table s3 presents a detailed analyte list along with details of the analytical methods used the first seven sampling events occurred when the specific ozone dose was maintained at 0 9 and bac ebcts were maintained at 10 min and 20 min for bac 1 and bac 2 respectively bac ebcts remained the same throughout the study the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 leading up to the eighth sampling event and then increased to 2 0 leading up to the ninth and final sampling event with regards to frequency of sample collection initial samples i e first 6 of 9 samples were taken within 142 days with the goal of capturing gac to bac transition until steady state was reached seventh sample at 450 days was collected to assess long term reliability the final two samples were collected to investigate the effect of higher specific ozone dose the intermediate period between sixth and seventh sampling events was considered as a steady state operational period 2 4 targeted contaminant quantification after each treatment process sampled cecs were quantified either by american water belleville illinois usa with a method developed in house or by eurofins eaton analytical laboratory monrovia california usa the methodology employed by american water included analytes preconcentration by solid phase extraction followed by quantitation by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight lc qtof eurofins eaton analytical laboratory utilized a fully automated method based on online solid phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography hplc mass spectrometry mass spectrometry spe lc ms ms according to eea 9609 method oppenheimer et al 2011 ndma was quantified utilizing a modified version of epa method 521 usepa 2004 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa were quantified utilizing epa method 537 usepa 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndma ndma was measured in ozone bac process influent after ozonation and after biofiltration in bac 1 10 min ebct and bac 2 20 min ebct results over time are shown in fig 1 while the percentage of ndma removal post ozonation in bac 1 and bac 2 as a function of bvs treated is shown in fig 2 formation of ndma during ozonation and removal of ndma across biofilters were observed in the past hollender et al 2009 and was confirmed by this research ndma was consistently formed during ozonation the average concentration of ndma in ozonated effluent was 40 4 15 1 ng l with a maximum of 80 ng l in the fifth sampling event day 104 this elevated ndma concentration may have been caused by increased concentrations of precursors in the influent such as secondary tertiary or quaternary amines with at least one dimethylamine dma functional group certain pharmaceuticals personal care products herbicides and water treatment polymers roback et al 2019 other studies have observed elevated ndma formation during ozonation as a function of precursor concentrations but not of ozone dose bacaro et al 2019 hollender et al 2009 however the formation of ndma does not appear to be significantly affected by the ozone dose when precursors are limited as evidenced by the results of this study when the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 then 2 0 during the last two sampling events see fig 1 3 1 1 ndma removal in bac 1 10 min ebct over 60 000 bvs process operation three distinct phases were observed for ndma removal across bac 1 the first phase was a steady initial decrease in ndma removal over the first 70 days of operation 10 000 bvs treated potentially dominated by carbon based mechanisms the second phase is a transition state from 70 to 140 days of operation i e between 10 000 and 20 000 bvs influenced by both carbon and non carbon based mechanisms such as biodegradation sorption to biofilm and others the third phase 140 days or 20 000 bvs was dominated by non carbon based mechanisms leading to the nearly complete removal of ndma these three phases are shown in fig 2 several researchers have reported ndma removals in biofilters bacaro et al 2019 hollender et al 2009 sundaram et al 2014 sun et al 2018 and have postulated that a cometabolic pathway involving monooxygenase enzymes could be responsible for ndma biodegradation hatzinger et al 2017 however few studies have reported a material increase in ndma removal over time which confirms the importance of biofilter acclimation time relative to biofilter performance sun et al 2018 trussell et al 2018 bourgin et al 2018 reported an 83 ndma removal across virgin gac with upstream ozonation a past study in the reno area using virgin f 400 gac biofilter media reported the complete removal of ndma through treatment of 13 000 bvs sundaram et al 2014 fleming et al 1996 conducted ndma bench scale and adsorption column studies using bituminous coal based f 400 coconut shell and carbonaceous resin based media they reported f 400 s ndma adsorption capacity at liquid concentration of 50 ng l closer to the average ozone effluent ndma concentration of 40 4 ng l in this study to be around 5 10 6 kg kg and f 400 was found to have the lowest adsorption capacity among the media tested bacaro et al 2019 reported a maximum 90 removal of ndma in both bac and an anthracite biofilter when 10 min or higher ebct was maintained it can therefore be assumed that ndma removal across bac biofilters involves both carbon based and non carbon based mechanisms however how these mechanisms interact over time is poorly understood which is just one of the current challenges to ozone bac implementation ndma results from this study clearly show a transition between carbon based and non carbon based mechanisms during the test duration and an acclimation time of around 140 days 20 000 bvs which underscores the benefit of performing extended field testing a much shorter acclimation time around 55 days was observed for ethyl glyoxal in a previous potable reuse ozone bac study sundaram and emerick 2010 zearley 2012 reported a similar removal trend for 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d in drinking water biofilters and attributed the phenomena to biodegradation that occurred with longer acclimation time if this study had terminated after 120 days of operation 17 300 bvs the conclusion on ndma removal in bac 1 would have been completely different analyzing the results of ndma removal in bac 1 in light of observations made by previous studies bacaro et al 2019 confirms that an ebct of 10 min could be a suitable for ndma removal 3 1 2 ndma removal in bac 2 20 min ebct over 30 000 bvs treated bac 2 was operated at twice the ebct of bac 1 and therefore had half the hydraulic and contaminant loads compared to bac 1 the carbon based removal capacity of bac 2 should have been available for a longer period of time than bac 1 because of the lower ndma loading rate and the reduced organic loading rate and associated reduced biofouling plugging of adsorption sites trends shown in figs 1 and 2 illustrate that ndma removal mechanisms in bac 2 over time were not as distinctive as bac 1 ndma removal in bac 2 was consistently better than in bac 1 during the initial phase of operation when carbon based mechanisms were more prevalent over time as non carbon based mechanisms e g biodegradation developed fully limited results see fig 1 day 132 and forward suggest that effluent ndma concentrations are relatively independent of ebct within the ranges and loads studied 3 1 3 discussion bac 1 and bac 2 biological activity reached a plateau on or about day 69 as evidenced by atp results presented in fig 3 the bac mechanisms for removing ndma are diverse and vary over the course of bac maturity initially ndma appeared to be removed primarily by carbon based mechanisms this is shown in results on day 19 for both bac 1 and bac 2 as time progressed particularly for the more heavily loaded bac 1 ndma became more prevalent in the bac 1 effluent both for concentration and percent removal in the context of this study the concentration of ndma in the bac 1 effluent peaked on day 104 and then reduced to very low concentrations for the remainder of the study day 482 the reduction in ndma levels in effluent up to day 104 is believed to result from deterioration of carbon based treatment mechanisms the subsequent increase in ndma removal could be from non carbon based treatment mechanisms previous studies have reported enhanced biodiversity of biomass on bac media over time sundaram et al 2009 zearley 2012 reported a similar phenomenon for the herbicide 2 4 d in a study of bac performance in a potable water treatment process though bac mitigates ndma generated during ozonation ndma concentrations in bac effluent are still higher than the ndma levels observed in potable sources 3 2 pfas among the pfas monitored only pfoa was consistently detected during each sampling event concentrations of pfoa in bac 1 and bac 2 effluents are shown in fig 4 the average concentration of pfoa influent to the ozone bac process was 26 6 ng l which is below the epa drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l usepa 2016 but above the california notification level of 5 1 ng l state of california 2019 pfoa concentrations were largely unchanged during ozonation even when the specific ozone doses were increased during the last two sampling events sun et al 2018 have also reported a similar trend of almost no pfoa removal during ozonation both bac 1 and bac 2 provided almost complete removal of pfoa during the first sampling event which was mainly driven by adsorption a carbon based mechanism the f 400 media used for this study was effective in providing carbon based treatment for pfoa ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 subsequently pfoa removals in bac 1 were less than in bac 2 presumably because of the reduced carbon based removal capacity biodegradation of pfoa does not appear to be a major removal mechanism comparing bac 1 and bac 2 results based on an equal number of bvs treated i e identical total pfoa and organic loads suggests that bac 2 retains more overall carbon based removal capacity than bac 1 whether it is on the carbon or on the biofilm that formed on the lightly loaded carbon bac 2 with higher ebct and reduced loading rate had lesser biological activity than bac 1 previous studies have reported benefits of pre ozonation including conversion of a wide range of refractory organics with longer carbon carbon chains into biodegradable compounds with smaller chains thereby reducing the risk of saturation of adsorption capacity with refractory materials simpson 2008 considering the pfoa and ndma results a 20 min ebct appears to be superior to a 10 min ebct for bac serving as a wide spectrum cec barrier because it allows for both longer term carbon based and non carbon based removal mechanisms results show that bac treatment with appropriate media adequate ebct and situation specific limits on bvs treated can provide reliable removal of pfoa bac 1 and bac 2 trends from this study agree with sun et al 2018 who reported that adsorption was found to be an effective treatment for pfoa additionally the f 400 media used in this study has been reported to be effective in providing adsorption based treatment for pfoa ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 however in this study pfoa removals in bac 1 were considerably less than in bac 2 presumably due to pore plugging that may have reduced the carbo based removal capacity ma et al 2018 the pfoa breakthrough observed in bac 1 is further analyzed based on a linearized thomas model several models have been developed and are used to evaluate and size adsorption processes the thomas model is one of these models it is used to analyze the removal of contaminants in fixed bed adsorption units xu et al 2013 patel 2019 thomas model calculations are shown in supplemental text the estimated bac 1 pfoa removal capacity is 5 14 10 7 kg kg based on an influent with 25 85 ng l of pfoa the average ozone effluent pfoa concentration and 121 kg of carbon the mass in bac 1 the estimated bac 2 removal capacity is 2 5 10 6 kg kg the estimated capacity is four orders of magnitude lower than the reported adsorption capacity of f 400 media in clean water experiments ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 this lower removal pfoa removal capacity in bac 1 and in bac 2 to a lesser extent may be attributed to very high levels of competitive adsorbates e g other contaminants and bulk organics that use the adsorption capacity higher surface loading and particulate initiated blinding and pore plugging due to biological growth the results of the final sampling event day 482 show an increase in pfoa concentration in the bac 1 effluent compared to advanced water treatment awt influents and ozonated effluents this anomalous result could be due to desorption of pfoa and or variabilities in laboratory analysis 3 3 cecs the water research foundation formerly watereuse research foundation published the framework of direct potable reuse tchobanoglous et al 2015 which lists various indicator cecs the cec levels were measured across ozonation bac 1 and bac 2 these results are shown in figs 5 7 a summary of cec concentrations after each treatment step is also presented in supplemental text table s3 although numerous cecs were monitored during this study many were not detected in the influent to the ozone bac process 3 3 1 cec removal during ozonation the efficiency of cec removal across ozonation is presented by days of operation and specific ozone dose in fig 5 during the first seven of nine sampling events i e through day 446 the specific ozone dose was maintained at 0 9 during the eighth event the specific ozone dose was increased to 1 5 and then to 2 0 for the ninth and final sampling event though chemicals such as peroxide were not added to generate hydroxyl radicals during ozonation i e advanced oxidation indirect formation of hydroxyl radicals is more prevalent in wastewater ozonation than drinking water ozonation because of higher concentrations of organic matter in the former buffle et al 2006 the study results provide three key insights 1 the fate of cecs during ozonation over an extended time i e 446 days of continuous operation with a specific ozone dose of 0 9 b the cause and effect relationship when the specific ozone dose is increased to 1 5 and 2 0 and c the categorization of cecs based on their reactivities with ozone and incidentally formed hydroxyl radicals three general categories of cecs as shown in figs 5 7 were identified based on their reactivity levels during ozonation 1 cecs that are readily oxidized 2 cecs that are marginally oxidized and 3 cecs that are oxidized proportionally with the ozone dose in this context increasing the specific ozone dose from 0 9 to 2 0 improved the removal of some cecs with the exception of flame retardants this relatively muted cec oxidation improvement may be attributed to most cecs being fully oxidized by a specific ozone dose of 0 9 and that some cecs are not amenable to oxidation at reasonable specific ozone doses such as flame retardants i e tcep tdcpp and tcpp additionally the ozonation influent may have contained compounds that scavenge ozone and or hydroxyl radicals such as nitrites and carbonates finally the type of pretreatment used before ozonation can affect cec oxidation in fact previous studies report greater cec removals when the pretreatment process uses either membrane filtration or non membrane filtration with chemical pretreatment rather than sand filtration without chemical pretreatment bourgin et al 2018 lee et al 2012 this is because membrane filters or granular media filters with chemical pretreatment reduce organic fractions that exert instantaneous ozone demand consequently more oxidant is available for cec oxidation the extended field testing and monitoring conducted in this study have confirmed that except for a few instances ozonation provides consistent removal of cecs that are amenable to oxidation increasing the specific ozone dose in this study increased the removal efficiencies of atenolol sulfamethoxazole deet and sucralose in a previous investigation sulfamethoxazole was completely eliminated during ozonation hollender et al 2009 hollender et al 2009 also attributed the removal of sucralose during ozonation to secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals which suggests incidental formation of hydroxyl radicals the results of this study show that organophosphate flame retardants e g tdcpp tcep and tcpp were marginally oxidized even when the specific ozone dose was increased to 2 0 these results were expected since these compounds tend to resist oxidation in summary the levels of cec removal during ozonation observed in this study confirm and validate the cec groupings and predictive model results published elsewhere blackbeard et al 2015 hollender et al 2009 sun et al 2018 3 3 2 cec abatement across bac 1 10 min ebct over 60 000 bvs treated the performance of bac 1 in removing cecs as a function of bvs treated is shown in fig 6 in previous bac studies cec removals were observed long after biofilter results showed bulk organics breakthrough indicating that the general carbon based organic removal capacity of the bac had been exhausted more importantly general increases in cec removals were reported over extended bac operation bourgin et al 2018 reungoat et al 2011 this study confirms this finding since both bac 1 and bac 2 were in continuous operation for over 482 days the study results challenge previous conclusions that biofiltration is often inconsequential in terms of long term cec removals except for ndma bacaro et al 2019 maidrand and ohlinger 2013 the following discussion focuses on ozone bac removal of two categories of cecs those that are oxidized proportionally to ozone dose e g atenolol sulfamethoxazole deet and sucralose and those that are marginally oxidized during ozonation e g organophosphate flame retardants bac effectively removed atenolol during the initial months of operation e g sampling events 1 and 2 presumably via carbon based removal mechanism for days 41 through 446 when the specific ozone dose was maintained at 0 9 the efficiency of atenolol removal across bac 1 reduced from 95 to 75 during sampling events 8 and 9 when the specific ozone doses were 1 5 and 2 0 respectively substantial amounts of atenolol were oxidized 89 and 100 respectively during ozonation since most of the atenolol was oxidized by ozonation little was left for removal by bac in this situation bac 1 served as a polishing step during the last two events which explains the decrease in the percent removal performance limited atenolol was available for treatment relative to the analytical laboratory s detection limits for atenolol hollender et al 2009 also reported increased atenolol removal with increased ozone doses while blackbeard et al 2015 reported almost no atenolol removal in a biofilter using sand media i e no carbon based removal capacity it is therefore likely that biodegradation of atenolol by bac is limited yet bac 1 continued to remove atenolol long after bac 1 s carbon based removal capacity for doc and pfoa seemed largely exhausted day 132 pfoa removal 13 atenolol removal 82 this observation underscores that the carbon based adsorptive capacity of bac is contaminant specific because of the extended field investigation considerable desorption of cecs such as sulfamethoxazole deet and sucralose from bac 1 a significant reliability concern was observed during the last three sampling events removal of sulfamethoxazole and deet in bac 1 followed a similar trend both cecs were removed by bac during the early days of operation presumably by adsorption with removal efficiencies slowly decreasing as the bvs treated increased in this study the potential significant desorption of these specific cecs was observed during the last three sampling events with specific ozone doses of 0 9 1 5 and 2 0 increasing the specific ozone dose led to increased sulfamethoxazole and deet removal across ozonation during the last two sampling events the concentration gradients across bac 1 for these cecs was therefore reduced thereby worsening the desorption mechanism past studies have noted a similar cec desorption phenomenon in bac when there is a change in concentration gradient bacaro et al 2019 reungoat et al 2011 sun et al 2018 however this does not explain the desorption observed during the seventh sampling event with the specific ozone dose of 0 9 although sucralose removal in bac 1 was similar to sulfamethoxazole and deet desorption of sucralose was only observed during the last sampling event when the specific ozone dose was increased to 2 0 a possible explanation for this observed desorption is that the concentration of sucralose in the bac influent decreased enough to trigger desorption when the efficiency of sucralose removal increased from 20 during sampling events 1 through 7 to 43 during the last event sampling event 9 tcep tdcpp and tcpp results show a decline in removal efficiencies through the first 132 days 19 059 bvs of operation which is attributed to carbon based removal of these flame retardants as shown in fig 5 a previous study that used the same f 400 media reported significant tcep and tcpp removals in bac sundaram et al 2014 researchers who have investigated cec removal in bac installed downstream of ozonation have postulated that cecs in ozonated water have fewer competitor compounds for adsorption sites because organic matter is transformed into smaller hydrophilic compounds with poor adsorbability but high biodegradability compared to non ozonated wastewater resulting in later breakthrough of cecs bourgin et al 2018 tcpp results from the last two sampling events show significant increases in removal efficiencies which could be attributed to reduced cec load to bac 1 with the increased ozone dose mechanisms increasing tcep removal at the end of testing could not be clearly inferred however biodegradation of tcep has been reported by other studies zhang et al 2017 3 3 3 cec removal across bac 2 20 min ebct over 30 000 bvs treated results show that cecs oxidized as a function of ozone dose as well as those marginally oxidized by ozone were fully removed by bac 2 even after 32 000 bvs reungoat et al 2012 compared cec removals in bacs operated at ebct of 9 min and 18 min they observed a clear increase in cec removal with increased ebct when normalized to an equal bv treated through each bac filter however the same study reported that increasing the ebct from 18 min to 45 min did not show any clear benefit comparing bac 2 results with cec removal data from previous reports it appears that carbon based removal was a dominant mechanism involved in bac 2 trends observed in bac 2 confirm the following conclusions from studies that investigated cec removal in bac 1 preozonation extends the cec adsorption life of bac sun et al 2018 2 bac has adsorption capacity for cecs even after the bed is exhausted for general wide spectrum adsorption of doc reungoat et al 2011 and 3 bac can be effective in removing cecs by adsorption even after 50 000 bvs treated bourgin et al 2018 ma et al 2018 have reported a similar phenomenon of higher cec removals when the bac loading rate was reduced by half in a drinking water treatment application a decrease in deet removal was observed during sampling event 8 once bac 2 had treated 31 981 bvs however deet was not detected in the bac 2 effluent during sampling event 9 comparing the bac 1 and bac 2 deet results biodegradation does not appear to be a dominant mechanism for deet removal in bac therefore the observed drop in deet removal efficiency in bac 2 during sampling event 8 could be due to variability in laboratory quantification 3 4 toc toc is considered a key indicator parameter for potable reuse projects this is because toc levels affect the production of chlorinated disinfection byproduct dbps when the purified water is subsequently treated with chlorine as a primary or secondary disinfectant in the drinking water distribution system marfil vega et al 2017 no single nationwide toc standard has been established for potable reuse projects in the united states at the time of publication however both florida and california have established a toc limit in their potable reuse regulation florida s toc limit is 3 mg l florida department of environmental protection 2010 while california s toc limit is 0 5 mg l state of california 2018a california also requires the use of ro or diluent water to meet this requirement concentrations of toc over time across bac 1 10 min ebct and bac 2 20 min ebct from this study are shown in fig 8 a results from a past ozone bac study in the reno area termed bac 3 with an ebct of 30 min are shown in fig 8b concentrations of toc as a function of bac 1 bac 2 and bac 3 bvs treated are shown in fig 9 both bac 1 and bac 2 were operated downstream of the stmwrf s secondary treatment average srt 10 days influent temperature 12 2 28 c continuous backwash sand filters and ozonation with a specific ozone dose of 0 9 except during the last month of operation when higher specific ozone doses of 1 5 and 2 0 were investigated bac 3 was operated downstream of the reno stead water reclamation facility average srt 15 days influent temperature range 12 8 23 3 c ultrafiltration and ozonation with a specific ozone dose of 0 8 secondary effluent toc is a function of biological treatment process type srt biomass concentration temperature food to microorganism ratio and other factors barker and stuckey 1999 bvs treated in bac 1 bac 2 and bac 3 over time are shown in fig 9 in figs 8a and 9 bac 1 appears to have an effluent toc concentration plateau of around 4 5 mg l compared to the influent toc of around 6 mg l from 200 to 400 days of operation after 450 days of operation corresponding to winter conditions the influent toc increased to around 8 mg l and the bac 1 effluent toc plateau increased to around 6 mg l these observations suggest that under these conditions the toc mass removal potential of bac 1 was being exceeded by the load therefore any load that exceeded the removal potential of bac 1 simply passed through similar phenomena were observed for bac 2 and bac 3 consequently the apparent toc mass removed rate kg d for all three bac units was calculated per cubic meter of carbon bed volume the results of these calculations are presented in fig 10 as shown bac 1 and bac 2 with sand filter pretreatment and ozonation appear to have a gross toc removal potential plateau of around 0 2 0 3 kg of toc removed per day per cubic meter of carbon media kg d m3 the water temperature and specific ozone dose may also have some impact bac 3 with ultrafiltration pretreatment has a lower toc removal rate plateau at around 0 1 kg d m3 presumably due to a lower toc load on the bac other potential causes for this lower plateau may be attributed to reduced pore plugging and availability of adsorption sites for toc removal i e lower levels of influent toc that are subject to removal by non carbon treatment mechanisms comparably 0 1 kg d m3 of doc removal is expected in drinking water biofilters with upstream ozonation with a specific ozone dose of 0 8 1 0 mwh 2005 a comparison of fig 8a bac 2 fig 8b bac 3 and fig 9 shows that both filters after start up having similar effluent toc concentrations in the 2 4 mg l range although the specific ozone dose and temperature both affect the toc concentrations the overall phenomenon appears to agree with the typical bac design and operation where effluent toc generally stays in the 2 4 mg l range this suggests that the lower plateau for effluent toc concentrations in typical bac filters is expected to be in the 2 4 mg l range and that a 30 min ebct as used for bac 3 is not needed reducing the required ebct from 30 min to 20 min in bac will lead to substantial cost savings for potable reuse projects bac toc plateaus in the 3 4 mg l range have been reported by others arnold et al 2018 water research foundation 2016 however cause and effect factors that affect the toc plateau in ozone bac systems have not been explored elsewhere since the ozone bac effluent toc plateau concentration is a function of process design it can be designed to be in the 3 4 mg l range required by some regulatory agencies without supplemental treatment the authors propose using a toc mass removal rate per unit volume of carbon or a specific toc mass removal rate for bac sizing purposes this approach accounts for both volume of bac media and influent toc mass loading and has been used in the design of drinking water bac biofilters mwh 2005 these are important steps towards technology implementation the toc mass removal rates observed in bac 1 and bac 2 with upstream sand filter were significantly higher than the rates observed in bac 3 with upstream membrane filter after 13 000 bvs the bac 3 toc mass removal rate was in the range of 0 08 0 13 kg d m3 with is significantly lower than the 0 2 0 3 kg d m3 observed in bac 1 and bac 2 the influent toc to bac is expected to have a direct impact on the mass of toc removed and the specific toc mass removal rate the average influent toc to bac 3 was 5 9 mg l which was substantially lower than the bac 1 and bac 2 influent toc of 7 5 mg l however the bac 3 trendline shown in fig 9 indicates a steady decrease in toc removal rate over time with a steeper slope than bac 1 and 2 indicating that toc removal in bac 3 could be resulting predominantly from carbon based mechanisms the authors postulate that a substantial amount of microbiology must be present in the bac to achieve its full non carbon based toc removal rate once the carbon based removal capacity is largely exhausted and pore plugging has occurred due to biological growth for example atp levels in heavily loaded bac 1 are about four times higher than lightly loaded bac 2 bac 3 appears to have been so lightly loaded with biodegradable substrate that it never achieved its full non carbon based toc removal rate however pore plugging from biological growth is also expected to be significantly lower in bac 3 compared to bac 2 which increases the competition for toc from available adsorption sites with significant carbon based toc removal in bac 3 the biology needed to maximize non carbon based toc removal never developed it is important to consider the differences in pretreatment pore plugging and the limitations of biofilters with regards to toc removal biofilters are relatively high rate filtration and biodegradation treatment processes that therefore have finite filtration and biodegradation capacities based on design and loading rate the important point regarding toc removal is that toc biodegradation continues long after bac carbon based removal capacity is largely exhausted and that upstream treatment steps have a significant impact on biofilter performance 3 5 suva specific uv absorbance suva is calculated based on uv absorbance and doc of the water and occasionally based on toc of the water though doc based suva analysis is more common toc based suva has advantages because it can be measured real time and therefore be utilized for operations and control doc based and toc based suva data for influent ozone effluent and bac 1 and bac 2 effluents are shown in fig 11 a bac 1 and 11 b bac 2 suva is considered to be an indicator of aromatic carbon content recalcitrance in water and is well correlated to dbp yields zearley 2012 results show that suva reduction was achieved either by increasing the specific ozone dose or by increasing the bac ebct the bac 1 effluent suva trend reveals considerable reduction in suva and aromatic compounds during the initial days of operation potentially due to carbon based removal mechanisms the transition of bac 1 operation to non carbon based removal resulted in almost negligible suva removal which coincided with the improved ndma removals presented in figs 1 and 2 tracking and monitoring a bac s influent and effluent suva could potentially be used as an operational indicator of bac performance in terms of ndma removal additional investigation is warranted to further test and validate this strategy more pronounced and sustained suva reduction was observed in bac 2 compared to bac 1 comparing bac 2 and bac 1 suva data over the study duration it is evident that bac 2 was potentially influenced by both carbon and non carbon removal mechanisms while bac 1 was dominated by non carbon based removal mechanisms a comparison of doc based and toc based suva trends shows that toc based suva could potentially be used as a critical control parameter by operators and regulators of potable reuse projects these data could be measured in real time via online analyzers 3 6 implications of study findings for commercial implementation studies and investigations conducted so far have identified four key hurdles for ozone biofiltration based potable reuse solutions 1 ndma formation 2 inability to remove cecs such as pfas and flame retardants 3 bromate formation and 4 meeting effluent toc requirements findings from this study confirm that acclimation time is required for non carbon based removal of ndma in bac biofiltration bromate formation during this study was 50 lower than the primary drinking water maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 ppb in specific potable reuse situations where bromate is problematic mitigation strategies such as peroxide and or ammonia addition have been developed sundaram and emerick 2010 this study has developed a deeper understanding of ozone bac performance in terms of toc removal and design based effluent toc plateaus reducing the bac ebct while achieving project goals and objectives has a direct and significant impact on lifecycle costs of these treatment processes plumlee et al 2014 the results of this study show that an ebct of 20 min appears to be sufficient for cec removal cec and toc removal across bac and gac systems can be further optimized by having a bac for toc removal followed by a gac for additional cec and toc removal as needed an ozone bac based non ro awt train is shown in fig 12 if salt removal is needed a side stream ro process should be considered as an alternative to full stream ro treatment almost all treatment steps along with uv disinfection should be considered for pathogen inactivation collectively concerns related to ozone bac based potable reuse solutions have either been addressed or resolved via mitigation measures the authors believe that these optimization efforts make ozone bac based solutions more economical for implementation in communities around the globe particularly for inland communities a paradigm shift is needed when considering potable water resource management and planning the cost of ozone bac should be compared to either the cost of developing other water supply alternatives or to the estimated damages resulting from not having a reliable potable water supply during a protracted drought a recent case study on sustainable water management planning in reno has shown that potable reuse solutions based on ozone bac would provide multiple benefits to the community haak et al 2018 the use of ozone bac in potable reuse applications has been gaining momentum in recent years information available from this study augments the ozone bac body of knowledge for full scale implementation 4 conclusions presence of ndma is a limitation of ozone biofiltration technology evidence of ndma removal across bac during transition period i e conversion of gac to bac was captured an acclimation period of 140 days or 20 000 bed volumes was observed in heavily loaded bac bac 1 this period is much longer than acclimation times needed for readily biodegradable organics findings from this study show the interactions between carbon based and non carbon based mechanisms involved in the removal of ndma and thereby directly address the perceived limitations pfoa removal across bac appears to be heavily influenced by carbon based removal mechanisms study results indicate that ozonation upstream of bac along with longer ebct extends bac bed life for pfoa removal lightly loaded bac with longer ebct bac 2 contained lower biomass density and demonstrated higher pfoa removal capacity than heavily loaded bac with shorter ebct bac 1 increasing the specific ozone dose resulted in muted improvement in oxidation of cecs that are resistive to ozonation higher ebct yielded higher overall cec removals while lower ebct resulted in significant desorption of sulfamethoxazole and deet most of the reductions across bac are believed to be from carbon based treatment mechanisms therefore higher ebct is required when ozone bac is used as the primary cec treatment barrier potable reuse bac specific toc mass removal rate reached a plateau over time and it was higher than values observed in drinking water bac systems bac units with an upstream sand filter have significantly higher specific toc mass removal rates compared to bac units with an upstream membrane filter suva i e organic aromaticity was decreased by higher specific ozone dose and or longer bac ebct toc based suva appeared to be comparable to doc based suva therefore toc based suva is proposed for real time ozone bac performance monitoring and gac to bac transition monitoring operators can implement the

18171,benzene is a toxic contaminant and can harm many aquatic species and cause serious damages to the river eco system if released to rivers in 2012 a major spill accident occurred on the huaihe

incidents toxic contaminants may be discharged into rivers causing serious damages on the aquatic ecosystem palumbo roe et al 2017 mandaric et al 2019 in 2012 three tons of benzene was suddenly released into a major river in eastern china the huaihe river due to an industrial accident on 28th december at a location 3 5 km downstream of the bengbu sluice on the river and around 70 km upstream

ongley 2004 zuo et al 2015 this study focuses on determining the factors that influence the benzene transport and transformation process during the 2012 major pollution incident in the huaihe river evaluating the effects of different management measures including discharge control and in situ treatment using activated carbon and developing tools and strategies for similar incidents during the 2012 pollution incident the huaihe river basin water resources protection bureau and hohai university monitored the benzene concentrations in the river water at 22 given cross sections downstream of the accident location figs 1 and 2 while the data showed that the emergency response appeared to have successfully mitigated the impact of the accident on the river and natural reserve the mechanism and critical conditions underlying the effectiveness of the measures taken require further investigation in addition to absorption and mixing the fate of benzene released to the huaihe rivers could be affected by volatilization and natural attenuation by analyzing the monitoring data using a mathematical model we aimed to learn further lessons from the huaihe river incident by addressing the following questions 1 which process es among volatilization naturally attenuation and ac adsorption dominated the removal of benzene from the river water 2 how do the flow control via the sluice operation and in situ treatment through active carbon adsorption combine to reduce the benzene concentration to the required limit and 3 how should an emergency pollution control strategy and management engineering solution be formulated over a pollution incident on a regulated river in general 2 method the benzene concentrations measured at the 22 cross sections p1 to p22 fig 1 are shown fig s1 to analyze the concentrations a process based mathematical model was developed this model simulates the transport and transformation of benzene over the downstream river section from the bengbu sluice to the last monitoring location p22 fig 1 and the flow process is in fig 3 a this river section was divided into ten segments s1 to s10 fig 1 each of similar geomorphology including the geometry of river cross section and vegetation the geometries of representative cross sections for the 10 segments were measured at h1 to h10 respectively fig 1 for each segment the manning equation e

on the cross section geometry in order to derive the analytical solution the model was developed based on the averaged flow rates constant during the incident for the purpose of simplicity for the 1 d

input mass and a 0 m2 is the area of the cross section at the input x 0 however this solution is only applicable for the first segment s1 where the sudden benzene mass input occurred at the release point for s2 to s10 the mass input boundary condition was given by the entry of the plume with temporally varying concentrations as shown in fig 3b given c x n τ as the input concentration at the upstream boundary x n of the n th segment the benzene concentration varying along this segment can be obtained as follows 10 c x n 1 d t a n a n 1 0 t u n 1 c x n τ 4 π d n 1 t τ exp d u n 1 t τ 2 4 d

process while t s is the time for the n 1 th process note that eq 10 is applied progressively to the segments from s2 to s10 taking the output from the current segment as the input to the next segment with the change of the cross section area taken into account so c x n 1 t calculated by eq 10 should be corrected by a factor of a n a n 1 before using it as the input into segment n 1 all the model parameters values are listed in table 1 the values of slopes j and roughness n m factors were based on previous studies beng 2010 wang et al 2014 the relationships among average flow velocity u m s average depth of water h m and average area a m2 were determined through the manning equations eqs 1 3 with the measured geometries of the cross sections and discharge q m s3 the results are shown in fig 2c and d and fig s2 the volatilization coefficient was calculated by eq 6 based on the average flow velocity u m s and average water depth h m the total attenuation coefficient k 1 s and dispersion coefficient d m2 s were based on model calibration by fitting model predictions eqs 9 and 10 to measured benzene concentration data p1 p22 nevertheless we estimated the values of d with the following empirical formula fischer 1975 11 d 0 011 u 2 b 2 h u where b m is the width of the river and u u g h j m s is the friction velocity the typical value range of d in the reach of huaihe river we studied is 1 5 9 7 m2 s deng et al 2002 which covers the fitted value table 1 3 results and discussion four simulation cases were considered case a representing the real situation with flow control and activated carbons measures implemented case b with activated carbons applied but no flow control case c with flow control but no activated carbons applied and case d without flow control or activated carbons applied 3 1 spatial and temporal variations of benzene concentrations in the river water measurements and model predictions case a of benzene concentrations at all the monitoring locations agree reasonably well both showing similar trends with a rising and a falling phase at p2 p22 fig 4 and fig s1 with no flow control case b the model predicted earlier arrivals and larger magnitudes of peak concentrations at all the monitoring locations compared with case a fig 4 and fig s1 the arrival time of peak concentration in case a lagged that in case b by 21 6 h at p6 and 54 2 h at p11 fig 4 another way to estimate the peak concentration time is based on the flow time t a for a particular location x within segment n calculated as follows 12 t a i 1 n 1 l i u i x i 1 n 1 l i u n if n 2 x u n if n 1 where l i is the length of the i th segment eq 12 provides estimates of t a being 64 0 h and 43 5 h for p6 and p11 in case a while the actual arrival times of peak concentration were 66 0 h and 43 1 h respectively for case b t a was 164 2 h for p6 and 108 9 h for p11 and the corresponding arrival times of peak concentration were 164 8 h and 110 6 h respectively the peak concentration was higher with larger flow rates in case b than in case a fig 5 as the time for benzene mixing and attenuation became shorter in the former case similar effect was also evident in case d in comparisons with case c comparisons between case a and case c and case b and case d revealed the effect of active carbons which led to reduction in the benzene concentrations including the peak concentration but did not change the arrival time of peak concentrations figs 4 and 5 overall the peak concentration decreased from p1 to p22 as the benzene plume mixed with ambient water dilution and underwent attenuation for case a and b over distance and time fig 6 in case a and b the peak concentrations also responded to the input of ac with an immediate drop fig 6 demonstrating the strong ac adsorption effect on the removal of benzene from the river water to further assess the local pollution we calculated the duration over which the benzene concentration exceeds the regulatory limit as the plume passed through a location fig 7 in all cases this duration t p increased with distance initially then remained relatively constant and finally decreased dramatically fig 7 the initial lengthening of the local pollution duration in upstream areas near the benzene release point was due to benzene dispersion which dominated over the attenuation process and resulted in spreading of the plume of relatively high concentrations the rapid shortening of the local pollution duration in the downstream areas reflected the significant attenuation of the plume over the distance with the peak concentration close to and dropping quickly below the regulatory limit in the middle reach the effects of dispersion and attenuation balanced each other keeping t p relatively constant dramatic drops of t p in the segments where activated carbons ac were put into the river were clearly evident as simulated in case a and b this again demonstrated the effect of ac adsorption on removing benzene from the river water the comparisons among the four simulation cases showed how flow control and in situ treatment using ac could be applied to mitigate the impact of a pollution accident incident on a river system 3 2 fate of benzene with distributions in different phases the reach of the huaihe river where this study focus on is divided into 2 reaches reach a ra and reach b rb and ra represents s1 while rb represents s2 s3 s10 fig 1 this study is focus on rb as the monitoring data in p3 is relative credible the benzene in ra might be heterogeneous mixing the removed benzene from the river water would be in the volatilized phase transformed phase and ac adsorbed phase according to the model simulations most of the mass was in the ac absorbed phase and likely to have settled on the river bed and volatilized phase table 2 under the real condition case a only about 10 of the benzene mass was transformed and around 42 and 48 were volatilized and ac adsorbed respectively table 2 in case c and d with no input of ac most of the benzene mass was volatilized table 2 comparison between case a and b or case c and d indicated that a larger flow rate resulted in less volatilized mass table 2 both volatilized mass and transformed mass decreased with the distance fig 8 a the ac adsorption occurred rapidly within the three sections with the ac input to further analyze the benzene mass in different phases forms we calculated the mass per kilometer for each phase normalized by the total benzene mass i e m m m rb m of the transformed benzene was almost the same in both case a and case b while m of the volatilized in case b was only half of that in case a the ac adsorbed mass was very high in the three sections with ac input since the ac adsorption coefficient is several times higher than the natural attenuation coefficient and volatilization coefficient table 1 comparison between case a and case b showed that m of the ac adsorbed benzene was higher in case a than in case b in the first segment of ac input because the faster flow in the latter case resulted in less time for benzene to be adsorbed in the second segment the two cases differed little however m in the last segment was lower in case a than in case b fig 8a in this segment the benzene concentration in case a was low resulting in less adsorption the temporal variations of the benzene mass in different phases were also examined fig 8b the benzene mass in the water phase decreased continuously in contrast with the increasing trends of the other phases rapid increase in the absorbed benzene mass occurred in case a and case b corresponding to the ac input fig 8b consistent with the spatial variations shown in fig 8a there were 3 dramatic increases in the mass of ac adsorbed benzene in case a starting around 125 h 175 h and 225 h when the ac was input to the river consequently the water phase benzene mass dropped more rapidly around these times fig 8b 3 3 effectiveness of pollution control options based on the model simulation results the pollution zone bounded by the edges x coordinates of the benzene plume of concentrations above the regulatory limit can be determined at different times over the incident the extents of the pollution zone simulated in the different cases can be assessed based on the edges curves shown in fig 9 these closed curves display how the spatial extent of the pollution zone changed over time with a trend of expansion followed by contraction to non existence i e the front tip of the curve highlighted in the figure at a particular location the edges curves show the temporal extent of the pollution indicating the passing though period of the benzene plume above the regulatory limit the front tips of these curves provide information about how far the pollution incident impacts on the downstream river reach with benzene concentrations above the regulatory limit and for how long the spatial and temporal extents of the pollution zones simulated in the four different cases are consistent with the results discussed above the simulations show that in the actual event case a the incident lasted for 312 5 h and affected the downstream area covering 58 2 km from the benzene release point but fortunately falling short of 17 2 km from the natural reserve table 3 fig 9 the two implemented emergency measures were effective in reducing the pollution extent to avoid damage on the natural reserve in case b c and d simulated with less or no measures undertaken the incident would have caused damages case c and d or presented a threat case b with the front tip being close the reserve to the natural reserve table 3 fig 9 comparison between case a and c indicates that the in situ treatment with the input of ac reduced significantly both the spatial and temporal extents of benzene pollution despite little effect on the movement of the peak concentration i e most polluted section of the plume fig 9 on the other hand the difference between case a and b shows again the effect of flow rates in particular under a larger flow rate the pollution incident may last for a shorter duration but with the risk of causing pollution for a larger downstream area fig 9 3 4 sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of the modeled benzene transport transformation process to different conditions we conducted further analyses based on different values of dispersion coefficient d flow rate u and adsorption coefficient of activated carbons k ac with a focus on changes of pollution length l m pollution duration t m and peak concentration c m the results of spatial and temporal range of pollution are shown in table 4 and fig 10 the concentration profiles are shown in fig 11 fig s3 fig s4 and fig s5 the peak concentration variations are shown in fig s6 with the increase of flow velocity u the pollution length l m increases but the pollution duration t m decreases fig 10a and table 4 the local contaminant concentration at a cross section increases with the arrival time of peak concentration brought forward and the contamination duration shortened fig 11a b fig s3 and fig s6 as the larger flow rate leads to faster downstream movement of the contaminant there is less time for the plume to spread resulting in a more concentrated plume moving farther downstream in contrast a larger dispersion coefficient d reduces the overall spatial and temporal extents of contamination fig 10b table 4 however the spatial range of the pollution plume becomes larger at a particular time while at a given location the temporal range of the pollution plume becomes greater the variation of dispersion coefficient does not affect the arrival time of peak concentration figs 10band 11c d large adsorption coefficients of activated carbons k ac also lead to smaller spatial and temporal benzene distributions fig 10c table 4 at a given time the spatial range of the contaminant plume becomes narrower while the temporal range of the pollution plume at a given location becomes shorter the variation of the adsorption coefficient does not affect the arrival time of peak concentration either figs 10cand 11e f in order to quantify the sensitivity of the benzene transport transformation process in response to condition changes all the parameters are normalized fig 12 by real values based on case a the pollution length pollution duration peak concentration dispersion coefficient flow rate and adsorption coefficient of activated carbons are normalized as l m l m0 t m t m0 c m c m0 d d 0 u u 0 and k ac k ac0 respectively obviously the effects of u on l m and c m are positive but negative for t m fig 12a reflecting that the peak concentration and the spatial range of pollution increase with flow rate but the temporal range of pollution decreases the sensitivity of c m to u at p11 is greater than at p6 fig 12a this suggests that the influence of u on c m is stronger at locations which is farther from the contaminant release point the effects of d on t m l m and c m are negative the sensitivity of c m to d at two different locations are similar and so are the sensitivity of t m and l m to d fig 12b the effects of k ac on t m l m and c m are negative fig 12c the sensitivity of c m to k ac at p18 is greater than at p11 fig 12c this suggests that the influence of active carbons is more important father downstream because the adsorption time of active carbons would be longer fig 5 c m appears to be less sensitive to changes of k ac compared with the sensitivity induced by u and d fig 12d for p11 this suggests that the adsorption coefficient of active carbons has less effect on the peak concentration than those of u and d for l m u is much more influential than d and k ac fig 12e thus the control of flow rate can be an effective way to manage the spatial extent of pollution comparison of the sensitivities of t m to u d and k ac shows that the effect of u on t m is slightly greater than those of other two factors fig 12d thus measures based on manipulating u d and k ac can all be effective options for managing the temporal range of pollution 4 concluding remarks based on analyses of the monitoring data collected during a major benzene pollution incident on the huaihe river with assistance of a mathematical model this study examined the processes and critical conditions underlying the emergency measures implemented to mitigate the impact of the incident the flow reduction slows down the transport of benzene downstream allowing more time for benzene dilution via mixing with ambient water and attenuation through reactions the in situ treatment using ac absorption removes benzene from the river water the combination of both measures in dealing with the actual incident was proved to be very effective the developed mathematical model was demonstrated to be capable of simulating the benzene transport and transformation in the river the results showed that volatilization and ac adsorption dominated the removal of benzene from the river water to deal with a pollution incident with accidental release of contaminants this model can be used as a tool to predict the pollution extent as shown in fig 9 under different emergency management scenarios and assess the effectiveness of different measures that can be implemented to mitigate the impact of the incident however the model coefficients were assumed to be constants in the river segments in reality these coefficients may vary considerably with time and distance therefore further model development in the future can focus on how to incorporate further temporal and spatial variations of the river systems in this study no consideration was given to the fate of activated carbons with a large amount of benzene adsorbed would the carbon particles enter the streambed and affect the eco system of the hyporheic zone would the adsorbed benzene become mobile and get released to the river water moreover how should the secondary pollution be considered in dealing with a major pollution incident using an in situ treatment method that only removes the pollutant from the river water temporarily but not completely from the river system these questions will provide directions for future research as motivated by the present study declaration of competing

ongley 2004 zuo et al 2015 this study focuses on determining the factors that influence the benzene transport and transformation process during the 2012 major pollution incident in the huaihe river evaluating the effects of different management measures including discharge control and in situ treatment using activated carbon and developing tools and strategies for similar incidents during the 2012 pollution incident the huaihe river basin water resources protection bureau and hohai university monitored the benzene concentrations in the river water at 22 given cross sections downstream of the accident location figs 1 and 2 while the data showed that the emergency response appeared to have successfully mitigated the impact of the accident on the river and natural reserve the mechanism and critical conditions underlying the effectiveness of the measures taken require further investigation in addition to absorption and mixing the fate of benzene released to the huaihe rivers could be affected by volatilization and natural attenuation by analyzing the monitoring data using a mathematical model we aimed to learn further lessons from the huaihe river incident by addressing the following questions 1 which process es among volatilization naturally attenuation and ac adsorption dominated the removal of benzene from the river water 2 how do the flow control via the sluice operation and in situ treatment through active carbon adsorption combine to reduce the benzene concentration to the required limit and 3 how should an emergency pollution control strategy and management engineering solution be formulated over a pollution incident on a regulated river in general 2 method the benzene concentrations measured at the 22 cross sections p1 to p22 fig 1 are shown fig s1 to analyze the concentrations a process based mathematical model was developed this model simulates the transport and transformation of benzene over the downstream river section from the bengbu sluice to the last monitoring location p22 fig 1 and the flow process is in fig 3 a this river section was divided into ten segments s1 to s10 fig 1 each of similar geomorphology including the geometry of river cross section and vegetation the geometries of representative cross sections for the 10 segments were measured at h1 to h10 respectively fig 1 for each segment the manning equation e g bjerklie et al 2005 is used to determine the relationship among average flow rate u m s discharge q m3 s and average cross section area a m2 i e 1 u 1 n m r 2 3 j 1 2 2 q a u 3 r a χ where n m is the bed roughness factor j m is the river bed slope r m is the hydraulic radius and χ m is the wetted perimeter fig 2 the transport and transformation of benzene through each segment within the modeled river section are governed by the 1 d transport reaction equation e g wang et al 2006 fu et al 2008 4 c t u c x d 2 c x 2 k c where c kg m3 is the benzene concentration in the river water t s

on the cross section geometry in order to derive the analytical solution the model was developed based on the averaged flow rates constant during the incident for the purpose of simplicity for the 1 d transport reaction eq 4 with a sudden input the analytical solution can be found below e g van genuchten 1982 kumar et al 2009 9 c x t m a 0 4 π d t exp x u t 2 4 d t exp k t where m kg is the sudden input mass and a 0 m2 is the area of the cross section at the input x 0 however this solution is only applicable for the first segment s1 where the sudden benzene mass input occurred at the release point for s2 to s10 the mass input boundary condition was given by the entry of the plume with temporally varying concentrations as shown in fig 3b given c x n τ as the input concentration at the upstream boundary x n of the n th segment the benzene concentration varying along this segment can be obtained as follows 10 c x n 1 d t a n a n 1 0 t u n 1 c x n τ 4 π d n 1 t τ exp d u n 1 t τ 2 4 d

process while t s is the time for the n 1 th process note that eq 10 is applied progressively to the segments from s2 to s10 taking the output from the current segment as the input to the next segment with the change of the cross section area taken into account so c x n 1 t calculated by eq 10 should be corrected by a factor of a n a n 1 before using it as the input into segment n 1 all the model parameters values are listed in table 1 the values of slopes j and roughness n m factors were based on previous studies beng 2010 wang et al 2014 the relationships among average flow velocity u m s average depth of water h m and average area a m2 were determined through the manning equations eqs 1 3 with the measured geometries of the cross sections and discharge q m s3 the results are shown in fig 2c and d and fig s2 the volatilization coefficient was calculated by eq 6 based on the average flow velocity u m s and average water depth h m the total attenuation coefficient k 1 s and dispersion coefficient d m2 s were based on model calibration by fitting model predictions eqs 9 and 10 to measured benzene concentration data p1 p22 nevertheless we estimated the values of d with the following empirical formula fischer 1975 11 d 0 011 u 2 b 2 h u where b m is the width of the river and u u g h j m s is the friction velocity the typical value range of d in the reach of huaihe river we studied is 1 5 9 7 m2 s deng et al 2002 which covers the fitted value table 1 3 results and discussion four simulation cases were considered case a representing the real situation with flow control and activated carbons measures implemented case b with activated carbons applied but no flow control case c with flow control but no activated carbons applied and case d without flow control or activated carbons applied 3 1 spatial and temporal variations of benzene concentrations in the river water measurements and model predictions case a of benzene concentrations at all the monitoring locations agree reasonably well both showing similar trends with a rising and a falling phase at p2 p22 fig 4 and fig s1 with no flow control case b the model predicted earlier arrivals and larger magnitudes of peak concentrations at all the monitoring locations compared with case a fig 4 and fig s1 the arrival time of peak concentration in case a lagged that in case b by 21 6 h at p6 and 54 2 h at p11 fig 4 another way to estimate the peak concentration time is based on the flow time t a for a particular location x within segment n calculated as follows 12 t a i 1 n 1 l i u i x i 1 n 1 l i u n if n 2 x u n if n 1 where l i is the length of the i th segment eq 12 provides estimates of t a being 64 0 h and 43 5 h for p6 and p11 in case a while the actual arrival times of peak concentration were 66 0 h and 43 1 h respectively for case b t a was 164 2 h for p6 and 108 9 h for p11 and the corresponding arrival times of peak concentration were 164 8 h and 110 6 h respectively the peak concentration was higher with larger flow rates in case b than in case a fig 5 as the time for benzene mixing and attenuation became shorter in the former case similar effect was also evident in case d in comparisons with case c comparisons between case a and case c and case b and case d revealed the effect of active carbons which led to reduction in the benzene concentrations including the peak concentration but did not change the arrival time of peak concentrations figs 4 and 5 overall the peak concentration decreased from p1 to p22 as the benzene plume mixed with ambient water dilution and underwent attenuation for case a and b over distance and time fig 6 in case a and b the peak concentrations also responded to the input of ac with an immediate drop fig 6 demonstrating the strong ac adsorption effect on the removal of benzene from the river water to further assess the local pollution we calculated the duration over which the benzene concentration exceeds the regulatory limit as the plume passed through a location fig 7 in all cases this duration t p increased with distance initially then remained relatively constant and finally decreased dramatically fig 7 the initial lengthening of the local pollution duration in upstream areas near the benzene release point was due to benzene dispersion which dominated over the attenuation process and resulted in spreading of the plume of relatively high concentrations the rapid shortening of the local pollution duration in the downstream areas reflected the significant attenuation of the plume over the distance with the peak concentration close to and dropping quickly below the regulatory limit in the middle reach the effects of dispersion and attenuation balanced each other keeping t p relatively constant dramatic drops of t p in the segments where activated carbons ac were put into the river were clearly evident as simulated in case a and b this again demonstrated the effect of ac adsorption on removing benzene from the river water the comparisons among the four simulation cases showed how flow control and in situ treatment using ac could be applied to mitigate the impact of a pollution accident incident on a river system 3 2 fate of benzene with distributions in different phases the reach of the huaihe river where this study focus on is divided into 2 reaches reach a ra and reach b rb and ra represents s1 while rb represents s2 s3 s10 fig 1 this study is focus on rb as the monitoring data in p3 is relative credible the benzene in ra might be heterogeneous mixing the removed benzene from the river water would be in the volatilized phase transformed phase and ac adsorbed phase according to the model simulations most of the mass was in the ac absorbed phase and likely to have settled on the river bed and volatilized phase table 2 under the real condition case a only about 10 of the benzene mass was transformed and around 42 and 48 were volatilized and ac adsorbed respectively table 2 in case c and d with no input of ac most of the benzene mass was volatilized table 2 comparison between case a and b or case c and d indicated that a larger flow rate resulted in less volatilized mass table 2 both volatilized mass and transformed mass decreased with the distance fig 8 a the ac adsorption occurred rapidly within the three sections with the ac input to further analyze the benzene mass in different phases forms we calculated the mass per kilometer for each phase normalized by the total benzene mass i e m m m rb m of the transformed benzene was almost the same in both case a and case b while m of the volatilized in case b was only half of that in case a the ac adsorbed mass was very high in the three sections with ac input since the ac adsorption coefficient is several times higher than the natural attenuation coefficient and volatilization coefficient table 1 comparison between case a and case b showed that m of the ac adsorbed benzene was higher in case a than in case b in the first segment of ac input because the faster flow in the latter case resulted in less time for benzene to be adsorbed in the second segment the two cases differed little however m in the last segment was lower in case a than in case b fig 8a in this segment the benzene concentration in case a was low resulting in less adsorption the temporal variations of the benzene mass in different phases were also examined fig 8b the benzene mass in the water phase decreased continuously in contrast with the increasing trends of the other phases rapid increase in the absorbed benzene mass occurred in case a and case b corresponding to the ac input fig 8b consistent with the spatial variations shown in fig 8a there were 3 dramatic increases in the mass of ac adsorbed benzene in case a starting around 125 h 175 h and 225 h when the ac was input to the river consequently the water phase benzene mass dropped more rapidly around these times fig 8b 3 3 effectiveness of pollution control options based on the model simulation results the pollution zone bounded by the edges x coordinates of the benzene plume of concentrations above the regulatory limit can be determined at different times over the incident the extents of the pollution zone simulated in the different cases can be assessed based on the edges curves shown in fig 9 these closed curves display how the spatial extent of the pollution zone changed over time with a trend of expansion followed by contraction to non existence i e the front tip of the curve highlighted in the figure at a particular location the edges curves show the temporal extent of the pollution indicating the passing though period of the benzene plume above the regulatory limit the front tips of these curves provide information about how far the pollution incident impacts on the downstream river reach with benzene concentrations above the regulatory limit and for how long the spatial and temporal extents of the pollution zones simulated in the four different cases are consistent with the results discussed above the simulations show that in the actual event case a the incident lasted for 312 5 h and affected the downstream area covering 58 2 km from the benzene release point but fortunately falling short of 17 2 km from the natural reserve table 3 fig 9 the two implemented emergency measures were effective in reducing the pollution extent to avoid damage on the natural reserve in case b c and d simulated with less or no measures undertaken the incident would have caused damages case c and d or presented a threat case b with the front tip being close the reserve to the natural reserve table 3 fig 9 comparison between case a and c indicates that the in situ treatment with the input of ac reduced significantly both the spatial and temporal extents of benzene pollution despite little effect on the movement of the peak concentration i e most polluted section of the plume fig 9 on the other hand the difference between case a and b shows again the effect of flow rates in particular under a larger flow rate the pollution incident may last for a shorter duration but with the risk of causing pollution for a larger downstream area fig 9 3 4 sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of the modeled benzene transport transformation process to different conditions we conducted further analyses based on different values of dispersion coefficient d flow rate u and adsorption coefficient of activated carbons k ac with a focus on changes of pollution length l m pollution duration t m and peak concentration c m the results of spatial and temporal range of pollution are shown in table 4 and fig 10 the concentration profiles are shown in fig 11 fig s3 fig s4 and fig s5 the peak concentration variations are shown in fig s6 with the increase of flow velocity u the pollution length l m increases but the pollution duration t m decreases fig 10a and table 4 the local contaminant concentration at a cross section increases with the arrival time of peak concentration brought forward and the contamination duration shortened fig 11a b fig s3 and fig s6 as the larger flow rate leads to faster downstream movement of the contaminant there is less time for the plume to spread resulting in a more concentrated plume moving farther downstream in contrast a larger dispersion coefficient d reduces the overall spatial and temporal extents of contamination fig 10b table 4 however the spatial range of the pollution plume becomes larger at a particular time while at a given location the temporal range of the pollution plume becomes greater the variation of dispersion coefficient does not affect the arrival time of peak concentration figs 10band 11c d large adsorption coefficients of activated carbons k ac also lead to smaller spatial and temporal benzene distributions fig 10c table 4 at a given time the spatial range of the contaminant plume becomes narrower while the temporal range of the pollution plume at a given location becomes shorter the variation of the adsorption coefficient does not affect the arrival time of peak concentration either figs 10cand 11e f in order to quantify the sensitivity of the benzene transport transformation process in response to condition changes all the parameters are normalized fig 12 by real values based on case a the pollution length pollution duration peak concentration dispersion coefficient flow rate and adsorption coefficient of activated carbons are normalized as l m l m0 t m t m0 c m c m0 d d 0 u u 0 and k ac k ac0 respectively obviously the effects of u on l m and c m are positive but negative for t m fig 12a reflecting that the peak concentration and the spatial range of pollution increase with flow rate but the temporal range of pollution decreases the sensitivity of c m to u at p11 is greater than at p6 fig 12a this suggests that the influence of u on c m is stronger at locations which is farther from the contaminant release point the effects of d on t m l m and c m are negative the sensitivity of c m to d at two different locations are similar and so are the sensitivity of t m and l m to d fig 12b the effects of k ac on t m l m and c m are negative fig 12c the sensitivity of c m to k ac at p18 is greater than at p11 fig 12c this suggests that the influence of active carbons is more important father downstream because the adsorption time of active carbons would be longer fig 5 c m appears to be less sensitive to changes of k ac compared with the sensitivity induced by u and d fig 12d for p11 this suggests that the adsorption coefficient of active carbons has less effect on the peak concentration than those of u and d for l m u is much more influential than d and k ac fig 12e thus the control of flow rate can be an effective way to manage the spatial extent of pollution comparison of the sensitivities of t m to u d and k ac shows that the effect of u on t m is slightly greater than those of other two factors fig 12d thus measures based on manipulating u d and k ac can all be effective options for managing the temporal range of pollution 4 concluding remarks based on analyses of the monitoring data collected during a major benzene pollution incident on the huaihe river with assistance of a mathematical model this study examined the processes and critical conditions underlying the emergency measures implemented to mitigate the impact of the incident the flow reduction slows down the transport of benzene downstream allowing more time for benzene dilution via mixing with ambient water and attenuation through reactions the in situ treatment using ac absorption removes benzene from the river water the combination of both measures in dealing with the actual incident was proved to be very effective the developed mathematical model was demonstrated to be capable of simulating the benzene transport and transformation in the river the results showed that volatilization and ac adsorption dominated the removal of benzene from the river water to deal with a pollution incident with accidental release of contaminants this model can be used as a tool to predict the pollution extent as shown in fig 9 under different emergency management scenarios and assess the effectiveness of different measures that can be implemented to mitigate the impact of the incident however the model coefficients were assumed to be constants in the river segments in reality these coefficients may vary considerably with time and distance therefore further model development in the future can focus on how to incorporate further temporal and spatial variations of the river systems in this study no consideration was given to the fate of activated carbons with a large amount of benzene adsorbed would the carbon particles enter the streambed and affect the eco system of the hyporheic zone would the adsorbed benzene become mobile and get released to the river water moreover how should the secondary pollution be considered in dealing with a major pollution incident using an in situ treatment method that only removes the pollutant from the river water temporarily but not completely from the river system these questions will provide directions for future research as motivated by the present study declaration of competing

18172,in nature many microorganisms show resistance to toxic selenite by reducing selenite to non soluble and low toxic elemental selenium extracellular polymeric substances eps a high molecular weight biopolymers originated from microbial metabolism contain many reducing groups and can induce reductive transformation of pollutants however the roles of eps and its redox state in reductive detoxification or reduction removal of selenite respectively remain unknown yet herein the reduction of selenite by different sources of eps was investigated selenite was proved to be reduced by eps and partly transformed to elemental selenium the formed elemental selenium was mainly selenium nanoparticles confirmed by transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy the redox state of eps governed selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation and the reduced state of eps was in favor of selenite reduction dissolved oxygen concentration in water regulated eps redox state and influenced selenite reduction the thiols aldehyde and phenolic groups in eps were responsible for selenite reduction under selenite stress eps was capable of increasing cell survivability by enhancing microorganisms mediated selenite reduction this work revealed the previously undiscovered roles of eps in selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation in aquatic environments and also suggested a possible crucial role of eps in selenium biogeochemical cycle graphical abstract image 1 keywords selenite reduction selenium nanoparticles senps extracellular polymeric substances eps redox state detoxification 1 introduction selenium as one kind of micronutrients is essential for life however it also exerts toxicity at a high concentration dessì et al 2016 jain et al 2015 though selenium is a trace element in nature the weathering of selenium rich rocks or anthropogenic activities like agricultural irrigation mining or smelting can release selenium into environments and increase the environmental risks of selenium ling et al 2015 luo et al 2018 excessive uptake of selenium can cause teratogenic defects and fatal reproductive of fish and pose a threat to human due to the bioaccumulation of selenium ohlendorf 2003 zhang et al 2008 the toxicity of selenium is closely related to its species among the diverse species of selenium including selenate selenite elemental selenium selenide and organic selenium selenite is accepted to be the most toxic species frankenberger and engberg 1998 when encountering toxic selenite diverse microorganisms including bacteria and fungi exhibit detoxification capabilities by reducing selenite to insoluble and less toxic elemental selenium ike et al 2000 li et al 2014 in addition to elemental selenium formation of selenide or organic selenium are also observed tan et al 2018 microbial reduction played a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of selenium and is regarded as the important source of naturally occurring elemental selenium the elemental selenium can be formed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by microbial reduction of selenite subsequently assembled to selenium nanoparticles senps wadhwani et al 2016 reduction of selenite to elemental selenium mediated by microorganisms is usually driven by thiol containing compounds such as glutathione thioredoxin and glutaredoxin garbisu et al 1996 nancharaiah and lens 2015 additionally some microorganisms reductase including nitrite reductase fumarate reductase and sulfite reductase etc can also catalyze selenite reduction to produce elemental selenium nancharaiah and lens 2015 based on the reducing capability of microorganisms for selenite some biologically reductive treatment technologies for selenite containing wastewater have been developed in recent decades nancharaiah et al 2018 tan et al 2018 during biological treatment the toxic selenite is removed by converting selenite to elemental selenium as well as volatile methylation products kagami et al 2013 reamer and zoller 1980 microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps are high molecular weight biopolymers originated from microorganisms secretion or cells lysis and are found to be widely and abundantly presented in natural waters bhaskar and bhosle 2005 flemming and wingender 2010 proteins polysaccharides and humic substances are the main components in microbial eps from various origins including biofilm and activated sludge sheng et al 2010 abundant functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl sulfhydryl phenolic and phosphoric groups are presented in eps giving the binding properties of eps for various heavy metals as well as organic pollutants sheng et al 2010 in the last few decades the adsorption property of eps for pollutants and the involved mechanisms have been well investigated recently the reductive property of eps has been gradually recognized and proved to influence the migration and transformation of pollutants as well as the detoxification of microorganisms kang et al 2013 kang and zhu 2013 zhang et al 2016 as aforementioned biotic reduction of selenite mediated by microorganisms is generally recognized and is critical for selenium biogeochemical cycle detoxification and enhanced removal however the possible roles of microbial eps in the biotic reduction of selenite have not yet been known considering the reductive capability of eps it is hypothesized that eps would participate in the reduction of selenite in addition the redox state of microbial eps probably varies with the depth of waters or the biological wastewater treatment regions containing different oxygen levels the redox state of eps probably influence the reduction of selenite which has been overlooked and needs to be investigated in the present work we attempted to demonstrate the role of eps at various redox states in the reduction of selenite to form elemental selenium eps extracted from escherichia coli dh5α e

adopted to confirm the formation of senps and reveal the physicochemical properties of formed senps the functional groups in eps responsible for selenite reduction were investigated the effects of redox state of eps dissolved oxygen do and ph on the selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation were explored further the role of eps in the reductive detoxification of microorganism under selenite stress was evaluated uncovering the role of eps in selenite reduction favored us to better understand the sources of senps and the fate of selenium in aquatic environments and the reductive detoxification mechanisms of selenite by microorganism 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria cultivation and eps extraction e coli dh5α or s oneidensis mr 1 single colony picked from luria bertani lb

elsewhere hansen et al 2007 2 3 selenite reduction and senps characterization experiments were conducted in 50 ml serum bottles containing 30 ml mixture of 100 mg c l eps and 1 0 mm selenite under nitrogen saturated and dark conditions serum bottles were shaken at 200 rpm and 30 c to investigate the effect of do on selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation the experiments were also performed under air balanced or oxygen saturated conditions ph buffer was adopted to control the solution ph to investigate the impact of ph on selenite reduction and elemental selenium generation sodium chloride was added to maintain the same ionic strength under different ph conditions at a pre determined specific time interval 1 ml of solution was sampled from each serum bottles then the samples were centrifuged 50 000 g 30 min to separate formed senps from suspension the concentration of residual selenite in filtrate was analyzed using ascorbic acid hcl method according to a previous work li et al 2014 in addition the total soluble selenium was also determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to calculate the mass balance of selenium the concentration of soluble selenium in other forms was calculated by minus the concentration of residual selenite from the concentration of total soluble selenium the harvested senps was characterized using transmission electron microscopy tem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds h 7650 hitachi co japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and ftir were also used to characterize the formed senps the surface charge of formed senps was measured using a malvern zetasizer zen3600 malvern instruments co uk the concentrations of formed elemental selenium under different conditions were quantified by icp ms after digestion to reveal the extent of selenite reduction the reduction efficiency of selenite e1 was defined and calculated as following equation 1 1 e 1 seo 3 2 0 seo 3 2 t seo 3 2 0 100 to understand how much of the reduced selenite was transformed to elemental selenium the production efficiency of elemental selenium from reduced selenite e2 was calculated as following equation 2 2 e 2 se 0 t seo 3 2 0 seo 3 2 t 100 where seo 3 2 0 and seo 3 2 t were the concentrations of selenite at initially and reaction time t respectively the se 0 t represented the concentration of formed elemental selenium at reaction time of t 2 4 role of eps in reductive detoxification of selenite by microorganism after eps extraction the residual e coli cell pellets were harvested and re suspended in m9 medium with succinate 20 mm as the carbon source followed by addition of selenite to desired concentration 1 0 mm the initial cell concentration was controlled at an od600 optical density of bacteria suspensions at λ 600 nm of 1 0 after that different amounts of extracted e coli eps were added to the bacteria suspensions the dosed eps with the concentrations of 250 mg c l and 500 mg c l were defined as the medium eps content and high eps content respectively the control without addition of extra eps was denoted as the low eps content after cultivation 48 h to reach stable growth

washed three times using deionized water to remove inorganic salts the obtained pellets including cells and elemental selenium was re suspended and fixed in glutaraldehyde 2 5 vol overnight the fixed samples were dehydrated using gradient concentration of ethanol 0 25 50 75 90 95 98 and 100 the prepared samples were subjected to tem characterization the concentration of residual selenite and generated elemental selenium were quantified as aforementioned methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation as shown in fig 1 a the concentration of selenite gradually decreased in the presence of eps with various redox states no selenite decrease was observed in the control without addition of eps fig 1 after 18 days reaction the levels of selenite reached equilibrium and the removal efficiencies of selenite were 23 7 33 4 and 17 8 by eps from e coli s oneidensis and sludge respectively indicating the universal capability of eps for selenite reduction however no selenite was removed in the medium containing oxidized eps fig 1 these results indicate that selenite was removed by eps mainly due to reduction rather than absorption considering of the different redox states of microbial eps in environments the eps were electrochemically treated to further reveal the effect of eps redox states on selenite reduction results show that the removal efficiencies of selenite by the reduced eps were enhanced to 41 3 54 7 and 36 8 respectively for eps from e coli s oneidensis and sludge fig 1 suggesting that the redox states of eps greatly influenced their capabilities for selenite reductive transformation after mixing the e coli eps and selenite solution for 5 days the solution exerted reddish color fig 2 a and the formed elemental selenium was mainly spherical nanoparticles with diameters around 200 nm as show in tem image fig 2a the eds fig 2b proved that the produced spherical nanoparticles were senps the xps spectrum of produced nanoparticles fig 2c showed two peaks centered at 55 3 and 56 2 ev which were assigned to se 3d5 2 and se 3d2 3 respectively further confirming the formation of elemental selenium gonzalez gil et al 2016 in addition senps were also generated in the solutions containing s oneidensis eps or sludge eps as shown in tem images and eds spectra fig s2 after 18 days reaction there were 83 1 105 9 and 82 9 μm senps formed in solutions containing original e coli eps s oneidensis eps and sludge eps respectively fig 2d in the solutions containing the reduced eps the amounts of the formed senps increased and were elevated to 163 3 212 4 and 149 2 μm respectively fig 2d this indicates that the redox states of eps would influence the selenite reduction and thus affected the formation of senps the production efficiencies of elemental selenium from reduced selenite in the solutions with different sources or redox states of eps were calculated to be 31 7 46 6 this implies that soluble selenium in other forms such as selenotrisulfides s se s probably generated during selenite reduction gennari et al 2014 the concentrations of total soluble selenium in different eps solution were all higher than the residual selenite fig s3 demonstrating that soluble selenium in other forms were formed the sum of soluble selenium and elemental selenium exceeded 92 of the total selenium fig s3 implying that negligible volatile selenium was formed senps produced from the reduction of selenite by microorganisms or activated sludge are usually capped by an organic layer e g protein or eps which govern the zeta potential and aggregation behavior of senps che et al 2017 jain et al 2015 as shown in fig s4a except for se 3d signal the signal of c1s o1s and n1s were all observed in the xps of the produced senps suggesting the presence of organic layer on the surface of the formed senps the amplifying tem image of senps fig s4b also shows that the formed senps were covered by one layer of organic compounds ftir spectrum was used to reveal the components of organic layer on the surface of senps fig s4c the peaks at 1653 and 1540 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching of co amide i and bending of n h amide ii in proteins respectively the major peaks at 1401 and 1385 cm 1 corresponded to oh bending of cooh or the stretching of coo abdulla et al 2010 the couple peaks at 1153 and 1082 cm 1 were the characterized stretching of c o c in polysaccharides zhang et al 2019 the three peaks at 988 933 and 862 cm 1 were related to the glycosidic bond or rings in polysaccharides kang et al 2013 the observed proteins and polysaccharides signals in ftir indicated that the formed senps were capped by eps as shown in fig s4d the zeta potentials of the formed senps under different conditions were all negative which increased their stability due to the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles furthermore the zeta potential of the formed senps mediated by different of eps were all nearly equal to those of the corresponding eps fig s4d indicating that the eps layer governed the surface charge of the formed senps capping layer e g eps or other organic matters on nanoparticles is believed to enhance the stability of nanoparticles in waters due to electrostatic repulsion or steric effect thio et al 2011 thus eps in natural waters or wastewater not only could reduce selenite to produce senps but also cap the formed senps and govern their surface charges and stability 3 2 functional groups of eps responsible for selenite reduction during reductive detoxification of selenite by many microorganisms the reducing thiol containing compounds in microorganisms are usually considered to drive the selenite reduction to elemental selenium nancharaiah and lens 2015 eps secreted by microorganisms has also been reported to contain plenty of thiol groups yu and fein 2016 implying that thiols in eps might contribute to the reduction of selenite herein to explore the role of thiols in eps in selenite reduction the sulfhydryl site concentrations in different eps were determined before and after reaction with selenite the initial concentrations of sulfhydryl sites in e coli eps s oneidensis eps and sludge eps were 43 5 59 2 and 31 6 μmol g c respectively fig 3 a after reacted with selenite the sulfhydryl site concentrations in all eps decreased to nearly zero fig 3a demonstrating the role of thiols of eps in selenite reduction in addition the contents of thiols in different sources of eps were positively correlated with the efficiencies of selenite reduction and elemental selenium production figs 1 2d and 3a this implied that thiols in eps possibly dominated the reduction of selenite by eps as earlier work reported selenite was first transformed to selenotrisulfides s se s by thiol containing compounds followed by the decomposition of s se s to form elemental selenium gennari et al 2014 to investigate whether other reducing groups of eps contribute to selenite reduction the ftir spectra of eps before and after reaction with selenite were collected as shown in fig 3b the double peaks of c o c 1045 and 1091 cm 1 in polysaccharides showed red shift 1080 and 1160 cm 1 and decreases in peak intensities after interaction with selenite besides the peaks at 985 and 833 cm 1 related to polysaccharides in eps almost disappeared after reaction with selenite these changes in ftir spectrum of eps suggested that the reducing saccharides of eps might participate in selenite reduction reducing saccharides are the important reducing components of eps and play a crucial role in the reductive transformation of heavy metals such as ag and au3 in which the hemiacetal or aldehyde groups was accepted to be the key reducing groups kang et al 2013 2017 due to the reducing capability of aldehyde groups glucose has been recently used as an environmentally friendly reducing agent for selenium nanomaterials synthesis from selenite zhang et al 2018 furthermore in ftir spectrum of eps the peak at 1236 cm 1 related to c o stretching of phenols abdulla et al 2010 also disappeared fig 3b which suggests that phenolic groups of eps also play a role in selenite reduction in the reduction of selenite by plant extracts phenolic groups in lignin has been reported to be responsible for selenite reduction sharma et al 2014 overall the thiols hemiacetal or aldehyde groups and phenolic groups of eps were responsible for eps mediated selenite reduction 3 3 factors affecting selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation by eps do level changes with the depth of natural waters or the wastewater treatment processes and possibly influence eps mediated reductive transformation zhang et al 2016 therefore in the present study the reduction of selenite by eps were conducted under nitrogen saturated air balanced and oxygen saturated conditions to elucidate the effect of do on selenite reduction as well as elemental selenium formation under nitrogen saturated condition at ph of 7 0 23 7 of selenite was reduced however the reduction efficiency of selenite e1 decreased to 13 5 and 11 3 respectively under air balanced and oxygen saturated conditions fig 4 the reducing capability of eps for selenite was weakened with elevated do level most likely due to the oxidation of reducing groups of eps by oxygen it was worth noting that although the reduction of selenite decreased in the presence of do the production of elemental selenium were nearly unchanged under oxic conditions p 0 05 fig 4 the production efficiencies of elemental selenium from reduced selenite e2 increased from 35 1 under nitrogen saturated condition to 63 8 and 84 9 under air balanced and oxygen saturated conditions respectively fig s5 these reflected that the presence of do was conducive to the conversion of selenite to elemental selenium rather than other forms of selenium such as selenotrisulfides s se s with ph increased from 4 0 to 7 0 the reduction efficiency of selenite increased gradually however when the ph continuously increased to 10 0 the reduction efficiency decreased fig 4 the greatest reduction efficiency of selenite was observed at ph 7 0 fig 4 in addition the production of elemental selenium exerted the same trend as the reduction of selenite fig 4 at ph 4 0 or 10 0 the reduction of selenite were negligible fig 4 increasing solution ph would decrease the redox potential of selenite which was not conducive to selenite reduction nevertheless decreasing the ph would increase the redox potential of the reducing groups such as thiols and phenolic groups in eps according to previous work aeschbacher et al 2012 chiu and reinhard 1996 thus inhibited the reduction of selenite by eps in addition with the decrease of ph the molecular structure of eps changed from extended random structures to compact structure li and yu 2014 thereby decreased the available reducing sites in eps to selenite and weakening selenite reduction in brief neutral condition was most favorable for eps mediated selenite reduction 3 4 enhanced microbial detoxification of selenite by dosing eps many microorganisms show resistance to selenite due to their capabilities to reduce selenite to insoluble and low toxic elemental selenium wadhwani et al 2016 considering the capability of eps for reducing selenite to elemental selenium herein different amount of eps were added to e coli cell suspensions to investigate the role of eps in microbial detoxification of selenite the live dead cell staining results shown in fig 5 a indicated that cells viability decreased with dosing of selenite after 48 h however the toxicity of selenite to cells were weakened in the presence of eps evidenced by higher cell viability after dosing eps fig 5a to confirm the role of eps in enhancing cells survivability under selenite stress the cells concentration was determined using plate count as shown in fig 5b after cultivated for 48 h the cell densities in the medium with selenite were much lower compared with that in the medium without selenite indicating that the spiked selenite resulted in cell death the cell densities in the medium containing selenite with medium and high contents of eps were 1 6 p 0 05 and 2 4 p 0 01 times of that in the medium containing selenite without dosing eps however the cells densities after addition of oxidized eps were nearly equal to that without dosing eps p 0 05 fig 5b with addition of eps more selenite reduction and senps formation were observed fig 5c e without addition of eps only 35 1 of selenite was reduced fig 5e due to the reduction of selenite by e coli cells however after spiking medium and high contents of eps the values increased to 54 0 and 76 5 respectively fig 5e simultaneously the production of elemental selenium increased by 3 3 and 6 6 times fig 5e respectively these suggested that the presence of eps enhanced the reduction of selenite to less toxic elemental selenium hence the enhanced survivability of cells by eps resulted from the reduction of selenite by eps furthermore the extracellular formation of senps induced by eps probably inhibited selenium to get into cells due to the large sizes of the formed nanoparticles which possibly also contributed to the increase in cell survivability 3 5 possible reduction mechanism of selenite by eps at various redox states the present study demonstrate that thiols aldehyde as well as phenolic groups of eps were responsible for selenite reduction and the possible reduction mechanism of selenite by eps is illustrated in fig 6 the thiols of eps probably complexed selenite to form s se s intermediate and then the s se s decomposed to form elemental selenium and disulfide 32 the produced elemental selenium would assemble to senps the thiols as the reducing groups of eps to participate in the reduction of contaminants has not been reported yet the finding of the crucial role of thiols in eps mediated selenite reduction imply that thiols possibly played a role in eps induced reductive transformation of other contaminants especially for the sulfophilic element gu et al 2011 the aldehyde or hemiacetal and phenolic groups have been previously recognized as the important reducing groups in eps and participate in the eps induced reductive transformation of several contaminants kang et al 2013 kang and zhu 2013 zhang et al 2016 the reduction of selenite by aldehydes or phenolic groups of eps might be thermodynamically feasible because the aldehydes in glucose and phenolic groups in lignin could reduce selenite to elemental selenium sharma et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 do probably oxidized some reducing groups such as thiols in eps bagiyan et al 2003 and thus changed the redox state of eps which would weaken the reduction of selenite and decrease the detoxification capability of microorganisms fig 6 facultative anaerobes such as e coli dh5α and s oneidensis mr 1 can survive under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the redox states of eps of these microbes may vary with the do in waters concerning to sludge eps its redox state may also change with the do in the different biological wastewater treatment regions the findings of the present work revealed that the redox state of eps had great impact on the reductive transformation of selenite and the reduced state of eps was conducive to selenite reduction fig 1 therefore the oxygen concentration gradient of natural waters possibly regulates the redox state of eps and thereby deeply influences selenite reduction and elemental selenium generation eps induced formation of naturally occurring senps and reductive transformation of selenite or even other contaminants e g ag cr6 hg2 should be assessed by considering oxygen level in aquatic environments in terms of biological selenite removal from wastewater removal of selenite can be improved by enhancing the production of eps and decreasing the redox potential to keep eps at the reduced state 3 6 significances of this study the present study revealed the previously unrecognized role of eps in selenite detoxification by microorganisms this new findings complemented the reductive detoxification mechanisms of microorganisms for toxic selenite on the other hand given the ubiquity and abundance of microbial eps in the environments the uncovered role of eps in selenite reduction implied that eps participate in selenium biogeochemical cycle and deeply influence selenium species taking e coli dh5α induced selenite reduction as an example the eps content of e coli dh5α was measured as 67 3 mg g dry cell table s1 thus the eps content of e coli cells at od600 of 1 0 was estimated to be 22 2 mg l with the assumption that the ratio of od600 to dry cell weight was 3 0 glazyrina et al 2010 according to selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation induced by e coli eps and e coli cells without eps figs 1 2d and 5e the eps with reduced state was estimated to contribute 20 7 and 30 1 of selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation induced by e coli in natural waters these would benefit researchers to get a deeper understanding of the fate of selenium and re evaluate the sources of senps in the environments moreover this study highlights the importance of eps redox state in the transformation of contaminants 4 conclusions this work demonstrated that eps from various origins including pure bacteria and activated sludge could reduce selenite to elemental selenium in aquatic environments the formed senps were coated by eps and exhibited negative surface charge the thiols aldehyde or hemiacetal and phenolic groups of eps were found to be the reducing groups for selenite reduction selenite reduction by eps was deeply influenced by the redox state of eps do and ph the reduced state of eps lower level of do and neutral condition were favorable for selenite reduction moreover eps induced reductive transformation to elemental selenium could improve detoxification capability and tolerance of microorganisms under selenite stress in summary microbial eps played a crucial but previously unrecognized role in the reduction of selenite thereby contributing to the reductive detoxification and removal of selenite declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18172,in nature many microorganisms show resistance to toxic selenite by reducing selenite to non soluble and low toxic elemental selenium extracellular polymeric substances eps a high molecular weight biopolymers originated from microbial metabolism contain many reducing groups and can induce reductive transformation of pollutants however the roles of eps and its redox state in reductive detoxification or reduction removal of selenite respectively remain unknown yet herein the reduction of selenite by different sources of eps was investigated selenite was proved to be reduced by eps and partly transformed to elemental selenium the formed elemental selenium was mainly selenium nanoparticles confirmed by transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy the redox state of eps governed selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation and the reduced state of eps was in favor of selenite reduction dissolved oxygen concentration in water regulated eps redox state and influenced selenite reduction the thiols aldehyde and phenolic groups in eps were responsible for selenite reduction under selenite stress eps was capable of increasing cell survivability by enhancing microorganisms mediated selenite reduction this work revealed the previously undiscovered roles of eps in selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation in aquatic environments and also suggested a possible crucial role of eps in selenium biogeochemical cycle graphical abstract image 1 keywords selenite reduction selenium nanoparticles senps extracellular polymeric substances eps redox state detoxification 1 introduction selenium as one kind of micronutrients is essential for life however it also exerts toxicity at a high concentration dessì et al 2016 jain et al 2015 though selenium is a trace element in nature the weathering of selenium rich rocks or anthropogenic activities like agricultural irrigation mining or smelting can release selenium into environments and increase the environmental risks of selenium ling et al 2015 luo et al 2018 excessive uptake of selenium can cause teratogenic defects and fatal reproductive of fish and pose a threat to human due to the bioaccumulation of selenium ohlendorf 2003 zhang et al 2008 the toxicity of selenium is closely related to its species among the diverse species of selenium including selenate selenite elemental selenium selenide and organic selenium selenite is accepted to be the most toxic species frankenberger and engberg 1998 when encountering toxic selenite diverse microorganisms including bacteria and fungi exhibit detoxification capabilities by reducing selenite to insoluble and less toxic elemental selenium ike et al 2000 li et al 2014 in addition to elemental selenium formation of selenide or organic selenium are also observed tan et al 2018 microbial reduction played a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of selenium and is regarded as the important source of naturally occurring elemental selenium the elemental selenium can be formed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by microbial reduction of selenite subsequently assembled to selenium nanoparticles senps wadhwani et al 2016 reduction of selenite to elemental selenium mediated by microorganisms is usually driven by thiol containing compounds such as glutathione thioredoxin and glutaredoxin garbisu et al 1996 nancharaiah and lens 2015 additionally some microorganisms reductase including nitrite reductase fumarate reductase and sulfite reductase etc can also catalyze selenite reduction to produce elemental selenium nancharaiah and lens 2015 based on the reducing capability of microorganisms for selenite some biologically reductive treatment technologies for selenite containing wastewater have been developed in recent decades nancharaiah et al 2018 tan et al 2018 during biological treatment the toxic selenite is removed by converting selenite to elemental selenium as well as volatile methylation products kagami et al 2013 reamer and zoller 1980 microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps are high molecular weight biopolymers originated from microorganisms secretion or cells lysis and are found to be widely and abundantly presented in natural waters bhaskar and bhosle 2005 flemming and wingender 2010 proteins polysaccharides and humic substances are the main components in microbial eps from various origins including biofilm and activated sludge sheng et al 2010 abundant functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl sulfhydryl phenolic and phosphoric groups are presented in eps giving the binding properties of eps for various heavy metals as well as organic pollutants sheng et al 2010 in the last few decades the adsorption property of eps for pollutants and the involved mechanisms have been well investigated recently the reductive property of eps has been gradually recognized and proved to influence the migration and transformation of pollutants as well as the detoxification of microorganisms kang et al 2013 kang and zhu 2013 zhang et al 2016 as aforementioned biotic reduction of selenite mediated by microorganisms is generally recognized and is critical for selenium biogeochemical cycle detoxification and enhanced removal however the possible roles of microbial eps in the biotic reduction of selenite have not yet been known considering the reductive capability of eps it is hypothesized that eps would participate in the reduction of selenite in addition the redox state of microbial eps probably varies with the depth of waters or the biological wastewater treatment regions containing different oxygen levels the redox state of eps probably influence the reduction of selenite which has been overlooked and needs to be investigated in the present work we attempted to demonstrate the role of eps at various redox states in the reduction of selenite to form elemental selenium eps extracted from escherichia coli dh5α e coli dh5α shewanella oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 and activated sludge were used to investigate the universal reductive capabilities of eps for selenite multiple analytical technologies were adopted to confirm the formation of senps and reveal the physicochemical properties of formed senps the functional groups in eps responsible for selenite reduction were investigated the effects of redox state of eps dissolved oxygen do and ph on the selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation were explored further the role of eps in the reductive detoxification of microorganism under selenite stress was evaluated uncovering the role of eps in selenite reduction favored us to better understand the sources of senps and the fate of selenium in aquatic environments and the reductive detoxification mechanisms of selenite by microorganism 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria cultivation and eps extraction e coli dh5α or s oneidensis mr 1 single colony picked from luria bertani lb agar plate were inoculated into 1 l of fresh lb medium to cultivate at 37 and 30 c respectively for 12 h with 200 rpm shaking subsequently the bacteria cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min and washed three times by 0 9 nacl to remove the residual medium activated sludge floc was collected from a local municipal sewage plant hefei china and washed three times using 0 9 nacl for eps extraction eps were extracted from bacteria or activated sludge using cation exchange resin cer na form sigma specifically the bacteria pellets or sludge floc were re suspended in 0 9 nacl solution with addition of cer 60 g g dry cell the cells or sludge suspensions were stirred at 4 c and 800 rpm for 6 h after that cer was firstly separated from suspensions by settling and the cell pellets or sludge were subsequently removed by centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min the supernatant were further filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose membrane to obtain bacteria free eps the extracted eps without further treatment was denoted as original eps dissolved eps 500 mg c l were electrochemically reduced and oxidized in a three electrode electrochemical cell to prepare reduced and oxidized eps respectively aeschbacher et al 2009 the three electrode system was consisted of a carbon paper 1 cm 2 cm working electrode a pt foil counter electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode the reduced and oxidized eps were prepared at 0 6 v and 0 6 v controlled by a potentiostat chi660e chenhua shanghai china respectively for 12 h the prepared eps were temporarily stored in anaerobic glove box and were used within two days 2 2 eps characterization the concentration of eps was determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena co germany the contents of proteins and humic substances in eps were measured by modified lowry method the polysaccharides content in eps was determined using anthrone method the content of dna in eps was quantified by diphenylamine colorimetric method to determine the extent of cell lysis during the extraction of eps low contents of dna presented in each extracted eps indicated that the cell lysis were negligible zhang et al

ftir spectroscopy vertex 70 bruker germany to identify the reducing functional groups participated in selenite reduction the free thiols in eps were quantified by measuring the content of formed 4 thiopyridone using high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa after thiols reacted with 4 4 dithiodipyridine more details about the quantification of free thiol could be found elsewhere hansen et al 2007 2 3 selenite reduction and senps characterization experiments were conducted in 50 ml serum bottles containing 30 ml mixture of 100 mg c l eps and 1 0 mm selenite under nitrogen saturated and dark conditions serum bottles were shaken at 200 rpm and 30 c to investigate the effect of do on selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation the experiments were also performed under air balanced or oxygen saturated conditions ph buffer was adopted to control the solution ph to investigate the impact of ph on selenite reduction and elemental selenium generation sodium chloride was added to maintain the same ionic strength under different ph conditions at a pre determined specific time interval 1 ml of solution was sampled from each serum bottles then the samples were centrifuged 50 000 g 30 min to separate formed senps from suspension the concentration of residual selenite in filtrate was analyzed using ascorbic acid hcl method according to a previous work li et al 2014 in addition the total soluble selenium was also determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to calculate the mass balance of selenium the concentration of soluble selenium in other forms was calculated by minus the concentration of residual selenite from the concentration of total soluble selenium the harvested senps was characterized using transmission electron microscopy tem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds h 7650 hitachi co japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and ftir were also used to characterize the formed senps the surface charge of formed senps was measured using a malvern zetasizer zen3600 malvern instruments co uk the concentrations of formed elemental selenium under different conditions were quantified by

understand how much of the reduced selenite was transformed to elemental selenium the production efficiency of elemental selenium from reduced selenite e2 was calculated as following equation 2 2 e 2 se 0 t seo 3 2 0 seo 3 2 t 100 where seo 3 2 0 and seo 3 2 t were the concentrations of selenite at initially and reaction time t respectively the se 0 t represented the concentration of formed elemental selenium at reaction time of t 2 4 role of eps in reductive detoxification of selenite by microorganism after eps extraction the residual e coli cell pellets were harvested and re suspended in m9 medium with succinate 20 mm as the carbon source followed by addition of selenite to desired concentration 1 0 mm the initial cell concentration was controlled at an od600 optical density of bacteria suspensions at λ 600 nm of 1 0 after that different amounts of extracted e coli eps were added to the bacteria suspensions the dosed eps with the concentrations of 250 mg c l and 500 mg c l were defined as the medium eps content and high eps content respectively the control without addition of extra eps was denoted as the low eps content after cultivation 48 h to reach stable growth phase fig s1 the cells was stained using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kits thermo scientific usa to judge the cells viability in suspensions in addition the cells concentration after dosing selenite for 48 h were determined by using the graredient dilution and plate method the bacteria cells and formed elemental selenium after 48 h cultivation were collected by centrifugation and washed three times using deionized water to remove inorganic salts the obtained pellets including cells and elemental selenium was re suspended and fixed in glutaraldehyde 2 5 vol overnight the fixed samples were dehydrated using gradient concentration of ethanol 0 25 50 75 90 95 98 and 100 the prepared samples were subjected to tem characterization the concentration of residual selenite and generated elemental selenium were quantified as aforementioned methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation as shown in fig 1 a the concentration of selenite gradually decreased in the presence of eps with various redox states no selenite decrease was observed in the control without addition of eps fig 1 after 18 days reaction the levels of selenite reached equilibrium and the removal efficiencies of selenite were 23 7 33 4 and 17 8 by eps from e coli s oneidensis and sludge respectively indicating the universal capability of eps for selenite reduction however no selenite was removed in the medium containing oxidized eps fig 1 these results indicate that selenite was removed by eps mainly due to reduction rather than absorption considering of the different redox states of microbial eps in environments the eps were electrochemically treated to further reveal the effect of eps redox states on selenite reduction results show that the removal efficiencies of selenite by the reduced eps were enhanced to 41 3 54 7 and 36 8 respectively for eps from e coli s oneidensis and sludge fig 1 suggesting that the redox states of eps greatly influenced their capabilities for selenite reductive transformation after mixing the e coli eps and selenite solution for 5 days the solution exerted reddish color fig 2 a and the formed elemental selenium was mainly spherical nanoparticles with diameters around 200 nm as show in tem image fig 2a the eds fig 2b proved that the produced spherical nanoparticles were senps the xps spectrum of produced nanoparticles fig 2c showed two peaks centered at 55 3 and 56 2 ev which were assigned to se 3d5 2 and se 3d2 3 respectively further confirming the formation of elemental selenium gonzalez gil et al 2016 in addition senps were also generated in the solutions containing s oneidensis eps or sludge eps as shown in tem images and eds spectra fig s2 after 18 days reaction there were 83 1 105 9 and 82 9 μm senps formed in solutions containing original e coli eps s oneidensis eps and sludge eps respectively fig 2d in the solutions containing the reduced eps the amounts of the formed senps increased and were elevated to 163 3 212 4 and 149 2 μm respectively fig 2d this indicates that the redox states of eps would influence the selenite reduction and thus affected the formation of senps the production efficiencies of elemental selenium from reduced selenite in the solutions with different sources or redox states of eps were calculated to be 31 7 46 6 this implies that soluble selenium in other forms such as selenotrisulfides s se s probably generated during selenite reduction gennari et al 2014 the concentrations of total soluble selenium in different eps solution were all higher than the residual selenite fig s3 demonstrating that soluble selenium in other forms were formed the sum of soluble selenium and elemental selenium exceeded 92 of the total selenium fig s3 implying that negligible volatile selenium was formed senps produced from the reduction of selenite by microorganisms or activated sludge are usually capped by an organic layer e g protein or eps which govern the zeta potential and aggregation behavior of senps che et al 2017 jain et al 2015 as shown in fig s4a except for se 3d signal the signal of c1s o1s and n1s were all observed in the xps of the produced senps suggesting the presence of organic layer on the surface of the formed senps the amplifying tem image of senps fig s4b also shows that the formed senps were covered by one layer of organic compounds ftir spectrum was used to reveal the components of organic layer on the surface of senps fig s4c the peaks at 1653 and 1540 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching of co amide i and bending of n h amide ii in proteins respectively the major peaks at 1401 and 1385 cm 1 corresponded to oh bending of cooh or the stretching of coo abdulla et al 2010 the couple peaks at 1153 and 1082 cm 1 were the characterized stretching of c o c in polysaccharides zhang et al 2019 the three peaks at 988 933 and 862 cm 1 were related to the glycosidic bond or rings in polysaccharides kang et al 2013 the observed proteins and polysaccharides signals in ftir indicated that the formed senps were capped by eps as shown in fig s4d the zeta potentials of the formed senps under different conditions were all negative which increased their stability due to the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles furthermore the zeta potential of the formed senps mediated by different of eps were all nearly equal to those of the corresponding eps fig s4d indicating that the eps layer governed the surface charge of the formed senps capping layer e g eps or other organic matters on nanoparticles is believed to enhance the stability of nanoparticles in waters due to electrostatic repulsion or steric effect thio et al 2011 thus eps in natural waters or wastewater not only could reduce selenite to produce senps but also cap the formed senps and govern their surface charges and stability 3 2 functional groups of eps responsible for selenite reduction during reductive detoxification of selenite by many microorganisms the reducing thiol containing compounds in microorganisms are usually considered to drive the selenite reduction to elemental selenium nancharaiah and lens 2015 eps secreted by microorganisms has also been reported to contain plenty of thiol groups yu and fein 2016 implying that thiols in eps might contribute to the reduction of selenite herein to explore the role of thiols in eps in selenite reduction the sulfhydryl site concentrations in different eps were determined before and after reaction with selenite the initial concentrations of sulfhydryl sites in e coli eps s oneidensis eps and sludge eps were 43 5 59 2 and 31 6 μmol g c respectively fig 3 a after reacted with selenite the sulfhydryl site concentrations in all eps decreased to nearly zero fig 3a demonstrating the role of thiols of eps in selenite reduction in addition the contents of thiols in different sources of eps were positively correlated with the efficiencies of selenite reduction and elemental selenium production figs 1 2d and 3a this implied that thiols in eps possibly dominated the reduction of selenite by eps as earlier work reported selenite was first transformed to selenotrisulfides s se s by thiol containing compounds followed by the decomposition of s se s to form elemental selenium gennari et al 2014 to investigate whether other reducing groups of eps contribute to selenite reduction the ftir spectra of eps before and after reaction with selenite were collected as shown in fig 3b the double peaks of c o c 1045 and 1091 cm 1 in polysaccharides showed red shift 1080 and 1160 cm 1 and decreases in peak intensities after interaction with selenite besides the peaks at 985 and 833 cm 1 related to polysaccharides in eps almost disappeared after reaction with selenite these changes in ftir spectrum of eps suggested that the reducing saccharides of eps might participate in selenite reduction reducing saccharides are the important reducing components of eps and play a crucial role in the reductive transformation of heavy metals such as ag and au3 in which the hemiacetal or aldehyde groups was accepted to be the key reducing groups kang et al 2013 2017 due to the reducing capability of aldehyde groups glucose has been recently used as an environmentally friendly reducing agent for selenium nanomaterials synthesis from selenite zhang et al 2018 furthermore in ftir spectrum of eps the peak at 1236 cm 1 related to c o stretching of phenols abdulla et al 2010 also disappeared fig 3b which suggests that phenolic groups of eps also play a role in selenite reduction in the reduction of selenite by plant extracts phenolic groups in lignin has been reported to be responsible for selenite reduction sharma et al 2014 overall the thiols hemiacetal or aldehyde groups and phenolic groups of eps were responsible for eps mediated selenite reduction 3 3 factors affecting selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation by eps do level changes with the depth of natural waters or the wastewater treatment processes and possibly influence eps mediated reductive transformation zhang et al 2016 therefore in the present study the reduction of selenite by eps were conducted under nitrogen saturated air balanced and oxygen saturated conditions to elucidate the effect of do on selenite reduction as well as elemental selenium formation under nitrogen saturated condition at ph of 7 0 23 7 of selenite was reduced however the reduction efficiency of selenite e1 decreased to 13 5 and 11 3 respectively under air balanced and oxygen saturated conditions fig 4 the reducing capability of eps for selenite was weakened with elevated do level most likely due to the oxidation of reducing groups of eps by oxygen it was worth noting that although the reduction of selenite decreased in the presence of do the production of elemental selenium were nearly unchanged under oxic conditions p 0 05 fig 4 the production efficiencies of elemental selenium from reduced selenite e2 increased from 35 1 under nitrogen saturated condition to 63 8 and 84 9 under air balanced and oxygen saturated conditions respectively fig s5 these reflected that the presence of do was conducive to the conversion of selenite to elemental selenium rather than other forms of selenium such as selenotrisulfides s se s with ph increased from 4 0 to 7 0 the reduction efficiency of selenite increased gradually however when the ph continuously increased to 10 0 the reduction efficiency decreased fig 4 the greatest reduction efficiency of selenite was observed at ph 7 0 fig 4 in addition the production of elemental selenium exerted the same trend as the reduction of selenite fig 4 at ph 4 0 or 10 0 the reduction of selenite were negligible fig 4 increasing solution ph would decrease the redox potential of selenite which was not conducive to selenite reduction nevertheless decreasing the ph would increase the redox potential of the reducing groups such as thiols and phenolic groups in eps according to previous work aeschbacher et al 2012 chiu and reinhard 1996 thus inhibited the reduction of selenite by eps in addition with the decrease of ph the molecular structure of eps changed from extended random structures to compact structure li and yu 2014 thereby decreased the available reducing sites in eps to selenite and weakening selenite reduction in brief neutral condition was most favorable for eps mediated selenite reduction 3 4 enhanced microbial detoxification of selenite by dosing eps many microorganisms show resistance to selenite due to their capabilities to reduce selenite to insoluble and low toxic elemental selenium wadhwani et al 2016 considering the capability of eps for reducing selenite to elemental selenium herein different amount of eps were added to e coli cell suspensions to investigate the role of eps in microbial detoxification of selenite the live dead cell staining results shown in fig 5 a indicated that cells viability decreased with dosing of selenite after 48 h however the toxicity of selenite to cells were weakened in the presence of eps evidenced by higher cell viability after dosing eps fig 5a to confirm the role of eps in enhancing cells survivability under selenite stress the cells concentration was determined using plate count as shown in fig 5b after cultivated for 48 h the cell densities in the medium with selenite were much lower compared with that in the medium without selenite indicating that the spiked selenite resulted in cell death the cell densities in the medium containing selenite with medium and high contents of eps were 1 6 p 0 05 and 2 4 p 0 01 times of that in the medium containing selenite without dosing eps however the cells densities after addition of oxidized eps were nearly equal to that without dosing eps p 0 05 fig 5b with addition of eps more selenite reduction and senps formation were observed fig 5c e without addition of eps only 35 1 of selenite was reduced fig 5e due to the reduction of selenite by e coli cells however after spiking medium and high contents of eps the values increased to 54 0 and 76 5 respectively fig 5e simultaneously the production of elemental selenium increased by 3 3 and 6 6 times fig 5e respectively these suggested that the presence of eps enhanced the reduction of selenite to less toxic elemental selenium hence the enhanced survivability of cells by eps resulted from the reduction of selenite by eps furthermore the extracellular formation of senps induced by eps probably inhibited selenium to get into cells due to the large sizes of the formed nanoparticles which possibly also contributed to the increase in cell survivability 3 5 possible reduction mechanism of selenite by eps at various redox states the present study demonstrate that thiols aldehyde as well as phenolic groups of eps were responsible for selenite reduction and the possible reduction mechanism of selenite by eps is illustrated in fig 6 the thiols of eps probably complexed selenite to form s se s intermediate and then the s se s decomposed to form elemental selenium and disulfide 32 the produced elemental selenium would assemble to senps the thiols as the reducing groups of eps to participate in the reduction of contaminants has not been reported yet the finding of the crucial role of thiols in eps mediated selenite reduction imply that thiols possibly played a role in eps induced reductive transformation of other contaminants especially for the sulfophilic element gu et al 2011 the aldehyde or hemiacetal and phenolic groups have been previously recognized as the important reducing groups in eps and participate in the eps induced reductive transformation of several contaminants kang et al 2013 kang and zhu 2013 zhang et al 2016 the reduction of selenite by aldehydes or phenolic groups of eps might be thermodynamically feasible because the aldehydes in glucose and phenolic groups in lignin could reduce selenite to elemental selenium sharma et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 do probably oxidized some reducing groups such as thiols in eps bagiyan et al 2003 and thus changed the redox state of eps which would weaken the reduction of selenite and decrease the detoxification capability of microorganisms fig 6 facultative anaerobes such as e coli dh5α and s oneidensis mr 1 can survive under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the redox states of eps of these microbes may vary with the do in waters concerning to sludge eps its redox state may also change with the do in the different biological wastewater treatment regions the findings of the present work revealed that the redox state of eps had great impact on the reductive transformation of selenite and the reduced state of eps was conducive to selenite reduction fig 1 therefore the oxygen concentration gradient of natural waters possibly regulates the redox state of eps and thereby deeply influences selenite reduction and elemental selenium generation eps induced formation of naturally occurring senps and reductive transformation of selenite or even other contaminants e g ag cr6 hg2 should be assessed by considering oxygen level in aquatic environments in terms of biological selenite removal from wastewater removal of selenite can be improved by enhancing the production of eps and decreasing the redox potential to keep eps at the reduced state 3 6 significances of this study the present study revealed the previously unrecognized role of eps in selenite detoxification by microorganisms this new findings complemented the reductive detoxification mechanisms of microorganisms for toxic selenite on the other hand given the ubiquity and abundance of microbial eps in the environments the uncovered role of eps in selenite reduction implied that eps participate in selenium biogeochemical cycle and deeply influence selenium species taking e coli dh5α induced selenite reduction as an example the eps content of e coli dh5α was measured as 67 3 mg g dry cell table s1 thus the eps content of e coli cells at od600 of 1 0 was estimated to be 22 2 mg l with the assumption that the ratio of od600 to dry cell weight was 3 0 glazyrina et al 2010 according to selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation induced by e coli eps and e coli cells without eps figs 1 2d and 5e the eps with reduced state was estimated to contribute 20 7 and 30 1 of selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation induced by e coli in natural waters these would benefit researchers to get a deeper understanding of the fate of selenium and re evaluate the sources of senps in the environments moreover this study highlights the importance of eps redox state in the transformation of contaminants 4 conclusions this work demonstrated that eps from various origins including pure bacteria and activated sludge could reduce selenite to elemental selenium in aquatic environments the formed senps were coated by eps and exhibited negative surface charge the thiols aldehyde or hemiacetal and phenolic groups of eps were found to be the reducing groups for selenite reduction selenite reduction by eps was deeply influenced by the redox state of eps do and ph the reduced state of eps lower level of do and neutral condition were favorable for selenite reduction moreover eps induced reductive transformation to elemental selenium could improve detoxification capability and tolerance of microorganisms under selenite stress in summary microbial eps played a crucial but previously unrecognized role in the reduction of selenite thereby contributing to the reductive detoxification and removal of selenite declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18173,poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a wide group of environmentally persistent organic compounds of industrial origin which are of great concern due to their harmful impact on human health and ecosystems amongst long chain pfas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos are the most detected in the aquatic environment even though their use has been limited by recent regulations recently more attention has been posed on the short chain compounds due to their use as an alternative to long chain ones and to their high mobility in the water bodies therefore short chain pfas have been increasingly detected in the environmental compartments the main process investigated and implemented for pfas removal is adsorption however to date most adsorption studies have focused on synthetic water the main objective of this article is to provide a critical review of the recent peer reviewed studies on the removal of long and short chain pfas by adsorption specific objectives are to review 1 the performance of different adsorbents for both long and short chain pfas 2 the effect of organic matter and 3 the adsorbent regeneration techniques strong anion exchange resins seem to better remove both long and short chain pfas however the adsorption capacity of short chain pfas is lower than that observed for long chain pfas therefore short chain pfas removal is more challenging furthermore the effect of organic matter on pfas adsorption in water or wastewater under real environmental conditions is overlooked in most studies high pfas levels have been often investigated without organic matter presence the rapid breakthrough of pfas is also a limiting factor and the regeneration of pfas exhausted adsorbents is very challenging and needs more

treatment plants 1 introduction 1 1 pfas classification poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a large group of anthropogenic aliphatic compounds that are of increasing concern worldwide due to their impact on environment and human health for many decades they have been used in an array of formulations as surfactants intermediates i e firefighting foams hydraulic fluids for aircrafts waterproofing treatment for textiles i e apparel carpet and household products i e paper and non stick cookware coating buck et al 2011 rahman et al 2014 xiao 2017 pfas contamination is the result of consumer product degradation firefighting activities and discharges of fluorochemical manufacturing facilities hu et al 2016 pfas are made up of a chain of varying carbon length on which at least one polyfluoroalkyl acids or all perfluoroalkyl acids of the hydrogen atoms bound to carbon chain in the nonfluorinated substances have been replaced by fluorine atoms buck et al 2011 their chemical structure also includes a charged functional group commonly carboxylic or sulfonic acids attached at one end polyfluoroalkyl acids have also been indicated as precursors of perfluoroalkyl ones hence the non fluorinated bond provides a biotic or abiotic degradation pathway itrc 2017 depending on their terminal functional group pfas can be distinguished in perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and in perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas buck et al 2011 however an abridged way to distinguish among pfas subclasses is that referred to carbon chain length according to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd the term long chain compound indicates pfcas with eight or more carbons and pfsas with six or more carbons whereas short chain is related to pfcas with seven or fewer carbons and pfsas with five or fewer carbons oecd unep global pfc group 2013 it should be noted that pfcas and pfsas classification based on chain length is different in terms of number of carbon atoms however pfas bioaccumulation and biomagnification into biota increase with the increasing of carbon chain length pfsas are more bioaccumulate than pfcas with the same chain length ahrens 2011 1 2 pfas properties the knowledge of pfas physical and chemical properties is paramount to understand their fate and transport in the environment the c f bound is the strongest covalent bond in organic chemistry and it leads to pfas thermal stability itrc 2017 in addition pfas exhibit mutually hydrophobic and lipophobic properties which are primarily attributed to the low polarizability of fluorine atoms moreover the terminal functional group attached to fluoroalkyl chain provides pfas chemical stability with the increasing replacement of hydrogen by fluorine as well as the increasing carbon chain length pfas become more chemically inert on the contrary their water solubility increases with the decreasing carbon chain length kucharzyk et al 2017 pfcas and pfsas are characterized by a low vapor pressure which makes air stripping an unsuitable technique for pfas removal rahman et al 2014 with the increasing c f chain length pfas become more lipophilic as demonstrated by octanol water partition coefficients kow at environmentally relevant ph pfas exhibit anionic species according to their low values of acid dissociation constant pka other properties such as resistance to thermal biological and chemical degradation and redox stability impart unique features to pfas making them suitable for several industrial applications information regarding chemical formulas and chemical abstracts service cas of selected per fluoroalkyl substances along with their physical and chemical properties are reported in table 1 1 3 occurrence of pfas in water in the aquatic environment pfas have been detected at low concentrations ranging from pg l 1 to μg l 1 kaboré et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 and long chain compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are the most commonly measured pfas around the world itrc 2017 widespread occurrence of pfas in urban water cycle including wastewater ww river water rw lake water lw drinking water dw stormwater and groundwater gw has been demonstrated by several studies appleman et al 2014 arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 ateia et al 2019 hölzer et al 2009 munoz et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 the amount of pfas not removed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and consequently released into the receiving environment is a concern for the possible presence of these compounds in water used for potable supply production a recent research suggests that the possible impacts of pfas on gw is linked to the use of treated ww for irrigation szabo et al 2018 the occurrence and distribution of pfas remain not completely identified due to the limited data about the removal efficiency of conventional water treatment plants and about the transformation of pfas precursor compounds appleman et al 2014 arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 although the use of pfos and pfoa has been reduced due to their health impact the total amount of pfas introduced into the environment has not been reduced because the long chain compounds have been replaced by short and ultra short pfas ateia et al 2019 the latter are potentially less bioaccumulated and bioconcentrated through trophic levels as compared to long chain but they are still environmentally persistent brendel et al 2018 oecd unep global pfc group 2013 1 4 pfas toxicity pfas are absorbed in human body after oral ingestion they are not metabolized and they are detected in human tissue and blood serum at typical concentrations of ng ml 1 long chain pfas are taken up and stored preferentially in the liver half life values of pfos and pfoa in humans range from 2 3 to 5 4 years hölzer et al 2009 stubleski et al 2017 epidemiological studies have shown that the occurrence of pfoa and pfos in humans is probably linked to a high incidence of thyroid disease high cholesterol ulcerative colitis kidney cancer testicular cancer and pregnancy induced hypertension crawford et al 2017 domingo and nadal 2017 more details concerning pfas toxicological properties are reported in literature dewitt 2015 based on who s recommendation and on the precautionary principle the proposal for a recast of the drinking water directive 98 83 ce directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption published on february 1 2018 has included the group of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances in the list of regulated chemicals the proposal recommends the values of 0 5 μg l 1 for the total amount of pfas and 0 1 μg l 1 for each single compound in 2017 the veneto region italy set drinking water quality standards for pfas veneto legislation 1590 201 with a limit value of 90 ng l 1 for pfoa and pfos with pfos 30 ng l 1 and a limit value of 300 ng l 1 for the other pfas sum of pfba pfpea pfbs pfhxa pfhpa pfhxs pfna pfdea pfuna pfdoa such regulation came after a large contamination of surface water and gw due to industrial ww discharges with the subsequent bioaccumulation of pfas in the serum of the exposed population as a result pfas are emerging contaminants already regulated in italy 1 5 pfas removal conventional treatment processes are ineffective for pfas degradation due to the high straight of the covalent c f bond of their chain their low concentration in water and their high hydrophilicity rahman et al 2014 ross et al 2018 biological treatment both aerobic and anaerobic are only able to break the c c bond and they lead to the formation of short chain pfas when advanced treatment technologies are not implemented biological wwtps affect the receiving water bodies and the concentration of pfas detected in finished water is often higher than in the untreated water arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 kaboré et al 2018 this fact gives evidence to recalcitrant behaviour of pfas to biological treatment and consequently their formation via biodegradation of precursor compounds rahman et al 2014 according to data obtained from monitoring studies pfas with long carbon chain such as pfos tend to accumulate in sludge whereas perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs has been mainly detected in the effluents of wwtps and in drinking water treatment plants dwtps arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 rahman et al 2014 under typical water treatment plant conditions disinfection by free chlorine or uv irradiation are ineffective appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 pfas are also much more resistant than other micro contaminants to the oxidation by ozone and hydroxyl radicals due to the strong c f bond and the electron withdrawing of their functional groups nzeribe et al 2019 trojanowicz et al 2018 furthermore advanced oxidation processes aops often result in a partial degradation of pfas with formation of pfas with shorter perfluorinated alkyl chain nzeribe et al 2019 trojanowicz et al 2018 adsorption anion exchange ae high pressure nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane processes are effective for substantial pfas removal appleman et al 2013 du et al 2014 kucharzyk et al 2017 main issues inherent with pfas removal through these mentioned techniques are the influence of water matrix i e competing anions organic matter frequent regeneration due to fast breakthrough and disposal of concentrate with high pfas concentration appleman et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 adsorption is actually an established technology for pfas removal both as single process of point of use applications and as step of water treatment plants arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 eschauzier et al 2012 quiñones and snyder 2009 moreover it shows a more economical performance compared to high pressure membrane processes rizzo et al 2019 roccaro et al 2013 as previously mentioned pfas exist as anions at ambient ph values and this makes strong base ae resins suitable for their removal however ae treatment efficiency depends on the resin properties including porosity functional group and polymer matrix deng et al 2010 to date adsorption studies have addressed single long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos even though long and short chain co removal requires further investigation ateia et al 2019 maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 moreover many compounds commonly present in water bodies could affect adsorption efficiency and additional studies should regard their potential competition ateia et al 2019 du et al 2015 2014 yu et al 2012 2 pfas adsorption and scope of the review 2 1 pfas adsorption mechanism electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are considered the predominant forces that govern adsorption of pfas on several adsorbent materials other less important mechanisms of pfas adsorption are hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding pfas molecular structure adsorbent chemistry and physical properties i e surface functional groups polarity and porosity as well as liquid phase composition should be considered as the main factors affecting pfas adsorption efficiency du et al 2014 electrostatic interactions occur between anionic pfas and adsorbent material positively charged consequently any changes in ionic strength i e co existing inorganic anions and changing solution ph could affect adsorption efficiency due to electrostatic repulsions du et al 2014 change in solution ph has an effect on the charge characteristics of pfas molecules and surface properties of adsorbents liu et al 2018 yu et al 2008 as reported in several studies an increase in ph solution led to a decrease in adsorption capacity of most adsorbents deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 qian et al 2017 nevertheless an increase of ionic strength ascribed to the presence of monovalent and divalent cations i e na k ca2 mg2 might enhance the pfas removal due to the compression of the electrical double layer du et al 2014 xiao et al 2011 the salting out effect should be also mentioned as reported in previous studies carter and farrell 2010 chen et al 2016 this effect occurs at high salt concentrations and it involves a decline of pfas solubility and consequently their adsorption on adsorbent surface could be encouraged du et al 2014 it is clear that the presence of inorganic anions i e cl and so4 involves a competition with pfas for adsorption sites deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 however the worsening of pfas removal occurred when solution ph was higher than point of zero charge of the adsorbents due to the establishment of electrostatic repulsions chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 electrostatic repulsions between anions pfas and negatively charged surfaces can be overcome through hydrophobic interactions of fluorinated chain zaggia et al 2016 moreover removal efficiency of individual pfas into adsorbent materials depends on the compound functional groups and c f chain length in detail pfsas are removed better than pfcas and long chain compounds with the same functional group are more efficiently removed than short chain ones appleman et al 2014 du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 xiao et al 2011 zaggia et al 2016 hydrophobic effect has been found to increase with the increasing c f chain length du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 this was also demonstrated in a prior work that investigated the competitive adsorption among pfas with different chain length on kaolinite xiao et al 2011 the authors argued that due to a stronger hydrophobic interaction with the tested adsorbent the longer chained pfas outcompeted the shorter during adsorption based on pfas functional group the presence of one more c f bond in pfsas compared to corresponding pfcas results in stronger hydrophobic properties and increasing adsorption of pfsas chen et al 2016 zaggia et al 2016 moreover strong hydrophobic interactions favour the formation of molecular aggregates during pfoa and pfos removal while highly hydrophilic compounds such as pfba and pfbs are removed as single molecules on adsorbent active sites du et al 2014 exceeding the critical micelle concentration c m c may lead to the formation of multilayer structures i e micelles and hemi micelles on adsorbent surfaces that may play an important role in pfas adsorption appleman et al 2014 deng et al 2013 du et al 2014 however at the pfas environmental level the formation of micelles is unlikely and only aggregates have been observed zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 reported that pfas adsorption process may include two distinct phases initially removal occurs through pfas adsorption on open sites of adsorbents gradually pore sites become clogged and removal becomes a function of molecular aggregation of pfas mccleaf et al 2017 since electrostatic negativity is originated from pfas functional head and hydrophobic interaction is linked to c f chain the electrostatic interactions seem to be dominant for short chain pfas while longer pfas are adsorbed through hydrophobic interactions which favour the formation of molecular aggregate on the active surface deng et al 2012 du et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 2 2 scope of the review an important limitation of prior research on pfas adsorption is that the evaluation of adsorption efficiency has been explored at high pfas concentrations which are not representative of the environmental concentration level furthermore very high doses of adsorbents have been used which do not reflect the actual water treatment plant adsorption processes rahman et al 2014 another relevant limitation of prior researches is that the experiments have often been carried out by using deionized water di spiked with selected pfas and the effect of organic matter om was not accounted for du et al 2014 recent studies have shown that om may not affect pfas removal sgroi et al 2018a or may positively influence the pfas adsorption mccleaf et al 2017 however natural organic matter nom and effluent organic matter efom often play a competitive role in the adsorption process appleman et al 2013 kothawala et al 2017 therefore a critical review of the published data is needed to better understand the om effect on long and short chain pfas removal furthermore the regeneration of adsorbents exhausted by pfas is not fully addressed woodard et al 2017 since pfas breakthrough is fast adsorbent regeneration is a very important and challenging task previous published review papers deals with pfas classification and origins buck et al 2011 xiao 2017 their occurrence and fate in aquatic environments ahrens 2011 arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 rahman et al 2014 and the treatment technologies for long chain pfas removal appleman et al 2014 kucharzyk et al 2017 a critical review concerning pfas adsorption previously published is mainly concerned with pfos and pfoa du et al 2014 and it does not include recent scientific findings on om effect as well as the performance and the regeneration of novel adsorbents recently the removal of short chain pfas by different processes including different adsorbents has been critically reviewed by ateia et al 2019 however such prior review papers concerning pfas adsorption were not focused on the role of pfas chain length om effect and adsorbents regeneration therefore the objective of this paper is to critically discuss data concerning pfas adsorption with particular focus on 1 recent published data about adsorption capacity of different materials for both long and short chain pfas 2 effect of om on the pfas adsorption 3 role of adsorbent regeneration 3 adsorption of long chain pfas 3 1 pfoa and pfos a number of studies have been carried out worldwide in order to investigate long chain pfas removal by adsorption on different materials pfoa and pfos are commonly regarded as the most representative pfas due to their persistence in the environment and occurrence in industrial applications a prior review paper indicated that long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos have been mainly removed through hydrophobic interactions and adsorbents with amine groups generally have high adsorption capacity du et al 2014 the adsorption of long chain pfas on different adsorbents commercially available or synthetized obtained from batch adsorption tests is discussed in the following sections table 2 reports the adsorption capacity obtained from published data fitting the langmuir model along with adsorbent material type and dosage long chain pfas initial concentrations and experimental setups 3 2 activated carbon and biochar among commercial adsorbents activated carbon ac has been widely investigated for pfos and pfoa removal liang et al 2011 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 rattanaoudom et al 2012 in detail powdered activated carbon pac had higher adsorption capacity than granular activated carbon gac for both pfoa and pfos chen et al 2017 yu et al 2009 results about adsorption of pfoa on bamboo derived activated carbon bdac have shown that a long time about 34 h was required to reach adsorption equilibrium du et al 2015 the comparison between bdac and microporous ac revealed that the adsorption capacity of bdac was higher than that of microporous ac du et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this evidence corroborates that microporous adsorbents are not suitable for removing large molecules i e long chain pfsas and pfcas and it is in agreement with results from fixed bed column tests as detailed below appleman et al 2013 du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 rattanaoudom et al 2012 zaggia et al 2016 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b is a pfos alternative compound both f 53b and pfos compounds have been detected at high concentrations in an actual chrome plating ww du et al 2016a electroplating wastewater treatment plant ewtp employing reduction reaction adding na2s2o5 precipitation adding ca oh 2 and flocculation sedimentation adding anionic polyacrylamide pam was unable to effectively remove pfos and f 53b hence batch adsorption experiments were performed and a commercial coconut shell based gac r cac after an activation process at low koh c ratio was selected as adsorbent material for pfos and f 53b removal du et al 2016a f 53b is more hydrophobic than pfos due to an ether unit in the molecular structure and this led to a much higher adsorption capacity of f 53b two fold higher than pfos onto r cac table 2 single walled carbon nanotubes swnt are hollow cylindrical tubes made of graphene layers and a lattice of c atoms and they have been investigated for pfos and pfoa removal wang et al 2016 the comparison of microporous ac efficiency with swnt in removing pfoa at the same concentration revealed that microporous ac has a higher adsorption capacity than swnt this difference may be linked to the higher surface area of microporous ac than that of swnt table 2 moreover adsorption capacities of swnt and ac for pfos were 6 and 2 times higher respectively than that of pfoa probably due to the one more c f unit of the pfos molecule wang et al 2016 in addition swnt exhibited higher adsorption capacity than multi walled carbon nanotubes mwnt consistent with their higher brunauer emmett and teller bet surface area chen et al 2011 li et al 2011 pfas adsorption on biochar has also been investigated because of its cost effectiveness and affinity with organic compounds guo et al 2017 inyang and dickenson 2017 x xiao et al 2017 pinewood pwc and hardwood hwc biochars have been tested for pfoa removal and the adsorption capacity of the biochar was lower than that of ac table 2 guo et al 2017 have demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of corn straw derived biochar for pfos removal increased with the increase of pyrolytic temperature which is related to bet surface area of biochar table 2 reported data from fixed bed column tests showed the ability of gac to remove traces of pfas as both complex mixture or single solute from water intended for human consumption appleman et al 2014 chularueangaksorn et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 2015 sgroi et al 2018a zaggia et al 2016 gac filtrasorb 400 calgon column tested for pfoa removal has shown that the bed volumes were about 55 000 at 90 breakthrough point chularueangaksorn et al 2014 the same gac filtrasorb 400 calgon has been tested for long chain pfcas i e pfoa pfna pfda pfuna pfdoda pfteda and pfsas i e pfhxs and pfos removal and the observed removal efficiencies were in the range 65 80 mccleaf et al 2017 information about the influence of gac pore distribution on adsorption capacity of pfos and pfoa were reported by zaggia et al 2016 results from continuous adsorption experiments have demonstrated the great efficiency of bituminous ac characterized by meso and macropores for pfoa and pfos removal whose maximum adsorption capacity was 39 6 and 4 1 μg g 1 respectively zaggia et al 2016 in fact meso and macro porous adsorbent materials are more easily accessed by long chain pfas resulting in higher adsorption capacity kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 a high dosage of gac filtrasorb 400 calgon was tested in a pre equilibrium batch study for the removal of a complex mixture of long chain pfsas pfhxs and pfos and pfcas pfoa pfna pfda pfunda pfdoda from lw kothawala et al 2017 regardless of om concentration long chain pfas removal was in the range of 50 90 kothawala et al 2017 however these results were obtained from a pre equilibrium study contact time was 15 min with a gac dose 10 g l 1 that is not typically employed at water treatment plants 3 3 molecularly imprinted polymers several experimental works have explored the pfas adsorption onto synthetically modified polymers which are adsorbents conveniently synthetized to have high affinity and selectivity towards the target contaminants guo et al 2018 karoyo and wilson 2016 l xiao et al 2017 the macromolecular imprinted materials mims containing β cyclodextrin β cd within a urethane framework provide two types of binding sites one binding site is a β cd inclusion site the second is a non inclusion interstitial site of the cross linker domains where aggregates micelles and other inclusion complexes could be formed karoyo and wilson 2016 formation of bilayer and multilayer structures is the dominant adsorption process for both pfoa and pfos in these materials as observed in several studies du et al 2014 gao et al 2017 karoyo and wilson 2016 the modification of cd based polymer adsorbents composition may allow an increasing of pfoa removal l xiao et al 2017 nevertheless the removal efficiency of cross linked polymer network where β cd substitutes decafluorobiphenyl dfb cdp was comparable with that of biochar tested by inyang and dickenson 2017 adsorption efficiency of non imprinted carbon microspheres nip cms for pfos removal has been compared with a surface imprinted polymer mip cms in which double functional monomers of methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and 2 trifluoromethyl acrylic acid tfma have been synthetized on carbon microspheres guo et al 2018 the adsorption capacity was higher for mip cms than nip cms table 2 due to the effect of molecularly imprinting technique in enhancing pfos removal the molecular imprinting technique has also been employed in order to prepare a novel adsorbent using chitosan crosslinked for pfos removal and its adsorption capacity was higher than that observed for non imprinted ones yu et al 2008 3 4 anion exchange resin several studies have indicated the suitability of the ae process for pfas removal otherwise pfas removal efficiency varied greatly among ae resins due to their properties such as polymer matrix functional group and porosity zaggia et al 2016 it was demonstrated that large pores of macroporous resin allow a faster diffusion of pfos than the gel one deng et al 2010 this evidence is confirmed by comparing the adsorption capacity of ira910 polystyrene dvb macroporous type and ira400 styrene dvb gel type for pfos removal maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2009 moreover polymer matrixes led to different intraparticle diffusion and a polyacrylic resin has shown higher efficiency for pfos removal than polystyrene one deng et al 2010 ira910 exhibited a good selectivity also for pfhxs as demonstrated by maimaiti et al 2018 when ira67 polyacrylic dvb gel type has been employed its adsorption capacity was higher than styrene type resins table 2 gao et al 2017 demonstrated the great applicability of polyacrylic resin for f 53b removal since the adsorption capacity of ira67 about 2400 mg g 1 was higher than that of r cac in batch experiments table 2 as regards long chain pfcas pfoa removal has been investigated on different kinds of strong ae resins du et al 2015 maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2009 based on table 2 the highest adsorption capacity was obtained when ira910 polystyrene dvb macroporous type resin was employed maimaiti et al 2018 the adsorption capacity of ira67 was higher than that of bdac both adsorbents tested at the same pfoa initial concentration table 2 the efficiency of ira67 may be ascribed to the amine groups on the resin surface which involve the pfoa adsorption via ae mechanisms besides the open pore structure of ira67 also allowed a better diffusion of pfoa molecules moreover as demonstrated by zaggia et al 2016 the selectivity of larger and more hydrophobic anions i e pfos and pfoa increased with the increasing of alkyl chain length of the functional group of ae resins differences in terms of equilibrium exchange capacity of different type of resins are linked with the strength of hydrophobic interactions between resin functional groups and pfas molecules considering hydrophobicity of resin highly hydrophobic resins such as a532e favour pfoa and pfos passage from hydrated state to adsorbed state as confirmed by the highest adsorption capacity values obtained on both batch and continuous flow pilot scale experiments zaggia et al 2016 the comparison between the performance of ae resin and gac for long chain pfas removal has also been carried out by employing the fixed bed column tests particularly as demonstrated by chularueangaksorn et al 2014 pfa300 ae resin polystyrene crosslinked dvb could treat a higher amount of water than gac filtrasorb 400 calgon before the saturation at a 90 breakthrough point bed volumes were 119 880 and 55 080 respectively a532e polystyrene dvb gel type bifunctional quaternary amine exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for both pfos and pfoa among several adsorbent materials tested i e coconut based gac bituminous coal based gac mildly hydrophobic and non hydrophobic resins during continuous experiments zaggia et al 2016 removal efficiencies of ae resin a600 polystyrene dvb gel type for long chain pfcas pfoa pfna pfda pfuna pfdoda pfteda and pfsas pfhxs and pfos were in the range 33 94 after 50 704 bed volumes bvs whereas removal efficiencies of gac filtrasorb 400 calgon column were in the range 28 94 after 49 523 bvs mccleaf et al 2017 3 5 synthetized materials with the purpose of identifying the best suitable adsorbent for pfas removal it is currently practice to synthesize new materials with properties and structures easy to control and modify to date new adsorbents with higher selectivity and specificity designed towards pfas removal are also becoming commercially available for water treatment applications for instance a porous aromatic framework constructed from benzene rings paf 45 was employed for pfos removal luo et al 2016 despite the remarkable adsorption capacity table 2 paf 45 feasibility was influenced by ph solution and ionic strength since the adsorption capacity was higher at acidic ph values i e ph 3 moreover the adsorption isotherm experiments have been carried out at pfos concentrations in the range of 50 200 mg l 1 luo et al 2016 which are much higher than the pfas concentrations typically detected in the water environment rahman et al 2014 covalent triazine based framework ctf has been investigated for removing different long chain compounds pfoa pfhxs and pfos due to its large surface area and rigid pore structure wang et al 2016 among the three long chain pfas tested wang et al 2016 have demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of ctf was highest for pfos table 2 the electrostatic interaction between pfas anion head and triazine groups of ctf positively charged represents the main driving force for pfas adsorption on ctf based on electrostatic interactions which are the main adsorption mechanism of short chain pfas ctf exhibited a good adsorption capacity for pfbs and pfba removal as it will be discussed below boron nitride characterized by lightness structure and thermal stability has been synthesized as porous hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets h bns for pfos and pfda removal feng et al 2016 the efficiency of this adsorbent material has been demonstrated to be linked with chain length and functional group of pfas since pfda was more favourable adsorbed than pfos adsorption capacity of 0 16 mg m 2 and 0 04 mg m 2 respectively among novel adsorbent materials investigated magnetic nanoparticles attached into fluorographene 2 mnps fg mass ratio of mnps and fg is 3 5 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for pfos instead of pfoa table 2 however adsorbent dosage was not coherent with that really employed in full scale treatment plants wang et al 2018 quaternized cotton and aminated rice husk arh both prepared with atom transfer radical polymerization atrp technique were tested for pfos and pfoa removal deng et al 2013 2012 results have demonstrated that quaternized cotton had higher adsorption capacity than arh for both pfos and pfoa table 2 polyacrylonitrile fiber panf derived activated carbon fibers pacfs showed a remarkable adsorption capacity for pfos and pfoa chen et al 2017 the adsorption affinity could be ascribed to its high specific surface area and micro and mesoporous structure which allowed the establishment of multilayer adsorption formation of hemi micelles and micelles the latter was also the main adsorption mechanism on crosslinked chitosan beads employed for pfos removal as demonstrated by zhang et al 2011 poly ethylenimine functionalized cellulose microcrystals pei f cmc have been tested for removing long chain pfas at environmentally relevant concentration level ateia et al 2018 long chain pfas removal percentage was in the range of 80 98 despite its low surface area pei f cmc exhibited a good adsorption affinity both in di and in the presence of co existing om as discussed in section 5 the main drawback of those synthetized materials is the application at full scale treatment plants because their production is not industrialized and probably they are not commercially available unlike ac and ae resins economic assessment for new synthetized materials is needed 3 6 nanoparticles materials the adsorption of pfas into nanoparticles nps has recently been investigated due to their co existing in aquatic environments i e marine debris plastic or their high surface area and reactivity i e iron oxides as demonstrated by lu et al 2016 nano oxides such as titania tio2 iron oxides fe2o3 alumina al2o3 and silica sio2 have the ability to sorb pfos among the different nano oxides tested al2o3 showed the highest pfos adsorption capacity 1 1 μg m 2 whereas sio2 exhibited the lower adsorption capacity 0 1 μg m 2 this difference in terms of pfos removal should be ascribed to the different hydroxyl groups and surface area furthermore the main adsorption mechanism of pfos on nano oxides was not only electrostatic interaction but also the formation of hydrogen bounds between the pfos sulfonic terminal group and nano oxides surface lu et al 2016 magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 np were used as the substrate of a novel magnetic nanocomposite fe3o4 sio2 nh2 f13 in which silica membrane functionalized with amino group and octyl perfluorinated chain was synthesized on the fe3o4 np surface zhou et al 2016 based on kinetic data the predominant adsorption mechanism between the magnetic adsorbent and pfas tested was chemisorption which includes both electrostatic and f f interaction zhou et al 2016 in detail the selective f f interaction between octyl perfluorinated chain on the magnetic composite surface and perfluoroalkyl dipole shell in pfas molecule was enhanced by electrostatic attraction of nh2 and the anionic cooh or so3h of pfcas and pfsas molecules respectively due to size exclusion effect pfcas were better adsorbed than pfsas on fe3o4 sio2 nh2 f13 considering perfluoroalkyl chain length pfunda exhibited the highest adsorption capacity onto fe3o4 sio2 nh2 f13 due to the formation of aggregate structure between long chain pfas which could stick together and consequently the amount of pfas adsorbed increased zhou et al 2016 a recent experimental work investigated the capability of microplastics mpls to sorb a complex mixture of pfas from rw ebro river and seawater seaw simulating realistic environmental conditions llorca et al 2018 high density polyethylene hdpe polystyrene ps and poly styrene carboxylic acid ps cooh were selected due to their wide occurrence as marine debris plastic results of batch adsorption experiments showed low removal percentages 27 of long chain pfas in rw after 7 days with few exceptions of pftra and pftea whose percentages were between 65 and 70 moreover mpls efficiency in seaw was affected by water chemistry such as salinity and om concentration this point will be deeply explained later see section 5 overall carboxylated compounds with more than 11 c atoms were the most removed llorca et al 2018 in detail hdpe exhibited the worst adsorption capacity due to its granular shape which limited the intraparticle diffusion llorca et al 2018 in rw pfoa pfna pfhxs and pfos did not present any adsorption on both hdpe and ps cooh throughout the experiment period on the contrary affinity between carboxylated compounds with less than 10 c atoms and hdpe was higher in seaw adsorption rates of pfcas on ps cooh in rw increased with the increasing of chain length comparing pfcas to pfsas with the same chain length the carboxylated compounds were less removed llorca et al 2018 whereas in seaw the presence of carboxylic group in the ps cooh surface implicated an increase of adsorption rates of carboxylated compounds adsorption kinetics were influenced by adsorbents size therefore ps exhibited faster kinetic than hdpe since it had the smallest particles llorca et al 2018 4 adsorption of short chain pfas 4 1 challenges in short chain pfas adsorption short chain pfas and their precursors are as persistent as those long chained therefore although they show less bioaccumulation potential their environmental occurrence is of concern ateia et al 2019 brendel et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 while long chain pfas are binding with particles present in solution those short chain are mainly in the dissolved phase resulting in long range transport in aquatic environments ahrens 2011 therefore short chain pfas have higher mobility in water bodies than long chain compounds specifically short chain compounds could significantly affect drinking water supplies increasing the human exposure to pfas compounds considering the properties of short chain pfas table 1 it is expected that the large scale remediation treatments currently suitable for long chain pfas are ineffective for short chain pfas ateia et al 2019 brendel et al 2018 this evidence is consistent with data from full scale drinking water treatment plants arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 rahman et al 2014 moreover it is widely reported that carbon chain length influences adsorption capacities of pfas onto various materials since adsorption rate seems to increase with the increase of molecular size appleman et al 2014 data collected from full scale treatment plants drinking and wastewater facilities suggested that the removal of short chain compounds is still a challenge task due to their early and faster breakthrough arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 to date a restricted number of published data have addressed short chain pfas adsorption by using different materials because most of the experimental works have focused on the removal of long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos adsorption capacities obtained by fitting the langmuir model along with type and dosage of adsorbent materials initial concentration of short chain pfas and experimental setup are reported in table 3 comparisons between several adsorbent materials tested for short chain pfas are reviewed based on both batch experiment studies table 3 and fixed bed column tests the adsorption capacity of materials tested for pfba removal observed during batch tests table 3 follows the order microporous ac ctf ira910 strong ae resin however results obtained by continuous experiments have demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of meso porous gac meso porous bituminous coal derived ac was higher than a532e strong ae resin 4 3 and 3 3 μg g 1 respectively zaggia et al 2016 in the following sections the removal of short chain pfas by adsorption is discussed based on the type of adsorbent 4 2 activated carbon biochar and other adsorbents the performance of bdac and coal based ac microporous type used for removing pfhxa has been compared the adsorption capacity of bdac was 13 times lower than microporous ac probably due to its low bet surface area and the presence of om in the solution tested du et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the adsorption capacities of hwc and pwc biochars for pfba and pfoa removal were investigated by inyang and dickenson 2017 results from adsorption kinetic tests showed that the amount of pfba adsorbed on both hwc and pwc was 3 4 times lower than that of pfoa this evidence suggests the incapability of biochar for short chain pfas removal and it may prove the competition between long and short chain pfas for the adsorption sites and or competition with om inyang and dickenson 2017 short chain pfas adsorption on gac and pac has also been investigated by using batch test hansen et al 2010 tests have been carried out at real concentrations of short chain pfas range about 73 320 ng l 1 and using an adsorbent dose comparable to that used in real water treatment plants range about 25 125 mg l 1 results have demonstrated that pac has higher adsorption capacity than gac more than twice due to the shorter internal diffusion distances and its higher bet surface area hansen et al 2010 mwcnts functionalized in different ways mwcnts pri mwcnts cooh mwcnts oh were tested for pfbs removal deng et al 2015a removal percentage of pfbs on mwcnts was about 30 in di water whereas when humic acids ha and phenol co existed in the solution this percentage was lower than 20 deng et al 2015a moreover due to the weak hydrophobicity of pfbs its percentage removal was lower than that of long chain compounds deng et al 2015a results of adsorption isotherm of pfos and pfbs on boehmite showed that pfos was better removed than pfbs since the effect of surface aggregation enhanced long chain pfas removal wang et al 2015 among fixed bed column experiments carried out in order to assert the short chain pfas removal mccleaf et al 2017 reported faster breakthrough and lower removal percentage of short chain pfcas on gac column f400 calgon than long chain ones the removal efficiencies of the short chain pfcas tested i e pfba pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa were lower than 19 on gac column after 49 523 bvs whereas the removal efficiency of pfbs short chained pfsas tested was 10 those results suggest that short chain pfas removal depends mainly on the availability of active sites since they do not bind with other particles and consequently the formation of aggregates does not occur mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 moreover desorption of short chain pfas has been also hypothesized due to the competition of long chain pfas and or om similar fast breakthrough of short chain pfas has also been observed in rapid small scale column tests rssct carried out on different types of gac columns appleman et al 2013 among the three activated carbons tested f300 microporous bituminous coal derived exhibited the lowest efficiency for the short chain pfcas tested i e pfba pfpea and pfhxa due to its pores distribution mainly microporous type and bet surface area others gac tested coconut based gac aquacarb 1240 and bituminous coal based ones f600 performed better for the removal of selected short chain pfas appleman et al 2013 pfba uptake on different types of biochar was influenced by bet surface area indeed the highest percentage removal has been found on the hardwood sawdust pellets gasified at 900 c hwc which had the highest bet surface area among the different biochars tested inyang and dickenson 2017 however results obtained from batch adsorption kinetic tests have demonstrated that gac removed pfba better than hwc inyang and dickenson 2017 short chain pfas adsorption on microplastics hdpe ps and ps cooh has recently been investigated in simulated realistic environmental conditions llorca et al 2018 due to the increase in ionic strength short chain carboxylates compounds have been better removed by ps cooh in seaw than in rw whereas short chain pfas were almost not adsorbed onto ps and hdpe llorca et al 2018 removal of pfbs short chain pfsas has been investigated at batch mode by means of ac i e microporous ac and calgon f400 and ctf ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 wang et al 2016 the difference of adsorption capacity between ctf and ac may be related to their different structure and consequently adsorption mechanisms established since the electrostatic interactions between pfas anion head and triazine groups of ctf involved short chain pfas adsorption on ctf wang et al 2016 however ctf exhibited a lower affinity with pfba than arh table 3 adsorption capacity of arh was 4 times higher than ctf deng et al 2013 wang et al 2016 a novel adsorbent poly ethylenimine functionalized cellulose microcrystal pei f cmc has been synthetized and its efficiency for short chain removal has been evaluated at environmental relevant concentration levels ateia et al 2018 results have demonstrated that short chain with sulfonate terminal group were removed better than short chain pfcas in agreement with previous experimental studies mccleaf et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 4 3 anion exchange the removal efficiency of three pfcas owning different chain lengths including pfhxa with 6 c atoms pfhpa with 7 c atoms and pfoa with 8 c atoms from industrial ww perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride washing wastewater pfsof www by ae resin has been evaluated during batch experiments conducted by du et al 2015 results demonstrated that adsorption sites on ira67 were occupied by pfoa molecules prior to the others pfcas and therefore the adsorption rates of short chain were lower consequently short chain pfcas reached the equilibrium very fast du et al 2015 moreover comparing the efficiency of two different anion exchange resins i e ira910 and ira67 for removing the same compound pfhxa ira910 polystyrene dvb macroporous type exhibited higher adsorption capacity than ira67 polyacrylic dvb gel type du et al 2015 maimaiti et al 2018 this difference in adsorption capacity for pfhxa may be linked to the resin properties such as polymer matrix and porosity and or to the effect of om present in the solution in fact ira910 was tested in di water whereas ira67 was employed for pfhxa removal from pfsof www du et al 2015 maimaiti et al 2018 moreover when tested for the same actual ww ira67 had higher affinity with pfhpa than bdac as demonstrated by the adsorption capacity which was 3 times higher than that of bdac du et al 2015 furthermore amine groups on adsorbent surface improved the short chain pfas removal due to the establishment of electrostatic interactions which are the main driving force during short chain adsorption deng et al 2013 du et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 results provided by fixed bed column tests demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of a532e strong ae resin was almost equal to that of gac meso porous bituminous coal derived ac when tested for pfbs removal 4 7 μg g 1 and 4 1 μg g 1 respectively zaggia et al 2016 results from fixed bed column experiments carried out by mccleaf et al 2017 have shown fast breakthrough and low removal percentage for short chain pfcas on ae resin a600 polystyrene dvb gel type the removal efficiencies of short chained pfcas tested were 11 on a600 column after 50 704 bvs the same anion exchange resin better removed pfbs short chain pfsas tested than other short chain compounds and the removal efficiency of pfbs was 55 mccleaf et al 2017 results from a pre equilibrium study carried out by kothawala et al 2017 demonstrated that fresh adsorbent materials i e ae resin purolite a600 and gac filtrasorb 400 could remove short chain pfas from water solutions nevertheless anion exchange showed the highest percent of removal in detail removal percentages of short chain pfas pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfbs were about 90 and 50 on a600 and filtrasorb 400 respectively however those results have been obtained from a pre equilibrium study contact time was equal to 15 min with a high dosage of adsorbent materials kothawala et al 2017 analysis of transmission electron microscopy tem carried out on ae resins allowed a deep understanding of the predominant adsorption mechanism involved during short chain pfas removal zaggia et al 2016 indeed tem images showed that the weak hydrophobic interactions between pfba or pfbs and resin surface did not allow the formation of aggregates and consequently ae of single molecules was the main mechanism for short chain removal overall ae resins exhibit a remarkable adsorption capacity for both long and short chain pfas nevertheless the possible release of disinfection by products dbp such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma may represent the main drawback for their full scale application sgroi et al 2018b particularly the amount of ndma and their precursors released upon usage depends on the resin functional group such as amine groups and operational conditions such as regeneration activities and flow interruptions 4 4 comparison between long and short chain pfas adsorption in order to provide a deeper analysis on the long and short chain pfas removal by adsorption data from tables 2 and 3 have been elaborated to build a box and whiskers plot fig 1 that allows the comparison between the removals of long and short chain pfas by different adsorbents classified as activated carbon resin and synthetized materials fig 1 shows that the adsorption capacity of a wide range of adsorbents is lower for short chain pfas compared to that observed for long chain pfas this result emphasizes that the removal of short chain pfas by adsorption is very challenging and it will need more research in the future a comparison in adsorption capacity of the different adsorbents employed have shown that resins are more effective than activated carbons for both long and short chain pfas removal activated carbon exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity a significant variation in adsorption capacity of synthetized materials used for long chain removal was observed such variation ranged from the lowest to the highest adsorption capacity observed for long chain pfas removal however the latter best results were often obtained at acid ph for instance the best adsorption capacity 5847 mg g 1 was found by using the paf 45 adsorbent at ph 3 therefore the real operating conditions may affect the removal efficiency for instance the effect om may significantly influence the performance of adsorbents as discussed in the next section 5 effect of organic matter om on pfas adsorption 5 1 pfas adsorption in presence of om om is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and it can be distinguished between nom regarded as om naturally present in surface water and efom the om released from wwtps shon et al 2006 om could affect adsorption efficiency of adsorbent materials due to binding and adsorption interactions with pfas including long and short chain compounds as illustrated by du et al 2014 nom could interact with pfas via electrostatic and or hydrophobic interactions firstly om is mostly constituted of anionic species and after adsorbing on materials it can lead to repulsive electrostatic interactions meanwhile nom can also lead to pfas adsorption via hydrophobic interaction between perfluoroalkyl tail and nom adsorbed on the adsorbent surfaces to date it is not well understood how these effects co exist and which is predominant most of undertaken experimental works investigated adsorption properties of pfas on different adsorbent materials in di deng et al 2012 guo et al 2018 maimaiti et al 2018 yu et al 2009 many researches have selected fulvic and humic acids fa and ha as the model dom in order to evaluate the impact of dom on pfas adsorption deng et al 2015a du et al 2016b maimaiti et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 f wang et al 2015 l xiao et al 2017 actually nom consists of a wide range of organic compounds such as hydrophilic acids proteins carboxylic and amino acids in addition to the already mentioned ha and fa when using a synthetic solution of om during experimental studies some interactions between pfas and water matrix have not been described in detail table 4 reports the main experimental works published related to the adsorption of pfas both long and short chain compounds on different adsorbent materials in the presence of om however some of those studies lacked a detailed discussion on the effect of om on pfas adsorption most of these experimental studies appleman et al 2013 du et al 2016b 2016a y wang et al 2015 l xiao et al 2017 have investigated the effect of om on pfas adsorption through comparison between synthetic om solution and om free solution table 4 only few experimental works compared the effect of different dom sources on pfas adsorption and tested water had different dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations ateia et al 2018 inyang and dickenson 2017 kothawala et al 2017 sgroi et al 2018a wang et al 2018 furthermore the simultaneous effect of ionic strength and om on the pfas adsorption is very complex for instance it was demonstrated that the presence of monovalent and divalent cations increases pfas adsorption on different materials i e sediments higgins and luthy 2006 activated carbon du et al 2015 synthesized material paf 45 luo et al 2016 resin du et al 2015 and kaolite xiao et al 2011 particularly the adsorption of short chain pfas i e pfhxa and pfba on kaolinite was more thermodynamically favourable at a higher na concentration due to the compression of the electrical double layer and ensuing reduced electrostatic repulsion between pfas and kaolite surface xiao et al 2011 in addition divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 could also improve pfas removal by divalent cation bridging effect du et al 2015 2014 on the contrary the presence of inorganic anion negatively affects the adsorption of pfas due to the competition for adsorption sites deng et al 2010 whereas it was observed that the presence of ionic om i e ha sds fa compete with both long f wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 and short chain pfas maimaiti et al 2018 zhao et al 2011 specifically such effect seems more relevant for short chain pfas due to the competition for active sites maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 on the other hand hydrophobic dom was found to improve the pfas retention in gac adsorption while hydrophilic dom seems do not affect significantly pfas adsorption in both gac and ae adsorption experiments kothawala et al 2017 the positive impact of dom on the adsorption of long chain pfas has been ascribed to the formation of pfas aggregate or dom pfas complexes kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 but such bonds have been rarely demonstrated consequently the impact of dom and ionic strength on the pfas adsorption need more investigation a systematic review concerning the effect of om on pfas adsorption for different classes of adsorbents is reported in the following sections 5 2 activated carbon among adsorbent materials ac has proven to be effective for pfas removal and its efficiency in presence of om has been investigated both in batch and column experiments table 4 contrasting trends have been observed in experimental studies because of the influence of co existing om indeed the performance of pfas adsorption onto ac was found negatively impacted enhanced or not influenced by the presence of om the main interactions that could be established between om molecules and pfas both long and short chain during adsorption on gac column are illustrated in fig 2 in detail hydrophobic interactions mainly concern long chained c f molecules while short chain pfas interact with om molecules through pore blockage and electrostatic repulsions in many cases activated carbon performance was negatively influenced by co existing om and its efficiency decreased with the increase of doc concentrations du et al 2016a 2015 hansen et al 2010 kothawala et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 2015 y wang et al 2015 yu et al 2012 zhao et al 2011 on the contrary adsorption capacity on gac did not significantly decrease in the presence of gw nom probably due to the high concentration of pfas tested 50 mg l 1 and to the effect of ionic strength zhao et al 2011 results from the previously mentioned study demonstrated that pfba removal was affected by om since the results from adsorption equilibrium suggested a reduction of 40 zhao et al 2011 results from adsorption kinetic experiments provided by yu et al 2012 suggested that adsorption equilibrium for pfoa and pfos on pac was reached at 4 h and 24 h in the absence and in the presence of efom respectively yu et al 2012 the competition between pfas and dom for ac adsorption sites has also been investigated in rsscts appleman et al 2013 mccleaf et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 2015 sgroi et al 2018a results obtained from the latter mentioned experimental works are in disagreement about the effect of om this discrepancy may be related to the different experimental setups such as pfas initial concentration source and concentration of dom empty bed contact time ebct and to the kind of ac tested as suggested by pramanik et al 2015 when doc concentration increased from 5 to 25 mg l 1 the removal efficiency of pfoa and pfos on pac decreased by 50 and 35 respectively on the contrary the performance of bituminous coal based gac was less influenced by variation of doc concentration pramanik et al 2015 similar results have asserted that proteins resulted in a low retention of pfoa and pfos through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions pramanik et al 2017 moreover breakthrough 20 has been reached at 125 000 bvs during dom free experiments and at 11 000 bvs when doc concentration was equal to 1 7 mg l 1 this observation highlights that faster breakthrough of pfas takes place during rssct experiments in presence of dom appleman et al 2013 nevertheless sgroi et al 2018a found that breakthrough curves of some long chain pfas i e pfos pfoa and pfda were similar in column beds packed tests by using norit darco 12 40 in those experiments waters with different dom concentrations and compositions fed the packed columns table 4 the observed behaviour for the investigated long chain compounds may be ascribed to the hydrophobic interactions occurring between long chain pfas and gac indeed hydrophobic interactions are the main adsorption mechanisms for long chain pfas and the hydrophobic interactions may be only slightly influenced by om presence results of pre equilibrium study by kothawala et al 2017 are in contrast with other findings du et al 2016a wang et al 2016 yu et al 2012 zhao et al 2011 since the increase in doc concentration seems to enhance long chain pfas removal due to the formation of dom pfas complex and consequently their co adsorption in detail removal efficiency of pfas with a fluorocarbon chain length of 8 c atoms increased by 50 when doc concentration of a hydrophobic dom passed from 0 to 8 mg l 1 using gac kothawala et al 2017 it should be highlighted that these results were obtained in pre equilibrium conditions contact time about 15 min at pfas initial concentration of about 2 5 μg l 1 and at batch dose of gac of about 10 g l 1 which is much higher than doses typically used in full scale treatment plants ziska et al 2016 performance of bdac for pfcas removal from pfsof www has been investigated in the presence of high total organic carbon toc concentration co existing om competed with pfcas for adsorption sites on the bdac du et al 2015 the same achievement was obtained using r cac for pfos and its alternative compound f 53b removal from electrochemical wwtp effluent du et al 2016a the high concentration of toc 78 3 mg l 1 was linked to the high amount of hydrocarbon surfactants which were unfavourable for the adsorption of pfos and f 53b on r cac since adsorption sites were manly occupied by co existing organic compounds table 4 depending on om concentration and source dose and kind of ac employed powdered or granular and its porosity and pfas tested long or short chain the effect of om is different due to adsorption mechanisms established the presence of om can lead to the enhancement of pfas adsorption through the formation of agglomerations between long chain pfas and om otherwise om can negatively influence the adsorption efficiency due to the reducing of accessible binding sites and pore spaces i e pore blockage fig 2 5 3 anion exchange resin main interactions occurring between om and pfas molecules during ae process are reported in fig 3 as previously asserted about the influence of om on ac performance the effect of co existing om on ae resins for pfas removal depends on several factors including om composition and concentration kind of resin and pfas concentration tested to date the competition between om and pfas on ae resins is not fully understood this evidence is confirmed by several experimental studies carried out both on batch and column setups du et al 2015 kothawala et al 2017 maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2016 zaggia et al 2016 organic compounds such as ha tri chloroethylene tce methylbenzene mb and sodium dodecyl sulphate sds have been selected to evaluate their effect on pfhxs removal on ae resin i e ira910 a macroporous polystyrene resin with a dimethyl ethanol ammonium functional group during batch experiments maimaiti et al 2018 results suggested that pfhxs retention on ira910 was not affected by non ionic co existing organic compounds i e mb and tce regardless of their concentration in the solution whereas ira910 efficiency decreased with the increasing of ha and sds concentrations due to the competition for adsorption sites a slight effect on pfas retention has been highlighted under pre equilibrium condition since ae resin a600 polystyrene dvb gel type with quaternary ammonium functional group performance was independent from dom concentration and source kothawala et al 2017 in detail pfas removal has been reduced by 10 at the highest dom concentration tested this result is consistent with data reported by previous experimental works which have demonstrated that om weakly interferes with pfas removal during ae process du et al 2015 wang et al 2016 resins gel type polymer matrixes such as ira400 and ira67 showed a remarkable affinity with pfas both long and short chain which was independent of om present in an opposed way the performance of macroporous resins i e ira910 could be affected by background dom levels 5 4 other adsorbents biochar multi walled carbon nanotubes mineral materials nanoparticles effect of co existing ha on boehmite surface was investigated during pfos and pfbs batch adsorption experiments f wang et al 2015 due to the electrostatic interactions between pfas and boehmite strong competition between pfos or pfbs and ha occurred electrostatic repulsions increased with the increasing of ha accumulation on boehmite surface f wang et al 2015 the competition between pfas and synthetic om ha phenol 1 naphthol and benzoic acids has also been investigated on mwcnts deng et al 2015a the pronounced influence on pfos removal was provided by ha whereas phenol had a lesser influence moreover pfbs removal was the worst in the presence of ha or phenol deng et al 2015a as demonstrated by inyang and dickenson 2017 hwc and pwc biochar performances were affected by om since adsorption capacities decreased with the increase of doc concentration in particular om molecules could lead to pore blockage and may occupy high energy pore sites the adsorption capacities were about 41 3 and 27 7 mg g 1 when lw doc 2 mg l 1 and tertiary treated ww effluent doc 4 9 mg l 1 were tested respectively inyang and dickenson 2017 results from pilot scale tests have demonstrated that the breakthrough of some pfas i e pfpea pfhxa pfoa and pfos was faster on biochar hwc filter than on gac column since om adsorbed on biochar surface caused changes on biochar surface charge consequently the electrostatic repulsions between pfas and biochar surface increased adsorption kinetic tests were performed for both pfba and pfos and the observed slow kinetics could have been caused by pre loaded om on biochar inyang and dickenson 2017 the efficiency of novel magnetic adsorbent 2 mnps fg has been investigated for pfoa and pfos removal from different water matrixes wang et al 2018 its performance was independent of om content also at the highest doc concentration tested 1 7 mg l 1 indeed the removal efficiencies were always found around 99 for both pfoa and pfos in all performed experiments however it should be noted that those efficiencies have probably been obtained because of a high dosage of adsorbent employed 400 mg l 1 the competition between nom both seaw and rw and pfas both long and short chain compounds has also been investigated during pfas adsorption onto hdpe ps and ps cooh particles llorca et al 2018 results asserted that aromatic rings of ps contrasted nom competition and consequently they favoured pfas adsorption by contrast nom influenced pfas adsorption on hdpe and its effect was higher in seaw than in rw llorca et al 2018 sun et al 2018 investigated the effect of co existing organic compounds on gac biofilter they reported that more active sites were available for pfas adsorption in the pre ozonated regenerated gac biofilter due to the oxidation of competitive dom sun et al 2018 recently the performance of new synthetized adsorbent pei f cmc for pfas removal both long and short chain was evaluated using three different nom solutions ateia et al 2018 firstly experiments were carried out in lw hartwell lake south carolina and pfas removal efficiency has been compared with that resulted from doc free solution pfoa and pfos removal efficiency was almost equal in both lw and di pfas with longer chain than pfoa and pfos c12 c13 pfcas c9 c10 pfsas were removed better from lw than from di using pei f cmc this result can be explained by the co removal of long chain pfas aggregated with om du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 by contrast short chain pfas removal was higher in di than in lw indeed om competed with short chain pfas during adsorption process ateia et al 2018 overall lower removal efficiency has been obtained for short chain pfas compared with that observed for long chain ones removal 20 and 70 respectively the effect of different types of nom with different hydrophobicity was also investigated in order to assert the performance of pei f cmc for pfas removal the two nom solutions tested had the same doc concentration 2 mg l 1 but a different value of specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 results have demonstrated that short chain removal was lower than 30 from both nom solutions and the competition between short chain pfas and hydrophilic nom suva254 1 7 l mg 1 m 1 was higher than that with hydrophobic nom suva254 4 9 l mg 1 m 1 the hydrophobicity of nom does not seem to influence the adsorption of long chain pfas on pei f cmc and their removal efficiency was higher than 70 for both nom solutions 6 regeneration of adsorbents despite the widespread use of adsorption and anion exchange processes for pfas removal the main drawback of their application at full scale is the regeneration of spent materials when their adsorption capacity has been exhausted regeneration must allow the removal of adsorbed pfas in order to restore the adsorption capacity of spent materials by means of technologies which have economic viability and environmental security for instance chemical regeneration of saturated adsorbents is usually performed in situ at full scale treatment processes however it is not always feasible because of the related costs or environmental issues as discussed in the next section on the other hand the thermal regeneration is often performed off site at the adsorbent manufacturing establishment therefore a direct comparison between the above mentioned techniques is not easy overall in situ regeneration should be pursued to avoid the transportation treatment and or disposal of exhausted materials to date regeneration and reuse of materials saturated with pfas is challenging as discussed in the following sections 6 1 chemical regeneration pfas anionic head could be desorbed using a solution of sodium salts such as sodium chloride nacl and sodium hydroxide naoh whereas a solution of organic alcohol is required to desorb the hydrophobic c f chain wang et al 2014 woodard et al 2017 fig 4 depicts a schematic view of pfas saturated adsorbent which is regenerated using a chemical solution made of sodium salts and organic alcohol in fig 4 the desorption mechanisms related to the use of sodium ions and organic solvents are illustrated as well table 5 reports a compilation of data on chemical regeneration of pfas exhausted adsorbents with particular attention to chemical solution employed and regeneration percentage achieved due to the lower solubility of pfas on ionic strength media conventional solutions of sodium salts were ineffective in regenerating adsorbents exhausted by both long and short chain pfas conte et al 2015 deng et al 2015b regeneration percentages were lower than 10 when regeneration agents including nacl and naoh were adopted for desorbing pfbs and pfos from acrylic resins carter and farrell 2010 deng et al 2010 the deprotonation of amine groups on acrylic gel type resins allowed the desorption of pfos at a low concentration of naoh solutions although a regeneration percentage of about 90 was achieved when a solution of sodium hydroxide and methanol was tested table 5 mixture of sodium salts and organic solvents such as ch3oh c2h5oh and c3h6o have been widely used in order to involve the desorption of pfas deng et al 2015b yu et al 2008 zaggia et al 2016 moreover the efficiency of regenerating solution depends on resin properties and in particular on the interactions established between pfas and resin functional groups deng et al 2010 in fact data from regeneration experiments carried out using different mixtures of inorganic salts with or without organic alcohol demonstrated that the amount of pfas desorbed from three different types of strong ae resins depends on resin hydrophobicity and consequently on the interactions between pfas and the alkyl chains of the functional exchange group zaggia et al 2016 solution of ammonium salts such as nh4oh and nh4cl showed a good efficiency for the desorption of pfba pfbs pfoa and pfos from ae resins with trimethyl quaternary amine functional group i e purolite a600e and a520e whereas the same regenerating solution was totally ineffective in reactivating highly hydrophobic resin i e purolite a532e since the solvatation of fluorine chain was needed in order to remove pfas molecules from the active sites of the resin table 5 in that case the organic solvent could slacken the hydrophobic interactions between pfas and resin then the inorganic anions of ammonium salts oh or cl could replace pfas fig 4 achieving the recovery of the exchange capacity of the resin the effect of different temperatures of di water as regenerating solution on pfos desorption from bdac was also investigated deng et al 2015b results from regeneration experiments demonstrated that a higher temperature of di water about 80 c enhanced the pfos desorption and the regeneration percentage was about 53 table 5 furthermore pfos desorption from pacfs was about 5 when di water was employed as regenerating solution chen et al 2017 by contrast the regeneration percentage increased with the increase of ethanol concentration in the regeneration solution chen et al 2017 punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2014 nevertheless regenerating solution made of organic solvent is not suitable for the treatment of drinking water on full scale applications and consequently on site regeneration is not feasible it is noteworthy that the effect of om co adsorbed on materials may affect regeneration efficiency after five successive adsorption regeneration cycles the efficiency of bdac for pfcas removal pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa decreased while ae resin ira67 performance was relatively stable du et al 2015 co adsorbed organic pollutants on surface or pores of ac could interfere with the regeneration process it was the case of the r cac which was regenerated through different regenerating solutions made of 70 ethanol 90 methanol or 90 acetone after the regeneration r cac was reused for pfos and f 53b removal from industrial wastewater du et al 2016a due to the presence of non desorbed om the adsorption efficiency of regenerated r cac decreased after each regeneration cycle for this reason persulfate oxidation was tested as alternative regeneration process to the conventional elution with organic solvents regeneration results demonstrated that sulphate free radicals were able to diffuse into pores of activated carbon and they allowed the degradation of both pfas and other organic compounds however sulphate free radicals could cause the release of fluorine and short chained pfas due to break down of long chained pfas du et al 2016a consequently further investigations should be addressed in order to better understand the effect of sulphate and other free radicals on degradation of pfos overall the need of organic solvents for the chemical regeneration of pfas saturated adsorbents is a relevant limitation of this technique 6 2 thermal regeneration thermal regeneration in n2 gas stream of gac saturated with long chain pfas pfos pfhxs and pfoa has been investigated in order to evaluate the release of volatile organic fluorine vof or other compounds such as short chain compounds watanabe et al 2016 thermal regeneration may be optimized when gac is maintained at 700 c and later off gases will be kept at 1000 c nevertheless the high temperature needed for thermally regenerating ac may cause the decreasing of their adsorption properties and a change in ac morphology watanabe et al 2018 these described aspect of thermal regeneration of activated carbon deserve a deep investigation calcination at 600 c in air for 20 min has been investigated for the reusability of h bns saturated with pfda and pfos feng et al 2016 a temperature of 600 c was selected in order to reach the complete decomposition of the investigated pfas compounds since pfos and pfda are decomposed at about 480 c and 200 c respectively as inferred from differential scanning calorimetry curves feng et al 2016 moreover calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 was employed as additive to avoid the formation of short chain fluorinated gases during calcination process results about regeneration experiments of h bns via calcining demonstrated that adsorption capacity was maintained approximately constant during different adsorption regeneration cycles the amount of pfos or pfda on the surface of h bns at equilibrium ranged about 0 35 0 45 mg m 2 feng et al 2016 recently microwave mw irradiation became an alternative process to conventional thermal regeneration due to its advantages such as rapidity and selectivity heating falciglia et al 2018 this technique includes the conversion of mw electric field energy adsorbed by the solid medium i e activated carbon into heat at the molecular level falciglia et al 2017 the dielectric properties of activated carbon combined with pfas properties such as their volatility could allow the regeneration of pfas exhausted ac by means of the interactions between delocalized π electrons of ac and the mws mw regeneration of pfas exhausted ac deserve further investigation 7 conclusions and future research recommended 7 1 conclusions poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a large group of manmade chemicals characterized by high stability and persistence on environmental compartments among interim response measures adsorption technologies i e by activated carbon or anion exchange resin are currently employed for treatment of pfas impacted water the present critical review of data on pfas adsorption suggests that ň to date most of the experimental works published have been carried out under unrealistic operating conditions such as high dosage of adsorbent materials long ebct acid ph and high concentrations of pfas spiked in di water such conditions are not representative of either full scale treatment plants or actual environmental contaminations long chain pfas adsorption can involve the formation of aggregates on surface materials that may improve the adsorption efficiency by hydrophobic interactions furthermore when different long chain pfas co exist in solution the longest pfas outcompete the shorter due to a stronger hydrophobic interaction between the longest pfas and the adsorbent surface meso and macro porous adsorbents both ac and resin showed high adsorption capacity because long chain pfas can easily access anion exchange resins are more effective than activated carbon for both long and short chain pfas removal regardless of the adsorbent used the adsorption capacity of short chain pfas is lower than that observed for long chain pfas therefore short chain pfas removal is more challenging adsorption of short chain pfas seems related to the availability of active pore sites because the formation of micelles multi layer adsorption does not occur studies focused on the effect of om during adsorption process report contrasting results overall co existing om negatively affects short chain pfas adsorption due to active site competition whereas the effect of om seems less relevant during long chain pfas adsorption due to pore blockage and electrostatic repulsions negative effect of om on other adsorbent materials such as biochar mineral materials and magnetic nanoparticles is also reported effect of co existing om should be taken into account during both adsorption and regeneration processes chemical regeneration of pfas saturated adsorbents requires the use of organic solvents which are harmful nevertheless thermal regeneration at high temperature of exhausted activated carbon causes the decline of adsorption capacity and may release dangerous short chain fluorinated gases overall the in situ implementation of either chemical or thermal regeneration is not feasible 7 2 research needs the following specific research needs can be drawn based on the observed gaps in pfas removal by adsorption the investigation of pfas removal by adsorption especially short chain pfas under typical water treatment conditions i e adsorbent dose or ebct ph pfas concentrations is strongly advised an advanced characterization of om before and after the adsorption processes is also advised in particular fractionation of om measuring hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions as well as acid neutral and base fractions is relevant to better understand the adsorption mechanism and the effect of om size exclusion chromatography sec is also suggested to ascertain the effect of molecular weight of om characterization of adsorbent morphology by means of transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy before and after pfas uptake is also useful the simultaneous effect of ionic strength and om should be considered during pfas adsorption and further investigations are required in order to better understand the contribution of ionic om and inorganic ions i e monovalent and divalent cations on pfas removal further experimental works should be performed at different om fractions but at the same ionic strength in order minimize the possible effect of inorganic ions economic assessment of pfas removal techniques should also address the adsorbent disposal regeneration for instance the management of the eluate produced by chemical regeneration of the resins should be considered other unconventional techniques such as microwave irradiation may help to overcome issues concerning the regeneration of pfas saturated adsorbents a novel treatment train which allows the combination of separation and destructive technologies is expected for the sustainable removal of pfas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18173,poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a wide group of environmentally persistent organic compounds of industrial origin which are of great concern due to their harmful impact on human health and ecosystems amongst long chain pfas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos are the most detected in the aquatic environment even though their use has been limited by recent regulations recently more attention has been posed on the short chain compounds due to their use as an alternative to long chain ones and to their high mobility in the water bodies therefore short chain pfas have been increasingly detected in the environmental compartments the main process investigated and implemented for pfas removal is adsorption however to date most adsorption studies have focused on synthetic water the main objective of this article is to provide a critical review of the recent peer reviewed studies on the removal of long and short chain pfas by adsorption specific objectives are to review 1 the performance of different adsorbents for both long and short chain pfas 2 the effect of organic matter and 3 the adsorbent regeneration techniques strong anion exchange resins seem to better remove both long and short chain pfas however the adsorption capacity of short chain pfas is lower than that observed for long chain pfas therefore short chain pfas removal is more challenging furthermore the effect of organic matter on pfas adsorption in water or wastewater under real environmental conditions is overlooked in most studies high pfas levels have been often investigated without organic matter presence the rapid breakthrough of pfas is also a limiting factor and the regeneration of pfas exhausted adsorbents is very challenging and needs more

treatment plants 1 introduction 1 1 pfas classification poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a large group of anthropogenic aliphatic compounds that are of increasing concern worldwide due to their impact on environment and human health for many decades they have been used in an array of formulations as surfactants intermediates i e firefighting foams hydraulic fluids for aircrafts waterproofing treatment for textiles i e apparel carpet and household products i e paper and non stick cookware coating buck et al 2011 rahman et al 2014 xiao 2017 pfas contamination is the result of consumer product degradation firefighting activities and discharges of fluorochemical manufacturing facilities hu et al 2016 pfas are made up of a chain of varying carbon length on which at least one polyfluoroalkyl acids or all perfluoroalkyl acids of the hydrogen atoms bound to carbon chain in the nonfluorinated substances have been replaced by fluorine atoms buck et al 2011 their chemical structure also includes a charged functional group commonly carboxylic or sulfonic acids attached at one end polyfluoroalkyl acids have also been indicated as precursors of perfluoroalkyl ones hence the non fluorinated bond provides a biotic or abiotic degradation pathway itrc 2017 depending on their terminal functional group pfas can be distinguished in perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and in perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas buck et al 2011 however an abridged way to distinguish among pfas subclasses is that referred to carbon chain length according to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd the term long chain compound indicates pfcas with eight or more carbons and pfsas with six or more carbons whereas short chain is related to pfcas with seven or fewer carbons and pfsas with five or fewer carbons oecd unep global pfc group 2013 it should be noted that pfcas and pfsas classification based on chain length is different in terms of number of carbon atoms however pfas bioaccumulation and biomagnification into biota increase with the increasing of carbon chain length pfsas are more bioaccumulate than pfcas with the same chain length ahrens 2011 1 2 pfas properties the knowledge of pfas physical and chemical properties is paramount to understand their fate and transport in the environment the c f bound is the strongest covalent bond in organic chemistry and it leads to pfas thermal stability itrc 2017 in addition pfas exhibit mutually hydrophobic and lipophobic properties which are primarily attributed to the low polarizability of fluorine atoms moreover the terminal functional group attached to fluoroalkyl chain provides pfas chemical stability with the increasing replacement of hydrogen by fluorine as well as the increasing carbon chain length pfas become more chemically inert on the contrary their water solubility increases with the decreasing carbon chain length kucharzyk et al 2017 pfcas and pfsas are characterized by a low vapor pressure which makes air stripping an unsuitable technique for pfas removal rahman et al 2014 with the increasing c f chain length pfas become more lipophilic as demonstrated by octanol water partition coefficients kow at environmentally relevant ph pfas exhibit anionic species according to their low values of acid dissociation constant pka other properties such as resistance to thermal biological and chemical degradation and redox stability impart unique features to pfas making them suitable for several industrial applications information regarding chemical formulas and chemical abstracts service cas of selected per fluoroalkyl substances along with their physical and chemical properties are reported in table 1 1 3 occurrence of pfas in water in the aquatic environment pfas have been detected at low concentrations ranging from pg l 1 to μg l 1 kaboré et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 and long chain compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are the most commonly measured pfas around the world itrc 2017 widespread occurrence of pfas in urban water cycle including wastewater ww river water rw lake water lw drinking water dw stormwater and groundwater gw has been demonstrated by several studies appleman et al 2014 arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 ateia et al 2019 hölzer et al 2009 munoz et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 the amount of pfas not removed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and consequently released into the receiving environment is a concern for the possible presence of these compounds in water used for potable supply production a recent research suggests that the possible impacts of pfas on gw is linked to the use of treated ww for irrigation szabo et al 2018 the occurrence and distribution of pfas remain not completely identified due to the limited data about the removal efficiency of conventional water treatment plants and about the transformation of pfas precursor compounds appleman et al 2014 arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 although the use of pfos and pfoa has been reduced due to their health impact the total amount of pfas introduced into the environment has not been reduced because the long chain compounds have been replaced by short and ultra short pfas ateia et al 2019 the latter are potentially less bioaccumulated and bioconcentrated through trophic levels as compared to long chain but they are still environmentally persistent brendel et al 2018 oecd unep global pfc group 2013 1 4 pfas toxicity pfas are absorbed in human body after oral ingestion they are not metabolized and they are detected in human tissue and blood serum at typical concentrations of ng ml 1 long chain pfas are taken up and stored preferentially in the liver half life values of pfos and pfoa in humans range from 2 3 to 5 4 years hölzer et al 2009 stubleski et al 2017 epidemiological studies have shown that the occurrence of pfoa and pfos in humans is probably linked to a high incidence of thyroid disease high cholesterol ulcerative colitis kidney cancer testicular cancer and pregnancy induced hypertension crawford et al 2017 domingo and nadal 2017 more details concerning pfas toxicological properties are reported in literature dewitt 2015 based on who s recommendation and on the precautionary principle the proposal for a recast of the drinking water directive 98 83 ce directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption published on february 1 2018 has included the group of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances in the list of regulated chemicals the proposal recommends the values of 0 5 μg l 1 for the total amount of pfas and 0 1 μg l 1 for each single compound in 2017 the veneto region italy set drinking water quality standards for pfas veneto legislation 1590 201 with a limit value of 90 ng l 1 for pfoa and pfos with pfos 30 ng l 1 and a limit value of 300 ng l 1 for the other pfas sum of pfba pfpea pfbs pfhxa pfhpa pfhxs pfna pfdea pfuna pfdoa such regulation came after a large contamination of surface water and gw due to industrial ww discharges with the subsequent bioaccumulation of pfas in the serum of the exposed population as a result pfas are emerging contaminants already regulated in italy 1 5 pfas removal conventional treatment processes are ineffective for pfas degradation due to the high straight of the covalent c f bond of their chain their low concentration in water and their high hydrophilicity rahman et al 2014 ross et al 2018 biological treatment both aerobic and anaerobic are only able to break the c c bond and they lead to the formation of short chain pfas when advanced treatment technologies are not implemented biological wwtps affect the receiving water bodies and the concentration of pfas detected in finished water is often higher than in the untreated water arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 kaboré et al 2018 this fact gives evidence to recalcitrant behaviour of pfas to biological treatment and consequently their formation via biodegradation of precursor compounds rahman et al 2014 according to data obtained from monitoring studies pfas with long carbon chain such as pfos tend to accumulate in sludge whereas perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs has been mainly detected in the effluents of wwtps and in drinking water treatment plants dwtps arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 rahman et al 2014 under typical water treatment plant conditions disinfection by free chlorine or uv irradiation are ineffective appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 pfas are also much more resistant than other micro contaminants to the oxidation by ozone and hydroxyl radicals due to the strong c f bond and the electron withdrawing of their functional groups nzeribe et al 2019 trojanowicz et al 2018 furthermore advanced oxidation processes aops often result in a partial degradation of pfas with formation of pfas with shorter perfluorinated alkyl chain nzeribe et al 2019 trojanowicz et al 2018 adsorption anion exchange ae high pressure nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane processes are effective for substantial pfas removal appleman et al 2013 du et al 2014 kucharzyk et al 2017 main issues inherent with pfas removal through these mentioned techniques are the influence of water matrix i e competing anions organic matter frequent regeneration due to fast breakthrough and disposal of concentrate with high pfas concentration appleman et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 adsorption is actually an established technology for pfas removal both as single process of point of use applications and as step of water treatment plants arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 eschauzier et al 2012 quiñones and snyder 2009 moreover it shows a more economical performance compared to high pressure membrane processes rizzo et al 2019 roccaro et al 2013 as previously mentioned pfas exist as anions at ambient ph values and this makes strong base ae resins suitable for their removal however ae treatment efficiency depends on the resin properties including porosity functional group and polymer matrix deng et al 2010 to date adsorption studies have addressed single long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos even though long and short chain co removal requires further investigation ateia et al 2019 maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 moreover many compounds commonly present in water bodies could affect adsorption efficiency and additional studies should regard their potential competition ateia et al 2019 du et al 2015 2014 yu et al 2012 2 pfas adsorption and scope of the review 2 1 pfas adsorption mechanism electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are considered the predominant forces that govern adsorption of pfas on several adsorbent materials other less important mechanisms of pfas adsorption are hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding pfas molecular structure adsorbent chemistry and physical properties i e surface functional groups polarity and porosity as well as liquid phase composition should be considered as the main factors affecting pfas adsorption efficiency du et al 2014 electrostatic interactions occur between anionic pfas and adsorbent material positively charged consequently any changes in ionic strength i e co existing inorganic anions and changing solution ph could affect adsorption efficiency due to electrostatic repulsions du et al 2014 change in solution ph has an effect on the charge characteristics of pfas molecules and surface properties of adsorbents liu et al 2018 yu et al 2008 as reported in several studies an increase in ph solution led to a decrease in adsorption capacity of most adsorbents deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 qian et al 2017 nevertheless an increase of ionic strength ascribed to the presence of monovalent and divalent cations i e na k ca2 mg2 might enhance the pfas removal due to the compression of the electrical double layer du et al 2014 xiao et al 2011 the salting out effect should be also mentioned as reported in previous studies carter and farrell 2010 chen et al 2016 this effect occurs at high salt concentrations and it involves a decline of pfas solubility and consequently their adsorption on adsorbent surface could be encouraged du et al 2014 it is clear that the presence of inorganic anions i e cl and so4 involves a competition with pfas for adsorption sites deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 however the worsening of pfas removal occurred when solution ph was higher than point of zero charge of the adsorbents due to the establishment of electrostatic repulsions chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 electrostatic repulsions between anions pfas and negatively charged surfaces can be overcome through hydrophobic interactions of fluorinated chain zaggia et al 2016 moreover removal efficiency of individual pfas into adsorbent materials depends on the compound functional groups and c f chain length in detail pfsas are removed better than pfcas and long chain compounds with the same functional group are more efficiently removed than short chain ones appleman et al 2014 du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 xiao et al 2011 zaggia et al 2016 hydrophobic effect has been found to increase with the increasing c f chain length du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 this was also demonstrated in a prior work that investigated the competitive adsorption among pfas with different chain length on kaolinite xiao et al 2011 the authors argued that due to a stronger hydrophobic interaction with the tested adsorbent the longer chained pfas outcompeted the shorter during adsorption based on pfas functional group the presence of one more c f bond in pfsas compared to corresponding pfcas results in stronger hydrophobic properties and increasing adsorption of pfsas chen et al 2016 zaggia et al 2016 moreover strong hydrophobic interactions favour the formation of molecular aggregates during pfoa and pfos removal while highly hydrophilic compounds such as pfba and pfbs are removed as single molecules on adsorbent active sites du et al 2014 exceeding the critical micelle concentration c m c may lead to the formation of multilayer structures i e micelles and hemi micelles on adsorbent surfaces that may play an important role in pfas adsorption appleman et al 2014 deng et al 2013 du et al 2014 however at the pfas environmental level the formation of micelles is unlikely and only aggregates have been observed zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 reported that pfas adsorption process may include two distinct phases initially removal occurs through pfas adsorption on open sites of adsorbents gradually pore sites become clogged and removal becomes a function of molecular aggregation of pfas mccleaf et al 2017 since electrostatic negativity is originated from pfas functional head and hydrophobic interaction is linked to c f chain the electrostatic interactions seem to be dominant for short chain pfas while longer pfas are adsorbed through hydrophobic interactions which favour the formation of molecular aggregate on the active surface deng et al 2012 du et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 2 2 scope of the review an important limitation of prior research on pfas adsorption is that the evaluation of adsorption efficiency has been explored at high pfas concentrations which are not representative of the environmental concentration level furthermore very high doses of adsorbents have been used which do not reflect the actual water treatment plant adsorption processes rahman et al 2014 another relevant limitation of prior researches is that the experiments have often been carried out by using deionized water di spiked with selected pfas and the effect of organic matter om was not accounted for du et al 2014 recent studies have shown that om may not affect pfas removal sgroi et al 2018a or may positively influence the pfas adsorption mccleaf et al 2017 however natural organic matter nom and effluent organic matter efom often play a competitive role in the adsorption process appleman et al 2013 kothawala et al 2017 therefore a critical review of the published data is needed to better understand the om effect on long and short chain pfas removal furthermore the regeneration of adsorbents exhausted by pfas is not fully addressed woodard et al 2017 since pfas breakthrough is fast adsorbent regeneration is a very important and challenging task previous published review papers deals with pfas classification and origins buck et al 2011 xiao 2017 their occurrence and fate in aquatic environments ahrens 2011 arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 rahman et al 2014 and the treatment technologies for long chain pfas removal appleman et al 2014 kucharzyk et al 2017 a critical review concerning pfas adsorption previously published is mainly concerned with pfos and pfoa du et al 2014 and it does not include recent scientific findings on om effect as well as the performance and the regeneration of novel adsorbents recently the removal of short chain pfas by different processes including different adsorbents has been critically reviewed by ateia et al 2019 however such prior review papers concerning pfas adsorption were not focused on the role of pfas chain length om effect and adsorbents regeneration therefore the objective of this paper is to critically discuss data concerning pfas adsorption with particular focus on 1 recent published data about adsorption capacity of different materials for both long and short chain pfas 2 effect of om on the pfas adsorption 3 role of adsorbent regeneration 3 adsorption of long chain pfas 3 1 pfoa and pfos a number of studies have been carried out worldwide in order to investigate long chain pfas removal by adsorption on different materials pfoa and pfos are commonly regarded as the most representative pfas due to their persistence in the environment and occurrence in industrial applications a prior review paper indicated that long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos have been mainly removed through hydrophobic interactions and adsorbents with amine groups generally have high adsorption capacity du et al 2014 the adsorption of long chain pfas on different adsorbents commercially available or synthetized obtained from batch adsorption tests is discussed in the following sections table 2 reports the adsorption capacity obtained from published data fitting the langmuir model along with adsorbent material type and dosage long chain pfas initial concentrations and experimental setups 3 2 activated carbon and biochar among commercial adsorbents activated carbon ac has been widely investigated for pfos and pfoa removal liang et al 2011 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 rattanaoudom et al 2012 in detail powdered activated carbon pac had higher adsorption capacity than granular activated carbon gac for both pfoa and pfos chen et al 2017 yu et al 2009 results about adsorption of pfoa on bamboo derived activated carbon bdac have shown that a long time about 34 h was required to reach adsorption equilibrium du et al 2015 the comparison between bdac and microporous ac revealed that the adsorption capacity of bdac was higher than that of microporous ac du et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this evidence corroborates that microporous adsorbents are not suitable for removing large molecules i e long chain pfsas and pfcas and it is in agreement with results from fixed bed column tests as detailed below appleman et al 2013 du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 rattanaoudom et al 2012 zaggia et al 2016 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b is a pfos alternative compound both f 53b and pfos compounds have been detected at high concentrations in an actual chrome plating ww du et al 2016a electroplating wastewater treatment plant ewtp employing reduction reaction adding na2s2o5 precipitation adding ca oh 2 and flocculation sedimentation adding anionic polyacrylamide pam was unable to effectively remove pfos and f 53b hence batch adsorption experiments were performed and a commercial coconut shell based gac r cac after an activation process at low koh c ratio was selected as adsorbent material for pfos and f 53b removal du et al 2016a f 53b is more hydrophobic than pfos due to an ether unit in the molecular structure and this led to a much higher adsorption capacity of f 53b two fold higher than pfos onto r cac table 2 single walled carbon nanotubes swnt are hollow cylindrical tubes made of graphene layers and a lattice of c atoms and they have been investigated for pfos and pfoa removal wang et al 2016 the comparison of microporous ac efficiency with swnt in removing pfoa at the same concentration revealed that microporous ac has a higher adsorption capacity than swnt this difference may be linked to the higher surface area of microporous ac than that of swnt table 2 moreover adsorption capacities of swnt and ac for pfos were 6 and 2 times higher respectively than that of pfoa probably due to the one more c f unit of the pfos molecule wang et al 2016 in addition swnt exhibited higher adsorption capacity than multi walled carbon nanotubes mwnt consistent with their higher brunauer emmett and teller bet surface area chen et al 2011 li et al 2011 pfas adsorption on biochar has also been investigated because of its cost effectiveness and affinity with organic compounds guo et al 2017 inyang and dickenson 2017 x xiao et al 2017 pinewood pwc and hardwood hwc biochars have been tested for pfoa removal and the adsorption capacity of the biochar was lower than that of ac table 2 guo et al 2017 have demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of corn straw derived biochar for pfos removal increased with the increase of pyrolytic temperature which is related to bet surface area of biochar table 2 reported data from fixed bed column tests showed the ability of gac to remove traces of pfas as both complex mixture or single solute from water intended for human consumption appleman et al 2014 chularueangaksorn et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 2015 sgroi et al 2018a zaggia et al 2016 gac filtrasorb 400 calgon column tested for pfoa removal has shown that the bed volumes were about 55 000 at 90 breakthrough point chularueangaksorn et al 2014 the same gac filtrasorb 400 calgon has been tested for long chain pfcas i e pfoa pfna pfda pfuna pfdoda pfteda and pfsas i e pfhxs and pfos removal and the observed removal efficiencies were in the range 65 80 mccleaf et al 2017 information about the influence of gac pore distribution on adsorption capacity of pfos and pfoa were reported by zaggia et al 2016 results from continuous adsorption experiments have demonstrated the great efficiency of bituminous ac characterized by meso and macropores for pfoa and pfos removal whose maximum adsorption capacity was 39 6 and 4 1 μg g 1 respectively zaggia et al 2016 in fact meso and macro porous adsorbent materials are more easily accessed by long chain pfas resulting in higher adsorption capacity kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 a high dosage of gac filtrasorb 400 calgon was tested in a pre equilibrium batch study for the removal of a complex mixture of long chain pfsas pfhxs and pfos and pfcas pfoa pfna pfda pfunda pfdoda from lw kothawala et al 2017 regardless of om concentration long chain pfas removal was in the range of 50 90 kothawala et al 2017 however these results were obtained from a pre equilibrium study contact time was 15 min with a gac dose 10 g l 1 that is not typically employed at water treatment plants 3 3 molecularly imprinted polymers several experimental works have explored the pfas adsorption onto synthetically modified polymers which are adsorbents conveniently synthetized to have high affinity and selectivity towards the target contaminants guo et al 2018 karoyo and wilson 2016 l xiao et al 2017 the macromolecular imprinted materials mims containing β cyclodextrin β cd within a urethane framework provide two types of binding sites one binding site is a β cd inclusion site the second is a non inclusion interstitial site of the cross linker domains where aggregates micelles and other inclusion complexes could be formed karoyo and wilson 2016 formation of bilayer and multilayer structures is the dominant adsorption process for both pfoa and pfos in these materials as observed in several studies du et al 2014 gao et al 2017 karoyo and wilson 2016 the modification of cd based polymer adsorbents composition may allow an increasing of pfoa removal l xiao et al 2017 nevertheless the removal efficiency of cross linked polymer network where β cd substitutes decafluorobiphenyl dfb cdp was comparable with that of biochar tested by inyang and dickenson 2017 adsorption efficiency of non imprinted carbon microspheres nip cms for pfos removal has been compared with a surface imprinted polymer mip cms in which double functional monomers of methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and 2 trifluoromethyl acrylic acid tfma have been synthetized on carbon microspheres guo et al 2018 the adsorption capacity was higher for mip cms than nip cms table 2 due to the effect of molecularly imprinting technique in enhancing pfos removal the molecular imprinting technique has also been employed in order to prepare a novel adsorbent using chitosan crosslinked for pfos removal and its adsorption capacity was higher than that observed for non imprinted ones yu et al 2008 3 4 anion exchange resin several studies have indicated the suitability of the ae process for pfas removal otherwise pfas removal efficiency varied greatly among ae resins due to their properties such as polymer matrix functional group and porosity zaggia et al 2016 it was demonstrated that large pores of macroporous resin allow a faster diffusion of pfos than the gel one deng et al 2010 this evidence is confirmed by comparing the adsorption capacity of ira910 polystyrene dvb macroporous type and ira400 styrene dvb gel type for pfos removal maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2009 moreover polymer matrixes led to different intraparticle diffusion and a polyacrylic resin has shown higher efficiency for pfos removal than polystyrene one deng et al 2010 ira910 exhibited a good selectivity also for pfhxs as demonstrated by maimaiti et al 2018 when ira67 polyacrylic dvb gel type has been employed its adsorption capacity was higher than styrene type resins table 2 gao et al 2017 demonstrated the great applicability of polyacrylic resin for f 53b removal since the adsorption capacity of ira67 about 2400 mg g 1 was higher than that of r cac in batch experiments table 2 as regards long chain pfcas pfoa removal has been investigated on different kinds of strong ae resins du et al 2015 maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2009 based on table 2 the highest adsorption capacity was obtained when ira910 polystyrene dvb macroporous type resin was employed maimaiti et al 2018 the adsorption capacity of ira67 was higher than that of bdac both adsorbents tested at the same pfoa initial concentration table 2 the efficiency of ira67 may be ascribed to the amine groups on the resin surface which involve the pfoa adsorption via ae mechanisms besides the open pore structure of ira67 also allowed a better diffusion of pfoa molecules moreover as demonstrated by zaggia et al 2016 the selectivity of larger and more hydrophobic anions i e pfos and pfoa increased with the increasing of alkyl chain length of the functional group of ae resins differences in terms of equilibrium exchange capacity of different type of resins are linked with the strength of hydrophobic interactions between resin functional groups and pfas molecules considering hydrophobicity of resin highly hydrophobic resins such as a532e favour pfoa and pfos passage from hydrated state to adsorbed state as confirmed by the highest adsorption capacity values obtained on both batch and continuous flow pilot scale experiments zaggia et al 2016 the comparison between the performance of ae resin and gac for long chain pfas removal has also been carried out by employing the fixed bed column tests particularly as demonstrated by chularueangaksorn et al 2014 pfa300 ae resin polystyrene crosslinked dvb could treat a higher amount of water than gac filtrasorb 400 calgon before the saturation at a 90 breakthrough point bed volumes were 119 880 and 55 080 respectively a532e polystyrene dvb gel type bifunctional quaternary amine exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for both pfos and pfoa among several adsorbent materials tested i e coconut based gac bituminous coal based gac mildly hydrophobic and non hydrophobic resins during continuous experiments zaggia et al 2016 removal efficiencies of ae resin a600 polystyrene dvb gel type for long chain pfcas pfoa pfna pfda pfuna pfdoda pfteda and pfsas pfhxs and pfos were in the range 33 94 after 50 704 bed volumes bvs whereas removal efficiencies of gac filtrasorb 400 calgon column were in the range 28 94 after 49 523 bvs mccleaf et al 2017 3 5 synthetized materials with the purpose of identifying the best suitable adsorbent for pfas removal it is currently practice to synthesize new materials with properties and structures easy to control and modify to date new adsorbents with higher selectivity and specificity designed towards pfas removal are also becoming commercially available for water treatment applications for instance a porous aromatic framework constructed from benzene rings paf 45 was employed for pfos removal luo et al 2016 despite the remarkable adsorption capacity table 2 paf 45 feasibility was influenced by ph solution and ionic strength since the adsorption capacity was higher at acidic ph values i e ph 3 moreover the adsorption isotherm experiments have been carried out at pfos concentrations in the range of 50 200 mg l 1 luo et al 2016 which are much higher than the pfas concentrations typically detected in the water environment rahman et al 2014 covalent triazine based framework ctf has been investigated for removing different long chain compounds pfoa pfhxs and pfos due to its large surface area and rigid pore structure wang et al 2016 among the three long chain pfas tested wang et al 2016 have demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of ctf was highest for pfos table 2 the electrostatic interaction between pfas anion head and triazine groups of ctf positively charged represents the main driving force for pfas adsorption on ctf based on electrostatic interactions which are the main adsorption mechanism of short chain pfas ctf exhibited a good adsorption capacity for pfbs and pfba removal as it will be discussed below boron nitride characterized by lightness structure and thermal stability has been synthesized as porous hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets h bns for pfos and pfda removal feng et al 2016 the efficiency of this adsorbent material has been demonstrated to be linked with chain length and functional group of pfas since pfda was more favourable adsorbed than pfos adsorption capacity of 0 16 mg m 2 and 0 04 mg m 2 respectively among novel adsorbent materials investigated magnetic nanoparticles attached into fluorographene 2 mnps fg mass ratio of mnps and fg is 3 5 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for pfos instead of pfoa table 2 however adsorbent dosage was not coherent with that really employed in full scale treatment plants wang et al 2018 quaternized cotton and aminated rice husk arh both prepared with atom transfer radical polymerization atrp technique were tested for pfos and pfoa removal deng et al 2013 2012 results have demonstrated that quaternized cotton had higher adsorption capacity than arh for both pfos and pfoa table 2 polyacrylonitrile fiber panf derived activated carbon fibers pacfs showed a remarkable adsorption capacity for pfos and pfoa chen et al 2017 the adsorption affinity could be ascribed to its high specific surface area and micro and mesoporous structure which allowed the establishment of multilayer adsorption formation of hemi micelles and micelles the latter was also the main adsorption mechanism on crosslinked chitosan beads employed for pfos removal as demonstrated by zhang et al 2011 poly ethylenimine functionalized cellulose microcrystals pei f cmc have been tested for removing long chain pfas at environmentally relevant concentration level ateia et al 2018 long chain pfas removal percentage was in the range of 80 98 despite its low surface area pei f cmc exhibited a good adsorption affinity both in di and in the presence of co existing om as discussed in section 5 the main drawback of those synthetized materials is the application at full scale treatment plants because their production is not industrialized and probably they are not commercially available unlike ac and ae resins economic assessment for new synthetized materials is needed 3 6 nanoparticles materials the adsorption of pfas into nanoparticles nps has recently been investigated due to their co existing in aquatic environments i e marine debris plastic or their high surface area and reactivity i e iron oxides as demonstrated by lu et al 2016 nano oxides such as titania tio2 iron oxides fe2o3 alumina al2o3 and silica sio2 have the ability to sorb pfos among the different nano oxides tested al2o3 showed the highest pfos adsorption capacity 1 1 μg m 2 whereas sio2 exhibited the lower adsorption capacity 0 1 μg m 2 this difference in terms of pfos removal should be ascribed to the different hydroxyl groups and surface area furthermore the main adsorption mechanism of pfos on nano oxides was not only electrostatic interaction but also the formation of hydrogen bounds between the pfos sulfonic terminal group and nano oxides surface lu et al 2016 magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 np were used as the substrate of a novel magnetic nanocomposite fe3o4 sio2 nh2 f13 in which silica membrane functionalized with amino group and octyl perfluorinated chain was synthesized on the fe3o4 np surface zhou et al 2016 based on kinetic data the predominant adsorption mechanism between the magnetic adsorbent and pfas tested was chemisorption which includes both electrostatic and f f interaction zhou et al 2016 in detail the selective f f interaction between octyl perfluorinated chain on the magnetic composite surface and perfluoroalkyl dipole shell in pfas molecule was enhanced by electrostatic attraction of nh2 and the anionic cooh or so3h of pfcas and pfsas molecules respectively due to size exclusion effect pfcas were better adsorbed than pfsas on fe3o4 sio2 nh2 f13 considering perfluoroalkyl chain length pfunda exhibited the highest adsorption capacity onto fe3o4 sio2 nh2 f13 due to the formation of aggregate structure between long chain pfas which could stick together and consequently the amount of pfas adsorbed increased zhou et al 2016 a recent experimental work investigated the capability of microplastics mpls to sorb a complex mixture of pfas from rw ebro river and seawater seaw simulating realistic environmental conditions llorca et al 2018 high density polyethylene hdpe polystyrene ps and poly styrene carboxylic acid ps cooh were selected due to their wide occurrence as marine debris plastic results of batch adsorption experiments showed low removal percentages 27 of long chain pfas in rw after 7 days with few exceptions of pftra and pftea whose percentages were between 65 and 70 moreover mpls efficiency in seaw was affected by water chemistry such as salinity and om concentration this point will be deeply explained later see section 5 overall carboxylated compounds with more than 11 c atoms were the most removed llorca et al 2018 in detail hdpe exhibited the worst adsorption capacity due to its granular shape which limited the intraparticle diffusion llorca et al 2018 in rw pfoa pfna pfhxs and pfos did not present any adsorption on both hdpe and ps cooh throughout the experiment period on the contrary affinity between carboxylated compounds with less than 10 c atoms and hdpe was higher in seaw adsorption rates of pfcas on ps cooh in rw increased with the increasing of chain length comparing pfcas to pfsas with the same chain length the carboxylated compounds were less removed llorca et al 2018 whereas in seaw the presence of carboxylic group in the ps cooh surface implicated an increase of adsorption rates of carboxylated compounds adsorption kinetics were influenced by adsorbents size therefore ps exhibited faster kinetic than hdpe since it had the smallest particles llorca et al 2018 4 adsorption of short chain pfas 4 1 challenges in short chain pfas adsorption short chain pfas and their precursors are as persistent as those long chained therefore although they show less bioaccumulation potential their environmental occurrence is of concern ateia et al 2019 brendel et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 while long chain pfas are binding with particles present in solution those short chain are mainly in the dissolved phase resulting in long range transport in aquatic environments ahrens 2011 therefore short chain pfas have higher mobility in water bodies than long chain compounds specifically short chain compounds could significantly affect drinking water supplies increasing the human exposure to pfas compounds considering the properties of short chain pfas table 1 it is expected that the large scale remediation treatments currently suitable for long chain pfas are ineffective for short chain pfas ateia et al 2019 brendel et al 2018 this evidence is consistent with data from full scale drinking water treatment plants arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 rahman et al 2014 moreover it is widely reported that carbon chain length influences adsorption capacities of pfas onto various materials since adsorption rate seems to increase with the increase of molecular size appleman et al 2014 data collected from full scale treatment plants drinking and wastewater facilities suggested that the removal of short chain compounds is still a challenge task due to their early and faster breakthrough arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 to date a restricted number of published data have addressed short chain pfas adsorption by using different materials because most of the experimental works have focused on the removal of long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos adsorption capacities obtained by fitting the langmuir model along with type and dosage of adsorbent materials initial concentration of short chain pfas and experimental setup are reported in table 3 comparisons between several adsorbent materials tested for short chain pfas are reviewed based on both batch experiment studies table 3 and fixed bed column tests the adsorption capacity of materials tested for pfba removal observed during batch tests table 3 follows the order microporous ac ctf ira910 strong ae resin however results obtained by continuous experiments have demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of meso porous gac meso porous bituminous coal derived ac was higher than a532e strong ae resin 4 3 and 3 3 μg g 1 respectively zaggia et al 2016 in the following sections the removal of short chain pfas by adsorption is discussed based on the type of adsorbent 4 2 activated carbon biochar and other adsorbents the performance of bdac and coal based ac microporous type used for removing pfhxa has been compared the adsorption capacity of bdac was 13 times lower than microporous ac probably due to its low bet surface area and the presence of om in the solution tested du et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the adsorption capacities of hwc and pwc biochars for pfba and pfoa removal were investigated by inyang and dickenson 2017 results from adsorption kinetic tests showed that the amount of pfba adsorbed on both hwc and pwc was 3 4 times lower than that of pfoa this evidence suggests the incapability of biochar for short chain pfas removal and it may prove the competition between long and short chain pfas for the adsorption sites and or competition with om inyang and dickenson 2017 short chain pfas adsorption on gac and pac has also been investigated by using batch test hansen et al 2010 tests have been carried out at real concentrations of short chain pfas range about 73 320 ng l 1 and using an adsorbent dose comparable to that used in real water treatment plants range about 25 125 mg l 1 results have demonstrated that pac has higher adsorption capacity than gac more than twice due to the shorter internal diffusion distances and its higher bet surface area hansen et al 2010 mwcnts functionalized in different ways mwcnts pri mwcnts cooh mwcnts oh were tested for pfbs removal deng et al 2015a removal percentage of pfbs on mwcnts was about 30 in di water whereas when humic acids ha and phenol co existed in the solution this percentage was lower than 20 deng et al 2015a moreover due to the weak hydrophobicity of pfbs its percentage removal was lower than that of long chain compounds deng et al 2015a results of adsorption isotherm of pfos and pfbs on boehmite showed that pfos was better removed than pfbs since the effect of surface aggregation enhanced long chain pfas removal wang et al 2015 among fixed bed column experiments carried out in order to assert the short chain pfas removal mccleaf et al 2017 reported faster breakthrough and lower removal percentage of short chain pfcas on gac column f400 calgon than long chain ones the removal efficiencies of the short chain pfcas tested i e pfba pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa were lower than 19 on gac column after 49 523 bvs whereas the removal efficiency of pfbs short chained pfsas tested was 10 those results suggest that short chain pfas removal depends mainly on the availability of active sites since they do not bind with other particles and consequently the formation of aggregates does not occur mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 moreover desorption of short chain pfas has been also hypothesized due to the competition of long chain pfas and or om similar fast breakthrough of short chain pfas has also been observed in rapid small scale column tests rssct carried out on different types of gac columns appleman et al 2013 among the three activated carbons tested f300 microporous bituminous coal derived exhibited the lowest efficiency for the short chain pfcas tested i e pfba pfpea and pfhxa due to its pores distribution mainly microporous type and bet surface area others gac tested coconut based gac aquacarb 1240 and bituminous coal based ones f600 performed better for the removal of selected short chain pfas appleman et al 2013 pfba uptake on different types of biochar was influenced by bet surface area indeed the highest percentage removal has been found on the hardwood sawdust pellets gasified at 900 c hwc which had the highest bet surface area among the different biochars tested inyang and dickenson 2017 however results obtained from batch adsorption kinetic tests have demonstrated that gac removed pfba better than hwc inyang and dickenson 2017 short chain pfas adsorption on microplastics hdpe ps and ps cooh has recently been investigated in simulated realistic environmental conditions llorca et al 2018 due to the increase in ionic strength short chain carboxylates compounds have been better removed by ps cooh in seaw than in rw whereas short chain pfas were almost not adsorbed onto ps and hdpe llorca et al 2018 removal of pfbs short chain pfsas has been investigated at batch mode by means of ac i e microporous ac and calgon f400 and ctf ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 wang et al 2016 the difference of adsorption capacity between ctf and ac may be related to their different structure and consequently adsorption mechanisms established since the electrostatic interactions between pfas anion head and triazine groups of ctf involved short chain pfas adsorption on ctf wang et al 2016 however ctf exhibited a lower affinity with pfba than arh table 3 adsorption capacity of arh was 4 times higher than ctf deng et al 2013 wang et al 2016 a novel adsorbent poly ethylenimine functionalized cellulose microcrystal pei f cmc has been synthetized and its efficiency for short chain removal has been evaluated at environmental relevant concentration levels ateia et al 2018 results have demonstrated that short chain with sulfonate terminal group were removed better than short chain pfcas in agreement with previous experimental studies mccleaf et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 4 3 anion exchange the removal efficiency of three pfcas owning different chain lengths including pfhxa with 6 c atoms pfhpa with 7 c atoms and pfoa with 8 c atoms from industrial ww perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride washing wastewater pfsof www by ae resin has been evaluated during batch experiments conducted by du et al 2015 results demonstrated that adsorption sites on ira67 were occupied by pfoa molecules prior to the others pfcas and therefore the adsorption rates of short chain were lower consequently short chain pfcas reached the equilibrium very fast du et al 2015 moreover comparing the efficiency of two different anion exchange resins i e ira910 and ira67 for removing the same compound pfhxa ira910 polystyrene dvb macroporous type exhibited higher adsorption capacity than ira67 polyacrylic dvb gel type du et al 2015 maimaiti et al 2018 this difference in adsorption capacity for pfhxa may be linked to the resin properties such as polymer matrix and porosity and or to the effect of om present in the solution in fact ira910 was tested in di water whereas ira67 was employed for pfhxa removal from pfsof www du et al 2015 maimaiti et al 2018 moreover when tested for the same actual ww ira67 had higher affinity with pfhpa than bdac as demonstrated by the adsorption capacity which was 3 times higher than that of bdac du et al 2015 furthermore amine groups on adsorbent surface improved the short chain pfas removal due to the establishment of electrostatic interactions which are the main driving force during short chain adsorption deng et al 2013 du et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 results provided by fixed bed column tests demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of a532e strong ae resin was almost equal to that of gac meso porous bituminous coal derived ac when tested for pfbs removal 4 7 μg g 1 and 4 1 μg g 1 respectively zaggia et al 2016 results from fixed bed column experiments carried out by mccleaf et al 2017 have shown fast breakthrough and low removal percentage for short chain pfcas on ae resin a600 polystyrene dvb gel type the removal efficiencies of short chained pfcas tested were 11 on a600 column after 50 704 bvs the same anion exchange resin better removed pfbs short chain pfsas tested than other short chain compounds and the removal efficiency of pfbs was 55 mccleaf et al 2017 results from a pre equilibrium study carried out by kothawala et al 2017 demonstrated that fresh adsorbent materials i e ae resin purolite a600 and gac filtrasorb 400 could remove short chain pfas from water solutions nevertheless anion exchange showed the highest percent of removal in detail removal percentages of short chain pfas pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfbs were about 90 and 50 on a600 and filtrasorb 400 respectively however those results have been obtained from a pre equilibrium study contact time was equal to 15 min with a high dosage of adsorbent materials kothawala et al 2017 analysis of transmission electron microscopy tem carried out on ae resins allowed a deep understanding of the predominant adsorption mechanism involved during short chain pfas removal zaggia et al 2016 indeed tem images showed that the weak hydrophobic interactions between pfba or pfbs and resin surface did not allow the formation of aggregates and consequently ae of single molecules was the main mechanism for short chain removal overall ae resins exhibit a remarkable adsorption capacity for both long and short chain pfas nevertheless the possible release of disinfection by products dbp such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma may represent the main drawback for their full scale application sgroi et al 2018b particularly the amount of ndma and their precursors released upon usage depends on the resin functional group such as amine groups and operational conditions such as regeneration activities and flow interruptions 4 4 comparison between long and short chain pfas adsorption in order to provide a deeper analysis on the long and short chain pfas removal by adsorption data from tables 2 and 3 have been elaborated to build a box and whiskers plot fig 1 that allows the comparison between the removals of long and short chain pfas by different adsorbents classified as activated carbon resin and synthetized materials fig 1 shows that the adsorption capacity of a wide range of adsorbents is lower for short chain pfas compared to that observed for long chain pfas this result emphasizes that the removal of short chain pfas by adsorption is very challenging and it will need more research in the future a comparison in adsorption capacity of the different adsorbents employed have shown that resins are more effective than activated carbons for both long and short chain pfas removal activated carbon exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity a significant variation in adsorption capacity of synthetized materials used for long chain removal was observed such variation ranged from the lowest to the highest adsorption capacity observed for long chain pfas removal however the latter best results were often obtained at acid ph for instance the best adsorption capacity 5847 mg g 1 was found by using the paf 45 adsorbent at ph 3 therefore the real operating conditions may affect the removal efficiency for instance the effect om may significantly influence the performance of adsorbents as discussed in the next section 5 effect of organic matter om on pfas adsorption 5 1 pfas adsorption in presence of om om is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and it can be distinguished between nom regarded as om naturally present in surface water and efom the om released from wwtps shon et al 2006 om could affect adsorption efficiency of adsorbent materials due to binding and adsorption interactions with pfas including long and short chain compounds as illustrated by du et al 2014 nom could interact with pfas via electrostatic and or hydrophobic interactions firstly om is mostly constituted of anionic species and after adsorbing on materials it can lead to repulsive electrostatic interactions meanwhile nom can also lead to pfas adsorption via hydrophobic interaction between perfluoroalkyl tail and nom adsorbed on the adsorbent surfaces to date it is not well understood how these effects co exist and which is predominant most of undertaken experimental works investigated adsorption properties of pfas on different adsorbent materials in di deng et al 2012 guo et al 2018 maimaiti et al 2018 yu et al 2009 many researches have selected fulvic and humic acids fa and ha as the model dom in order to evaluate the impact of dom on pfas adsorption deng et al 2015a du et al 2016b maimaiti et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 f wang et al 2015 l xiao et al 2017 actually nom consists of a wide range of organic compounds such as hydrophilic acids proteins carboxylic and amino acids in addition to the already mentioned ha and fa when using a synthetic solution of om during experimental studies some interactions between pfas and water matrix have not been described in detail table 4 reports the main experimental works published related to the adsorption of pfas both long and short chain compounds on different adsorbent materials in the presence of om however some of those studies lacked a detailed discussion on the effect of om on pfas adsorption most of these experimental studies appleman et al 2013 du et al 2016b 2016a y wang et al 2015 l xiao et al 2017 have investigated the effect of om on pfas adsorption through comparison between synthetic om solution and om free solution table 4 only few experimental works compared the effect of different dom sources on pfas adsorption and tested water had different dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations ateia et al 2018 inyang and dickenson 2017 kothawala et al 2017 sgroi et al 2018a wang et al 2018 furthermore the simultaneous effect of ionic strength and om on the pfas adsorption is very complex for instance it was demonstrated that the presence of monovalent and divalent cations increases pfas adsorption on different materials i e sediments higgins and luthy 2006 activated carbon du et al 2015 synthesized material paf 45 luo et al 2016 resin du et al 2015 and kaolite xiao et al 2011 particularly the adsorption of short chain pfas i e pfhxa and pfba on kaolinite was more thermodynamically favourable at a higher na concentration due to the compression of the electrical double layer and ensuing reduced electrostatic repulsion between pfas and kaolite surface xiao et al 2011 in addition divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 could also improve pfas removal by divalent cation bridging effect du et al 2015 2014 on the contrary the presence of inorganic anion negatively affects the adsorption of pfas due to the competition for adsorption sites deng et al 2010 whereas it was observed that the presence of ionic om i e ha sds fa compete with both long f wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 and short chain pfas maimaiti et al 2018 zhao et al 2011 specifically such effect seems more relevant for short chain pfas due to the competition for active sites maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 on the other hand hydrophobic dom was found to improve the pfas retention in gac adsorption while hydrophilic dom seems do not affect significantly pfas adsorption in both gac and ae adsorption experiments kothawala et al 2017 the positive impact of dom on the adsorption of long chain pfas has been ascribed to the formation of pfas aggregate or dom pfas complexes kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 but such bonds have been rarely demonstrated consequently the impact of dom and ionic strength on the pfas adsorption need more investigation a systematic review concerning the effect of om on pfas adsorption for different classes of adsorbents is reported in the following sections 5 2 activated carbon among adsorbent materials ac has proven to be effective for pfas removal and its efficiency in presence of om has been investigated both in batch and column experiments table 4 contrasting trends have been observed in experimental studies because of the influence of co existing om indeed the performance of pfas adsorption onto ac was found negatively impacted enhanced or not influenced by the presence of om the main interactions that could be established between om molecules and pfas both long and short chain during adsorption on gac column are illustrated in fig 2 in detail hydrophobic interactions mainly concern long chained c f molecules while short chain pfas interact with om molecules through pore blockage and electrostatic repulsions in many cases activated carbon performance was negatively influenced by co existing om and its efficiency decreased with the increase of doc concentrations du et al 2016a 2015 hansen et al 2010 kothawala et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 2015 y wang et al 2015 yu et al 2012 zhao et al 2011 on the contrary adsorption capacity on gac did not significantly decrease in the presence of gw nom probably due to the high concentration of pfas tested 50 mg l 1 and to the effect of ionic strength zhao et al 2011 results from the previously mentioned study demonstrated that pfba removal was affected by om since the results from adsorption equilibrium suggested a reduction of 40 zhao et al 2011 results from adsorption kinetic experiments provided by yu et al 2012 suggested that adsorption equilibrium for pfoa and pfos on pac was reached at 4 h and 24 h in the absence and in the presence of efom respectively yu et al 2012 the competition between pfas and dom for ac adsorption sites has also been investigated in rsscts appleman et al 2013 mccleaf et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 2015 sgroi et al 2018a results obtained from the latter mentioned experimental works are in disagreement about the effect of om this discrepancy may be related to the different experimental setups such as pfas initial concentration source and concentration of dom empty bed contact time ebct and to the kind of ac tested as suggested by pramanik et al 2015 when doc concentration increased from 5 to 25 mg l 1 the removal efficiency of pfoa and pfos on pac decreased by 50 and 35 respectively on the contrary the performance of bituminous coal based gac was less influenced by variation of doc concentration pramanik et al 2015 similar results have asserted that proteins resulted in a low retention of pfoa and pfos through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions pramanik et al 2017 moreover breakthrough 20 has been reached at 125 000 bvs during dom free experiments and at 11 000 bvs when doc concentration was equal to 1 7 mg l 1 this observation highlights that faster breakthrough of pfas takes place during rssct experiments in presence of dom appleman et al 2013 nevertheless sgroi et al 2018a found that breakthrough curves of some long chain pfas i e pfos pfoa and pfda were similar in column beds packed tests by using norit darco 12 40 in those experiments waters with different dom concentrations and compositions fed the packed columns table 4 the observed behaviour for the investigated long chain compounds may be ascribed to the hydrophobic interactions occurring between long chain pfas and gac indeed hydrophobic interactions are the main adsorption mechanisms for long chain pfas and the hydrophobic interactions may be only slightly influenced by om presence results of pre equilibrium study by kothawala et al 2017 are in contrast with other findings du et al 2016a wang et al 2016 yu et al 2012 zhao et al 2011 since the increase in doc concentration seems to enhance long chain pfas removal due to the formation of dom pfas complex and consequently their co adsorption in detail removal efficiency of pfas with a fluorocarbon chain length of 8 c atoms increased by 50 when doc concentration of a hydrophobic dom passed from 0 to 8 mg l 1 using gac kothawala et al 2017 it should be highlighted that these results were obtained in pre equilibrium conditions contact time about 15 min at pfas initial concentration of about 2 5 μg l 1 and at batch dose of gac of about 10 g l 1 which is much higher than doses typically used in full scale treatment plants ziska et al 2016 performance of bdac for pfcas removal from pfsof www has been investigated in the presence of high total organic carbon toc concentration co existing om competed with pfcas for adsorption sites on the bdac du et al 2015 the same achievement was obtained using r cac for pfos and its alternative compound f 53b removal from electrochemical wwtp effluent du et al 2016a the high concentration of toc 78 3 mg l 1 was linked to the high amount of hydrocarbon surfactants which were unfavourable for the adsorption of pfos and f 53b on r cac since adsorption sites were manly occupied by co existing organic compounds table 4 depending on om concentration and source dose and kind of ac employed powdered or granular and its porosity and pfas tested long or short chain the effect of om is different due to adsorption mechanisms established the presence of om can lead to the enhancement of pfas adsorption through the formation of agglomerations between long chain pfas and om otherwise om can negatively influence the adsorption efficiency due to the reducing of accessible binding sites and pore spaces i e pore blockage fig 2 5 3 anion exchange resin main interactions occurring between om and pfas molecules during ae process are reported in fig 3 as previously asserted about the influence of om on ac performance the effect of co existing om on ae resins for pfas removal depends on several factors including om composition and concentration kind of resin and pfas concentration tested to date the competition between om and pfas on ae resins is not fully understood this evidence is confirmed by several experimental studies carried out both on batch and column setups du et al 2015 kothawala et al 2017 maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2016 zaggia et al 2016 organic compounds such as ha tri chloroethylene tce methylbenzene mb and sodium dodecyl sulphate sds have been selected to evaluate their effect on pfhxs removal on ae resin i e ira910 a macroporous polystyrene resin with a dimethyl ethanol ammonium functional group during batch experiments maimaiti et al 2018 results suggested that pfhxs retention on ira910 was not affected by non ionic co existing organic compounds i e mb and tce regardless of their concentration in the solution whereas ira910 efficiency decreased with the increasing of ha and sds concentrations due to the competition for adsorption sites a slight effect on pfas retention has been highlighted under pre equilibrium condition since ae resin a600 polystyrene dvb gel type with quaternary ammonium functional group performance was independent from dom concentration and source kothawala et al 2017 in detail pfas removal has been reduced by 10 at the highest dom concentration tested this result is consistent with data reported by previous experimental works which have demonstrated that om weakly interferes with pfas removal during ae process du et al 2015 wang et al 2016 resins gel type polymer matrixes such as ira400 and ira67 showed a remarkable affinity with pfas both long and short chain which was independent of om present in an opposed way the performance of macroporous resins i e ira910 could be affected by background dom levels 5 4 other adsorbents biochar multi walled carbon nanotubes mineral materials nanoparticles effect of co existing ha on boehmite surface was investigated during pfos and pfbs batch adsorption experiments f wang et al 2015 due to the electrostatic interactions between pfas and boehmite strong competition between pfos or pfbs and ha occurred electrostatic repulsions increased with the increasing of ha accumulation on boehmite surface f wang et al 2015 the competition between pfas and synthetic om ha phenol 1 naphthol and benzoic acids has also been investigated on mwcnts deng et al 2015a the pronounced influence on pfos removal was provided by ha whereas phenol had a lesser influence moreover pfbs removal was the worst in the presence of ha or phenol deng et al 2015a as demonstrated by inyang and dickenson 2017 hwc and pwc biochar performances were affected by om since adsorption capacities decreased with the increase of doc concentration in particular om molecules could lead to pore blockage and may occupy high energy pore sites the adsorption capacities were about 41 3 and 27 7 mg g 1 when lw doc 2 mg l 1 and tertiary treated ww effluent doc 4 9 mg l 1 were tested respectively inyang and dickenson 2017 results from pilot scale tests have demonstrated that the breakthrough of some pfas i e pfpea pfhxa pfoa and pfos was faster on biochar hwc filter than on gac column since om adsorbed on biochar surface caused changes on biochar surface charge consequently the electrostatic repulsions between pfas and biochar surface increased adsorption kinetic tests were performed for both pfba and pfos and the observed slow kinetics could have been caused by pre loaded om on biochar inyang and dickenson 2017 the efficiency of novel magnetic adsorbent 2 mnps fg has been investigated for pfoa and pfos removal from different water matrixes wang et al 2018 its performance was independent of om content also at the highest doc concentration tested 1 7 mg l 1 indeed the removal efficiencies were always found around 99 for both pfoa and pfos in all performed experiments however it should be noted that those efficiencies have probably been obtained because of a high dosage of adsorbent employed 400 mg l 1 the competition between nom both seaw and rw and pfas both long and short chain compounds has also been investigated during pfas adsorption onto hdpe ps and ps cooh particles llorca et al 2018 results asserted that aromatic rings of ps contrasted nom competition and consequently they favoured pfas adsorption by contrast nom influenced pfas adsorption on hdpe and its effect was higher in seaw than in rw llorca et al 2018 sun et al 2018 investigated the effect of co existing organic compounds on gac biofilter they reported that more active sites were available for pfas adsorption in the pre ozonated regenerated gac biofilter due to the oxidation of competitive dom sun et al 2018 recently the performance of new synthetized adsorbent pei f cmc for pfas removal both long and short chain was evaluated using three different nom solutions ateia et al 2018 firstly experiments were carried out in lw hartwell lake south carolina and pfas removal efficiency has been compared with that resulted from doc free solution pfoa and pfos removal efficiency was almost equal in both lw and di pfas with longer chain than pfoa and pfos c12 c13 pfcas c9 c10 pfsas were removed better from lw than from di using pei f cmc this result can be explained by the co removal of long chain pfas aggregated with om du et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 by contrast short chain pfas removal was higher in di than in lw indeed om competed with short chain pfas during adsorption process ateia et al 2018 overall lower removal efficiency has been obtained for short chain pfas compared with that observed for long chain ones removal 20 and 70 respectively the effect of different types of nom with different hydrophobicity was also investigated in order to assert the performance of pei f cmc for pfas removal the two nom solutions tested had the same doc concentration 2 mg l 1 but a different value of specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 results have demonstrated that short chain removal was lower than 30 from both nom solutions and the competition between short chain pfas and hydrophilic nom suva254 1 7 l mg 1 m 1 was higher than that with hydrophobic nom suva254 4 9 l mg 1 m 1 the hydrophobicity of nom does not seem to influence the adsorption of long chain pfas on pei f cmc and their removal efficiency was higher than 70 for both nom solutions 6 regeneration of adsorbents despite the widespread use of adsorption and anion exchange processes for pfas removal the main drawback of their application at full scale is the regeneration of spent materials when their adsorption capacity has been exhausted regeneration must allow the removal of adsorbed pfas in order to restore the adsorption capacity of spent materials by means of technologies which have economic viability and environmental security for instance chemical regeneration of saturated adsorbents is usually performed in situ at full scale treatment processes however it is not always feasible because of the related costs or environmental issues as discussed in the next section on the other hand the thermal regeneration is often performed off site at the adsorbent manufacturing establishment therefore a direct comparison between the above mentioned techniques is not easy overall in situ regeneration should be pursued to avoid the transportation treatment and or disposal of exhausted materials to date regeneration and reuse of materials saturated with pfas is challenging as discussed in the following sections 6 1 chemical regeneration pfas anionic head could be desorbed using a solution of sodium salts such as sodium chloride nacl and sodium hydroxide naoh whereas a solution of organic alcohol is required to desorb the hydrophobic c f chain wang et al 2014 woodard et al 2017 fig 4 depicts a schematic view of pfas saturated adsorbent which is regenerated using a chemical solution made of sodium salts and organic alcohol in fig 4 the desorption mechanisms related to the use of sodium ions and organic solvents are illustrated as well table 5 reports a compilation of data on chemical regeneration of pfas exhausted adsorbents with particular attention to chemical solution employed and regeneration percentage achieved due to the lower solubility of pfas on ionic strength media conventional solutions of sodium salts were ineffective in regenerating adsorbents exhausted by both long and short chain pfas conte et al 2015 deng et al 2015b regeneration percentages were lower than 10 when regeneration agents including nacl and naoh were adopted for desorbing pfbs and pfos from acrylic resins carter and farrell 2010 deng et al 2010 the deprotonation of amine groups on acrylic gel type resins allowed the desorption of pfos at a low concentration of naoh solutions although a regeneration percentage of about 90 was achieved when a solution of sodium hydroxide and methanol was tested table 5 mixture of sodium salts and organic solvents such as ch3oh c2h5oh and c3h6o have been widely used in order to involve the desorption of pfas deng et al 2015b yu et al 2008 zaggia et al 2016 moreover the efficiency of regenerating solution depends on resin properties and in particular on the interactions established between pfas and resin functional groups deng et al 2010 in fact data from regeneration experiments carried out using different mixtures of inorganic salts with or without organic alcohol demonstrated that the amount of pfas desorbed from three different types of strong ae resins depends on resin hydrophobicity and consequently on the interactions between pfas and the alkyl chains of the functional exchange group zaggia et al 2016 solution of ammonium salts such as nh4oh and nh4cl showed a good efficiency for the desorption of pfba pfbs pfoa and pfos from ae resins with trimethyl quaternary amine functional group i e purolite a600e and a520e whereas the same regenerating solution was totally ineffective in reactivating highly hydrophobic resin i e purolite a532e since the solvatation of fluorine chain was needed in order to remove pfas molecules from the active sites of the resin table 5 in that case the organic solvent could slacken the hydrophobic interactions between pfas and resin then the inorganic anions of ammonium salts oh or cl could replace pfas fig 4 achieving the recovery of the exchange capacity of the resin the effect of different temperatures of di water as regenerating solution on pfos desorption from bdac was also investigated deng et al 2015b results from regeneration experiments demonstrated that a higher temperature of di water about 80 c enhanced the pfos desorption and the regeneration percentage was about 53 table 5 furthermore pfos desorption from pacfs was about 5 when di water was employed as regenerating solution chen et al 2017 by contrast the regeneration percentage increased with the increase of ethanol concentration in the regeneration solution chen et al 2017 punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2014 nevertheless regenerating solution made of organic solvent is not suitable for the treatment of drinking water on full scale applications and consequently on site regeneration is not feasible it is noteworthy that the effect of om co adsorbed on materials may affect regeneration efficiency after five successive adsorption regeneration cycles the efficiency of bdac for pfcas removal pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa decreased while ae resin ira67 performance was relatively stable du et al 2015 co adsorbed organic pollutants on surface or pores of ac could interfere with the regeneration process it was the case of the r cac which was regenerated through different regenerating solutions made of 70 ethanol 90 methanol or 90 acetone after the regeneration r cac was reused for pfos and f 53b removal from industrial wastewater du et al 2016a due to the presence of non desorbed om the adsorption efficiency of regenerated r cac decreased after each regeneration cycle for this reason persulfate oxidation was tested as alternative regeneration process to the conventional elution with organic solvents regeneration results demonstrated that sulphate free radicals were able to diffuse into pores of activated carbon and they allowed the degradation of both pfas and other organic compounds however sulphate free radicals could cause the release of fluorine and short chained pfas due to break down of long chained pfas du et al 2016a consequently further investigations should be addressed in order to better understand the effect of sulphate and other free radicals on degradation of pfos overall the need of organic solvents for the chemical regeneration of pfas saturated adsorbents is a relevant limitation of this technique 6 2 thermal regeneration thermal regeneration in n2 gas stream of gac saturated with long chain pfas pfos pfhxs and pfoa has been investigated in order to evaluate the release of volatile organic fluorine vof or other compounds such as short chain compounds watanabe et al 2016 thermal regeneration may be optimized when gac is maintained at 700 c and later off gases will be kept at 1000 c nevertheless the high temperature needed for thermally regenerating ac may cause the decreasing of their adsorption properties and a change in ac morphology watanabe et al 2018 these described aspect of thermal regeneration of activated carbon deserve a deep investigation calcination at 600 c in air for 20 min has been investigated for the reusability of h bns saturated with pfda and pfos feng et al 2016 a temperature of 600 c was selected in order to reach the complete decomposition of the investigated pfas compounds since pfos and pfda are decomposed at about 480 c and 200 c respectively as inferred from differential scanning calorimetry curves feng et al 2016 moreover calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 was employed as additive to avoid the formation of short chain fluorinated gases during calcination process results about regeneration experiments of h bns via calcining demonstrated that adsorption capacity was maintained approximately constant during different adsorption regeneration cycles the amount of pfos or pfda on the surface of h bns at equilibrium ranged about 0 35 0 45 mg m 2 feng et al 2016 recently microwave mw irradiation became an alternative process to conventional thermal regeneration due to its advantages such as rapidity and selectivity heating falciglia et al 2018 this technique includes the conversion of mw electric field energy adsorbed by the solid medium i e activated carbon into heat at the molecular level falciglia et al 2017 the dielectric properties of activated carbon combined with pfas properties such as their volatility could allow the regeneration of pfas exhausted ac by means of the interactions between delocalized π electrons of ac and the mws mw regeneration of pfas exhausted ac deserve further investigation 7 conclusions and future research recommended 7 1 conclusions poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a large group of manmade chemicals characterized by high stability and persistence on environmental compartments among interim response measures adsorption technologies i e by activated carbon or anion exchange resin are currently employed for treatment of pfas impacted water the present critical review of data on pfas adsorption suggests that ň to date most of the experimental works published have been carried out under unrealistic operating conditions such as high dosage of adsorbent materials long ebct acid ph and high concentrations of pfas spiked in di water such conditions are not representative of either full scale treatment plants or actual environmental contaminations long chain pfas adsorption can involve the formation of aggregates on surface materials that may improve the adsorption efficiency by hydrophobic interactions furthermore when different long chain pfas co exist in solution the longest pfas outcompete the shorter due to a stronger hydrophobic interaction between the longest pfas and the adsorbent surface meso and macro porous adsorbents both ac and resin showed high adsorption capacity because long chain pfas can easily access anion exchange resins are more effective than activated carbon for both long and short chain pfas removal regardless of the adsorbent used the adsorption capacity of short chain pfas is lower than that observed for long chain pfas therefore short chain pfas removal is more challenging adsorption of short chain pfas seems related to the availability of active pore sites because the formation of micelles multi layer adsorption does not occur studies focused on the effect of om during adsorption process report contrasting results overall co existing om negatively affects short chain pfas adsorption due to active site competition whereas the effect of om seems less relevant during long chain pfas adsorption due to pore blockage and electrostatic repulsions negative effect of om on other adsorbent materials such as biochar mineral materials and magnetic nanoparticles is also reported effect of co existing om should be taken into account during both adsorption and regeneration processes chemical regeneration of pfas saturated adsorbents requires the use of organic solvents which are harmful nevertheless thermal regeneration at high temperature of exhausted activated carbon causes the decline of adsorption capacity and may release dangerous short chain fluorinated gases overall the in situ implementation of either chemical or thermal regeneration is not feasible 7 2 research needs the following specific research needs can be drawn based on the observed gaps in pfas removal by adsorption the investigation of pfas removal by adsorption especially short chain pfas under typical water treatment conditions i e adsorbent dose or ebct ph pfas concentrations is strongly advised an advanced characterization of om before and after the adsorption processes is also advised in particular fractionation of om measuring hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions as well as acid neutral and base fractions is relevant to better understand the adsorption mechanism and the effect of om size exclusion chromatography sec is also suggested to ascertain the effect of molecular weight of om characterization of adsorbent morphology by means of transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy before and after pfas uptake is also useful the simultaneous effect of ionic strength and om should be considered during pfas adsorption and further investigations are required in order to better understand the contribution of ionic om and inorganic ions i e monovalent and divalent cations on pfas removal further experimental works should be performed at different om fractions but at the same ionic strength in order minimize the possible effect of inorganic ions economic assessment of pfas removal techniques should also address the adsorbent disposal regeneration for instance the management of the eluate produced by chemical regeneration of the resins should be considered other unconventional techniques such as microwave irradiation may help to overcome issues concerning the regeneration of pfas saturated adsorbents a novel treatment train which allows the combination of separation and destructive technologies is

18174,anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria can directly convert ammonium and nitrite to nitrogen gas anaerobically and were responsible for a substantial part of the fixed nitrogen loss and re oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in freshwater and marine ecosystems although a wide variety of studies have been undertaken to investigate the abundance and biodiversity of anammox bacteria so far ecological niche differentiation of anammox bacteria is still not fully understood to assess their growth behavior and consequent population dynamics at a given environment the monod model is often used here we summarize the monod kinetic parameters such as the maximum specific growth rate μ max and the half saturation constant for nitrite k no2 and ammonium k nh4 of five known candidatus genera of anammox bacteria we also discuss potential pivotal environmental factors and metabolic flexibility that influence the community compositions of anammox bacteria particularly biodiversity of the genus scalindua might have been largely underestimated several anammox bacteria have been successfully enriched from various source of biomass we reevaluate their enrichment methods and culture medium compositions to gain a clue of niche differentiation of anammox bacteria furthermore we formulate the current issues that must be addressed overall this review re emphasizes the importance of enrichment cultures preferably pure cultures physiological characterization and direct microbial competition studies using enrichment cultures in laboratories graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox bacteria niche differentiation growth kinetics enrichment cultures microbial competition 1 introduction anammox bacteria can catalyze the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions van de graaf et al 1996 so far 19 species under 6 candidatus genera brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua anammoxoglobus and anammoximicrobium have been reported from various natural and man made ecosystems oshiki et al 2016 khramenkov et al 2013 anammox process has received considerable attention as a cost effective and environment friendly nitrogen removal process from wastewater ali and okabe 2015 kartal et al 2010a b more importantly anammox bacteria have been detected ubiquitously in anoxic environments and found to be responsible for 24 67 of n loss in marine sediments thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 and 20 40 in the suboxic water columns of the black sea and gulfo dulce dalsgaard et al 2003 kuypers et al 2003 recent studies demonstrated even greater percentages up to 100 of marine n loss these experimental evidences reveal that anammox bacteria are one of key players in the global nitrogen cycle hamersley et al 2007 kuypers et al 2005 schmid et al 2007 trimmer et al 2013 an important ecological question remains to be answered is what shapes community compositions of anammox bacteria due to intra and inter specific competition occurred in natural environment anammox bacteria have been considered to occupy different niches in the natural environment in correlation with the physiological properties of individual species or group of species kartal et al 2007b hence enrichment or pure culture of anammox bacteria followed by physiological characterization is essential to understand the ecological niche differentiation of anammox bacteria koops and pommerening röser 2001 zhang et al 2017a given that among 19 anammox species being identified 10 species have been enriched and their physiological characteristics have been characterized to date oshiki et al 2016 thus direct microbial competition studies can be performed using those individual enrichment cultures individual populations can be quantified using 16s rrna gene targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays ali et al 2015 awata et al 2013 koops and pommerening röser 2001 narita et al 2017 oshiki et al 2011 in fact population shifts among different anammox species have been frequently observed in laboratory reactors for instance from ca b fulgida dominated population to ca brocadia sp 40 park et al 2010b from ca b fulgida to ca k stuttgartiensis park et al 2015 from ca brocadia sp to ca k stuttgartiensis van der star et al 2008 and from ca b anammoxidians to ca anammoxoglobus propionicus kartal et al 2007b in addition mage data analysis on anammox 16s rrna gene sequences detected so far revealed diverse geographical distributions and suggested possible driving factors sonthiphand et al 2014 which must be experimentally verified by direct microbial competition studies under controlled laboratory conditions ali et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a currently most of the wastewater treatment plants are seeded with mature anammox granules to reduce the start up time van der star et al 2007 selection of suitable seeding sludge could be a key to rapid and efficient start up of annamox processes kartal et al 2006 if we know the niche differentiation the most suitable anammox species can be selected for targeting wastewater therefore here we provide an overview of physiological characteristics of anammox bacteria and discuss potential factors determining ecological niche differentiation among different anammox species for details on the natural distributions of anammox bacteria reported so far see a recent review by oshiki et al 2016 2 microbial growth kinetics information on intrinsic microbial growth kinetics i e the maximum specific growth rate μ max and half saturation constant ks is indispensable to predict the growth behavior under given conditions based on the monod model bollmann et al 2002 french et al 2012 füchslin et al 2012 kindaichi et al 2006 kovarova kovar and egli 1998 martens habbena et al 2009 ngugi et al 2016 nogueira and melo 2006 nowka et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a based on the monod equation monod 1949 the growth properties of anammox species could be predicted using the reported values of ks and μ max fig 1 for instance ca brocadia sp 40 most likely outcompete other freshwater anammox bacteria under almost all conditions when assuming no2 is a limiting substrate and there is no specific inhibitor s for ca brocadia sp 40 under high no2 conditions like wastewater treatment ca brocadia sinica becomes a good competitor for ca brocadia sp 40 suggesting that both brocadia species are suitable for wastewater treatment on the other hand it seems that diverse anammox species could coexist under low substrate conditions like natural environments this speculation can be supported by the geographical distribution patterns of anammox bacteria revealed by anammox 16s rrna gene sequences data sonthiphand et al 2014 however choice of 16s rrna gene targeting primer sets can significantly bias the community composition of anammox bacteria as recently described by orschler et al 2019 therefore abundance and diversity of anammox bacteria reported so far must be carefully evaluated and compared so far direct evidence of a correlation between substrate availability and species abundance of anammox bacteria in natural environment is not available such information could be very helpful to understand the niche differentiation 2 1 maximum specific growth rate μ max μ max of anammox bacteria was mainly determined by either controlling the sludge retention time srt in membrane bioreactor mbr or measuring the biomass yield and maximum specific substrate consumption rate due to the lack of pure culture lotti et al 2015 oshiki et al 2011 μ max of ca b sinica ca j caeni and ca s japonica were recently reevaluated by directly measuring the time course increase of 16s rrna gene copy numbers using newly developed qpcr assays yielding the fastest μ max ever reported for these species so far zhang et al 2017b fig 2 ca b sinica and ca brocadia sp 40 exhibited the highest μ max 0 33 d 1 among anammox bacteria which could be advantageous of being dominant population thus μ max of other anammox species needs to be reevaluated using appropriate cell cultures i e planktonic free living cells with high purity and methodology e g more accurate cell quantification methods 2 2 half saturation constant ks availability of nitrite is more relevant to the niche differentiation among anammox bacteria since ammonium is usually more abundant than nitrite in both natural or man made ecosystems pitcher et al 2011 van der star et al 2007 thus ks is the key parameter for microbial growth and consequent niche differentiation a wide range of ks values for ammonium k nh4 3 0 640 μm and nitrite k no2 0 2 370 μm have been reported for different anammox species fig 3 and fig 4 ali et al 2015 awata et al 2013 carvajal arroyo et al 2013 kartal et al 2007b 2008 lotti et al 2014 narita et al 2017 oshiki et al 2013a b 2017 oshiki et al 2013a b strous et al 1999b van der star et al 2008 however it seems that most of the ks values were determined using granular and or aggregated biomass in which substrate transport limitations occurred lotti et al 2014 therefore the reported affinity constants k s were more likely apparent but not the intrinsic half saturation constants among the reported ks values some of them were determined from planktonic enrichment cell cultures ca k stuttgartiensis ca b sinica ca brocadia sp 40 ca s japonica and ca b sapporoensis awata et al 2013 lotti et al 2014 narita et al 2017 oshiki et al 2013a b van der star et al 2008 thus which are of highly importance 2 3 maintenance coefficient m maintenance m has been defined as the energy consumed for functions other than the production of new cell material pirt 1965 this value is considered to be growth rate independent and deeply involved in the microbial competition füchslin et al 2012 van bodegom 2007 the relative proportion of energy assigned for maintenance becomes more significant when cells are cultured at low growth rates than at high growth rate for example the maintenance energy was a critical factor to determine the successful growth under low substrate concentration in co culture of escherichia coli and chelatobacter heintzii füchslin et al 2012 the population dynamics could be estimated using an extended form of the monod model incorporating a finite substrate concentration at zero growth rate s min alternative expression of maintenance energy in a competition study between ca b sinica and ca j caeni ca b sinica was outcompeted by ca j caeni under only low nitrogen loading rates even though the monod model predicted the dominance of ca b sinica zhang et al 2017a this discrepancy might suggest the importance of s min ca b sinica requires high maintenance energy high s min than ca j caeni thereby ca b sinica could not sustain their population at low nitrogen loading rates since information of maintenance energy requirement was mostly missing for anammox bacteria they should be determined in the future 3 oxygen tolerance anammox bacteria anoxically oxidize ammonium with nitrite as an electron acceptor which was supplied by aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and or archaea aoa thus their affinities for ammonia and oxygen and oxygen tolerance of anammox bacteria play a crucial role in their association with aob and or aoa a limited information on oxygen tolerance of anammox bacteria is available anammox bacteria had higher k nh4 values than aoa but these values were comparable with those of aob fig 3 anammox bacteria were inhibited by oxygen at very low levels inhibition coefficient that gives the half maximum inhibition ki o2 is 0 092 μm straka et al 2019 this suggests that the cooperation of anammox bacteria and aoa is only possible when ammonia and oxygen diffuse in the counter direction such as stratified lakes and oceans straka et al 2019 association of aob and anammox bacteria could be expected at relatively high nh4 and o2 concentrations like wastewater treatment anammox bacteria were considered to be microaerotolerant instead of being strict anaerobes jensen et al 2008 lam et al 2009 strous and jetten 1997 the oxygen tolerance determined from enrichment cultures varies depending on species 0 200 μm o2 for ca k stuttgartiensis 63 μm o2 for ca b sinica 1 μm o2 for ca b anammoxidans 120 μm o2 for ca b caroliniensis 70 μm o2 for ca b fulgida oshiki et al 2016 despite their significant contribution to the oceanic nitrogen cycle the oxygen tolerance of marine anammox species ca scalindua is currently missing in marine environments i e oxygen minimum zones omzs anammox activity was found up to 10 μm o2 jensen et al 2008 and 20 μm o2 kalvelage et al 2011 however it should be noted that the oxygen tolerance is highly dependent upon types of biomass i e planktonic free living or aggregated biomass and careful assessment of biomass type is essential oxygen inhibition seems to be reversible anammox activity of brocadia dominated biomass gradually recovered to the original level after micro aerobic conditions 0 02 mg o2 l 1 was achieved seuntjens et al 2018 the recovery time was dependent on the degree i e exposure o2 concentration and time of perceived inhibition this result indicates that anammox bacteria residing in partial nitritation anammox pn a granules and marine snow probably experience repeated o2 inhibition and recovery however our understanding is still very limited oxygen inhibition and recovery needs to be further investigated for different anammox species 4 salinity salinity has been suggested as the most important discrimination factor governing the geographical distributions of anammox bacteria ca scalindua dominated in saline environments mostly marine while other genera were mostly found in freshwater environments sonthiphand et al 2014 all enrichment cultures of ca scalindua are obligately halophilic requirement of salt for growth they formed a cluster that phylogenetically distant from other anammox genera oshiki et al 2016 biogeographical distributions of anammox bacteria have shown that ca scalindua was the most abundant genus in river estuary area while abundances of ca brocadia and ca kuenenia were negatively correlated with salinity concentration amano et al 2007 dale et al 2009 ca brocadia and ca kuenenia were mostly detected from wastewater treatment plants and soil environment humbert et al 2010 schmid et al 2005 their detection in saline environments has been considered as transient accumulation dale et al 2009 interestingly first two ca scalindua species ca scalindua brodae and ca scalindua wagneri were retrieved from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp treating landfill leachate in pitsea uk instead of marine environment in addition ca scalindua related 16s rrna genes and the hydrazine synthase hzsa genes were detected in two anoxic hypersaline up to 24 salinity sulphidic basins in eastern mediterranean sea borin et al 2013 these evidences suggest that ca scalindua are distributing from freshwater environment e g river estuary to hypersaline environments indicating that ca scalindua might constitute the most diverse genus among anammox bacteria it is therefore essential to explore eco physiological and functional diversity of ca scalindua to better describe the growth behavior with salinity inhibition the salinity effect must be quantitatively determined and incorporated in the monod equation the monod model has been integrated with the gauss equation using the least square non linear regression for evaluation of salinity induced kinetics wu et al 2019 the model simulation revealed that ca scalindua dominated over ca kuenenia only at salinity 3 0 when nitrite concentration s no2 was higher than nitrite affinity constant k no2 conversely high nitrite affinity of ca scalindua leads to their predominance in all salinities under nitrite depleted conditions k no2 s no2 fig 4 wu et al 2019 generally to survive under saline conditions microorganisms must make osmolarity balance between the inside and outside cells either synthesize uptake organic compatible solutes or accumulate inorganic ions k so called salt in strategy ventosa et al 1998 for non halophiles this adaptation also involves the manipulation of intracellular protein structures to function under elevated intracellular ion concentrations dennis and shimmin 1997 depending on sort of osmolyte this process could be extremely energy intensive particularly for autotrophs oren 1999 for example to create same osmolarity de novo biosynthesis of trehalose a 12 carbon disaccharide sugar requires 750 times more atps than accumulating kcl fig 6 which significantly reduces energy allocated to growth therefore to successfully survive under saline environment an energy efficient osmoregulation strategy is preferred although experimental evidence for osmoregulation in anammox bacteria is still not available only some information has been inferred from the genomes based on protein isoelectric point distributions derived from the genome of ca s brodae and ca s profunda speth et al 2015 van de vossenberg et al 2013 it was suggested that both species might employ a salt in strategy for salinity adaptation however the genome of ca s rubra suggests the use of a compatible solutes synthesis strategy to cope with high salinity speth et al 2017 it was observed that addition of yeast extract improved the activity of ca s japonica personal commination this may suggest that anammox bacteria could directly up take the osmolytes or precursors including amino acids in yeast extract to enhance osmoregulation which is less energy intensive than de novo biosynthesis nieto et al 1998 oren 2011 youssef et al 2014 further study is apparently required to verify the osmoregulation strategies of anammox bacteria the salinity effect on kinetic properties and interspecies competition at various salinities to assess its effect on the niche differentiation 5 aggregation ability anammox bacteria exhibit high tendency to form aggregates or biofilms ali et al 2018 in which different microenvironments are developed due to substrate diffusion limitation and high microbial activity fig 7 microelectrode measurements showed considerable heterogeneity with respect to physicochemical parameters even in small microbial flocs granules and thin biofilms ali et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2007a okabe et al 1999 this spatial heterogeneity makes competing species to coexist in the same aggregates but different locations such as surface and inner part of the aggregate fig 7 ali et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2007b apparent half saturation coefficient in activated sludge flocs is highly dependent on the microcolony size biomass density and spatial biomass distribution lotti et al 2014 picioreanu et al 2016 the reversion of aob and nob apparent oxygen half saturation coefficients k o was caused by high biomass density and resulting o2 concentration gradients inside the microcolonies picioreanu et al 2016 therefore it is very important to describe more detailed microbial spatial distributions and directly link them to in situ analyses of microenvironments to accurately interpret the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria in aggregated biomass aggregates and biofilms also provide a protective niche as a physical barrier against physical washout weissbrodt et al 2012 predators kumar et al 2017 oxygen and inhibitory chemicals monier and lindow 2003 nogueira and melo 2006 aggregation abilities of three different anammox species ca b sinica ca j caeni and ca b sapporoensis were quantitatively evaluated based on cell surface properties and extracellular polymeric substances eps production ali et al 2018 it was found that ca b sinica possesses the most hydrophobic cell surface leading to the best aggregation capability ali et al 2018 in addition ca b sinica has the highest maximum specific growth rate zhang et al 2017b these superior eco physiological features suggest that ca b sinica is the most suitable inoculum for wastewater treatments this speculation is supported by the geographical distribution based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showing the most frequent detections of this species in engineering ecosystems sonthiphand et al 2014 aggregate formation however makes it extremely difficult to understand the mechanisms or factors involved in niche differentiation 6 organic matter anammox bacteria have been considered to be a chemolithotroph upon the discovery strous et al 1999a however some anammox bacteria could oxidize short chain fatty acids which was coupled with reduction of nitrate and or nitrite to ammonium disguised as denitrifiers alternatively kartal et al 2007a for example ca a propionicus can oxidize propionate at a rate of 0 64 0 05 μmol per gram protein per minute which was more than 5 times higher than ca b anammoxidans and ca k stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2007b while ca b fulgida an autofluorescent anammox bacteria can oxidize acetate at a rate of 0 95 0 04 μmol per gram protein per minute which is higher than other anammox species kartal et al 2008 both species became the dominant species in anammox community in the laboratory reactors fed with an anammox medium containing organic acids according to those studies the addition of organic acids does not affect the biomass yield and specific growth rate the question now is whether the organic matter can be used as energy or carbon source or both laureni et al 2015 have reported that ca b fulgida did not directly incorporate or store the amended acetate and glucose based on microautoradiography combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization mar fish analysis however this metabolic capability might be species specific therefore test using other anammox species should be conducted further study on fatty acids oxidation by anammox bacteria is also needed to understand how this metabolism gives certain anammox species physiological advantages over others 7 culture conditions for enrichment cultivation conditions are important for enrichment of anammox species because they reflect their potential niche differentiation here we summarized the inoculum types and culture conditions used for enrichment of each anammox species table 1 anammox bacteria have been enriched from various source of biomass so far including denitrifying sludge ca j caeni and ca b sinica fujii et al 2002 tsushima et al 2007 activated sludge ca b flugida and ca a propionicus kartal et al 2008 2007b nitrifying biomass ca k stuttgartiensis egli et al 2001 marine sediments ca s japonica and ca scalindua sp kindaichi et al 2011 van de vossenberg et al 2008 composition and concentrations of the feed substrate might determine the outcome of enrichment park et al 2010a 2010b for example ca b flugida and ca a propionicus were enriched from the same activated sludge by supplying an inorganic anammox medium with acetate 1 30 mm and propionate 0 8 15 mm respectively kartal et al 2008 in addition various types of reactors were used for enrichment of different types of biomass sequencing batch reactor sbr for granular biomass membrane bioreactor mbr for planktonic biomass and up flow anaerobic bioreactor uab for attached biomass i e biofilms no correlation between the reactor type and enriched anammox species was observed table 1 in our laboratory we first used up flow column reactors with non woven fabrics as biomass carrier for initial enrichment of ca b sinica from activated sludge yielding about 90 pure biofilm biomass after about 6 month anoxic cultivation tsushima et al 2007 fig 8 a secret key to successful enrichment is that contaminated other bacteria should be washed out by applying high flow rate i e short hydraulic retention time hrt and meanwhile maintaining low no2 concentration to avoid no2 inhibition oxygen contamination must be avoided especially at the beginning of enrichment thereafter enriched biofilm biomass was homogenized and inoculated into to mbrs to obtain planktonic free living biomass with 95 purity for physiological and biochemical studies oshiki et al 2013a b zhang and okabe 2017 in this way we have succeeded in enriching four different anammox species ca b sinica oshiki et al 2011 ca j caeni ali and okabe 2015 ca s japonica awata et al 2013 oshiki et al 2017 and ca b sapporensis narita et al 2017 however a certain species may not be easily cultured as planktonic cells in mbr trigo et al 2006 on the other hand it seems that ca s japonica forms less aggregates or biofilms it is therefore interesting to investigate which anammox species can be enriched in what form of biomass most freshwater anammox species were enriched at temperature range from 27 c to 37 c while marine anammox species were enriched at a temperature range from 15 c to 25 c maximum activities were observed at around 37 c for freshwater anammox species ali et al 2015 oshiki et al 2011 and below 30 c for marine species awata et al 2013 therefore besides salinity temperature could be another pivotal factor between marine and freshwater anammox species ph has been found to regulate the abundance diversity and activity of aob and aoa in paddy soils li et al 2015 since all anammox species were enriched at ph of 6 8 8 5 so far it is very interesting if certain anammox species be detected or enriched from acidic or alkalic environments finally an inorganic medium that was originally used by van de graaf et al 1996 has been used for these enrichment cultures with some modifications of metal concentrations table 1 for example various iron 5 0 van de graaf et al 1996 6 3 strous et al 1998 6 8 hsu et al 2014 or 9 0 mg l 1 quan et al 2008 respectively and copper 0 25 mg l 1 or no addition ali et al 2015 van de graaf et al 1996 concentrations were used anammox bacteria can carry out nitrate dependent ferrous iron oxidation oshiki et al 2013a b in addition fe ii addition significantly enhanced the specific growth rate of ca j caeni from 0 12 d 1 at a regular fe ii level 0 03 mm to 0 17 d 1 at 0 09 mm liu and ni 2015 iron is deeply involved in anammox metabolism qiao et al 2013 and vast majority of cellular iron is in the form of cofactors within fe s proteins and multi heme cytochromes ferousi et al 2017 kartal and keltjens 2016 high percentages of intracellular fe contents 41 and 39 for ca j caeni and ca b sinica respectively were reported ali et al 2015 copper was also found to be the dominant metal component in anammox bacteria 39 and 42 for ca j caeni and ca b sinica respectively which is involved in enzymes of reductive acetyl coa pathway for carbon fixation ali et al 2015 kartal et al 2011b it is also interesting that some anammox bacteria were enriched using ground water instead of demineralized water ali et al 2015 kindaichi et al 2011 tsushima et al 2007 indeed certain anammox species have been detected at groundwater environment sonthiphand et al 2014 composition of groundwater most likely metal elements minerals and alkalinity varies depending on geographical regions and weather conditions dragon and marciniak 2010 therefore it deserves to investigate the composition of trace elements in groundwater and compared with those in demineralized water for enrichment of anammox bacteria in fact ca b sinica dominated biomass has been enriched and maintained for many years using groundwater in author s laboratory hokkaido university sapporo japan however the dominant anammox population shifted to ca k stuttgartiensis after the ca b sinica dominated biomass was cultured by exactly same manner and conditions except using the local groundwater at nagaoka national college of technology niigata japan furthermore when the ca k stuttgartiensis dominated biomass was sent back to hokkaido university and cultured with hokkaido university s groundwater the dominant population shifted back to ca b sinica again unpublished our data since the only difference was the groundwater used for culture medium it clearly indicates that there are as yet unknown factor s in groundwater which determines the dominant anammox species 8 interspecific competition interspecific competition different anammox bacterial species compete for the same resources e g a limiting substrate nitrite or ammonium or living space which consequently results in the exclusion of an inferior species or decline in the population in the habitat and niche differentiation an important question is what shapes the community compositions among various properties such as growth kinetics metabolic flexibility and environmental factors growth kinetics play an important role in the competition tilman 1977 recently the interspecies competition for a limiting substrate nitrite between ca b sinica and ca j caeni were experimentally investigated using planktonic enrichment cultures in mbrs and gel immobilized enrichment cultures in column reactors zhang et al 2017a as predicted by the monod model fig 1 ca b sinica outcompeted ca j caeni under high nitrogen loading rates nlr however ca j caeni could proliferate and dominate under low nlrs which contradicts the model prediction this discrepancy is probably attributed to insufficient accuracy of growth kinetic parameters especially k no2 values and lack of information on maintenance rate as mentioned above more study is essential to consolidate the kinetic parameters of anammox bacteria for better understanding of niche differentiation in gel immobilized biomass gel beads both species coexisted but spatially separated ca j caeni was mainly present in the inner part low no2 environment whereas ca b sinica was present throughout the gel beads this spatial distribution may imply the niche differentiation of two species in natural environments more studies with different species combinations and different culture conditions are required to understand the niche partitioning among anammox species 9 other factors other variables might be involved in constituting the niche differentiation of anammox species the inhibitory concentration levels of nitrite 100 768 mg l 1 nontoxic organic matters counted as cod 237 mg cod l 1 290 mg cod l 1 sulfide 5 mm phosphate 50 mm methanol and others have been reported see references oshiki et al 2016 jin et al 2012 and references therein but data are yet too limited for a species specific differentiation 10 outlook 10 1 isolation of pure anammox bacteria although isolation is laborious and time consuming pure cultures are obviously needed for accurate measurement of growth kinetics and physiological traits and biochemical studies as stated above bollmann et al 2011 it is still not clear the missing element s in the isolation of anammox bacteria the culturability of slow growing fastidious bacteria from environmental samples has been improved by a simple modification in the preparation of agar media i e autoclaving the phosphate and agar separately kato et al 2018 other efforts including simulating environment and coculturing targets have been proven successful in pure culturing certain microorganisms see detailed review stewart 2012 pure cultures are still not available for anammox bacteria however several enrichment planktonic cell cultures have been established using membrane bioreactors mbrs so far van der star et al 2008 oshiki et al 2013a b kartal et al 2011a b lotti et al 2014 zhang and okabe 2017 these enrichment cultivations however require an enormous amount of time to achieve free living planktonic cells in most studies usually more than 100 200 days ali et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 oshiki et al 2013a b van der star et al 2008 in addition detailed mechanism of achieving planktonic free living cells in mbr is not well understood recently a more rapid and systematic cultivation technique was developed by applying polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa gel immobilization technology zhang and okabe 2017 in this new approach anammox bacterial cells were firstly grown in the pva sa gel beads which provides easily dispersible biomass and then the dispersed biomass was inoculated to mbr the combination of pva sa gel immobilization technique and mbr cultivation can provide planktonic cell cultures with high purity 95 within 35 days fig 5 which will significantly accelerate the cultivation of planktonic anammox cells and consequently studies on physiology and biochemistry of anammox bacteria to further purify anammox bacterial cells more than 99 5 purity a percall density gradient centrifugation technique has been applied for the planktonic mbr cultures kartal et al 2011a strous et al 1999b 1999a in this method percoll solution and anammox culture were mixed and then centrifugated resulting in an anammox cell suspension with more than 99 8 purity kartal et al 2011a this percoll separated almost pure anammox cells could carry out the anammox reaction and co2 fixation and thus can be used for further purification or isolation for isolation we commonly carry out a limiting dilution of the percall separated cell culture however anammox activity is highly dependent on the cell density minimum cell densities required to obtain a detectable anammox activity were reported to be at least 1010 1011 cells ml 1 strous et al 1999a 106 cells ml 1 oshiki et al unpublished data and 0 4 g anammox biomass vss l 1 thus the cell density of the diluted percoll separated culture must be higher than 106 cells ml 1 however since the percoll separated almost pure anammox culture is not pure yet ca 99 8 it still contains 103 cells ml of other contaminated cells which hampers the isolation of anammox bacteria therefore growth of the contaminated microorganisms must be supressed by adding antibiotics such as penicillin g and others which inhibit other contaminated bacteria but not anammox bacteria hu et al 2013a b promoting selection of anammox bacteria furthermore the cell density dependent anammox activity seems to be regulated by acyl homoserine lactones ahl mediated quorum sensing system sun et al 2018 tang et al 2015 tanga et al 2019 the release of three ahl ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl c12 hsl by anammox bacteria was confirmed tang et al 2015 furthermore external addition of ahls to low biomass concentration cultures significantly increased the anammox activity tanga et al 2019 in addition nitric oxide no could act as a signaling molecule which has been suggested from metagenome analysis kartal et al 2011a strous et al 1999b and promote growth of anammox bacteria hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2010a b thus an alternative approach for further isolation could be a limiting dilution of the percoll separated anammox culture the cell density could be below 106 cells ml followed by careful incubation with addition of signaling molecules like ahl and or no and specific antibiotics to inhibit the growth of other contaminated bacteria since this isolation method has never been tested yet it is important to try if it works or not alternatively anammox bacteria may associate with syntrophs metabolic networks between anammox bacteria and the member of chlorobi on degradation of protein and extracellular peptides and nitrate recycling into nitrite were proposed for naturally aggregated granules based on metagenomic analysis lawson et al 2017 however there was no experimental study to confirm this hypothesis yet in anammox granules nitrate could be reduced to nitrite by heterotrophic denitrifiers using either organic acids or hydrogen those are produced by fermentation of organic matter as the electron donor which makes additional nitrite available for anammox bacteria speth et al 2016 hence hydrogen forming microorganisms and denitrifiers may establish a syntrophic association with anammox bacteria it was experimentally confirmed that anammox bacteria produced and excreted a large amount of organic matter which was directly utilized by coexisting heterotrophs kindaichi et al 2012 therefore such syntrophic association with heterotrophs may not be excluded in enrichment or isolation processes otherwise the growth of anammox bacteria could be inhibited by accumulation of metabolites kindaichi et al 2012 to enrich anammox bacteria the accumulation of organic matter derived from anammox bacteria must be minimized by washing out the metabolites from reactors or exchanging culture medium frequently with efficient biomass retention this is a main reason why we have been using an up flow column reactor fig 8 and mbr for enrichment of anammox bacteria because mbr can be operated at very short hydraulic retention time hrt with 100 biomass retention that is hrt and solid biomass retention time srt can be controlled separately in mbr 10 2 cooperative and competitive microbial interaction anammox bacteria must live with both cooperative and competitive microbial interactions created in granular and aggregated biomass of wastewater treatment processes and marine and freshwater sediments since nitrite is scare as compared with ammonium in typical wastewater aerobic aob and or aoa partially oxidize ammonium to nitrite using oxygen creating a suitable anoxic condition and supplying nitrite for anammox bacteria oxygen and nitrite centered cooperative interaction on the other hand anammox bacteria must compete aerobic aob and or aoa for ammonium and nob and denitrifiers for the produced nitrite ammonium and nitrite centered competitive interaction these cooperative and competitive interactions are alternative driving factors determining dominant anammox bacteria obviously anammox bacteria representing the higher oxygen tolerance and higher affinity to ammonium and nitrite can advantageously compete with other n cycle microorganisms therefore kinetic parameters especially half saturation constants for ammonium k nh4 and nitrite k no2 are of importance figs 3 and 4 but are lacking because of a limited number of pure and enrichment cultures nowka et al 2015 the k nh4 values of anammox bacteria are slightly higher than those of aoa but lower than aob fig 3 the k no2 values of anammox bacteria are comparable with those of nob fig 4 this implies that nob more likely scavenge nitrite and convert to nitrate if oxygen is available which is an unwanted case for wastewater treatment for the competition for ammonium among anammox bacteria aob and aoa ammonium could be supplied from anaerobic degradation remineralization of organic matter occurring inside of marine and freshwater sediments which creates counter diffusion of nitrite from the surface and ammonium from the inner part these cooperative and competitive interactions may take place at oxic anoxic interface usually only a few 10 μm fig 7 a clear vertical stratification of these n cycle microorganisms was created in a partial nitritation anammox granule ali et al 2016 fig 7d aob were restricted to the outermost of the granule which were followed by nob in a thin oxic region and underneath anammox bacteria dominated thus aob convert ammonium into nitrite providing substrate for anammox ali et al 2016 anammox bacteria can tolerate trace amount of oxygen e g 20 μm kalvelage et al 2011 however a part of nitrite was scavenged by the tightly clustering nob in this granule active nitrogen transformation occurred within outer ca 300 500 μm which was obviously regulated by oxygen availability the cooperative and competitive interactions with other n cycle microorganisms could shape up the dominant anammox population interestingly anammox bacteria ca bracadia sp were found to be co aggregated with recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria which were affiliated with the genus nitrospira in flocs at very low oxygen concentrations van kessel et al 2015 recent kinetic analysis of a comammox strain nitrospira inopinata revealed its higher affinity with ammonium 0 65 μm and lower affinity with nitrite 372 μm as compared with anammox bacteria kits et al 2017 figs 3 and 4 both bacteria compete for ammonium but comammox bacteria create anoxic environment for anammox bacteria it was also experimentally demonstrated that anammox bacteria could cooperate with aoa by supplying nitrite and a trace amount of oxygen yan et al 2012 since interaction between anammox bacteria and these n cycle microorganisms is delicate and complicated mathematical modeling could be a useful tool for assessment of niche separation of anammox bacteria picioreanu et al 2016 straka et al 2019 10 3 utilization of organic nitrogen compounds although anammox contributes significantly to fixed n loss in omzs ammonium is scarce in the omzs dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra heterotrophic nitrate reduction and remineralization of organic matter could be potential ammonium sources for anammox however still a substantial part 54 77 of ammonium whose sources still cannot be identified lam et al 2009 for nitrite anammox bacteria retrieve 67 of nitrite from nitrate reduction and 33 from aerobic ammonium oxidation dalsgaard et al 2012 thus it is speculated that organic nitrogen compounds such as urea and cyanate might be alternative ammonium sources for anammox because these compounds were commonly detected in the omzs due to microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter zehr and ward 2002 genomic analysis revealed that the genes encoding for urease degrades urea to ammonium have not been found in anammox bacteria so far and genomic information on cyanate utilization is also limited recently it was reported that the genes encoding for urease were transcribed together with the genes for core anammox metabolisms in the omzs where the highest anammox rates were observed ganesh et al 2018 this evidence implies that organic nitrogen compounds were potential alternative ammonium sources for anammox bacteria the capability of urea utilization may drive the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria in ocean and provide fundamental evidence for urea degradation in wastewater treatment using specific anammox species aob possessing urease activity could proliferate successfully at oligotrophic environment with scarce ammonium concentrations koops and pommerening röser 2001 and formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster among nitrosomonas pommerening röser et al 1996 however it is still entirely unclear if anammox bacteria can degrade urea and cyanate to ammonium themselves or rely on other coexisting organisms future studies are required to assess how these organic nitrogen compounds are utilized by anammox bacteria under what environmental conditions 10 4 application of integrated multi omics analysis multi omic techniques such as metagenomics metatranscriptomics and metabolomics analysis are often seen as an indispensable platform for microbiological studies integrated multi omics analysis have begun to unravel the metabolic functions and interactions of anammox and coexisting heterotrophic bacteria in anammox granules lawson et al 2017 despite the potential of multi omics analysis the importance of culture based studies cannot be neglected cultures have provided the basis for our understanding of the microbiology and are necessary for physiological studies therefore we re emphasize that omics data must be combined with culture based studies to confirm the newly discovered microbial functions and interactions e g substrate cross feeding through omics analysis 11 conclusions many studies of anammox have been undertaking since anammox bacteria were discovered in the early 1990s for about 30 years which focused mainly on engineering applications nitrogen removal from various wastewaters as a result there are now more than 120 full scale anammox plants around the world however knowledge about their ecology physiology and biochemistry is still largely limited due to mainly lack of pure and enrichment cultures to improve the efficiency and stability of anammox processes further research is obviously required to assess niche differentiation of anammox bacteria in natural and engineered ecosystems it should be emphasized that kinetic parameters especially half saturation constants for nitrite and ammonium metabolic flexibility and effects of environmental factors must be evaluated using planktonic free living enrichment cultures other physiological traits such as maintenance coefficient must be experimentally determined further and linked to population dynamics in competition experiments the application of omics in studying niche differentiation in anammox could be included in declaration

18174,anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria can directly convert ammonium and nitrite to nitrogen gas anaerobically and were responsible for a substantial part of the fixed nitrogen loss and re oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in freshwater and marine ecosystems although a wide variety of studies have been undertaken to investigate the abundance and biodiversity of anammox bacteria so far ecological niche differentiation of anammox bacteria is still not fully understood to assess their growth behavior and consequent population dynamics at a given environment the monod model is often used here we summarize the monod kinetic parameters such as the maximum specific growth rate μ max and the half saturation constant for nitrite k no2 and ammonium k nh4 of five known candidatus genera of anammox bacteria we also discuss potential pivotal environmental factors and metabolic flexibility that influence the community compositions of anammox bacteria particularly biodiversity of the genus scalindua might have been largely underestimated several anammox bacteria have been successfully enriched from various source of biomass we reevaluate their enrichment methods and culture medium compositions to gain a clue of niche differentiation of anammox bacteria furthermore we formulate the current issues that must be addressed overall this review re emphasizes the importance of enrichment cultures preferably pure cultures physiological characterization and direct microbial competition studies using enrichment cultures in laboratories graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox bacteria niche differentiation growth kinetics enrichment cultures microbial competition 1 introduction anammox bacteria can catalyze the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions van de graaf et al 1996 so far 19 species under 6 candidatus genera brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua anammoxoglobus and anammoximicrobium have been reported from various natural and man made ecosystems oshiki et al 2016 khramenkov et al 2013 anammox process has received considerable attention as a cost effective and environment friendly nitrogen removal process from wastewater ali and okabe 2015 kartal et al 2010a b more importantly anammox bacteria have been detected ubiquitously in anoxic environments and found to be responsible for 24 67 of n loss in marine sediments thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 and 20 40 in the suboxic water columns of the black sea and gulfo dulce dalsgaard et al 2003 kuypers et al 2003 recent studies demonstrated even greater percentages up to 100 of marine n loss these experimental evidences reveal that anammox bacteria are one of key players in the global nitrogen cycle hamersley et al 2007 kuypers et al 2005 schmid et al 2007 trimmer et al 2013 an important ecological question remains to be answered is what shapes community compositions of anammox bacteria due to intra and inter specific competition occurred in natural environment anammox bacteria have been considered to occupy different niches in the natural environment in correlation with the physiological properties of individual species or group of species kartal et al 2007b hence enrichment or pure culture of anammox bacteria followed by physiological characterization is essential to understand the ecological niche differentiation of anammox bacteria koops and pommerening röser 2001 zhang et al 2017a given that among 19 anammox species being identified 10 species have been enriched and their physiological characteristics have been characterized to date oshiki et al 2016 thus direct microbial competition studies can be performed using those individual enrichment cultures individual populations can be quantified using 16s rrna gene targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays ali et al 2015 awata et al 2013 koops and pommerening röser 2001 narita et al 2017 oshiki et al 2011 in fact population shifts among different anammox species have been frequently observed in laboratory reactors for instance from ca b fulgida dominated population to ca brocadia sp 40 park et al 2010b from ca b fulgida to ca k stuttgartiensis park et al 2015 from ca brocadia sp to ca k stuttgartiensis van der star et al 2008 and from ca b anammoxidians to ca anammoxoglobus propionicus kartal et al 2007b in addition mage data analysis on anammox 16s rrna gene sequences detected so far revealed diverse geographical distributions and suggested possible driving factors sonthiphand et al 2014 which must be experimentally verified by direct microbial competition studies under controlled laboratory conditions ali et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a currently most of the wastewater treatment plants are seeded with mature anammox granules to reduce the start up time van der star et al 2007 selection of suitable seeding sludge could be a key to rapid and efficient start up of annamox processes kartal et al 2006 if we know the niche differentiation the most suitable anammox species can be selected for targeting wastewater therefore here we provide an overview of physiological characteristics of anammox bacteria and discuss potential factors determining ecological niche differentiation among different anammox species for details on the natural distributions of anammox bacteria reported so far see a recent review by oshiki et al 2016 2 microbial growth kinetics information on intrinsic microbial growth kinetics i e the maximum specific growth rate μ max and half saturation constant ks is indispensable to predict the growth behavior under given conditions based on the monod model bollmann et al 2002 french et al 2012 füchslin et al 2012 kindaichi et al 2006 kovarova kovar and egli 1998 martens habbena et al 2009 ngugi et al 2016 nogueira and melo 2006 nowka et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a based on the monod equation monod 1949 the growth properties of anammox species could be predicted using the reported values of ks and μ max fig 1 for instance ca brocadia sp 40 most likely outcompete other freshwater anammox bacteria under almost all conditions when assuming no2 is a limiting substrate and there is no specific inhibitor s for ca brocadia sp 40 under high no2 conditions like wastewater treatment ca brocadia sinica becomes a good competitor for ca brocadia sp 40 suggesting that both brocadia species are suitable for wastewater treatment on the other hand it seems that diverse anammox species could coexist under low substrate conditions like natural environments this speculation can be supported by the geographical distribution patterns of anammox bacteria revealed by anammox 16s rrna gene sequences data sonthiphand et al 2014 however choice of 16s rrna gene targeting primer sets can significantly bias the community composition of anammox bacteria as recently described by orschler et al 2019 therefore abundance and diversity of anammox bacteria reported so far must be carefully evaluated and compared so far direct evidence of a correlation between substrate availability and species abundance of anammox bacteria in natural environment is not available such information could be very helpful to understand the niche differentiation 2 1 maximum specific growth rate μ max μ max of anammox bacteria was mainly determined by either controlling the sludge retention time srt in membrane bioreactor mbr or measuring the biomass yield and maximum specific substrate consumption rate due to the lack of pure culture lotti et al 2015 oshiki et al 2011 μ max of ca b sinica ca j caeni and ca s japonica were recently reevaluated by directly measuring the time course increase of 16s rrna gene copy numbers using newly developed qpcr assays yielding the fastest μ max ever reported for these species so far zhang et al 2017b fig 2 ca b sinica and ca brocadia sp 40 exhibited the highest μ max 0 33 d 1 among anammox bacteria which could be advantageous of being dominant population thus μ max of other anammox species needs to be reevaluated using appropriate cell cultures i e planktonic free living cells with high purity and methodology e g more accurate cell quantification methods 2 2 half saturation constant ks availability of nitrite is more relevant to the niche differentiation among anammox bacteria since ammonium is usually more abundant than nitrite in both natural or man made ecosystems pitcher et al 2011 van der star et al 2007 thus ks is the key parameter for microbial growth and consequent niche differentiation a wide range of ks values for ammonium k nh4 3 0 640 μm and nitrite k no2 0 2 370 μm have been reported for different anammox species fig 3 and fig 4 ali et al 2015 awata et al 2013 carvajal arroyo et al 2013 kartal et al 2007b 2008 lotti et al 2014 narita et al 2017 oshiki et al 2013a b 2017 oshiki et al 2013a b strous et al 1999b van der star et al 2008 however it seems that most of the ks values were determined using granular and or aggregated biomass in which substrate transport limitations occurred lotti et al 2014 therefore the reported affinity constants k s were more likely apparent but not the intrinsic half saturation constants among the reported ks values some of them were determined from planktonic enrichment cell cultures ca k stuttgartiensis ca b sinica ca brocadia sp 40 ca s japonica and ca b sapporoensis awata et al 2013 lotti et al 2014 narita et al 2017 oshiki et al 2013a b van der star et al 2008 thus which are of highly importance 2 3 maintenance coefficient m maintenance m has been defined as the energy consumed for functions other than the production of new cell material pirt 1965 this value is considered to be growth rate independent and deeply involved in the microbial competition füchslin et al 2012 van bodegom 2007 the relative proportion of energy assigned for maintenance becomes more significant when cells are cultured at low growth rates than at high growth rate for example the maintenance energy was a critical factor to determine the successful growth under low substrate concentration in co culture of escherichia coli and chelatobacter heintzii füchslin et al 2012 the population dynamics could be estimated using an extended form of the monod model incorporating a finite substrate concentration at zero growth rate s min alternative expression of maintenance energy in a competition study between ca b sinica and ca j caeni ca b sinica was outcompeted by ca j caeni under only low nitrogen loading rates even though the monod model predicted the dominance of ca b sinica zhang et al 2017a this discrepancy might suggest the importance of s min ca b sinica requires high maintenance energy high s min than ca j caeni thereby ca b sinica could not sustain their population at low nitrogen loading rates since information of maintenance energy requirement was mostly missing for anammox bacteria they should be determined in the future 3 oxygen tolerance anammox bacteria anoxically oxidize ammonium with nitrite as an electron acceptor which was supplied by aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and or archaea aoa thus their affinities for ammonia and oxygen and oxygen tolerance of anammox bacteria play a crucial role in their association with aob and or aoa a limited information on oxygen tolerance of anammox bacteria is available anammox bacteria had higher k nh4 values than aoa but these values were comparable with those of aob fig 3 anammox bacteria were inhibited by oxygen at very low levels inhibition coefficient that gives the half maximum inhibition ki o2 is 0 092 μm straka et al 2019 this suggests that the cooperation of anammox bacteria and aoa is only possible when ammonia and oxygen diffuse in the counter direction such as stratified lakes and oceans straka et al 2019 association of aob and anammox bacteria could be expected at relatively high nh4 and o2 concentrations like wastewater treatment anammox bacteria were considered to be microaerotolerant instead of being strict anaerobes jensen et al 2008 lam et al 2009 strous and jetten 1997 the oxygen tolerance determined from enrichment cultures varies depending on species 0 200 μm o2 for ca k stuttgartiensis 63 μm o2 for ca b sinica 1 μm o2 for ca b anammoxidans 120 μm o2 for ca b caroliniensis 70 μm o2 for ca b fulgida oshiki et al 2016 despite their significant contribution to the oceanic nitrogen cycle the oxygen tolerance of marine anammox species ca scalindua is currently missing in marine environments i e oxygen minimum zones omzs anammox activity was found up to 10 μm o2 jensen et al 2008 and 20 μm o2 kalvelage et al 2011 however it should be noted that the oxygen tolerance is highly dependent upon types of biomass i e planktonic free living or aggregated biomass and careful assessment of biomass type is essential oxygen inhibition seems to be reversible anammox activity of brocadia dominated biomass gradually recovered to the original level after micro aerobic conditions 0 02 mg o2 l 1 was achieved seuntjens et al 2018 the recovery time was dependent on the degree i e exposure o2 concentration and time of perceived inhibition this result indicates that anammox bacteria residing in partial nitritation anammox pn a granules and marine snow probably experience repeated o2 inhibition and recovery however our understanding is still very limited oxygen inhibition and recovery needs to be further investigated for different anammox species 4 salinity salinity has been suggested as the most important discrimination factor governing the geographical distributions of anammox bacteria ca scalindua dominated in saline environments mostly marine while other genera were mostly found in freshwater environments sonthiphand et al 2014 all enrichment cultures of ca scalindua are obligately halophilic requirement of salt for growth they formed a cluster that phylogenetically distant from other anammox genera oshiki et al 2016 biogeographical distributions of anammox bacteria have shown that ca scalindua was the most abundant genus in river estuary area while abundances of ca brocadia and ca kuenenia were negatively correlated with salinity concentration amano et al 2007 dale et al 2009 ca brocadia and ca kuenenia were mostly detected from wastewater treatment plants and soil environment humbert et al 2010 schmid et al 2005 their detection in saline environments has been considered as transient accumulation dale et al 2009 interestingly first two ca scalindua species ca scalindua brodae and ca scalindua wagneri were retrieved from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp treating landfill leachate in pitsea uk instead of marine environment in addition ca scalindua related 16s rrna genes and the hydrazine synthase hzsa genes were detected in two anoxic hypersaline up to 24 salinity sulphidic basins in eastern mediterranean sea borin et al 2013 these evidences suggest that ca scalindua are distributing from freshwater environment e g river estuary to hypersaline environments indicating that ca scalindua might constitute the most diverse genus among anammox bacteria it is therefore essential to explore eco physiological and functional diversity of ca scalindua to better describe the growth behavior with salinity inhibition the salinity effect must be quantitatively determined and incorporated in the monod equation the monod model has been integrated with the gauss equation using the least square non linear regression for evaluation of salinity induced kinetics wu et al 2019 the model simulation revealed that ca scalindua dominated over ca kuenenia only at salinity 3 0 when nitrite concentration s no2 was higher than nitrite affinity constant k no2 conversely high nitrite affinity of ca scalindua leads to their predominance in all salinities under nitrite depleted conditions k no2 s no2 fig 4 wu et al 2019 generally to survive under saline conditions microorganisms must make osmolarity balance between the inside and outside cells either synthesize uptake organic compatible solutes or accumulate inorganic ions k so called salt in strategy ventosa et al 1998 for non halophiles this adaptation also involves the manipulation of intracellular protein structures to function under elevated intracellular ion concentrations dennis and shimmin 1997 depending on sort of osmolyte this process could be extremely energy intensive particularly for autotrophs oren 1999 for example to create same osmolarity de novo biosynthesis of trehalose a 12 carbon disaccharide sugar requires 750 times more atps than accumulating kcl fig 6 which significantly reduces energy allocated to growth therefore to successfully survive under saline environment an energy efficient osmoregulation strategy is preferred although experimental evidence for osmoregulation in anammox bacteria is still not available only some information has been inferred from the genomes based on protein isoelectric point distributions derived from the genome of ca s brodae and ca s profunda speth et al 2015 van de vossenberg et al 2013 it was suggested that both species might employ a salt in strategy for salinity adaptation however the genome of ca s rubra suggests the use of a compatible solutes synthesis strategy to cope with high salinity speth et al 2017 it was observed that addition of yeast extract improved the activity of ca s japonica personal commination this may suggest that anammox bacteria could directly up take the osmolytes or precursors including amino acids in yeast extract to enhance osmoregulation which is less energy intensive than de novo biosynthesis nieto et al 1998 oren 2011 youssef et al 2014 further study is apparently required to verify the osmoregulation strategies of anammox bacteria the salinity effect on kinetic properties and interspecies competition at various salinities to assess its effect on the niche differentiation 5 aggregation ability anammox bacteria exhibit high tendency to form aggregates or biofilms ali et al 2018 in which different microenvironments are developed due to substrate diffusion limitation and high microbial activity fig 7 microelectrode measurements showed considerable heterogeneity with respect to physicochemical parameters even in small microbial flocs granules and thin biofilms ali et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2007a okabe et al 1999 this spatial heterogeneity makes competing species to coexist in the same aggregates but different locations such as surface and inner part of the aggregate fig 7 ali et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2007b apparent half saturation coefficient in activated sludge flocs is highly dependent on the microcolony size biomass density and spatial biomass distribution lotti et al 2014 picioreanu et al 2016 the reversion of aob and nob apparent oxygen half saturation coefficients k o was caused by high biomass density and resulting o2 concentration gradients inside the microcolonies picioreanu et al 2016 therefore it is very important to describe more detailed microbial spatial distributions and directly link them to in situ analyses of microenvironments to accurately interpret the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria in aggregated biomass aggregates and biofilms also provide a protective niche as a physical barrier against physical washout weissbrodt et al 2012 predators kumar et al 2017 oxygen and inhibitory chemicals monier and lindow 2003 nogueira and melo 2006 aggregation abilities of three different anammox species ca b sinica ca j caeni and ca b sapporoensis were quantitatively evaluated based on cell surface properties and extracellular polymeric substances eps production ali et al 2018 it was found that ca b sinica possesses the most hydrophobic cell surface leading to the best aggregation capability ali et al 2018 in addition ca b sinica has the highest maximum specific growth rate zhang et al 2017b these superior eco physiological features suggest that ca b sinica is the most suitable inoculum for wastewater treatments this speculation is supported by the geographical distribution based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showing the most frequent detections of this species in engineering ecosystems sonthiphand et al 2014 aggregate formation however makes it extremely difficult to understand the mechanisms or factors involved in niche differentiation 6 organic matter anammox bacteria have been considered to be a chemolithotroph upon the discovery strous et al 1999a however some anammox bacteria could oxidize short chain fatty acids which was coupled with reduction of nitrate and or nitrite to ammonium disguised as denitrifiers alternatively kartal et al 2007a for example ca a propionicus can oxidize propionate at a rate of 0 64 0 05 μmol per gram protein per minute which was more than 5 times higher than ca b anammoxidans and ca k stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2007b while ca b fulgida an autofluorescent anammox bacteria can oxidize acetate at a rate of 0 95 0 04 μmol per gram protein per minute which is higher than other anammox species kartal et al 2008 both species became the dominant species in anammox community in the laboratory reactors fed with an anammox medium containing organic acids according to those studies the addition of organic acids does not affect the biomass yield and specific growth rate the question now is whether the organic matter can be used as energy or carbon source or both laureni et al 2015 have reported that ca b fulgida did not directly incorporate or store the amended acetate and glucose based on microautoradiography combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization mar fish analysis however this metabolic capability might be species specific therefore test using other anammox species should be conducted further study on fatty acids oxidation by anammox bacteria is also needed to understand how this metabolism gives certain anammox species physiological advantages over others 7 culture conditions for enrichment cultivation conditions are important for enrichment of anammox species because they reflect their potential niche differentiation here we summarized the inoculum types and culture conditions used for enrichment of each anammox species table 1 anammox bacteria have been enriched from various source of biomass so far including denitrifying sludge ca j caeni and ca b sinica fujii et al 2002 tsushima et al 2007 activated sludge ca b flugida and ca a propionicus kartal et al 2008 2007b nitrifying biomass ca k stuttgartiensis egli et al 2001 marine sediments ca s japonica and ca scalindua sp kindaichi et al 2011 van de vossenberg et al 2008 composition and concentrations of the feed substrate might determine the outcome of enrichment park et al 2010a 2010b for example ca b flugida and ca a propionicus were enriched from the same activated sludge by supplying an inorganic anammox medium with acetate 1 30 mm and propionate 0 8 15 mm respectively kartal et al 2008 in addition various types of reactors were used for enrichment of different types of biomass sequencing batch reactor sbr for granular biomass membrane bioreactor mbr for planktonic biomass and up flow anaerobic bioreactor uab for attached biomass i e biofilms no correlation between the reactor type and enriched anammox species was observed table 1 in our laboratory we first used up flow column reactors with non woven fabrics as biomass carrier for initial enrichment of ca b sinica from activated sludge yielding about 90 pure biofilm biomass after about 6 month anoxic cultivation tsushima et al 2007 fig 8 a secret key to successful enrichment is that contaminated other bacteria should be washed out by applying high flow rate i e short hydraulic retention time hrt and meanwhile maintaining low no2 concentration to avoid no2 inhibition oxygen contamination must be avoided especially at the beginning of enrichment thereafter enriched biofilm biomass was homogenized and inoculated into to mbrs to obtain planktonic free living biomass with 95 purity for physiological and biochemical studies oshiki et al 2013a b zhang and okabe 2017 in this way we have succeeded in enriching four different anammox species ca b sinica oshiki et al 2011 ca j caeni ali and okabe 2015 ca s japonica awata et al 2013 oshiki et al 2017 and ca b sapporensis narita et al 2017 however a certain species may not be easily cultured as planktonic cells in mbr trigo et al 2006 on the other hand it seems that ca s japonica forms less aggregates or biofilms it is therefore interesting to investigate which anammox species can be enriched in what form of biomass most freshwater anammox species were enriched at temperature range from 27 c to 37 c while marine anammox species were enriched at a temperature range from 15 c to 25 c maximum activities were observed at around 37 c for freshwater anammox species ali et al 2015 oshiki et al 2011 and below 30 c for marine species awata et al 2013 therefore besides salinity temperature could be another pivotal factor between marine and freshwater anammox species ph has been found to regulate the abundance diversity and activity of aob and aoa in paddy soils li et al 2015 since all anammox species were enriched at ph of 6 8 8 5 so far it is very interesting if certain anammox species be detected or enriched from acidic or alkalic environments finally an inorganic medium that was originally used by van de graaf et al 1996 has been used for these enrichment cultures with some modifications of metal concentrations table 1 for example various iron 5 0 van de graaf et al 1996 6 3 strous et al 1998 6 8 hsu et al 2014 or 9 0 mg l 1 quan et al 2008 respectively and copper 0 25 mg l 1 or no addition ali et al 2015 van de graaf et al 1996 concentrations were used anammox bacteria can carry out nitrate dependent ferrous iron oxidation oshiki et al 2013a b in addition fe ii addition significantly enhanced the specific growth rate of ca j caeni from 0 12 d 1 at a regular fe ii level 0 03 mm to 0 17 d 1 at 0 09 mm liu and ni 2015 iron is deeply involved in anammox metabolism qiao et al 2013 and vast majority of cellular iron is in the form of cofactors within fe s proteins and multi heme cytochromes ferousi et al 2017 kartal and keltjens 2016 high percentages of intracellular fe contents 41 and 39 for ca j caeni and ca b sinica respectively were reported ali et al 2015 copper was also found to be the dominant metal component in anammox bacteria 39 and 42 for ca j caeni and ca b sinica respectively which is involved in enzymes of reductive acetyl coa pathway for carbon fixation ali et al 2015 kartal et al 2011b it is also interesting that some anammox bacteria were enriched using ground water instead of demineralized water ali et al 2015 kindaichi et al 2011 tsushima et al 2007 indeed certain anammox species have been detected at groundwater environment sonthiphand et al 2014 composition of groundwater most likely metal elements minerals and alkalinity varies depending on geographical regions and weather conditions dragon and marciniak 2010 therefore it deserves to investigate the composition of trace elements in groundwater and compared with those in demineralized water for enrichment of anammox bacteria in fact ca b sinica dominated biomass has been enriched and maintained for many years using groundwater in author s laboratory hokkaido university sapporo japan however the dominant anammox population shifted to ca k stuttgartiensis after the ca b sinica dominated biomass was cultured by exactly same manner and conditions except using the local groundwater at nagaoka national college of technology niigata japan furthermore when the ca k stuttgartiensis dominated biomass was sent back to hokkaido university and cultured with hokkaido university s groundwater the dominant population shifted back to ca b sinica again unpublished our data since the only difference was the groundwater used for culture medium it clearly indicates that there are as yet unknown factor s in groundwater which determines the dominant anammox species 8 interspecific competition interspecific competition different anammox bacterial species compete for the same resources e g a limiting substrate nitrite or ammonium or living space which consequently results in the exclusion of an inferior species or decline in the population in the habitat and niche differentiation an important question is what shapes the community compositions among various properties such as growth kinetics metabolic flexibility and environmental factors growth kinetics play an important role in the competition tilman 1977 recently the interspecies competition for a limiting substrate nitrite between ca b sinica and ca j caeni were experimentally investigated using planktonic enrichment cultures in mbrs and gel immobilized enrichment cultures in column reactors zhang et al 2017a as predicted by the monod model fig 1 ca b sinica outcompeted ca j caeni under high nitrogen loading rates nlr however ca j caeni could proliferate and dominate under low nlrs which contradicts the model prediction this discrepancy is probably attributed to insufficient accuracy of growth kinetic parameters especially k no2 values and lack of information on maintenance rate as mentioned above more study is essential to consolidate the kinetic parameters of anammox bacteria for better understanding of niche differentiation in gel immobilized biomass gel beads both species coexisted but spatially separated ca j caeni was mainly present in the inner part low no2 environment whereas ca b sinica was present throughout the gel beads this spatial distribution may imply the niche differentiation of two species in natural environments more studies with different species combinations and different culture conditions are required to understand the niche partitioning among anammox species 9 other factors other variables might be involved in constituting the niche differentiation of anammox species the inhibitory concentration levels of nitrite 100 768 mg l 1 nontoxic organic matters counted as cod 237 mg cod l 1 290 mg cod l 1 sulfide 5 mm phosphate 50 mm methanol and others have been reported see references oshiki et al 2016 jin et al 2012 and references therein but data are yet too limited for a species specific differentiation 10 outlook 10 1 isolation of pure anammox bacteria although isolation is laborious and time consuming pure cultures are obviously needed for accurate measurement of growth kinetics and physiological traits and biochemical studies as stated above bollmann et al 2011 it is still not clear the missing element s in the isolation of anammox bacteria the culturability of slow growing fastidious bacteria from environmental samples has been improved by a simple modification in the preparation of agar media i e autoclaving the phosphate and agar separately kato et al 2018 other efforts including simulating environment and coculturing targets have been proven successful in pure culturing certain microorganisms see detailed review stewart 2012 pure cultures are still not available for anammox bacteria however several enrichment planktonic cell cultures have been established using membrane bioreactors mbrs so far van der star et al 2008 oshiki et al 2013a b kartal et al 2011a b lotti et al 2014 zhang and okabe 2017 these enrichment cultivations however require an enormous amount of time to achieve free living planktonic cells in most studies usually more than 100 200 days ali et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 oshiki et al 2013a b van der star et al 2008 in addition detailed mechanism of achieving planktonic free living cells in mbr is not well understood recently a more rapid and systematic cultivation technique was developed by applying polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa gel immobilization technology zhang and okabe 2017 in this new approach anammox bacterial cells were firstly grown in the pva sa gel beads which provides easily dispersible biomass and then the dispersed biomass was inoculated to mbr the combination of pva sa gel immobilization technique and mbr cultivation can provide planktonic cell cultures with high purity 95 within 35 days fig 5 which will significantly accelerate the cultivation of planktonic anammox cells and consequently studies on physiology and biochemistry of anammox bacteria to further purify anammox bacterial cells more than 99 5 purity a percall density gradient centrifugation technique has been applied for the planktonic mbr cultures kartal et al 2011a strous et al 1999b 1999a in this method percoll solution and anammox culture were mixed and then centrifugated resulting in an anammox cell suspension with more than 99 8 purity kartal et al 2011a this percoll separated almost pure anammox cells could carry out the anammox reaction and co2 fixation and thus can be used for further purification or isolation for isolation we commonly carry out a limiting dilution of the percall separated cell culture however anammox activity is highly dependent on the cell density minimum cell densities required to obtain a detectable anammox activity were reported to be at least 1010 1011 cells ml 1 strous et al 1999a 106 cells ml 1 oshiki et al unpublished data and 0 4 g anammox biomass vss l 1 thus the cell density of the diluted percoll separated culture must be higher than 106 cells ml 1 however since the percoll separated almost pure anammox culture is not pure yet ca 99 8 it still contains 103 cells ml of other contaminated cells which hampers the isolation of anammox bacteria therefore growth of the contaminated microorganisms must be supressed by adding antibiotics such as penicillin g and others which inhibit other contaminated bacteria but not anammox bacteria hu et al 2013a b promoting selection of anammox bacteria furthermore the cell density dependent anammox activity seems to be regulated by acyl homoserine lactones ahl mediated quorum sensing system sun et al 2018 tang et al 2015 tanga et al 2019 the release of three ahl ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl c12 hsl by anammox bacteria was confirmed tang et al 2015 furthermore external addition of ahls to low biomass concentration cultures significantly increased the anammox activity tanga et al 2019 in addition nitric oxide no could act as a signaling molecule which has been suggested from metagenome analysis kartal et al 2011a strous et al 1999b and promote growth of anammox bacteria hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2010a b thus an alternative approach for further isolation could be a limiting dilution of the percoll separated anammox culture the cell density could be below 106 cells ml followed by careful incubation with addition of signaling molecules like ahl and or no and specific antibiotics to inhibit the growth of other contaminated bacteria since this isolation method has never been tested yet it is important to try if it works or not alternatively anammox bacteria may associate with syntrophs metabolic networks between anammox bacteria and the member of chlorobi on degradation of protein and extracellular peptides and nitrate recycling into nitrite were proposed for naturally aggregated granules based on metagenomic analysis lawson et al 2017 however there was no experimental study to confirm this hypothesis yet in anammox granules nitrate could be reduced to nitrite by heterotrophic denitrifiers using either organic acids or hydrogen those are produced by fermentation of organic matter as the electron donor which makes additional nitrite available for anammox bacteria speth et al 2016 hence hydrogen forming microorganisms and denitrifiers may establish a syntrophic association with anammox bacteria it was experimentally confirmed that anammox bacteria produced and excreted a large amount of organic matter which was directly utilized by coexisting heterotrophs kindaichi et al 2012 therefore such syntrophic association with heterotrophs may not be excluded in enrichment or isolation processes otherwise the growth of anammox bacteria could be inhibited by accumulation of metabolites kindaichi et al 2012 to enrich anammox bacteria the accumulation of organic matter derived from anammox bacteria must be minimized by washing out the metabolites from reactors or exchanging culture medium frequently with efficient biomass retention this is a main reason why we have been using an up flow column reactor fig 8 and mbr for enrichment of anammox bacteria because mbr can be operated at very short hydraulic retention time hrt with 100 biomass retention that is hrt and solid biomass retention time srt can be controlled separately in mbr 10 2 cooperative and competitive microbial interaction anammox bacteria must live with both cooperative and competitive microbial interactions created in granular and aggregated biomass of wastewater treatment processes and marine and freshwater sediments since nitrite is scare as compared with ammonium in typical wastewater aerobic aob and or aoa partially oxidize ammonium to nitrite using oxygen creating a suitable anoxic condition and supplying nitrite for anammox bacteria oxygen and nitrite centered cooperative interaction on the other hand anammox bacteria must compete aerobic aob and or aoa for ammonium and nob and denitrifiers for the produced nitrite ammonium and nitrite centered competitive interaction these cooperative and competitive interactions are alternative driving factors determining dominant anammox bacteria obviously anammox bacteria representing the higher oxygen tolerance and higher affinity to ammonium and nitrite can advantageously compete with other n cycle microorganisms therefore kinetic parameters especially half saturation constants for ammonium k nh4 and nitrite k no2 are of importance figs 3 and 4 but are lacking because of a limited number of pure and enrichment cultures nowka et al 2015 the k nh4 values of anammox bacteria are slightly higher than those of aoa but lower than aob fig 3 the k no2 values of anammox bacteria are comparable with those of nob fig 4 this implies that nob more likely scavenge nitrite and convert to nitrate if oxygen is available which is an unwanted case for wastewater treatment for the competition for ammonium among anammox bacteria aob and aoa ammonium could be supplied from anaerobic degradation remineralization of organic matter occurring inside of marine and freshwater sediments which creates counter diffusion of nitrite from the surface and ammonium from the inner part these cooperative and competitive interactions may take place at oxic anoxic interface usually only a few 10 μm fig 7 a clear vertical stratification of these n cycle microorganisms was created in a partial nitritation anammox granule ali et al 2016 fig 7d aob were restricted to the outermost of the granule which were followed by nob in a thin oxic region and underneath anammox bacteria dominated thus aob convert ammonium into nitrite providing substrate for anammox ali et al 2016 anammox bacteria can tolerate trace amount of oxygen e g 20 μm kalvelage et al 2011 however a part of nitrite was scavenged by the tightly clustering nob in this granule active nitrogen transformation occurred within outer ca 300 500 μm which was obviously regulated by oxygen availability the cooperative and competitive interactions with other n cycle microorganisms could shape up the dominant anammox population interestingly anammox bacteria ca bracadia sp were found to be co aggregated with recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria which were affiliated with the genus nitrospira in flocs at very low oxygen concentrations van kessel et al 2015 recent kinetic analysis of a comammox strain nitrospira inopinata revealed its higher affinity with ammonium 0 65 μm and lower affinity with nitrite 372 μm as compared with anammox bacteria kits et al 2017 figs 3 and 4 both bacteria compete for ammonium but comammox bacteria create anoxic environment for anammox bacteria it was also experimentally demonstrated that anammox bacteria could cooperate with aoa by supplying nitrite and a trace amount of oxygen yan et al 2012 since interaction between anammox bacteria and these n cycle microorganisms is delicate and complicated mathematical modeling could be a useful tool for assessment of niche separation of anammox bacteria picioreanu et al 2016 straka et al 2019 10 3 utilization of organic nitrogen compounds although anammox contributes significantly to fixed n loss in omzs ammonium is scarce in the omzs dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra heterotrophic nitrate reduction and remineralization of organic matter could be potential ammonium sources for anammox however still a substantial part 54 77 of ammonium whose sources still cannot be identified lam et al 2009 for nitrite anammox bacteria retrieve 67 of nitrite from nitrate reduction and 33 from aerobic ammonium oxidation dalsgaard et al 2012 thus it is speculated that organic nitrogen compounds such as urea and cyanate might be alternative ammonium sources for anammox because these compounds were commonly detected in the omzs due to microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter zehr and ward 2002 genomic analysis revealed that the genes encoding for urease degrades urea to ammonium have not been found in anammox bacteria so far and genomic information on cyanate utilization is also limited recently it was reported that the genes encoding for urease were transcribed together with the genes for core anammox metabolisms in the omzs where the highest anammox rates were observed ganesh et al 2018 this evidence implies that organic nitrogen compounds were potential alternative ammonium sources for anammox bacteria the capability of urea utilization may drive the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria in ocean and provide fundamental evidence for urea degradation in wastewater treatment using specific anammox species aob possessing urease activity could proliferate successfully at oligotrophic environment with scarce ammonium concentrations koops and pommerening röser 2001 and formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster among nitrosomonas pommerening röser et al 1996 however it is still entirely unclear if anammox bacteria can degrade urea and cyanate to ammonium themselves or rely on other coexisting organisms future studies are required to assess how these organic nitrogen compounds are utilized by anammox bacteria under what environmental conditions 10 4 application of integrated multi omics analysis multi omic techniques such as metagenomics metatranscriptomics and metabolomics analysis are often seen as an indispensable platform for microbiological studies integrated multi omics analysis have begun to unravel the metabolic functions and interactions of anammox and coexisting heterotrophic bacteria in anammox granules lawson et al 2017 despite the potential of multi omics analysis the importance of culture based studies cannot be neglected cultures have provided the basis for our understanding of the microbiology and are necessary for physiological studies therefore we re emphasize that omics data must be combined with culture based studies to confirm the newly discovered microbial functions and interactions e g substrate cross feeding through omics analysis 11 conclusions many studies of anammox have been undertaking since anammox bacteria were discovered in the early 1990s for about 30 years which focused mainly on engineering applications nitrogen removal from various wastewaters as a result there are now more than 120 full scale anammox plants around the world however knowledge about their ecology physiology and biochemistry is still largely limited due to mainly lack of pure and enrichment cultures to improve the efficiency and stability of anammox processes further research is obviously required to assess niche differentiation of anammox bacteria in natural and engineered ecosystems it should be emphasized that kinetic parameters especially half saturation constants for nitrite and ammonium metabolic flexibility and effects of environmental factors must be evaluated using planktonic free living enrichment cultures other physiological traits such as maintenance coefficient must be experimentally determined further and linked to population dynamics in competition experiments the application of omics in studying niche differentiation in anammox could be included in declaration
