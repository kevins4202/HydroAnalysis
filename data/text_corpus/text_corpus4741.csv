23705,in this paper a theoretical predictive model is developed to investigate the heat and mass transfer from saline water droplets in cold seas and ocean regions also the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets during flight over marine platforms are analyzed the predictive model considers convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer from the droplet s surface to the ambient air the results show that droplets with medium sizes can reach their maximum heights and horizontal positions at the moment of impact on the deck during flight over marine platforms for small water droplets of approximately up to 1 1 mm a uniform temperature within the droplet is found to be a reasonable approximation the temperature gradient inside the droplet is small for larger droplets because the biot number is less than 0 5 the results indicate good agreement between the predicted results and previously published data a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the effects of various parameters on the trajectory and cooling process of the droplets as well as a droplet s biot number this analysis shows that the parameters of air temperature droplet size initial droplet temperature and droplet flight time have a significant impact on the droplet cooling process although the size of marine platforms is an important factor also wind velocity plays a considerable role on the trajectory of the droplets this model is a useful and relatively simple design tool for the analysis of thermal behaviour and prediction of the cooling process of saline water droplets keywords

ocean regions as well as in the arctic is a complex engineering problem that includes heat and mass transfer phase change and multiphase flow with droplets icing phenomena have a significant effect on the performance of wind turbines overhead power lines aircraft surfaces helicopter blades marine vessels and offshore structures dehghani sanij et al 2015 gates et al 1988 there are two main types of icing processes atmospheric icing and marine or sea spray icing atmospheric icing occurs due to the freezing of precipitation such as rain snow drizzle hail and fog on marine platforms jørgensen 1982 ryerson 2011 sea spray icing or marine icing is caused from wave spray and wind spray dehghani sanij et al 2015 2016 2017a 2017b 2017c jørgensen 1985 schrøder hansen 2012 wave spray is produced due to the impact of waves on marine vessels and structures dehghani sanij et al 2015 2016 2017a 2017b 2017c kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 lozowski et al 2000 wind spray is generated by sea spray from water droplets ejected off whitecaps on the sea or the ocean surface dehghani sanij et al 2015 2016 2017a 2017b 2017c jones and andreas 2012 fig 1 illustrates the formation of sea spray from waves and wind and the movement of a spray cloud on a marine vessel jones and andreas 2009 reported that wind can generate three types of droplets through distinct mechanisms on fixed marine structures monahan et al 1983 monahan 1986 1 small film droplets ranging between 0 5 and 50 μm in radius 2 jet droplets ranging between 1 and 100 μm in radius and 3 spume droplets or spindrift ranging between 20 and 500 μm in radius according to ryerson 1995 based on empirical measurements the diameter of water droplets from 7000 droplets was between 14 and 7700 μm for 39 spray events additionally the mean median volume diameter was 1094 μm in these spray events and ranged between 169 and 6097 μm for single spray events ryerson and gow 2000a 2000b zarling 1980 investigated the heat and mass transfer from a single water droplet including convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer between the ambient air and the surface of the droplet for an ambient air temperature of 18 c and initial temperature of the droplets of 0 c the results indicated that the temperature of the droplets with diameters less than 1 mm was about 18 c and for larger diameters 4 6 mm the temperature was between 5 c and 1 c kulyakhtin and løset 2011 numerically and semi analytically studied the effects of relative humidity on seawater spray temperatures during flight the results for a constant air temperature and wind velocity displayed that by increasing the liquid water content lwc the relative humidity of the ambient air will increase additionally the variations in humidity had insignificant effects on the temperature of the water droplet moreover for lower lwc the temperature difference is directly related to the relative humidity of the ambient air yoon and ettema 1993 experimentally investigated the moving trajectories of droplets surrounding the ice formation on collector cylinders the results showed that a spherical shape of droplets is relatively accurate and the droplet drag coefficient varies at around 35 the thermal and evaporative effects of the seawater spray droplets with a radius between 0 5 μm and 500 μm were investigated by andreas 1990 the results illustrated that the relative humidity of ambient air has an insignificant impact on the thermal characteristics of sea spray droplets in addition the temperature difference between the airflow and seawater has a small effect on the evaporative process the equilibrium diameter of a water droplet was found to be about one half of the diameter at its formation for a relative humidity of 80 dehghani et al 2016a analyzed the motion trajectory of water droplets from the impingement of waves on a ship the results showed that the distributions of the size and velocity of droplets in front of the ship are the most important factors to estimate the droplet trajectories and calculate the lwc also there is an inverse dependence between the size and velocity of the water droplets such that the droplets with small sizes have high speed and vice versa in another study dehghani et al 2016b numerically investigated the distribution of sizes and velocities of water droplets upon a medium size fishing vessel mfv they illustrated that both the biggest and smallest water droplets will not reach the highest height of the sea spray cloud however the water droplets with medium sizes 2 4 3 8 mm diameters can reach the highest height this paper aims to develop a theoretical predictive model to analyze the thermal behaviour as well as predict the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets during flight over marine platforms in cold seas and ocean regions by considering a uniform temperature across the droplet as well as convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer from the droplet s surface the heat and mass transfer rates from the water droplet are investigated afterwards the predicted results are compared with past obtained data 2 droplet cooling formulation 2 1 droplet trajectory formulation to study the thermal behaviour and predict the trajectory and cooling process of the water droplets the velocity of droplets must be computed for the time period of their flight over marine platforms dehghani et al 2016b found that the water droplets with different sizes and velocities which are generated by wave impact sea spray will have various trajectories and attain various positions on marine vessels however the geometry of the vessel and the position of different objects on the deck are important several factors such as drag force droplet size wind velocity gravity and the initial droplet velocity have a significant role in the droplet s path dehghani et al 2016b dehghani sanij et al 2017d by considering the air drag and gravity forces the motion of the droplet is governed by lozowski et al 2000 1 d v d d t 3 4 c d d ρ a ρ d v d u v d u g ρ a ρ d 1 where v d is the droplet velocity with regard to the ground t is the time c d is the

determined the initial velocity of water droplets with various sizes after the droplet breakup stage at the front edge of the mfv they reported that the initial velocities for the water droplets with a diameter close to zero and a diameter of 7 mm are 60 m s and 0 respectively there is approximately a linear inverse relationship between these droplet diameters and initial velocities by combining eqs 1 3 and solving these equations using a numerical time stepping method the droplet velocity with regard to the ground can be estimated to specify the position of the pathway of water droplets during flight over marine platforms the following equations can be used 4 d 2 x d t 2 3 4 c d d ρ a ρ d d x d t u r w d x d t u r w 2 d y d t 2 5 d 2 y d t 2 g ρ a ρ d 1 3 4 c d d ρ a ρ d d y d t d x

considered evaporation heat transfer in the cooling process of the droplets but neglected the influence of evaporation on the droplet mass the mass of evaporated water from the droplets is insignificant compared to the original mass of the droplets to solve eqs 4 and 5 the initial conditions are given as follows 6 x t 0 0 7 d x d t t 0 v d 0 x v d 0 cos β 8 y t 0 0 9 d y d t t 0 v d 0 y v d 0 sin β where v d0 is the initial droplet velocity and β is the initial travel angle of the water droplets 2 2 heat transfer formulation the water droplet is cooled and supercooled due to convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer to the airstream the heat loss by convection to the ambient air can be found by lozowski et al 2000 10 q c h c t d t a 11 h c n u k a d 12 n u 2 0 0

the droplet s nusselt number and pr is the droplet s prandtl number of the airflow the parameter of pr can be computed by bergman et al 2011 13 pr μ a ρ a α a where α a is the air thermal diffusivity and μ a is the air dynamic viscosity that is defined by tracy et al 1980 14 μ a μ o t o 120 t 120 t t o 1 5 here μ o 1 8325 10 5 pa s t o 296 16 k and t t a 273 15 k in addition the parameter of ρ a can be given by tracy et al 1980 15 ρ a p 287 04 t a 273 15 where p is the atmospheric air pressure and the air temperature t a in units of c the heat loss by evaporation with the ambient air can be obtained by bergman et al 2011 16 q e h c pr s c 0 63 l v p c a e s t r h e s t a c e s t r h e s t a here sc is the droplet s schmidt number is the ratio of the molecular weight of water vapour and

air water vapour diffusivity the heat loss by long wave radiation can be calculated by 19 q r ε σ t d 4 t a 4 where ε is the droplet emissivity and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant for simplification of the above equation the radiation heat transfer coefficient of the droplet h r can be used thus 20 h r ε σ t d 2 t a 2 t d t a according to a report by zarling 1980 when the temperature differences are small the radiation heat transfer coefficient can be approximated as a constant or by using the following expression 21 h r ε σ t 0 w 2 t a 2 t 0 w t a here t 0 w is the initial temperature of the water droplet hence eq 19 can be written as follows 22 q r h r t d t a several assumptions will be used in order to simplify and solve the problem first the water droplet has a spherical shape during the entire trajectory this is a reasonable approximation for small droplet diameters gao et al 2000 mcdonald 1954 reported that droplets with small sizes 1 mm in diameter and less have a spherical shape in flight also the shape of large droplets is mostly controlled via surface tension hydrostatic pressure and external aerodynamic pressure second the initial temperature of the water droplet equals the temperature of the water s surface third the temperature within the droplet is uniform fourth the wind velocity is uniform and in the horizontal direction 2 3 cooling process hindmarsh et al 2003 reported that by assuming the uniform temperature within the droplet the obtained results illustrate a good agreement with the empirical results yao and schrock 1976 investigated the cooling of free falling droplets they considered both the temperature gradient and uniform temperature inside the droplet the results showed that considering conduction heat transfer in the model leads to longer cooling times relative to a uniform temperature furthermore the average difference between the obtained results was 11 therefore neglecting the temperature gradient within the water droplet is a reasonable assumption the droplet s biot number can confirm the accuracy of this assumption the governing equation for the cooling process of droplets by considering convection evaporation and radiation heat loss from the droplet s surface to the ambient air is given by 23 ρ b c b d v d t d d t a s q c q e q r where ρ b is the density of brine c b is the specific heat capacity of brine v d is the droplet volume and a s is the surface area of the droplet the parameters of v d and a s respectively are 24 v d 4 3 π r d 3 and 25 a s 4 π r d 2 here r d is the droplet radius the brine density ρ b can be calculated by horjen 2013 26 ρ b 1000 0 8 s b where s b is the droplet salinity kuwahara 1938 obtained an experimental formula to estimate the specific heat capacity of seawater at 0 c and atmospheric pressure that is equal to 27 c b 1 005 0 004136 s b 0 0001098 s b 2 0 000001324 s b 3 here the parameter of c b is in units of cal gr c based on a study conducted by assur 1958 forest et al 2005 found a more accurate formula between the droplet salinity s b and the freezing temperature t f for three temperature regions for the first region is 28 t f 54 1126 s b 1 s b 7 7 t f 0 c a n d 0 s b 124 7 for the second region is 29 t f 0 063 1 063 s b 0 01031 1 s b 23 t f 7 7 c a n d 124 7 s b 230 8 and for the third region is 30 s b 3 3136 10

droplets which is generated by the wave spray is only somewhat greater compared to the seawater salinity owing to evaporation horjen 1990 2013 however for very small water droplets created by wind spray as well as for long distance flight the droplet salinity is higher than the seawater surface salinity horjen 1990 2013 kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 in this study the authors considered that the droplet salinity s b equals the seawater salinity s w when the droplet diameter is equal to or greater than 0 5 mm the volume of a droplet will decrease because of evaporation so the changes in the droplet s radius r d can be obtained by sadafi et al 2014 2015 mezhericher et al 2008 31 4 π r d 2 d r d d t m v ρ b where m v is the evaporation rate from the droplet s surface to the ambient air and can be defined by horjen 2013 32 m v q e l v a s by substituting eqs 24 25 and 31 into eq 23 the equation below will be obtained 33 d t d d t 3 m v 4 π ρ b r d 3 t d 3 ρ b c b r d q c q e q r by combining eqs 10 16 22 and 31 33 the temperature within the droplet can be determined during its flight over marine platforms to consider a uniform temperature across the droplet the lumped capacitance approximation must hold this approximation can be made when the following condition is satisfied bergman et al 2011 34 b i h r d 3 k b 0 1 where h is the heat transfer coefficient bi is the droplet s biot number and k b is the thermal conductivity of brine the parameter of k b can be calculated by lange and forke 1952 pringle et al 2007 35 k b 0 523 0 013 t b here t b is the brine temperature it should be noted that the temperature variations by assuming a uniform temperature within the droplet are only a function of time 3 results and discussion problem parameters and properties for case studies are shown in table 1 in order to analyze the thermal behaviour and predict the cooling process of water droplets a matlab code version r14 was employed to solve the governing equations the theoretical results are obtained for an mfv with an overall length of 45 m following zakrzewski 1986 who reported that the overall length for mfvs is between 40 and 50 m it is assumed that a the mfv goes directly into the waves and wind so a spray cloud will form in front of the bow and also b the sea spray is not dense so water droplets do not affect each other hence the trajectory of the droplet can be employed for every droplet separately fig 2 shows the changes of the droplet velocity v d versus time at a wind velocity of 15 m s and different diameters throughout the droplet flight over the mfv as illustrated in fig 2 the smaller droplets have greater initial velocities and the bigger droplets have lower initial velocities additionally with increasing time the droplet velocity will decrease until attaining the lowest value this point is the highest height of the droplet during its flight then with increasing time the droplet velocity will increase until it reaches the terminal velocity from this figure smaller droplets will reach the terminal velocity faster compared to bigger droplets for example the droplet with a diameter of 0 5 mm will reach the terminal velocity after approximately 0 5 s whereas the water droplet with a diameter of 6 mm reaches the terminal velocity after around 5 s fig 3 shows the trajectory and position of droplets during their flight over the mfv as illustrated in fig 3 the droplets will depart in the same direction of the mfv for a very short time after formation in the front of the tip of the bow and then turn back towards the deck table 2 indicates the maximum height of the droplets during flight y m the horizontal distance from the tip of the bow up to the position of highest height x m time for the droplet to reach the maximum height t m as well as the horizontal position x n and time t n of droplets with different sizes at the moment of impact on the deck as a result from fig 3 and table 2 the droplets with sizes approximately between 1 and 3 mm can attain the maximum positions at the moment of impact on the deck also the maximum heights in the flight duration occur for droplets with diameters from 2 to 4 mm the water droplets with larger sizes drop to the deck faster because of the higher gravity force for instance the maximum height and position at the moment of impact on the deck for the droplet with a diameter of 6 mm is 1 871 m and 10 258 m respectively according to fig 2 and table 2 the droplet with a diameter of 6 mm will reach the terminal velocity after approximately 5 s whereas the time at the moment of impact on the deck is equal to 1 121 s this means that the larger droplets will fall on the deck before attaining their terminal velocity the highest height for small droplets is low fig 3 for example the maximum height of droplet with a diameter of 0 1 mm is 0 295 m as illustrated in fig 3 the maximum heights in the flight duration over the mfv occur for the water droplets with medium sizes in these sizes the droplets are not heavy enough to be affected by gravity and not fast and large enough to be stopped by the drag force also the maximum heights occur at the horizontal distance between 1 and 10 m from the tip of the bow the theoretical approach to determine the droplet pathways which are shown in fig 3 have good agreement with the results of dehghani et al 2016b fig 4 illustrates the changes of the droplet s biot number over time for different droplet diameters from this figure for conditions of t a 18 c t 0 w 2 c u 15 m s s w 34 and rh 80 when the droplet diameter is up to 1 1 mm considering a uniform temperature within the droplet is a reasonable approximation because the droplet s biot number is lower than 0 1 except at initial times when the droplet diameter is larger than 1 1 mm there is a temperature gradient inside the water droplet but it is not significant for instance for the droplet diameter of 6 mm the biot number is lower than 0 5 this means that the temperature gradient within the droplet is relatively small a biot number lower than 0 5 will likely be a reasonable approximation to assume a uniform temperature across the droplet with induced motion fig 5 shows the changes of water droplet temperature over time at different diameters until the moment of droplet impact on the deck of the mfv table 3 indicates the time that the saline water droplets with different sizes start to freeze t f and the temperature of the droplets at the moment of their impact on the deck t n note that the freezing temperature t f is equal to 1 9 c at a salinity of 34 from fig 5 and table 3 the small droplets which are smaller than 0 5 mm in diameter will freeze completely before impinging on the deck andreas 1990 reported that the temperature of the small droplets lower than 0 1 mm in diameter will attain the temperature of ambient air in under 0 1 s the large droplets which are bigger than 4 mm do not freeze before colliding on the deck for the droplets with medium sizes a part of the droplet will freeze before impacting on the deck for instance with a diameter of 3 mm the droplet temperature is equal to 4 2 c at the moment of impact on the deck this means that an ice shell will form on the surface of the droplet after the freezing temperature is reached and will grow towards the centre of the droplet fig 5 and table 2 illustrate that the droplet size and the time of droplet flight are important factors in the cooling process also another notable factor for the prediction of the cooling and freezing of water droplets in cold seas and ocean regions is the size of marine vessels it is possible that the water droplets freeze before reaching the objects on marine platforms although the different parameters such as the droplet size wind velocity vessel speed droplet salinity ambient air temperature relative humidity and the initial droplet temperature have an impact on the cooling process additionally it is possible that the water droplets pass over a vessel fig 6 displays the changes in heat loss including convection evaporation and radiation for the droplet cooling process over time at d 1 mm during flight on the mfv from this figure the effects of convection and evaporation heat transfer in the droplet cooling process are significant however the influence of convection during the cooling process is almost two times more than the magnitude of evaporation in addition the influence of radiation heat transfer in the droplet cooling process is negligible the reduction of the droplet size due to evaporation during flight is very small for example for conditions of d 1 mm t a 18 c t 0 w 2 c u 15 m s s b 34 and rh 80 the droplet diameter reduction is equal to 25 8 μm the authors compared the theoretical results with past results obtained by zarling 1980 where the droplet was freshwater and had a free fall at low air temperatures by considering s b 0 t a 18 c t 0 w 0 c u 0 m s and different droplet diameters the results are examined and evaluated table 4 shows and compares the droplet velocity v d the droplet s reynolds number re and the droplet s drag coefficient c d at various diameters of the water droplet for the present model and the obtained results by zarling 1980 as can be seen from this table the difference between the results is small the temperature of the water droplet at various diameters for three different conditions is illustrated in fig 7 there is good agreement between the predicted results and past obtained results by zarling 1980 additionally when the droplet diameters are very small the droplet temperature is close to the ambient air temperature whereas for large water droplets the temperature is higher for example when the diameter is more than 3 mm the droplet temperature is greater than 5 c fig 7 it should be noted that a difference between the results may be due to the predicted radiation heat loss decrease in the size of the droplet due to evaporation and or the use of different formulae to obtain parameters and properties 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the effects of the various parameters on the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets as well as the droplets biot number during each study the authors considered that one parameter is variable whereas the other parameters are kept constant a droplet diameter of 1 mm is selected for the sensitivity analysis because a its biot number is less than 0 1 during flight except at initial times so a uniform temperature inside the droplet is a reasonable approximation and b the droplet with this size can more likely retain its spherical shape during flight horjen and vefsnmo 1985 reported that waves can be generated and impacted by marine platforms when the wind velocity increases more than 9 m s fig 8 shows the changes in the position and velocity of the droplet at d 1 mm for different wind velocities during flight over the mfv as a result by increasing the wind velocity the droplet velocity and drag force will increase so the maximum height of droplet flight will decrease but the horizontal position of the droplet at the moment of impact on the deck will increase table 5 as illustrated in fig 8 and table 5 for a wind velocity equal to 25 m s the droplet passes over the mfv because x n is equal to 51 6 m thus wind velocity plays an important role in the droplet trajectories fig 9 indicates the influence of wind velocity and droplet salinity on the cooling process and the droplet s biot number as illustrated from this figure wind velocity and salinity have a slight impact on the cooling process and the biot number the influence of the initial temperature of the water droplet and the relative humidity on the cooling process as well as the biot number is shown in fig 10 from this figure the initial droplet temperature has a substantial impact on the cooling process however this parameter has an insignificant impact on the biot number the effect of relative humidity on the cooling process is small and the effect of this parameter on the biot number is negligible fig 11 illustrates the influence of ambient air temperature on the cooling process and the droplet s biot number in this figure the ambient air temperature has a significant impact on the cooling process although the effect of this parameter on the biot number is negligible as a general result the parameters of the droplet size ambient air temperature and initial droplet temperature have a significant impact on the cooling process during droplet flight 5 conclusions a theoretical predictive model has been developed to analyze the thermal behaviour and predict the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets during flight over the mfv in cold seas and ocean regions the predictive model considers 1 a uniform temperature across the droplet and 2 convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer from the droplet s surface to the ambient air the results illustrate that the water droplets with medium sizes can attain the maximum heights and positions at the moment of impact on the deck in the flight duration over the mfv additionally for small water droplets about 1 1 mm the assumption of a uniform temperature inside the droplet is a reasonable approximation however the temperature gradient within the droplet is small for bigger droplets because the biot number is lower than 0 5 the results provide good agreement between the predicted results and previously published results the sensitivity analysis shows that wind velocity has a significant impact on the droplet trajectories in addition the droplet size initial droplet temperature air temperature and the droplet flight time have a considerable effect on the droplet cooling process although the size of marine platforms is an important factor the theoretical prediction shows that the assumption of a single droplet for estimation of the amount of ice accumulation on marine platforms is inaccurate because the water droplets have different trajectories and cooling processes the distribution of the droplets must be considered this theoretical model can provide a reasonable method for analyzing heat and mass transfer rates from saline water droplets and for predicting their trajectory and cooling process during flight over marine platforms to further improve the predictive model further research is needed particularly for the cooling and freezing processes of the

and the movement of a spray cloud on a marine vessel jones and andreas 2009 reported that wind can generate three types of droplets through distinct mechanisms on fixed marine structures monahan et al 1983 monahan 1986 1 small film droplets ranging between 0 5 and 50 μm in radius 2 jet droplets ranging between 1 and 100 μm in radius and 3 spume droplets or spindrift ranging between 20 and 500 μm in radius according to ryerson 1995 based on empirical measurements the diameter of water droplets from 7000 droplets was between 14 and 7700 μm for 39 spray events additionally the mean median volume diameter was 1094 μm in these spray events and ranged between 169 and 6097 μm for single spray events ryerson and gow 2000a 2000b zarling 1980 investigated the heat and mass transfer from a single water droplet including convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer between the ambient air and the surface of the droplet for an ambient air temperature of 18 c and initial temperature of the droplets of 0 c the results indicated that the temperature of the droplets with diameters less than 1 mm was about 18 c and for larger diameters 4 6 mm the temperature was between 5 c and 1 c kulyakhtin and løset 2011 numerically and semi analytically studied the effects of relative humidity on seawater spray temperatures during flight the results for a constant air temperature and wind velocity displayed that by increasing the liquid water content lwc the relative humidity of the ambient air will increase additionally the variations in humidity had insignificant effects on the temperature of the water droplet moreover for lower lwc the temperature difference is directly related to the relative humidity of the ambient air yoon and ettema 1993 experimentally investigated the moving trajectories of droplets surrounding the ice formation on collector cylinders the results showed that a spherical shape of droplets is relatively accurate and the droplet drag coefficient varies at around 35 the thermal and evaporative effects of the seawater spray droplets with a radius between 0 5 μm and 500 μm were investigated by andreas 1990 the results illustrated that the relative humidity of ambient air has an insignificant impact on the thermal characteristics of sea spray droplets in addition the temperature difference between the airflow and seawater has a small effect on the evaporative process the equilibrium diameter of a water droplet was found to be about one half of the diameter at its formation for a relative humidity of 80 dehghani et al 2016a analyzed the motion trajectory of water droplets from the impingement of waves on a ship the results showed that the distributions of the size and velocity of droplets in front of the ship are the most important factors to estimate the droplet trajectories and calculate the lwc also there is an inverse dependence between the size and velocity of the water droplets such that the droplets with small sizes have high speed and vice versa in another study dehghani et al 2016b numerically investigated the distribution of sizes and velocities of water droplets upon a medium size fishing vessel mfv they illustrated that both the biggest and smallest water droplets will not reach the highest height of the sea spray cloud however the water droplets with medium sizes 2 4 3 8 mm diameters can reach the highest height this paper aims to develop a theoretical predictive model to analyze the thermal behaviour as well as predict the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets during flight over marine platforms in cold seas and ocean regions by considering a uniform temperature across the droplet as well as convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer from the droplet s surface the heat and mass transfer rates from the water droplet are investigated afterwards the predicted results are compared with past obtained data 2 droplet cooling formulation 2 1 droplet trajectory formulation to study the thermal behaviour and predict the trajectory and cooling process of the water droplets the velocity of droplets must be computed for the time period of their flight over marine platforms dehghani et al 2016b found that the water droplets with different sizes and velocities which are generated by wave impact sea spray will have various trajectories and attain various positions on marine vessels however the geometry of the vessel and the position of different objects on the deck are important several factors such as drag force droplet size wind velocity gravity and the initial droplet velocity have a significant role in the droplet s path dehghani et al 2016b dehghani sanij et al 2017d by considering the air drag and gravity forces the motion of the droplet is governed by lozowski et al 2000 1 d v d d t 3 4 c d d ρ a ρ d v d u v d u g ρ a ρ d 1 where v d is the droplet velocity with regard to the ground t is the time c d is the

determined the initial velocity of water droplets with various sizes after the droplet breakup stage at the front edge of the mfv they reported that the initial velocities for the water droplets with a diameter close to zero and a diameter of 7 mm are 60 m s and 0 respectively there is approximately a linear inverse relationship between these droplet diameters and initial velocities by combining eqs 1 3 and solving these equations using a numerical time stepping method the droplet velocity with regard to the ground can be estimated to specify the position of the pathway of water droplets during flight over marine platforms the following equations can be used 4 d 2 x d t 2 3 4 c d d ρ a ρ d d x d t u r w d x d t u r w 2 d y d t 2 5 d 2 y d t 2 g ρ a ρ d 1 3 4 c d d ρ a ρ d d y d t d x

considered evaporation heat transfer in the cooling process of the droplets but neglected the influence of evaporation on the droplet mass the mass of evaporated water from the droplets is insignificant compared to the original mass of the droplets to solve eqs 4 and 5 the initial conditions are given as follows 6 x t 0 0 7 d x d t t 0 v d 0 x v d 0 cos β 8 y t 0 0 9 d y d t t 0 v d 0 y

convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer to the airstream the heat loss by convection to the ambient air can be found by lozowski et al 2000 10 q c h c t d t a 11 h c n u k a d 12 n u 2 0 0

simplification of the above equation the radiation heat transfer coefficient of the droplet h r can be used thus 20 h r ε σ t d 2 t a 2 t d t a according to a report by zarling 1980 when the temperature differences are small the radiation heat transfer coefficient can be approximated as a constant or by using the following expression 21 h r ε σ t 0 w 2 t a 2 t 0 w t a here t 0 w is the initial temperature of the water droplet hence eq 19 can be written as follows 22 q r h r t d t a several assumptions will be used in order to simplify and solve the problem first the water droplet has a spherical shape during the entire trajectory this is a reasonable approximation for small droplet diameters gao et al 2000 mcdonald 1954 reported that droplets with small sizes 1 mm in diameter and less have a spherical shape in flight also the shape of large droplets is mostly controlled via surface tension hydrostatic pressure and external aerodynamic pressure second the initial temperature of the water droplet equals the temperature of the water s surface third the temperature within the droplet is uniform fourth the wind velocity is uniform and in the horizontal direction 2 3 cooling process hindmarsh et al 2003 reported that by assuming the uniform temperature within the droplet the obtained results illustrate a good agreement with the empirical results yao and schrock 1976 investigated the cooling of free falling droplets they considered both the temperature gradient and uniform temperature inside the droplet the results showed that considering conduction heat transfer in the model leads to longer cooling times relative to a uniform temperature furthermore the average difference between the obtained results was 11 therefore neglecting the temperature gradient within the water droplet is a reasonable assumption the droplet s biot number can confirm the accuracy of this assumption the governing equation for the cooling process of droplets by considering convection evaporation and radiation heat loss from the droplet s surface to the ambient air is given by 23 ρ b c b d v d t d d t a s q c q e q r where ρ b is the density of brine c b is the specific heat capacity of brine v d is the droplet volume and a s is the surface area of the droplet the parameters of v d and a s respectively are 24 v d 4 3 π r d 3 and 25 a s 4 π r d 2 here r d is the droplet radius the brine density ρ b can be calculated by horjen 2013 26 ρ b 1000 0 8 s b where s b is the droplet salinity kuwahara 1938 obtained an experimental formula to estimate the

droplets which is generated by the wave spray is only somewhat greater compared to the seawater salinity owing to evaporation horjen 1990 2013 however for very small water droplets created by wind spray as well as for long distance flight the droplet salinity is higher than the seawater surface salinity horjen 1990 2013 kulyakhtin and tsarau 2014 in this study the authors considered that the droplet salinity s b equals the seawater salinity s w when the droplet diameter is equal to or greater than 0 5 mm the volume of a droplet will decrease because of evaporation so the changes in the droplet s radius r d can be obtained by sadafi et al 2014 2015 mezhericher et al 2008 31 4 π r d 2 d r d d t m v ρ b where m v is the evaporation rate from the droplet s surface to the ambient air and can be defined by horjen 2013 32 m v q e l v a s by substituting eqs 24 25 and 31 into eq 23 the equation below will be obtained 33 d t d d t 3 m v 4 π ρ b r d 3 t d 3 ρ b c b r d q c q e q r by combining eqs 10 16 22 and 31 33 the temperature within the droplet can be determined during its flight over marine platforms to consider a uniform temperature across the droplet the lumped capacitance approximation must hold this approximation can be made when the following condition is satisfied bergman et al 2011 34 b i h r d 3 k b 0 1 where h is the heat transfer coefficient bi is the droplet s biot number and k b is the thermal conductivity of brine the parameter of k b can be calculated by lange and forke 1952 pringle et al 2007 35 k b 0 523 0 013 t b here t b is the brine temperature it should be noted that the temperature variations by assuming a uniform temperature within the droplet are only a function of time 3 results and discussion problem parameters and properties for case studies are shown in table 1 in order to analyze the thermal behaviour and predict the cooling process of water droplets a matlab code version r14 was employed to solve the governing equations the theoretical results are obtained for an mfv with an overall length of 45 m following zakrzewski 1986 who reported that the overall length for mfvs is between 40 and 50 m it is assumed that a the mfv goes directly into the waves and wind so a spray cloud will form in front of the bow and also b the sea spray is not dense so water droplets do not affect each other hence the trajectory of the droplet can be employed for every droplet separately fig 2 shows the changes of the droplet velocity v d versus time at a wind velocity of 15 m s and different diameters throughout the droplet flight over the mfv as illustrated in fig 2 the smaller droplets have greater initial velocities and the bigger droplets have lower initial velocities additionally with increasing time the droplet velocity will decrease until attaining the lowest value this point is the highest height of the droplet during its flight then with increasing time the droplet velocity will increase until it reaches the terminal velocity from this figure smaller droplets will reach the terminal velocity faster compared to bigger droplets for example the droplet with a diameter of 0 5 mm will reach the terminal velocity after approximately 0 5 s whereas the water droplet with a diameter of 6 mm reaches the terminal velocity after around 5 s fig 3 shows the trajectory and position of droplets during their flight over the mfv as illustrated in fig 3 the droplets will depart in the same direction of the mfv for a very short time after formation in the front of the tip of the bow and then turn back towards the deck table 2 indicates the maximum height of the droplets during flight y m the horizontal distance from the tip of the bow up to the position of highest height x m time for the droplet to reach the maximum height t m as well as the horizontal position x n and time t n of droplets with different sizes at the moment of impact on the deck as a result from fig 3 and table 2 the droplets with sizes approximately between 1 and 3 mm can attain the maximum positions at the moment of impact on the deck also the maximum heights in the flight duration occur for droplets with diameters from 2 to 4 mm the water droplets with larger sizes drop to the deck faster because of the higher gravity force for instance the maximum height and position at the moment of impact on the deck for the droplet with a diameter of 6 mm is 1 871 m and 10 258 m respectively according to fig 2 and table 2 the droplet with a diameter of 6 mm will reach the terminal velocity after approximately 5 s whereas the time at the moment of impact on the deck is equal to 1 121 s this means that the larger droplets will fall on the deck before attaining their terminal velocity the highest height for small droplets is low fig 3 for example the maximum height of droplet with a diameter of 0 1 mm is 0 295 m as illustrated in fig 3 the maximum heights in the flight duration over the mfv occur for the water droplets with medium sizes in these sizes the droplets are not heavy enough to be affected by gravity and not fast and large enough to be stopped by the drag force also the maximum heights occur at the horizontal distance between 1 and 10 m from the tip of the bow the theoretical approach to determine the droplet pathways which are shown in fig 3 have good agreement with the results of dehghani et al 2016b fig 4 illustrates the changes of the droplet s biot number over time for different droplet diameters from this figure for conditions of t a 18 c t 0 w 2 c u 15 m s s w 34 and rh 80 when the droplet diameter is up to 1 1 mm considering a uniform temperature within the droplet is a reasonable approximation because the droplet s biot number is lower than 0 1 except at initial times when the droplet diameter is larger than 1 1 mm there is a temperature gradient inside the water droplet but it is not significant for instance for the droplet diameter of 6 mm the biot number is lower than 0 5 this means that the temperature gradient within the droplet is relatively small a biot number lower than 0 5 will likely be a reasonable approximation to assume a uniform temperature across the droplet with induced motion fig 5 shows the changes of water droplet temperature over time at different diameters until the moment of droplet impact on the deck of the mfv table 3 indicates the time that the saline water droplets with different sizes start to freeze t f and the temperature of the droplets at the moment of their impact on the deck t n note that the freezing temperature t f is equal to 1 9 c at a salinity of 34 from fig 5 and table 3 the small droplets which are smaller than 0 5 mm in diameter will freeze completely before impinging on the deck andreas 1990 reported that the temperature of the small droplets lower than 0 1 mm in diameter will attain the temperature of ambient air in under 0 1 s the large droplets which are bigger than 4 mm do not freeze before colliding on the deck for the droplets with medium sizes a part of the droplet will freeze before impacting on the deck for instance with a diameter of 3 mm the droplet temperature is equal to 4 2 c at the moment of impact on the deck this means that an ice shell will form on the surface of the droplet after the freezing temperature is reached and will grow towards the centre of the droplet fig 5 and table 2 illustrate that the droplet size and the time of droplet flight are important factors in the cooling process also another notable factor for the prediction of the cooling and freezing of water droplets in cold seas and ocean regions is the size of marine vessels it is possible that the water droplets freeze before reaching the objects on marine platforms although the different parameters such as the droplet size wind velocity vessel speed droplet salinity ambient air temperature relative humidity and the initial droplet temperature have an impact on the cooling process additionally it is possible that the water droplets pass over a vessel fig 6 displays the changes in heat loss including convection evaporation and radiation for the droplet cooling process over time at d 1 mm during flight on the mfv from this figure the effects of convection and evaporation heat transfer in the droplet cooling process are significant however the influence of convection during the cooling process is almost two times more than the magnitude of evaporation in addition the influence of radiation heat transfer in the droplet cooling process is negligible the reduction of the droplet size due to evaporation during flight is very small for example for conditions of d 1 mm t a 18 c t 0 w 2 c u 15 m s s b 34 and rh 80 the droplet diameter reduction is equal to 25 8 μm the authors compared the theoretical results with past results obtained by zarling 1980 where the droplet was freshwater and had a free fall at low air temperatures by considering s b 0 t a 18 c t 0 w 0 c u 0 m s and different droplet diameters the results are examined and evaluated table 4 shows and compares the droplet velocity v d the droplet s reynolds number re and the droplet s drag coefficient c d at various diameters of the water droplet for the present model and the obtained results by zarling 1980 as can be seen from this table the difference between the results is small the temperature of the water droplet at various diameters for three different conditions is illustrated in fig 7 there is good agreement between the predicted results and past obtained results by zarling 1980 additionally when the droplet diameters are very small the droplet temperature is close to the ambient air temperature whereas for large water droplets the temperature is higher for example when the diameter is more than 3 mm the droplet temperature is greater than 5 c fig 7 it should be noted that a difference between the results may be due to the predicted radiation heat loss decrease in the size of the droplet due to evaporation and or the use of different formulae to obtain parameters and properties 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the effects of the various parameters on the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets as well as the droplets biot number during each study the authors considered that one parameter is variable whereas the other parameters are kept constant a droplet diameter of 1 mm is selected for the sensitivity analysis because a its biot number is less than 0 1 during flight except at initial times so a uniform temperature inside the droplet is a reasonable approximation and b the droplet with this size can more likely retain its spherical shape during flight horjen and vefsnmo 1985 reported that waves can be generated and impacted by marine platforms when the wind velocity increases more than 9 m s fig 8 shows the changes in the position and velocity of the droplet at d 1 mm for different wind velocities during flight over the mfv as a result by increasing the wind velocity the droplet velocity and drag force will increase so the maximum height of droplet flight will decrease but the horizontal position of the droplet at the moment of impact on the deck will increase table 5 as illustrated in fig 8 and table 5 for a wind velocity equal to 25 m s the droplet passes over the mfv because x n is equal to 51 6 m thus wind velocity plays an important role in the droplet trajectories fig 9 indicates the influence of wind velocity and droplet salinity on the cooling process and the droplet s biot number as illustrated from this figure wind velocity and salinity have a slight impact on the cooling process and the biot number the influence of the initial temperature of the water droplet and the relative humidity on the cooling process as well as the biot number is shown in fig 10 from this figure the initial droplet temperature has a substantial impact on the cooling process however this parameter has an insignificant impact on the biot number the effect of relative humidity on the cooling process is small and the effect of this parameter on the biot number is negligible fig 11 illustrates the influence of ambient air temperature on the cooling process and the droplet s biot number in this figure the ambient air temperature has a significant impact on the cooling process although the effect of this parameter on the biot number is negligible as a general result the parameters of the droplet size ambient air temperature and initial droplet temperature have a significant impact on the cooling process during droplet flight 5 conclusions a theoretical predictive model has been developed to analyze the thermal behaviour and predict the trajectory and cooling process of saline water droplets during flight over the mfv in cold seas and ocean regions the predictive model considers 1 a uniform temperature across the droplet and 2 convection evaporation and radiation heat transfer from the droplet s surface to the ambient air the results illustrate that the water droplets with medium sizes can attain the maximum heights and positions at the moment of impact on the deck in the flight duration over the mfv additionally for small water droplets about 1 1 mm the assumption of a uniform temperature inside the droplet is a reasonable approximation however the temperature gradient within the droplet is small for bigger droplets because the biot number is lower than 0 5 the results provide good agreement between the predicted results and previously published results the sensitivity analysis shows that wind velocity has a significant impact on the droplet trajectories in addition the droplet size initial droplet temperature air temperature and the droplet flight time have a considerable effect on the droplet cooling process although the size of marine platforms is an important factor the theoretical prediction shows that the assumption of a single droplet for estimation of the amount of ice accumulation on marine platforms is inaccurate because the water droplets have different trajectories and cooling processes the distribution of the droplets must be considered this theoretical model can provide a reasonable method for analyzing heat and mass transfer rates from saline water droplets and for predicting their trajectory and cooling process during flight over marine platforms to further improve the predictive model further research is needed particularly for the cooling and freezing processes of the droplets in cold weather conditions including temperature gradients inside the droplet acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support received for this research from statoil

shanghai jiao tong university shanghai 200240 china state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university shanghai 200240 china vortex induced vibration viv of flexible risers under unsteady flows is receiving increasing attention over the recent years in this paper an alternative time domain force decomposition model for flexible risers is proposed to predict viv response under both steady and oscillatory flows non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is deemed as lock in region when lock in occurs the riser will be synchronized onto its own natural frequency closest to the non dimensional frequency of 0 17 the hydrodynamic forces are time varying and will be updated at each time step according to the riser s response amplitude and frequency firstly the adopted lock in region is verified well for uniform and sheared flow cases next the same numerical model is also validated against experimental measurements when expanding to oscillatory flow conditions viv response with different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities presents quite individual features which can be reasonably explained from the viv mechanism level then the comparisons of viv response between uniform and oscillatory flows are discussed and analyzed in essence finally another large scale riser is simulated under the designed oscillatory flows and some new conclusions different from the small scale risers are obtained keywords vortex induced vibration flexible risers time domain steady flow oscillatory flow 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of flexible risers in marine environment is a complicated fluid structure interaction problem when ocean current flows through vortex would shed periodically around the riser making the riser subjected to hydrodynamic forces due to the vortex shedding the excitation force oscillates with a frequency f s s t v d called strouhal frequency where d is the riser diameter and v is the current velocity for a flexible riser it will vibrate as a result of the oscillatory hydrodynamic forces then disturb the surrounding flow and corresponding hydrodynamic forces the most significant effect is that the vortex shedding may synchronize with the riser s motion such that the frequency of the excitation force deviates from the expected strouhal frequency consequently the response amplitude would enlarge obviously causing severe fatigue damage even structural failure therefore it is imperative to make lots of efforts to broaden the understanding of viv as there is still no well accepted analytic method to solve the motion governing equations of viscous flow experiments are the most effective source of the new insight of viv mechanism temporarily typical laboratory experiments can be classified into free vibration of elastically mounted rigid cylinders song et al 2016 and cylinder forced motions gopalkrishnan 1993 experiments with relatively long flexible structures were also performed both under controlled simulation conditions trim and braaten 2005 and in field environments vandiver et al 2006 these representative experiments are mainly in the view of steady flow situations however in the real marine environment the subjected relative current velocity of the risers will generally be unsteady either due to the wave induced motion of top end structures or the oscillations of incoming flow itself viv experiments under oscillatory flows had also been studied by several researchers for both rigid risers sumer and fredsøe 1988 and flexible ones fu et al 2014 it turned out that viv for risers under oscillatory flows presents more complicated features compared to steady flow situations there has been a sizable number of available methods to predict viv response of slender structures which can be divided into frequency domain and time domain approaches the semi empirical models such as shear7 vandiver and li 2005 and vivana larsen et al 2009 are the most recognized frequency domain prediction tools their prediction accuracy has been validated over the past decade however frequency domain approaches cannot take unsteady flow moving boundary conditions interaction between different response frequencies and nonlinear structural behaviors into account therefore time domain analysis is more considerable and applicable to a wider range of objects as well as conditions cfd methods are potential and able to simulate different flow and boundary conditions but generally complex and computationally demanding wake oscillator model usually uses a van der pol oscillator to describe the wake it was used by chang and isherwood 2003 to predict a riser s viv under the unsteady flow generated by the platform heave motion but like most wake oscillator models how to find a set of controlled parameters such that the model can satisfy with diverse tests is still a difficult problem semi empirical models have received increasing focus in the past years based on different forced vibration test data sidarta et al 2010 ma and qiu 2012 xue et al 2015 and yuan et al 2017 successively developed several viv time domain models liao 2001 developed a numerical method with reduced damping and wave propagation parameter to predict viv of slender structures under unsteady flow resvanis 2014 recommended a non dimensional parameter which can be used to determine whether the response under unsteady flow will be similar with that under steady flow when it comes to the test validation for unsteady flow cases of numerical model to the knowledge of the authors it seems only thorsen et al 2016 2017 developed a time domain semi empirical approach and compared their numerical results with the test measurements of a ttr and an scr under oscillatory flows therefore such a research issue involved in this paper is still in its infancy at present viv hydrodynamic force coefficients are the kernel of semi empirical models the formulations of the coefficients include no restriction on the time variability of the incoming current velocity for an unsteady flow it can be thought meeting steady flow condition during each tiny time interval that means the existing hydrodynamic force coefficient databases available for steady flow cases should be theoretically applicable under unsteady flow situations as long as the calculated time increment is short enough in this paper an alternative force decomposition model of viv for flexible risers is proposed to predict the structural response under steady and oscillatory flows all the associated hydrodynamic force coefficients originate from forced vibration experimental data gopalkrishnan 1993 the most important component is applying existing hydrodynamic force coefficient database to unsteady flow cases another novel attempts are improving hydrodynamic force formulation and adopting new lock in region making them perform well under oscillatory flows no longer just applicable for steady flow cases in the previous researches moreover the proposed numerical model is validated well against laboratory experiments under uniform sheared and oscillatory flows respectively this paper is structured as follows section 2 is the description of the proposed numerical model and analysis methodology in section 3 the experiments by song et al 2016 and lie and kaasen 2006 are used for comparisons to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model for steady flow cases in section 4 by comparing with the experiments in fu et al 2014 the same numerical model is proved compatible for oscillatory flow situations the different viv features between uniform and oscillatory flows are analyzed in section 5 and the reasonable explanations for all the interesting response characteristics are given as well two designed oscillatory flow cases of the large scale riser model in trim and braaten 2005 are simulated in section 6 for the further investigation on viv response under oscillatory flow finally the main conclusions are drawn in section 7 it is worth mentioning that the main contributions of this paper are not developing an original approach but improving the existing viv semi empirical model to handle more realistic and complicated unsteady e g oscillatory flow cases explaining the time varying response characteristics under oscillatory flow with the viv mechanism and revealing the universal features of viv under oscillatory flow for a relatively large scale riser 2 numerical model and analysis methodology the proposed force decomposition model originates from wang et al 2013 and xue et al 2015 nevertheless this paper improves the hydrodynamic force formulation and updates the lock in region making the present numerical model applicable for more extensive including unsteady flow cases a large aspect ratio of length to diameter is a universal feature of flexible risers thus the riser can be considered as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation for the riser in the cross flow direction could be expressed as eq 1 in the cartesian coordinate system where x axis is parallel with current velocity y axis is perpendicular to the incoming flow direction and z axis is along the riser s axial direction 1 m π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 c s f r t c f a f r t y t e i 4 y z 4 z t a z t y z f a f r t y where m is the mass per unit length of the riser c a is the added mass coefficient which is generally assumed as a constant e g 1 0 in this paper ρ f is the fluid density c s and c f are the structural and hydrodynamic damping coefficients a is the non dimensional response amplitude to riser s diameter d respectively f r is the non dimensional frequency equal to f d v f is the response frequency e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia t a is the effective axial tension f y is the viv excitation force the viv excitation force f y is in phase with the riser s velocity and depends on the response amplitude vibration frequency and current velocity assuming that the excitation force acting on riser element follows sinusoidal rule in one period it could be expressed as eq 2 2 f y 1 2 c v a f r t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t where c v is the excitation force coefficient and v is the instantaneous current velocity compared with the existing viv semi empirical models eq 2 replaces v 2 with v t v t to take the time varying velocity and direction of unsteady flow into account 2 1 excitation force model to obtain the excitation force coefficient c v a function of non dimensional amplitude and frequency based on forced vibration experimental data is proposed gopalkrishnan 1993 carried out a series of cylinder forced vibration tests in mit towing tank and gave the contour of viv excitation force coefficient this database has been well verified and used by several relatively mature frequency domain software like shear7 and vivana but only limited to steady flow cases before this paper fig 1 is the contour of viv excitation force coefficient in phase with velocity gopalkrishnan 1993 where the thick line marks the important boundary corresponding to c v 0 the non dimensional frequency of viv excitation center is approximately 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient note that when c v is negative the excitation force is deemed to transfer into hydrodynamic damping which will be described in detail as follows strouhal number of this series of forced vibration experiments is 0 193 2 2 damping model the total damping considered in the proposed viv model consists of structural damping and hydrodynamic damping the structural damping coefficient c s is typically expressed in eq 3 3 c s 4 π m f ξ where ξ is the structural damping ratio hydrodynamic damping is an active subject in viv research when c v is positive the excitation force will synchronize to the riser s velocity and the power will be transferred from fluid to the riser however if c v is negative the power will be transferred from the riser back to fluid and hydrodynamic damping will work the hydrodynamic damping coefficient can be calculated in eq 4 4 c f c v ρ f v 2 d 4 π a f if the non dimensional frequency is outside the experimental data range an empirical damping model by venugopal 1996 is used to simulate viv hydrodynamic damping venugopal 1996 synthesized a broad variety of experimental evidence and recommended the following empirical model made up of high and low non dimensional frequency regions damping in high non dimensional frequency region is expressed in eq 5 5 c f c h f ρ f d v c s w where c hf is an empirical coefficient c s w is the still water damping given by eq 6 6 c s w π 2 ρ f d 2 f 2 1 π d 2 f v c s w a d 2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid c sw is another empirical coefficient damping in low non dimensional frequency region is expressed in eq 7 7 c f c l f ρ f v 2 2 π f where c lf is also an empirical coefficient the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 by validating against experimental measurements this nonlinear hydrodynamic damping model is proved able to handle the damping affected by the contributing factors such as actual response amplitude vibration frequency cross section properties and local current velocity under both steady and oscillatory flows 2 3 lock in judgment criterion response amplitude a and frequency f of the riser elements are the most crucial factors to calculate hydrodynamic forces so at each time step the displacement u as well as velocity v of nodes and time t should be extracted to calculate the real time a and f for every riser element a and f are calculated in eq 8 which could also be described by fig 2 8 a u b u a 2 f 1 2 t b t a where u a u b t a t b are the displacement and time corresponding to the adjacent two time points a and b with v 0 the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is determined as lock in region which should be corrected for the difference of strouhal number between the actual and test circumstances by eq 9 9 f r s t t e s t f r s t a c t u a l compared with the lock in region of 0 125 0 2 which is adopted by the existing semi empirical models 0 125 0 25 is based on the recently published experimental research by zheng 2014 the validation against experiments in section 3 also indicates that the updated lock in region of 0 125 0 25 shows better performance in predicting viv response if the non dimensional response frequency locates within the excitation bandwidth lock in occurs the riser element will be synchronized onto the structural natural frequency closest to the non dimensional frequency of 0 17 and 0 17 here also needs to be corrected by eq 9 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient when implementing the proposed numerical procedure this paper adopts the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 to ensure that the excitation force is actually in phase with the local velocity of the riser as a regulator system the control loop consists of a phase error detector and a second order tracker the phase error detector monitors the phase difference between a reference signal and the real time oscillation phase of the excitation force the reference signal is calculated by prony s algorithm and able to be switched according to the real time lock in state such a pre differentiated and post integrated regulator works as an effective tracking system similar with the phase locked loops pll used in electronic equipment the phase difference between the local velocity of the riser and the excitation force acts as a step input function of the control system and it will be gradually adjusted down to zero over a period of time the adjusting time steps can be modified by tuning the parameters of the tracking algorithm such that a smooth transition of the excitation force can be achieved then the pll remains active to keep the phase difference equal to zero if the non dimensional response frequency is outside the excitation bandwidth the dominant frequency is regarded equal to the response frequency a negative excitation force coefficient will be calculated according to fig 1 and then the hydrodynamic damping coefficient can be obtained by eq 4 outside the experimental data the empirical damping model mentioned in section 2 2 will be adopted 2 4 structural response solution for the structure modelling eq 1 is discretized in space by finite element method fem the flexible riser is uniformly discretized along the axial direction into a large amount of elements the element number is controlled more than 150 which has been checked to be sufficient i e more elements cause no difference on the predicted results the proposed time domain numerical model is based on direct integration dynamic analysis eq 1 is solved with the hilber hughes taylor hht method which is a one step implicit method that has been used successfully in the classical mechanical simulations hilber et al 1977 eq 10 shows how the positions and velocities are updated at each time step and the time discrete momentum equation is expressed as eq 11 10 u t δ t u t δ t u t δ t 2 1 2 β u t 2 β u t δ t 2 u t δ t u t δ t 1 γ u t γ u t δ t 11 r t α δ t f t δ t e x t m u t δ t c u t α δ t f i n t u t α δ t u t α δ t 1 α u t α u t δ t u t α δ t 1 α u t α u t δ t where f ext and f int are the external and internal forces in the whole system r is the force residuals when α 1 3 0 β 1 α 2 4 and γ 1 2 α 2 hht method is unconditionally stable automatic convergence checks are applied to the force residuals with standard parameters α 0 05 the stable time increment is selected as 0 002 f max where f max is the maximum expected fundamental frequency there is at least 500 steps during each vibration period of the riser which has been found to be sufficient i e reducing the time increment gives no change in the predicted results to better demonstrate the proposed model the time domain analysis flow chart is shown in fig 3 associated with eq 8 and fig 2 hydrodynamic force coefficients are updated every half oscillation period according to the calculated real time response amplitude and frequency during each time step hydrodynamic forces will be updated by eq 2 before structural response calculation 3 validation against experiments under steady flows in this section two series of experiments are simulated to verify the proposed model for steady flow cases one is a small scale tensioned riser under uniform flow song et al 2016 and the other is a relatively long tensioned riser under linearly sheared flow lie and kaasen 2006 the key parameters of above two riser models are listed in table 1 3 1 uniform flow case the uniform flow experiment published by song et al 2016 was performed in the towing tank of shanghai shipping science institute with dimensions of 192 m 10 m 4 2 m length width depth a 7 9 m long riser model was horizontally installed on a towing carriage at a water depth of 1 5 m and uniform current was simulated by towing the riser at a constant speed 38 fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were instrumented symmetrically on the surface of the riser model in cf plane cf strain response history of 19 monitor points can be captured throughout the process all the strain signals were synchronously acquired at a rate of 125 hz fig 4 is a schematic of the test apparatus the case with current velocity of 1 6 m s is chosen to be predicted as an example the distributions of viv rms displacement a rms d along the riser are shown in fig 5 the proposed model predicts the same main excited mode and approximate amplitude with the experimental data at the two ends of the riser the predicted amplitude is larger than the test result the possible reason is that the structural natural frequency closest to non dimensional frequency of 0 17 is chosen as the dominant frequency which may lead to a little overestimated excitation force fig 5 also gives the prediction results under the other dominant frequencies if non dimensional dominant frequency f r d o m is simply equal to 0 16 and 0 18 the predicted amplitude at the two ends of the riser becomes smaller than the middle and the vibration shape seems more similar with the test observation but more importantly the magnitude of response amplitude along the whole riser is so much smaller than the test result that the prediction accuracy turns unacceptable overall the predicted result with f r d o m equal to the non dimensional natural frequency closest to 0 17 shows better agreement with the test result especially at the middle of the riser the slight underestimate of the proposed model at the middle of the riser is probably due to the prediction error of dominant frequency in fig 6 if assuming the test response frequency is known before running the simulation and taking the test measurement of 9 08 hz as dominant frequency the prediction result presents better consistency with the test observation at the middle of the riser as shown by the green dashed line in fig 5 fig 6 are the time histories and frequency spectra of viv strain at the midpoint z 3 95 m for the riser the predicted response displacement presents typical periodicity with a sinusoidal shape and constant vibration amplitude which are consistent with the test data the reasonable similarity can also be found between the predicted and test frequency spectra from the prediction result a single frequency of 8 94 hz corresponding to the third natural frequency of the riser is excited the deviation of the predicted value from the test data 9 08 hz is in an acceptable range 3 2 sheared flow case large scale model test of a tensioned steel riser in well defined sheared current was performed at hanøytangen outside bergen on the west coast of norway in 1997 the detailed description can be found in lie and kaasen 2006 the test site was a 180 m long floating quay at 97 m depth the length of the riser model is 90 m and the diameter is 3 cm the large scale riser model was attached to a floating vessel at top end and kept with constant axial tension by a buoyancy can at bottom end by moving the top vessel at a constant speed the subjected current of the riser is equivalent to a linearly sheared flow the transducers were furnished every 3 m down the riser to measure bending moment which means viv induced moments were measured at 29 positions in addition inclinometers and tension transducers were installed at both ends the transducers were sampled at a rate of 120 hz the schematic of the sheared flow experiment set up is shown in fig 7 the representative case with top current velocity of 0 54 m s is calculated for comparison the measured and predicted distributions of viv rms displacement and curvature along the riser are presented in fig 8 the predicted viv rms displacement has a good match with the test result only slightly larger at the top of the riser the dominant modes are both the 11st for viv rms curvature the predicted result also shows satisfactory agreement with the measured scatter data even at the top of the riser the same dominant modal order of 11 is observed in both the predicted and test results as shown with red dotted lines fig 8 also gives the corresponding prediction results with the lock in region of 0 125 0 2 which is adopted in the existing semi empirical models compared with 0 125 0 25 0 125 0 2 underestimates rms displacement for the region z l of 0 1 0 35 and overestimates it for the region z l of 0 7 0 9 for the rms curvature envelops the prediction error of 0 125 0 2 is also more visible especially for the region z l of 0 4 0 6 the predicted rms curvatures of 0 125 0 25 are evidently larger and more consistent with the corresponding test measurements therefore the adopted lock in region of 0 125 0 25 by this paper indeed shows better performance than 0 125 0 2 according to fig 9 the time histories and frequency spectra of viv displacement at the riser s midpoint z 45 m can be compared as well viv displacement of the riser under sheared flow shows irregular vibration shape with an evident feature of muti frequency response superposition in general prediction and experiment present similar response time histories and the response displacements both locate within 0 02 m 0 02 m the predicted frequency spectrum shows that several frequency components are excited and exist roughly from 1 hz to 3 hz the highest peak appears at about 2 24 hz test value is 2 13 hz the similar response frequency spectrum can be captured in the test result as well 4 validation against experiment under oscillatory flows as demonstrated above the availability of the proposed numerical model has been well validated against experiments under steady flows next the same numerical model is applied to predict viv of a test flexible riser under oscillatory flows furtherly when fluid oscillates periodically in time domain the motion equation can be described in eq 12 12 a t a m sin 2 π t t v t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t v m cos 2 π t t where a m is the maximum oscillation amplitude and v m is the maximum oscillation velocity t is the oscillation period keulegan carpenter kc number is another key parameter to describe a certain oscillatory flow which can be expressed as eq 13 13 k c v m t d 2 π a m d in this section the series of experiments conducted in the ocean basin at shanghai jiao tong university fu et al 2014 is chosen for comparison to assess the proposed model the whole experimental set up was installed under the bottom of the carriage which mainly contains two horizontal tracks the test riser model was towed in still water with a harmonic in line motion at various combinations of amplitude and period such that the riser was subjected to different oscillatory flows fig 10 gives the simplified schematic of the oscillatory flow experimental set up as only lower modes mode 1 2 can be excited enough fiber brag grating fbg strain sensors were equipped along the riser model at 7 equally spaced positions to measure the cross flow strain the main parameters of the riser model are listed in table 2 reduced velocity is one of the most important parameters as far as viv is concerned under steady flows for an oscillatory flow case the maximum reduced velocity was defined as eq 14 in fu et al 2014 14 v r m v m f 1 d 2 π a m t f 1 d k c t f 1 where f 1 is the first natural frequency of the riser model in still water by assuming added mass coefficient as 1 0 a specified oscillatory flow case was characterized by a combination of kc number and maximum reduced velocity v r m a large number of cases were included in this series of experiments with kc numbers between 26 and 178 and maximum reduced velocities between 4 and 7 9 in this paper six representative cases listed in table 3 are simulated to evaluate the performance of the proposed model at different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities strouhal number is taken as 0 2 which is known to be approximately true in the subcritical flow regime by the way the continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to obtain the time frequency distribution of viv under oscillatory flows identical with fu et al 2014 morlet wavelet is used as the mother wavelet figs 11 16 present the response comparisons between the predicted and test results for all the six calculated cases the left columns give the predicted results based on the proposed model while the right ones are the test results originated from fu et al 2014 the top rows are the viv displacement time histories at specified locations and the bottom ones are the wavelet contour plots of viv strain time history the horizontal axis represents time and vertical axis represents frequency while the color shows the concentration level of the vibrational energy the first two real time natural frequencies in still water of the riser model are also plotted in the same coordinate the time interval between the two black vertical dashed lines is one complete oscillation period marked as t in the middle 4 1 high kc number case high kc number denotes large oscillation amplitude under the similar maximum reduced velocity it usually means the oscillatory flow has a relatively long oscillation period figs 11 13 show the viv response for case 1 case 3 respectively several typical features included in fu et al 2014 which are different from steady flow conditions are observed in the predicted results as well 1 intermittent viv the most intuitive difference between steady and oscillatory flows is that the current velocity of the latter changes with time it is easy to speculate that viv response under oscillatory flows should present a feature of time sharing for the predicted results intermittent viv can be evidently found in the time histories of viv displacement especially for case 1 and case 2 during a certain oscillation period the vibration amplitude is close to zero within a visible time interval this kind of intermittent viv shows periodic response in a long time interval all of these are well consistent with the test results 2 amplitude modulation another notable phenomenon observed in both the predicted and test results is amplitude modulation with the intermittent viv the vibration amplitude is also time varying in general response amplitude would enlarge with the increase of the current velocity and vice versa during a certain oscillation period because there are two time segments for current velocity to increase and decrease the response amplitude would modulate slightly like a shape of mountain peak twice correspondingly the predicted modulation process and maximum value of response amplitude both show good agreement with the test results for the calculated cases 3 hysteresis oscillatory flow can be deemed as a combination of symmetrically continuous acceleration and deceleration process as fig 12 shows a d acc and a d dec denote two time points in the acceleration and deceleration process respectively where both correspond to a same current velocity however the response amplitudes are obviously not equal and the amplitude at a d acc is less than that at a d dec above phenomenon was called hysteresis in fu et al 2014 which can also be found in the predicted results for case 2 4 frequency transition similar with amplitude modulation viv response frequency also presents time varying characteristic which can be captured in both the predicted and test wavelet contour plots the frequency is generally proportional to current velocity as a result there are two obvious frequency transition processes during a certain oscillation period for case 1 and case 2 the transitions shows strong regularity and consistency with test results while for case 3 the measured frequency transition is relatively irregular and presents mode transition phenomenon i e response frequency may jump up and down to the 2nd and 1st mode discretely above phenomenon is not evidently found in the predicted results the possible reason will be discussed in section 4 3 even so the half wave numbers within the same time interval for the predicted and test results are still close 5 higher harmonics from the wavelet contour plots shown in figs 11 13 although they do not match very well with the test results the higher harmonics approximately three times of the dominant frequency could also be observed in the predicted results the higher harmonics are proved existent in most viv model tests of flexible risers however the adopted excitation force coefficient database of the proposed model is based on the forced vibration tests of rigid cylinder and the existing information of this higher frequency region is still inadequate therefore the research on this frequency component still needs to be furtherly carried out this paper mainly focus on the viv response at the fundamental frequency 6 viv developing process in figs 11 13 the envelops of viv response displacement are shaped like trapeziums in fu et al 2014 a viv developing process available for oscillatory flow cases with high kc number was proposed including three phases building up lock in and dying out region the time period when amplitude fluctuation is greater than 2 2 a d max is defined as lock in region the predicted viv response for above three cases all show the similar developing process in the time histories of response displacement with the increase of maximum reduced velocity the proportion of the lock in region to half oscillation period increases correspondingly for both the predicted and test results 4 2 low kc number case for low kc number cases the oscillation amplitude of flow is small under the similar maximum reduced velocity the oscillation period is generally short which means flow pattern will change with time intensively the viv response for case 4 case 6 are shown in figs 14 16 respectively although both are oscillatory flow situations viv response at low kc number shows several quite different features from high kc number cases 1 amplitude modulation the amplitude modulation phenomenon can also be observed in the viv displacement response at low kc number but it should be distinguished from that at high kc number the measured amplitude fluctuates in time domain without evident regularity especially for case 4 and case 6 it is more likely owing to the unsteady vibration of the riser rather than the periodically varying pattern of current velocity the predicted results for above two cases also give the irregular time history similarly and the maximum amplitudes of the predicted and test results are approximate for case 5 whose maximum reduced velocity is 6 5 both of the predicted and test response amplitudes are relatively constant and the time histories are quite like the sinusoidal shape under uniform flow 2 frequency transition according to figs 14 16 frequency transition still exists in the test results for case 4 although the predicted instantaneous response frequency keeps constant with time and has a slight discrepancy with the observation in experiment the frequency fluctuation range and half wave number during the same time interval are still equal for case 5 both the predicted and test results show that the dominant frequency keeps continuous in time domain and the comparable values are coincident while for case 6 mode transition is captured again which is similar with case 3 the predicted frequency is generally less than the test result causing the half wave number does not match quite well with the test data either 3 higher harmonics the higher harmonics corresponding to three times of the fundamental frequency could also be observed in both the predicted and test results at low kc number so far there still seems no widely accepted semi empirical model able to predict this high frequency component precisely this paper only proves the higher harmonics do exist as to how to deepen the understanding and predict it precisely under steady even oscillatory flow situations more and further experimental research work needs to been done next 4 3 general discussion it is obvious that viv of flexible riser will occur under oscillatory flows universally nevertheless viv response presents quite different features at different kc numbers when kc number is high several novel phenomena distinguished from uniform flow conditions such as intermittent viv amplitude modulation hysteresis and frequency transition can be observed the time histories of response displacement present the viv developing process consisting of building up lock in and dying out phases while when kc number is low viv response is relatively unstable although amplitude modulation and frequency transition can also be captured the periodicity or regularity is no longer clear enough the response amplitude keeps approximately constant and the dominant frequency maintains continuous which are quite like the viv response under uniform flow for case 3 and case 6 whose maximum reduced velocities are both 7 9 mode transition occurs in the test observations the maximum dominant frequencies rise to about 4 92 hz corresponding to the non dimensional frequency of 0 23 which is unusually large to the existing knowledge of viv for marine flexible risers while in the proposed model based on most of the existing viv experimental results under steady flows the structural natural frequency closest to the non dimensional frequency of 0 17 is chosen as the dominant frequency when response frequency is located within the excitation region that s why the predicted frequencies are less than the observed ones besides strouhal number is one of the most important fluid parameters for viv research and it is related with reynolds number as well as the surface roughness of the riser fig 17 gives the relationship between st and re for fixed circular cylinder gopalkrishnan 1993 for the risers with smooth surface when re 105 st would change intensively with the increase of re and vortices shedding would become chaotic and disordered for case 3 and case 6 the maximum current velocity is 0 51 m s and the maximum reynolds number is up to 12240 fu et al 2014 in fact due to small oscillation amplitude or short oscillation period when the incoming current reverses it would encounter the flow field caused by itself during the last half period causing the instantaneous relative current velocity must be much larger than 0 51 m s it means the reynolds number would also be much larger than 12240 therefore the corresponding st may be not equal to 0 2 and vortices would shed irregularly the adopted hydrodynamic force coefficient database obtained within subcritical flow regime may be not applicable in such situations any more above analysis could to some extent explain the differences between the predicted and test structural response in figs 13 and 16 the viv mechanism under the oscillatory flows with high maximum reduced velocity i e high maximum reynolds number needs to be investigated furtherly especially by more laboratory experiments in general the fluctuation range of the predicted response amplitude for case 3 and case 6 is close to the measured results for the rest four calculated cases the predicted results show good consistency and similar regularity with the corresponding test data moreover for an actual sea state flow usually has large oscillation amplitude and long period i e high kc number and low maximum reduced velocity the viv response for flexible risers in the real ocean environment is relatively closer to case 1 and case 2 under which the predicted and test results can match with each other very well as a conclusion the proposed model can predict the viv response under most oscillatory flows effectively 5 viv response comparison between uniform and oscillatory flows based on the predicted results under oscillatory flows the corresponding uniform flow cases for the 4 m riser model with comparable current velocities are also simulated to discuss the relationship of viv response between uniform and oscillatory flows as the current velocity of an oscillatory flow can be expressed as v t v m cos 2 π t t this paper choose v m and 2 2 v m corresponding to the maximum and rms current velocities as the matched uniform flow cases the comparison of viv rms displacement for all the cases is discussed and the essential mechanism of viv response under uniform and oscillatory flows is analyzed as follows 5 1 viv rms displacement comparison fig 18 are the distributions of viv rms displacement along the 4 m riser under the oscillatory flows with high kc number kc 178 and uniform flows it is mainly mode 1 being excited for all the calculated cases for the oscillatory flow cases the maximum of viv rms displacement i e a rms d max reaches the peak when v r m 6 5 and the value of v r m 4 is a little larger than v r m 7 9 for the uniform flow cases the results of v r 5 6 present the largest a rms d max a rms d max will enlarge with the increase of v r when v r 5 6 while reduce with its continuing increase when v r 5 6 the regularity for the uniform flow cases matches well with most of free vibration tests a rms d max under oscillatory flow cases are all less than the corresponding uniform flow cases with the maximum and rms current velocities the distributions of viv rms displacement under the oscillatory flows with low kc number kc 31 and the comparable uniform flow cases are shown in fig 19 two new uniform flow cases with v r 3 3 and v r 4 7 are included and their a rms d max meets the rule mentioned above as well a rms d max of three oscillatory flow cases are close the maximum and minimum appear when v r m 7 9 and v r m 4 7 respectively associated with fig 18 with the same maximum reduced velocity a rms d max will be larger at lower kc number for v r m 4 and v r m 6 5 the viv response displacements under oscillatory flows are still less than the corresponding uniform flow cases except for v r m 4 7 and the rms current velocity of v r 3 3 the possible reason will be discussed in the next section 5 2 mechanism analysis of viv response under oscillatory flow it has been widely recognized that viv will occur evidently for flexible risers under steady flows when 4 v r 8 and viv normalized response displacement a d will reach the maximum at v r 6 approximately that is also why the non dimensional excitation region and excitation center are deemed as 0 125 0 25 and 0 17 in the proposed model in the excitation region the excitation force will act on the riser playing a role to aggravate structural vibration while if the instantaneous reduced velocity is outside the region i e v r 4 or v r 8 excitation force transfers into hydrodynamic damping weakening the structural vibration therefore the excitation region and damping region can be marked in figs 20 and 21 for high kc number cases the oscillation amplitude of flow is generally large enough for vortices to shed as completely as they do under steady flows the time histories of current velocity for kc 178 are shown in fig 20 during every half oscillation period the riser would enter the excitation region from damping region firstly and then go back to damping region again the observed intermittent viv exactly occurs within the excitation segment the transitions between excitation and damping regions can also explain why the developing process consists of three phases building up lock in and dying out region when a structure is acted on a certain changing load it usually needs some time to give corresponding response that s why hysteresis phenomenon exists for v r m 4 the most time of one period is located in damping regions while for v r m 6 5 there is longer time interval when the riser is within excitation region and the instantaneous reduced velocity will be closer to 6 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient so the proportion of the lock in region to half oscillation period and viv rms displacement both increase when v r m comes from 4 to 6 5 however even though the oscillation amplitude is large if the oscillation period is relatively short there is still no enough time for vortices to shed completely causing disturbances in excitation force in such cases the maximum current velocity is normally large which means higher order mode may be excited i e mode transition for case 3 the absolute time for excitation force to work is too short such that when the vibration amplitude just reaches about 0 3d damping has come again making the viv response sometimes not quite evident even within excitation region when viv occurs under uniform flows this paper assumes that only excitation force acts on the riser while under the oscillatory flows with high kc number the hydrodynamic damping has an obvious reducing effect on the structural response so the viv rms displacement under oscillatory flows is smaller than the corresponding uniform flow cases when oscillation amplitude is small i e at low kc number the boundary layer separation at the rear of the riser will not be obvious when the riser is still located in the disturbance generated by the first half period flow the current has reversed during the latter half period in that case the effect of fluid viscosity which can also be deemed as the hydrodynamic damping on structural response is not as important as steady flow situations therefore the viv response under the oscillatory flow with low kc number is similar with uniform flow situations fig 21 gives the time histories of current velocity for kc 31 note that the longest half period is less than 1 3s the decrease of vibration amplitude needs fixed time while the time for damping to work is too short to kill the vibration such that excitation force can promptly dominate again that is why the predicted response amplitude basically keeps constant at low kc number besides as the effect of hydrodynamic damping on structural response will gradually fade with the decrease of kc number a rms d max will be larger at lower kc number under the same maximum reduced velocity the time interval within excitation region is also too short for the amplitude to reach a large value and the damping still plays a role as a result the viv rms displacement at lower kc number is also smaller than the associated uniform flow cases for the oscillatory flow case with v r m 4 7 it still has quite long time within excitation region and its viv response presents similar feature with uniform flow case while the rms current velocity case with v r 3 3 has been outside the viv excitation region so a rms d max of v r m 4 7 is larger than v r 3 3 6 viv response of large scale riser under oscillatory flows in section 4 and section 5 the 4 m riser model in the experiments by fu et al 2014 is used to validate the proposed numerical model and explain the essential mechanism of viv response under oscillatory flows however compared with most of the deepwater risers in the actual marine environment the small scale test riser has some obvious specificities particularly for its distributions of natural frequencies under similar conditions the shorter is the riser length the larger is the structure stiffness which leads to larger natural frequencies in fu et al 2014 the first natural frequency of the 4 m riser in water was up to 2 68 hz and the second was 5 46 hz the gap between the natural frequencies of different orders is quite large that s why it is mainly the first mode being excited for most of the experimental oscillatory flow cases as far as deepwater risers are concerned the magnitude of natural frequencies is relatively small and viv will excite higher modes rather than always the first order even with low current velocity therefore a large scale riser model published by trim and braaten 2005 which is more similar with industrial risers in service is chosen to furtherly investigate the viv response under oscillatory flows the structural parameters of the large scale riser are as follows the outer and inner diameters are 0 027 m and 0 021 m the riser length is 38 m and the mass ratio is 1 6 the young s modulus is 3 62 1010pa and the structural damping ratio is 0 003 the top tension is 5000 n the calculated first second and third natural frequencies in still water are 0 74 hz 1 49 hz and 2 23 hz respectively by assuming added mass coefficient as 1 0 according to the experimental results under the uniform flow with current velocity of 0 4 m s the third mode was excited trim and braaten 2005 this paper selects 0 4 m s as the maximum oscillation velocity and designs two oscillatory flow cases i e case 7 and case 8 in table 4 to represent high and low kc number situations respectively the oscillation periods are set as 10s and 2s to ensure the maximum oscillation velocity maximum reduced velocity and kc number approximate to the 4 m riser model under case 2 and case 5 for case 7 and case 8 the maximum reduced velocity should be expressed by v r m k c t f 3 where f 3 2 23 hz is the third natural frequency in still water of the 38 m riser model the instantaneous current velocity of both two designed cases is always within the applicable range of the proposed model mentioned in section 4 3 6 1 high kc number case fig 22 gives the viv response for the large scale riser under oscillatory flows the left column corresponds to the predicted results at z 19 m under high kc number case and the right one denotes the predicted results at z 9 4 m under low kc number case row 1 to row 3 are respectively the time histories of current velocity viv displacement and response frequency at the specified locations some typical viv response features under oscillatory flows mentioned in fu et al 2014 such as amplitude modulation frequency transition and so on can also be captured for the large scale riser under high kc number case during each oscillation period i e 10s since there are two time segments for current velocity to increase and decrease the response amplitude correspondingly modulates twice following a certain regularity the high frequency and low frequency responses are both easy to be observed during every half period of oscillatory flow and the fluctuation is quite violent not as smooth as that for the small scale riser model in the wavelet contour plot viv response frequency is time varying and basically proportional to the absolute value of real time current velocity the highest frequency is about 2 2 hz corresponding to the third natural frequency of the riser model there is an obvious frequency jump from 0 7 hz to 2 2 hz when the current velocity reaches extreme value while the exact time point of the extreme frequency arrives later than the extreme current velocity as described by the two pink solid lines this is because of the existence of hysteresis phenomenon which has been discussed in section 5 2 although the excited frequency bandwidth is approximately equal to the small scale riser under the similar oscillatory flow situation i e case 2 the involved mode number of the large scale riser is obviously larger the temporal spatial distributions of viv displacement for the large scale riser under the oscillatory flow with high kc number are shown in fig 23 for the high kc number case the vibration shape of the riser model presents a time varying feature obviously the periodicity and regularity in each cycle are quite clear according to the local magnification plot within 30s 34s the high frequency response and third order modal shape can be captured near 32 5s and the low frequency response as well as first order modal shape appears near 30 5s and 34s to more clearly present the real time vibration shape of the riser the sub plots with respective color bar are also shown below the local magnification plot it is easy to find that the transition process from low mode to high mode then back to low mode repeats twice within a complete oscillation period the maximum displacement appears at the middle of the riser when the first mode is dominant in viv for the 4 m riser mode jump does not occur under the comparable case i e case 2 it could explain why the amplitude modulation of the large scale riser is more violent than the small scale one 6 2 low kc number case when it comes to the low kc number case the dominant mode in viv response turns out to be the 2nd so the structural dynamic response at z 9 4 m for the large scale riser is given in the right part of fig 22 the amplitude modulation can also be found in the viv displacement time history and the response frequency fluctuates slightly in the wavelet contour plot but these time varying characteristics are more likely caused by the riser s unsteady vibration not the periodic variation of current velocity because the periodicity or regularity of the structural response is not clear enough to be captured during 5 complete oscillation periods i e 10s the fluctuation range of response amplitude is narrow and the dominant frequency maintains approximately constant compared to the small scale riser the viv response at a given monitor position for the large scale riser shows many similarities under the oscillatory flow with low kc number however if the structural response along the whole riser is concerned some differences will be found between two riser scales fig 24 are the temporal spatial distributions of viv displacement for the large scale riser under the oscillatory flow with low kc number the most significant phenomenon is that the large scale riser generally keeps the second modal shape rather than the first or the third one except for a little instability the displacement temporal spatial distributions look quite like those under the uniform flow with current velocity of 2 2 v m 0 28 m s which is also presented as the smaller size plot in fig 24 as discussed in section 5 2 there is no enough time for the structure to form corresponding time varying response or transition process between different modes since the current velocity changes too fast it can be deduced that when kc number is low enough the time varying characteristics of viv response tend to be weakened as those under an equivalent uniform flow case and the steady current velocity should be 2 2 v m for the small scale riser the magnitude of the first natural frequency is relatively large and it is the lowest mode being excited under the uniform flow with current velocity of v m 0 42 m s consequently although the current velocity of the equivalent uniform flow to case 5 is lower than v m it still turns out to be the first mode being excited the equivalent relationship of viv response between low kc number case and the uniform flow case with current velocity of 2 2 v m for the large scale riser is much clearer than the small scale one 7 conclusions a time domain force decomposition model of viv for flexible risers under steady and oscillatory flows is proposed the necessary hydrodynamic force coefficients are completely based on forced vibration experimental data the proposed numerical model is firstly verified well under steady flows by simulating a series of model tests at both high and low kc numbers the prediction accuracy of the proposed model for oscillatory flow cases is directly assessed as well then the comparisons of viv response between uniform and oscillatory flows are discussed and the differences as well as relationships are analyzed from the viv mechanism level finally two designed oscillatory flow cases of a 38 m large scale riser are simulated based on the proposed viv model for further research in summary several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 viv hydrodynamic force coefficient database originated from forced vibration test is applicable for oscillatory flow cases the proposed viv model can effectively predict the time domain structural response for flexible risers under both steady flow and most oscillatory flow situations viv response under the oscillatory flows with high maximum reduced velocity whose re is beyond the subcritical flow regime needs to be investigated furtherly with the help of more relevant experimental researches 2 several novel phenomena observed in test results such as intermittent viv amplitude modulation hysteresis frequency transition higher harmonics and developing process for viv response under oscillatory flows can also be captured in the predicted results viv response with different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities presents quite individual features which can be reasonably explained by analyzing the oscillation amplitude and period of the oscillatory flow with the viv mechanism 3 under the similar current velocity viv rms displacement for oscillatory flow case is generally smaller than the comparable uniform flow case with the same maximum reduced velocity the larger viv rms displacement appears at lower kc number 4 for large scale risers under high kc number cases mode jump is more likely to occur than the small scale ones and time varying viv response presents more complicated regularity the oscillatory flow case with low kc number can be approximately equivalent to a corresponding uniform flow case with current velocity of 2 2 v m overall the proposed time domain numerical model could give reasonable viv prediction results for flexible risers under steady and oscillatory flows it would make efforts to broaden the understanding of viv response characteristics under various current state and the predicted results can provide some references in the engineering design field the proposed viv numerical model is not necessarily optimal but is considered sufficient and easy to implement for such a challenging research frontier future works should focus on how to improve the prediction accuracy furtherly and simulate the higher harmonics precisely with the increasing understanding of viv mechanism under unsteady flows acknowledgement this paper is based on the projects supported by the national natural science foundation of

shanghai jiao tong university shanghai 200240 china state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university shanghai 200240 china vortex induced vibration viv of flexible risers under unsteady flows is receiving increasing attention over the recent years in this paper an alternative time domain force decomposition model for flexible risers is proposed to predict viv response under both steady and oscillatory flows non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is deemed as lock in region when lock in occurs the riser will be synchronized onto its own natural frequency closest to the non dimensional frequency of 0 17 the hydrodynamic forces are time varying and will be updated at each time step according to the riser s response amplitude and frequency firstly the adopted lock in region is verified well for uniform and sheared flow cases next the same numerical model is also validated against experimental measurements when expanding to oscillatory flow conditions viv response with different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities presents quite individual features which can be reasonably explained from the viv mechanism level then the comparisons of viv response between uniform and oscillatory flows are discussed and analyzed in essence finally another large scale riser is simulated under the designed oscillatory flows and some new conclusions different from the small scale risers are obtained keywords vortex induced vibration flexible risers time domain steady flow oscillatory flow 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of flexible risers in marine environment is a complicated fluid structure interaction problem when ocean current flows through vortex would shed periodically around the riser making the riser subjected to hydrodynamic forces due to the vortex shedding the excitation force oscillates with a frequency f s s t v d called strouhal frequency where d is the riser diameter and v is the current velocity for a flexible riser it will vibrate as a result of the oscillatory hydrodynamic forces then disturb the surrounding flow and corresponding hydrodynamic forces the most significant effect is that the vortex shedding may synchronize with the riser s motion such that the frequency of the excitation force deviates from the expected strouhal frequency consequently the response amplitude would enlarge obviously causing severe fatigue damage even structural failure therefore it is imperative to make lots of efforts to broaden the understanding of viv as there is still no well accepted analytic method to solve the motion governing equations of viscous flow experiments are the most effective source of the new insight of viv mechanism temporarily typical laboratory experiments can be classified into free vibration of elastically mounted rigid cylinders song et al 2016 and cylinder forced motions gopalkrishnan 1993 experiments with relatively long flexible structures were also performed both under controlled simulation conditions trim and braaten 2005 and in field environments vandiver et al 2006 these representative experiments are mainly in the view of steady flow situations however in the real marine environment the subjected relative current velocity of the risers will generally be unsteady either due to the wave induced motion of top end structures or the oscillations of incoming flow itself viv experiments under oscillatory flows had also been studied by several researchers for both rigid risers sumer and fredsøe 1988 and flexible ones fu et al 2014 it turned out that viv for risers under oscillatory flows presents more complicated features compared to steady flow situations there has been a sizable number of available methods to predict viv response of slender structures which can be divided into frequency domain and time domain approaches the semi empirical models such as shear7 vandiver and li 2005 and vivana larsen et al 2009 are the most recognized frequency domain prediction tools their prediction accuracy has been validated over the past decade however frequency domain approaches cannot take unsteady flow moving boundary conditions interaction between different response frequencies and nonlinear structural behaviors into account therefore time domain analysis is more considerable and applicable to a wider range of objects as well as conditions cfd methods are potential and able to simulate different flow and boundary conditions but generally complex and computationally demanding wake oscillator model usually uses a van der pol oscillator to describe the wake it was used by chang and isherwood 2003 to predict a riser s viv under the unsteady flow generated by the platform heave motion but like most wake oscillator models how to find a set of controlled parameters such that the model can satisfy with diverse tests is still a difficult problem semi empirical models have received increasing focus in the past years based on different forced vibration test data sidarta et al 2010 ma and qiu 2012 xue et al 2015 and yuan et al 2017 successively developed several viv time domain models liao 2001 developed a numerical method with reduced damping and wave propagation parameter to predict viv of slender structures under unsteady flow resvanis 2014 recommended a non dimensional parameter which can be used to determine whether the response under unsteady flow will be similar with that under steady flow when it comes to the test validation for unsteady flow cases of numerical model to the knowledge of the authors it seems only thorsen et al 2016 2017 developed a time domain semi empirical approach and compared their numerical results with the test measurements of a ttr and an scr under oscillatory flows therefore such a research issue involved in this paper is still in its infancy at present viv hydrodynamic force coefficients are the kernel of semi empirical models the formulations of the coefficients include no restriction on the time variability of the incoming current velocity for an unsteady flow it can be thought meeting steady flow condition during each tiny time interval that means the existing hydrodynamic force coefficient databases available for steady flow cases should be theoretically applicable under unsteady flow situations as long as the calculated time increment is short enough in this paper an alternative force decomposition model of viv for flexible risers is proposed to predict the structural response under steady and oscillatory flows all the associated hydrodynamic force coefficients originate from forced vibration experimental data gopalkrishnan 1993 the most important component is applying existing hydrodynamic force coefficient database to unsteady flow cases another novel attempts are improving hydrodynamic force formulation and adopting new lock in region making them perform well under oscillatory flows no longer just applicable for steady flow cases in the previous researches moreover the proposed numerical model is validated well against laboratory experiments under uniform sheared and oscillatory flows respectively this paper is structured as follows section 2 is the description of the proposed numerical model and analysis methodology in section 3 the experiments by song et al 2016 and lie and kaasen 2006 are used for comparisons to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model for steady flow cases in section 4 by comparing with the experiments in fu et al 2014 the same numerical model is proved compatible for oscillatory flow situations the different viv features between uniform and oscillatory flows are analyzed in section 5 and the reasonable explanations for all the interesting response characteristics are given as well two designed oscillatory flow cases of the large scale riser model in trim and braaten 2005 are simulated in section 6 for the further investigation on viv response under oscillatory flow finally the main conclusions are drawn in section 7 it is worth mentioning that the main contributions of this paper are not developing an original approach but improving the existing viv semi empirical model to handle more realistic and complicated unsteady e g oscillatory flow cases explaining the time varying response characteristics under oscillatory flow with the viv mechanism and revealing the universal features of viv under oscillatory flow for a relatively large scale riser 2 numerical model and analysis methodology the proposed force decomposition model originates from wang et al 2013 and xue et al 2015 nevertheless this paper improves the hydrodynamic force formulation and updates the lock in region making the present numerical model applicable for more extensive including unsteady flow cases a large aspect ratio of length to diameter is a universal feature of flexible risers thus the riser can be considered as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation for the riser in the cross flow direction could be expressed as eq 1 in the cartesian coordinate system where x axis is parallel with current velocity y axis is perpendicular to the incoming flow direction and z axis is along the riser s axial direction 1 m π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 c s f r t c f a f r t y t e i 4 y z 4 z t a z t y z f a f r t y where m is the mass per unit length of the riser c a is the added mass coefficient which is generally assumed as a constant e g 1 0 in this paper ρ f is the fluid density c s and c f are the structural and hydrodynamic damping coefficients a is the non dimensional response amplitude to riser s diameter d respectively f r is the non dimensional frequency equal to f d v f is the response frequency e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia t a is the effective axial tension f y is the viv excitation force the viv excitation force f y is in phase with the riser s velocity and depends on the response amplitude vibration frequency and current velocity assuming that the excitation force acting on riser element follows sinusoidal rule in one period it could be expressed as eq 2 2 f y 1 2 c v a f r t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t where c v is the excitation force coefficient and v is the instantaneous current velocity compared with the existing viv semi empirical models eq 2 replaces v 2 with v t v t to take the time varying velocity and direction of unsteady flow into account 2 1 excitation force model to obtain the excitation force coefficient c v a function of non dimensional amplitude and frequency based on forced vibration experimental data is proposed gopalkrishnan 1993 carried out a series of cylinder forced vibration tests in mit towing tank and gave the contour of viv excitation force coefficient this database has been well verified and used by several relatively mature frequency domain software like shear7 and vivana but only limited to steady flow cases before this paper fig 1 is the contour of viv excitation force coefficient in phase with velocity gopalkrishnan 1993 where the thick line marks the important boundary corresponding to c v 0 the non dimensional frequency of viv excitation center is approximately 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient note that when c v is negative the excitation force is deemed to transfer into hydrodynamic damping which will be described in detail as follows strouhal number of this series of forced vibration experiments is 0 193 2 2 damping model the total damping considered in the proposed viv model consists of structural damping and hydrodynamic damping the structural damping coefficient c s is typically expressed in eq 3 3 c s 4 π m f ξ where ξ is the structural damping ratio hydrodynamic damping is an active subject in viv research when c v is positive the excitation force will synchronize to the riser s velocity and the power will be transferred from fluid to the riser however if c v is negative the power will be transferred from the riser back to fluid and hydrodynamic damping will work the hydrodynamic damping coefficient can be calculated in eq 4 4 c f c v ρ f v 2 d 4 π a f if the non dimensional frequency is outside the experimental data range an empirical damping model by venugopal 1996 is used to simulate viv hydrodynamic damping venugopal 1996 synthesized a broad variety of experimental evidence and recommended the following empirical model made up of high and low non dimensional frequency regions damping in high non dimensional frequency region is expressed in eq 5 5 c f c h f ρ f d v c s w where c hf is an empirical coefficient c s w is the still water damping given by eq 6 6 c s w π 2 ρ f d 2 f 2 1 π d 2 f v c s w a d 2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid c sw is another empirical coefficient damping in low non dimensional frequency region is expressed in eq 7 7 c f c l f ρ f v 2 2 π f where c lf is also an empirical coefficient the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 by validating against experimental measurements this nonlinear hydrodynamic damping model is proved able to handle the damping affected by the contributing factors such as actual response amplitude vibration frequency cross section properties and local current velocity under both steady and oscillatory flows 2 3 lock in judgment criterion response amplitude a and frequency f of the riser elements are the most crucial factors to calculate hydrodynamic forces so at each time step the displacement u as well as velocity v of nodes and time t should be extracted to calculate the real time a and f for every riser element a and f are calculated in eq 8 which could also be described by fig 2 8 a u b u a 2 f 1 2 t b t a where u a u b t a t b are the displacement and time corresponding to the adjacent two time points a and b with v 0 the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is determined as lock in region which should be corrected for the difference of strouhal number between the actual and test circumstances by eq 9 9 f r s t t e s t f r s t a c t u a l compared with the lock in region of 0 125 0 2 which is adopted by the existing semi empirical models 0 125 0 25 is based on the recently published experimental research by zheng 2014 the validation against experiments in section 3 also indicates that the updated lock in region of 0 125 0 25 shows better performance in predicting viv response if the non dimensional response frequency locates within the excitation bandwidth lock in occurs the riser element will be synchronized onto the structural natural frequency closest to the non dimensional frequency of 0 17 and 0 17 here also needs to be corrected by eq 9 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient when implementing the proposed numerical procedure this paper adopts the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 to ensure that the excitation force is actually in phase with the local velocity of the riser as a regulator system the control loop consists of a phase error detector and a second order tracker the phase error detector monitors the phase difference between a reference signal and the real time oscillation phase of the excitation force the reference signal is calculated by prony s algorithm and able to be switched according to the real time lock in state such a pre differentiated and post integrated regulator works as an effective tracking system similar with the phase locked loops pll used in electronic equipment the phase difference between the local velocity of the riser and the excitation force acts as a step input function of the control system and it will be gradually adjusted down to zero over a period of time the adjusting time steps can be modified by tuning the parameters of the tracking algorithm such that a smooth transition of the excitation force can be achieved then the pll remains active to keep the phase difference equal to zero if the non dimensional response frequency is outside the excitation bandwidth the dominant frequency is regarded equal to the response frequency a negative excitation force coefficient will be calculated according to fig 1 and then the hydrodynamic damping coefficient can be obtained by eq 4 outside the experimental data the empirical damping model mentioned in section 2 2 will be adopted 2 4 structural response solution for the structure modelling eq 1 is discretized in space by finite element method fem the flexible riser is uniformly discretized along the axial direction into a large amount of elements the element number is controlled more than 150 which has been checked to be sufficient i e more elements cause no difference on the predicted results the proposed time domain numerical model is based on direct integration dynamic analysis eq 1 is solved with the hilber hughes taylor hht method which is a one step implicit method that has been used successfully in the classical mechanical simulations hilber et al 1977 eq 10 shows how the positions and velocities are updated at each time step and the time discrete momentum equation is expressed as eq 11 10 u t δ t u t δ t u t δ t 2 1 2 β u t 2 β u t δ t 2 u t δ t u t δ t 1 γ u t γ u t δ t 11 r t α δ t f t δ t e x t m u t δ t c u t α δ t f i n t u t α δ t u t α δ t 1 α u t α u t δ t u t α δ t 1 α u t α u t δ t where f ext and f int are the external and internal forces in the whole system r is the force residuals when α 1 3 0 β 1 α 2 4 and γ 1 2 α 2 hht method is unconditionally stable automatic convergence checks are applied to the force residuals with standard parameters α 0 05 the stable time increment is selected as 0 002 f max where f max is the maximum expected fundamental frequency there is at least 500 steps during each vibration period of the riser which has been found to be sufficient i e reducing the time increment gives no change in the predicted results to better demonstrate the proposed model the time domain analysis flow chart is shown in fig 3 associated with eq 8 and fig 2 hydrodynamic force coefficients are updated every half oscillation period according to the calculated real time response amplitude and frequency during each time step hydrodynamic forces will be updated by eq 2 before structural response calculation 3 validation against experiments under steady flows in this section two series of experiments are simulated to verify the proposed model for steady flow cases one is a small scale tensioned riser under uniform flow song et al 2016 and the other is a relatively long tensioned riser under linearly sheared flow lie and kaasen 2006 the key parameters of above two riser models are listed in table 1 3 1 uniform flow case the uniform flow experiment published by song et al 2016 was performed in the towing tank of shanghai shipping science institute with dimensions of 192 m 10 m 4 2 m length width depth a 7 9 m long riser model was horizontally installed on a towing carriage at a water depth of 1 5 m and uniform current was simulated by towing the riser at a constant speed 38 fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were instrumented symmetrically on the surface of the riser model in cf plane cf strain response history of 19 monitor points can be captured throughout the process all the strain signals were synchronously acquired at a rate of 125 hz fig 4 is a schematic of the test apparatus the case with current velocity of 1 6 m s is chosen to be predicted as an example the distributions of viv rms displacement a rms d along the riser are shown in fig 5 the proposed model predicts the same main excited mode and approximate amplitude with the experimental data at the two ends of the riser the predicted amplitude is larger than the test result the possible reason is that the structural natural frequency closest to non dimensional frequency of 0 17 is chosen as the dominant frequency which may lead to a little overestimated excitation force fig 5 also gives the prediction results under the other dominant frequencies if non dimensional dominant frequency f r d o m is simply equal to 0 16 and 0 18 the predicted amplitude at the two ends of the riser becomes smaller than the middle and the vibration shape seems more similar with the test observation but more importantly the magnitude of response amplitude along the whole riser is so much smaller than the test result that the prediction accuracy turns unacceptable overall the predicted result with f r d o m equal to the non dimensional natural frequency closest to 0 17 shows better agreement with the test result especially at the middle of the riser the slight underestimate of the proposed model at the middle of the riser is probably due to the prediction error of dominant frequency in fig 6 if assuming the test response frequency is known before running the simulation and taking the test measurement of 9 08 hz as dominant frequency the prediction result presents better consistency with the test observation at the middle of the riser as shown by the green dashed line in fig 5 fig 6 are the time histories and frequency spectra of viv strain at the midpoint z 3 95 m for the riser the predicted response displacement presents typical periodicity with a sinusoidal shape and constant vibration amplitude which are consistent with the test data the reasonable similarity can also be found between the predicted and test frequency spectra from the prediction result a single frequency of 8 94 hz corresponding to the third natural frequency of the riser is excited the deviation of the predicted value from the test data 9 08 hz is in an acceptable range 3 2 sheared flow case large scale model test of a tensioned steel riser in well defined sheared current was performed at hanøytangen outside bergen on the west coast of norway in 1997 the detailed description can be found in lie and kaasen 2006 the test site was a 180 m long floating quay at 97 m depth the length of the riser model is 90 m and the diameter is 3 cm the large scale riser model was attached to a floating vessel at top end and kept with constant axial tension by a buoyancy can at bottom end by moving the top vessel at a constant speed the subjected current of the riser is equivalent to a linearly sheared flow the transducers were furnished every 3 m down the riser to measure bending moment which means viv induced moments were measured at 29 positions in addition inclinometers and tension transducers were installed at both ends the transducers were sampled at a rate of 120 hz the schematic of the sheared flow experiment set up is shown in fig 7 the representative case with top current velocity of 0 54 m s is calculated for comparison the measured and predicted distributions of viv rms displacement and curvature along the riser are presented in fig 8 the predicted viv rms displacement has a good match with the test result only slightly larger at the top of the riser the dominant modes are both the 11st for viv rms curvature the predicted result also shows satisfactory agreement with the measured scatter data even at the top of the riser the same dominant modal order of 11 is observed in both the predicted and test results as shown with red dotted lines fig 8 also gives the corresponding prediction results with the lock in region of 0 125 0 2 which is adopted in the existing semi empirical models compared with 0 125 0 25 0 125 0 2 underestimates rms displacement for the region z l of 0 1 0 35 and overestimates it for the region z l of 0 7 0 9 for the rms curvature envelops the prediction error of 0 125 0 2 is also more visible especially for the region z l of 0 4 0 6 the predicted rms curvatures of 0 125 0 25 are evidently larger and more consistent with the corresponding test measurements therefore the adopted lock in region of 0 125 0 25 by this paper indeed shows better performance than 0 125 0 2 according to fig 9 the time histories and frequency spectra of viv displacement at the riser s midpoint z 45 m can be compared as well viv displacement of the riser under sheared flow shows irregular vibration shape with an evident feature of muti frequency response superposition in general prediction and experiment present similar response time histories and the response displacements both locate within 0 02 m 0 02 m the predicted frequency spectrum shows that several frequency components are excited and exist roughly from 1 hz to 3 hz the highest peak appears at about 2 24 hz test value is 2 13 hz the similar response frequency spectrum can be captured in the test result as well 4 validation against experiment under oscillatory flows as demonstrated above the availability of the proposed numerical model has been well validated against experiments under steady flows next the same numerical model is applied to predict viv of a test flexible riser under oscillatory flows furtherly when fluid oscillates periodically in time domain the motion equation can be described in eq 12 12 a t a m sin 2 π t t v t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t v m cos 2 π t t where a m is the maximum oscillation amplitude and v m is the maximum oscillation velocity t is the oscillation period keulegan carpenter kc number is another key parameter to describe a certain oscillatory flow which can be expressed as eq 13 13 k c v m t d 2 π a m d in this section the series of experiments conducted in the ocean basin at shanghai jiao tong university fu et al 2014 is chosen for comparison to assess the proposed model the whole experimental set up was installed under the bottom of the carriage which mainly contains two horizontal tracks the test riser model was towed in still water with a harmonic in line motion at various combinations of amplitude and period such that the riser was subjected to different oscillatory flows fig 10 gives the simplified schematic of the oscillatory flow experimental set up as only lower modes mode 1 2 can be excited enough fiber brag grating fbg strain sensors were equipped along the riser model at 7 equally spaced positions to measure the cross flow strain the main parameters of the riser model are listed in table 2 reduced velocity is one of the most important parameters as far as viv is concerned under steady flows for an oscillatory flow case the maximum reduced velocity was defined as eq 14 in fu et al 2014 14 v r m v m f 1 d 2 π a m t f 1 d k c t f 1 where f 1 is the first natural frequency of the riser model in still water by assuming added mass coefficient as 1 0 a specified oscillatory flow case was characterized by a combination of kc number and maximum reduced velocity v r m a large number of cases were included in this series of experiments with kc numbers between 26 and 178 and maximum reduced velocities between 4 and 7 9 in this paper six representative cases listed in table 3 are simulated to evaluate the performance of the proposed model at different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities strouhal number is taken as 0 2 which is known to be approximately true in the subcritical flow regime by the way the continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to obtain the time frequency distribution of viv under oscillatory flows identical with fu et al 2014 morlet wavelet is used as the mother wavelet figs 11 16 present the response comparisons between the predicted and test results for all the six calculated cases the left columns give the predicted results based on the proposed model while the right ones are the test results originated from fu et al 2014 the top rows are the viv displacement time histories at specified locations and the bottom ones are the wavelet contour plots of viv strain time history the horizontal axis represents time and vertical axis represents frequency while the color shows the concentration level of the vibrational energy the first two real time natural frequencies in still water of the riser model are also plotted in the same coordinate the time interval between the two black vertical dashed lines is one complete oscillation period marked as t in the middle 4 1 high kc number case high kc number denotes large oscillation amplitude under the similar maximum reduced velocity it usually means the oscillatory flow has a relatively long oscillation period figs 11 13 show the viv response for case 1 case 3 respectively several typical features included in fu et al 2014 which are different from steady flow conditions are observed in the predicted results as well 1 intermittent viv the most intuitive difference between steady and oscillatory flows is that the current velocity of the latter changes with time it is easy to speculate that viv response under oscillatory flows should present a feature of time sharing for the predicted results intermittent viv can be evidently found in the time histories of viv displacement especially for case 1 and case 2 during a certain oscillation period the vibration amplitude is close to zero within a visible time interval this kind of intermittent viv shows periodic response in a long time interval all of these are well consistent with the test results 2 amplitude modulation another notable phenomenon observed in both the predicted and test results is amplitude modulation with the intermittent viv the vibration amplitude is also time varying in general response amplitude would enlarge with the increase of the current velocity and vice versa during a certain oscillation period because there are two time segments for current velocity to increase and decrease the response amplitude would modulate slightly like a shape of mountain peak twice correspondingly the predicted modulation process and maximum value of response amplitude both show good agreement with the test results for the calculated cases 3 hysteresis oscillatory flow can be deemed as a combination of symmetrically continuous acceleration and deceleration process as fig 12 shows a d acc and a d dec denote two time points in the acceleration and deceleration process respectively where both correspond to a same current velocity however the response amplitudes are obviously not equal and the amplitude at a d acc is less than that at a d dec above phenomenon was called hysteresis in fu et al 2014 which can also be found in the predicted results for case 2 4 frequency transition similar with amplitude modulation viv response frequency also presents time varying characteristic which can be captured in both the predicted and test wavelet contour plots the frequency is generally proportional to current velocity as a result there are two obvious frequency transition processes during a certain oscillation period for case 1 and case 2 the transitions shows strong regularity and consistency with test results while for case 3 the measured frequency transition is relatively irregular and presents mode transition phenomenon i e response frequency may jump up and down to the 2nd and 1st mode discretely above phenomenon is not evidently found in the predicted results the possible reason will be discussed in section 4 3 even so the half wave numbers within the same time interval for the predicted and test results are still close 5 higher harmonics from the wavelet contour plots shown in figs 11 13 although they do not match very well with the test results the higher harmonics approximately three times of the dominant frequency could also be observed in the predicted results the higher harmonics are proved existent in most viv model tests of flexible risers however the adopted excitation force coefficient database of the proposed model is based on the forced vibration tests of rigid cylinder and the existing information of this higher frequency region is still inadequate therefore the research on this frequency component still needs to be furtherly carried out this paper mainly focus on the viv response at the fundamental frequency 6 viv developing process in figs 11 13 the envelops of viv response displacement are shaped like trapeziums in fu et al 2014 a viv developing process available for oscillatory flow cases with high kc number was proposed including three phases building up lock in and dying out region the time period when amplitude fluctuation is greater than 2 2 a d max is defined as lock in region the predicted viv response for above three cases all show the similar developing process in the time histories of response displacement with the increase of maximum reduced velocity the proportion of the lock in region to half oscillation period increases correspondingly for both the predicted and test results 4 2 low kc number case for low kc number cases the oscillation amplitude of flow is small under the similar maximum reduced velocity the oscillation period is generally short which means flow pattern will change with time intensively the viv response for case 4 case 6 are shown in figs 14 16 respectively although both are oscillatory flow situations viv response at low kc number shows several quite different features from high kc number cases 1 amplitude modulation the amplitude modulation phenomenon can also be observed in the viv displacement response at low kc number but it should be distinguished from that at high kc number the measured amplitude fluctuates in time domain without evident regularity especially for case 4 and case 6 it is more likely owing to the unsteady vibration of the riser rather than the periodically varying pattern of current velocity the predicted results for above two cases also give the irregular time history similarly and the maximum amplitudes of the predicted and test results are approximate for case 5 whose maximum reduced velocity is 6 5 both of the predicted and test response amplitudes are relatively constant and the time histories are quite like the sinusoidal shape under uniform flow 2 frequency transition according to figs 14 16 frequency transition still exists in the test results for case 4 although the predicted instantaneous response frequency keeps constant with time and has a slight discrepancy with the observation in experiment the frequency fluctuation range and half wave number during the same time interval are still equal for case 5 both the predicted and test results show that the dominant frequency keeps continuous in time domain and the comparable values are coincident while for case 6 mode transition is captured again which is similar with case 3 the predicted frequency is generally less than the test result causing the half wave number does not match quite well with the test data either 3 higher harmonics the higher harmonics corresponding to three times of the fundamental frequency could also be observed in both the predicted and test results at low kc number so far there still seems no widely accepted semi empirical model able to predict this high frequency component precisely this paper only proves the higher harmonics do exist as to how to deepen the understanding and predict it precisely under steady even oscillatory flow situations more and further experimental research work needs to been done next 4 3 general discussion it is obvious that viv of flexible riser will occur under oscillatory flows universally nevertheless viv response presents quite different features at different kc numbers when kc number is high several novel phenomena distinguished from uniform flow conditions such as intermittent viv amplitude modulation hysteresis and frequency transition can be observed the time histories of response displacement present the viv developing process consisting of building up lock in and dying out phases while when kc number is low viv response is relatively unstable although amplitude modulation and frequency transition can also be captured the periodicity or regularity is no longer clear enough the response amplitude keeps approximately constant and the dominant frequency maintains continuous which are quite like the viv response under uniform flow for case 3 and case 6 whose maximum reduced velocities are both 7 9 mode transition occurs in the test observations the maximum dominant frequencies rise to about 4 92 hz corresponding to the non dimensional frequency of 0 23 which is unusually large to the existing knowledge of viv for marine flexible risers while in the proposed model based on most of the existing viv experimental results under steady flows the structural natural frequency closest to the non dimensional frequency of 0 17 is chosen as the dominant frequency when response frequency is located within the excitation region that s why the predicted frequencies are less than the observed ones besides strouhal number is one of the most important fluid parameters for viv research and it is related with reynolds number as well as the surface roughness of the riser fig 17 gives the relationship between st and re for fixed circular cylinder gopalkrishnan 1993 for the risers with smooth surface when re 105 st would change intensively with the increase of re and vortices shedding would become chaotic and disordered for case 3 and case 6 the maximum current velocity is 0 51 m s and the maximum reynolds number is up to 12240 fu et al 2014 in fact due to small oscillation amplitude or short oscillation period when the incoming current reverses it would encounter the flow field caused by itself during the last half period causing the instantaneous relative current velocity must be much larger than 0 51 m s it means the reynolds number would also be much larger than 12240 therefore the corresponding st may be not equal to 0 2 and vortices would shed irregularly the adopted hydrodynamic force coefficient database obtained within subcritical flow regime may be not applicable in such situations any more above analysis could to some extent explain the differences between the predicted and test structural response in figs 13 and 16 the viv mechanism under the oscillatory flows with high maximum reduced velocity i e high maximum reynolds number needs to be investigated furtherly especially by more laboratory experiments in general the fluctuation range of the predicted response amplitude for case 3 and case 6 is close to the measured results for the rest four calculated cases the predicted results show good consistency and similar regularity with the corresponding test data moreover for an actual sea state flow usually has large oscillation amplitude and long period i e high kc number and low maximum reduced velocity the viv response for flexible risers in the real ocean environment is relatively closer to case 1 and case 2 under which the predicted and test results can match with each other very well as a conclusion the proposed model can predict the viv response under most oscillatory flows effectively 5 viv response comparison between uniform and oscillatory flows based on the predicted results under oscillatory flows the corresponding uniform flow cases for the 4 m riser model with comparable current velocities are also simulated to discuss the relationship of viv response between uniform and oscillatory flows as the current velocity of an oscillatory flow can be expressed as v t v m cos 2 π t t this paper choose v m and 2 2 v m corresponding to the maximum and rms current velocities as the matched uniform flow cases the comparison of viv rms displacement for all the cases is discussed and the essential mechanism of viv response under uniform and oscillatory flows is analyzed as follows 5 1 viv rms displacement comparison fig 18 are the distributions of viv rms displacement along the 4 m riser under the oscillatory flows with high kc number kc 178 and uniform flows it is mainly mode 1 being excited for all the calculated cases for the oscillatory flow cases the maximum of viv rms displacement i e a rms d max reaches the peak when v r m 6 5 and the value of v r m 4 is a little larger than v r m 7 9 for the uniform flow cases the results of v r 5 6 present the largest a rms d max a rms d max will enlarge with the increase of v r when v r 5 6 while reduce with its continuing increase when v r 5 6 the regularity for the uniform flow cases matches well with most of free vibration tests a rms d max under oscillatory flow cases are all less than the corresponding uniform flow cases with the maximum and rms current velocities the distributions of viv rms displacement under the oscillatory flows with low kc number kc 31 and the comparable uniform flow cases are shown in fig 19 two new uniform flow cases with v r 3 3 and v r 4 7 are included and their a rms d max meets the rule mentioned above as well a rms d max of three oscillatory flow cases are close the maximum and minimum appear when v r m 7 9 and v r m 4 7 respectively associated with fig 18 with the same maximum reduced velocity a rms d max will be larger at lower kc number for v r m 4 and v r m 6 5 the viv response displacements under oscillatory flows are still less than the corresponding uniform flow cases except for v r m 4 7 and the rms current velocity of v r 3 3 the possible reason will be discussed in the next section 5 2 mechanism analysis of viv response under oscillatory flow it has been widely recognized that viv will occur evidently for flexible risers under steady flows when 4 v r 8 and viv normalized response displacement a d will reach the maximum at v r 6 approximately that is also why the non dimensional excitation region and excitation center are deemed as 0 125 0 25 and 0 17 in the proposed model in the excitation region the excitation force will act on the riser playing a role to aggravate structural vibration while if the instantaneous reduced velocity is outside the region i e v r 4 or v r 8 excitation force transfers into hydrodynamic damping weakening the structural vibration therefore the excitation region and damping region can be marked in figs 20 and 21 for high kc number cases the oscillation amplitude of flow is generally large enough for vortices to shed as completely as they do under steady flows the time histories of current velocity for kc 178 are shown in fig 20 during every half oscillation period the riser would enter the excitation region from damping region firstly and then go back to damping region again the observed intermittent viv exactly occurs within the excitation segment the transitions between excitation and damping regions can also explain why the developing process consists of three phases building up lock in and dying out region when a structure is acted on a certain changing load it usually needs some time to give corresponding response that s why hysteresis phenomenon exists for v r m 4 the most time of one period is located in damping regions while for v r m 6 5 there is longer time interval when the riser is within excitation region and the instantaneous reduced velocity will be closer to 6 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient so the proportion of the lock in region to half oscillation period and viv rms displacement both increase when v r m comes from 4 to 6 5 however even though the oscillation amplitude is large if the oscillation period is relatively short there is still no enough time for vortices to shed completely causing disturbances in excitation force in such cases the maximum current velocity is normally large which means higher order mode may be excited i e mode transition for case 3 the absolute time for excitation force to work is too short such that when the vibration amplitude just reaches about 0 3d damping has come again making the viv response sometimes not quite evident even within excitation region when viv occurs under uniform flows this paper assumes that only excitation force acts on the riser while under the oscillatory flows with high kc number the hydrodynamic damping has an obvious reducing effect on the structural response so the viv rms displacement under oscillatory flows is smaller than the corresponding uniform flow cases when oscillation amplitude is small i e at low kc number the boundary layer separation at the rear of the riser will not be obvious when the riser is still located in the disturbance generated by the first half period flow the current has reversed during the latter half period in that case the effect of fluid viscosity which can also be deemed as the hydrodynamic damping on structural response is not as important as steady flow situations therefore the viv response under the oscillatory flow with low kc number is similar with uniform flow situations fig 21 gives the time histories of current velocity for kc 31 note that the longest half period is less than 1 3s the decrease of vibration amplitude needs fixed time while the time for damping to work is too short to kill the vibration such that excitation force can promptly dominate again that is why the predicted response amplitude basically keeps constant at low kc number besides as the effect of hydrodynamic damping on structural response will gradually fade with the decrease of kc number a rms d max will be larger at lower kc number under the same maximum reduced velocity the time interval within excitation region is also too short for the amplitude to reach a large value and the damping still plays a role as a result the viv rms displacement at lower kc number is also smaller than the associated uniform flow cases for the oscillatory flow case with v r m 4 7 it still has quite long time within excitation region and its viv response presents similar feature with uniform flow case while the rms current velocity case with v r 3 3 has been outside the viv excitation region so a rms d max of v r m 4 7 is larger than v r 3 3 6 viv response of large scale riser under oscillatory flows in section 4 and section 5 the 4 m riser model in the experiments by fu et al 2014 is used to validate the proposed numerical model and explain the essential mechanism of viv response under oscillatory flows however compared with most of the deepwater risers in the actual marine environment the small scale test riser has some obvious specificities particularly for its distributions of natural frequencies under similar conditions the shorter is the riser length the larger is the structure stiffness which leads to larger natural frequencies in fu et al 2014 the first natural frequency of the 4 m riser in water was up to 2 68 hz and the second was 5 46 hz the gap between the natural frequencies of different orders is quite large that s why it is mainly the first mode being excited for most of the experimental oscillatory flow cases as far as deepwater risers are concerned the magnitude of natural frequencies is relatively small and viv will excite higher modes rather than always the first order even with low current velocity therefore a large scale riser model published by trim and braaten 2005 which is more similar with industrial risers in service is chosen to furtherly investigate the viv response under oscillatory flows the structural parameters of the large scale riser are as follows the outer and inner diameters are 0 027 m and 0 021 m the riser length is 38 m and the mass ratio is 1 6 the young s modulus is 3 62 1010pa and the structural damping ratio is 0 003 the top tension is 5000 n the calculated first second and third natural frequencies in still water are 0 74 hz 1 49 hz and 2 23 hz respectively by assuming added mass coefficient as 1 0 according to the experimental results under the uniform flow with current velocity of 0 4 m s the third mode was excited trim and braaten 2005 this paper selects 0 4 m s as the maximum oscillation velocity and designs two oscillatory flow cases i e case 7 and case 8 in table 4 to represent high and low kc number situations respectively the oscillation periods are set as 10s and 2s to ensure the maximum oscillation velocity maximum reduced velocity and kc number approximate to the 4 m riser model under case 2 and case 5 for case 7 and case 8 the maximum reduced velocity should be expressed by v r m k c t f 3 where f 3 2 23 hz is the third natural frequency in still water of the 38 m riser model the instantaneous current velocity of both two designed cases is always within the applicable range of the proposed model mentioned in section 4 3 6 1 high kc number case fig 22 gives the viv response for the large scale riser under oscillatory flows the left column corresponds to the predicted results at z 19 m under high kc number case and the right one denotes the predicted results at z 9 4 m under low kc number case row 1 to row 3 are respectively the time histories of current velocity viv displacement and response frequency at the specified locations some typical viv response features under oscillatory flows mentioned in fu et al 2014 such as amplitude modulation frequency transition and so on can also be captured for the large scale riser under high kc number case during each oscillation period i e 10s since there are two time segments for current velocity to increase and decrease the response amplitude correspondingly modulates twice following a certain regularity the high frequency and low frequency responses are both easy to be observed during every half period of oscillatory flow and the fluctuation is quite violent not as smooth as that for the small scale riser model in the wavelet contour plot viv response frequency is time varying and basically proportional to the absolute value of real time current velocity the highest frequency is about 2 2 hz corresponding to the third natural frequency of the riser model there is an obvious frequency jump from 0 7 hz to 2 2 hz when the current velocity reaches extreme value while the exact time point of the extreme frequency arrives later than the extreme current velocity as described by the two pink solid lines this is because of the existence of hysteresis phenomenon which has been discussed in section 5 2 although the excited frequency bandwidth is approximately equal to the small scale riser under the similar oscillatory flow situation i e case 2 the involved mode number of the large scale riser is obviously larger the temporal spatial distributions of viv displacement for the large scale riser under the oscillatory flow with high kc number are shown in fig 23 for the high kc number case the vibration shape of the riser model presents a time varying feature obviously the periodicity and regularity in each cycle are quite clear according to the local magnification plot within 30s 34s the high frequency response and third order modal shape can be captured near 32 5s and the low frequency response as well as first order modal shape appears near 30 5s and 34s to more clearly present the real time vibration shape of the riser the sub plots with respective color bar are also shown below the local magnification plot it is easy to find that the transition process from low mode to high mode then back to low mode repeats twice within a complete oscillation period the maximum displacement appears at the middle of the riser when the first mode is dominant in viv for the 4 m riser mode jump does not occur under the comparable case i e case 2 it could explain why the amplitude modulation of the large scale riser is more violent than the small scale one 6 2 low kc number case when it comes to the low kc number case the dominant mode in viv response turns out to be the 2nd so the structural dynamic response at z 9 4 m for the large scale riser is given in the right part of fig 22 the amplitude modulation can also be found in the viv displacement time history and the response frequency fluctuates slightly in the wavelet contour plot but these time varying characteristics are more likely caused by the riser s unsteady vibration not the periodic variation of current velocity because the periodicity or regularity of the structural response is not clear enough to be captured during 5 complete oscillation periods i e 10s the fluctuation range of response amplitude is narrow and the dominant frequency maintains approximately constant compared to the small scale riser the viv response at a given monitor position for the large scale riser shows many similarities under the oscillatory flow with low kc number however if the structural response along the whole riser is concerned some differences will be found between two riser scales fig 24 are the temporal spatial distributions of viv displacement for the large scale riser under the oscillatory flow with low kc number the most significant phenomenon is that the large scale riser generally keeps the second modal shape rather than the first or the third one except for a little instability the displacement temporal spatial distributions look quite like those under the uniform flow with current velocity of 2 2 v m 0 28 m s which is also presented as the smaller size plot in fig 24 as discussed in section 5 2 there is no enough time for the structure to form corresponding time varying response or transition process between different modes since the current velocity changes too fast it can be deduced that when kc number is low enough the time varying characteristics of viv response tend to be weakened as those under an equivalent uniform flow case and the steady current velocity should be 2 2 v m for the small scale riser the magnitude of the first natural frequency is relatively large and it is the lowest mode being excited under the uniform flow with current velocity of v m 0 42 m s consequently although the current velocity of the equivalent uniform flow to case 5 is lower than v m it still turns out to be the first mode being excited the equivalent relationship of viv response between low kc number case and the uniform flow case with current velocity of 2 2 v m for the large scale riser is much clearer than the small scale one 7 conclusions a time domain force decomposition model of viv for flexible risers under steady and oscillatory flows is proposed the necessary hydrodynamic force coefficients are completely based on forced vibration experimental data the proposed numerical model is firstly verified well under steady flows by simulating a series of model tests at both high and low kc numbers the prediction accuracy of the proposed model for oscillatory flow cases is directly assessed as well then the comparisons of viv response between uniform and oscillatory flows are discussed and the differences as well as relationships are analyzed from the viv mechanism level finally two designed oscillatory flow cases of a 38 m large scale riser are simulated based on the proposed viv model for further research in summary several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 viv hydrodynamic force coefficient database originated from forced vibration test is applicable for oscillatory flow cases the proposed viv model can effectively predict the time domain structural response for flexible risers under both steady flow and most oscillatory flow situations viv response under the oscillatory flows with high maximum reduced velocity whose re is beyond the subcritical flow regime needs to be investigated furtherly with the help of more relevant experimental researches 2 several novel phenomena observed in test results such as intermittent viv amplitude modulation hysteresis frequency transition higher harmonics and developing process for viv response under oscillatory flows can also be captured in the predicted results viv response with different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities presents quite individual features which can be reasonably explained by analyzing the oscillation amplitude and period of the oscillatory flow with the viv mechanism 3 under the similar current velocity viv rms displacement for oscillatory flow case is generally smaller than the comparable uniform flow case with the same maximum reduced velocity the larger viv rms displacement appears at lower kc number 4 for large scale risers under high kc number cases mode jump is more likely to occur than the small scale ones and time varying viv response presents more complicated regularity the oscillatory flow case with low kc number can be approximately equivalent to a corresponding uniform flow case with current velocity of 2 2 v m overall the proposed time domain numerical model could give reasonable viv prediction results for flexible risers under steady and oscillatory flows it would make efforts to broaden the understanding of viv response characteristics under various current state and the predicted results can provide some references in the engineering design field the proposed viv numerical model is not necessarily optimal but is considered sufficient and easy to implement for such a challenging research frontier future works should focus on how to improve the prediction accuracy furtherly and simulate the higher harmonics precisely with the increasing understanding of viv mechanism under unsteady flows acknowledgement this paper is based on the projects supported by the national natural science foundation of

23707,evaluation of wave induced soil response is particularly important for coastal geotechnical engineers involved in the foundation design for marine structures such as immersed tunnels breakwaters platforms etc in this study a finite element model for the wave induced soil response around an immersed tunnel is developed in which the seabed is treated as a porous medium and characterized by biot s consolidation equations while the tunnel is considered as a single phase medium and behaves under a linear elastic law a new conceptual pore pressure buildup model is developed to investigate the wave induced residual liquefaction around the tunnel due to the accumulation of pore pressures under cyclic shearing the consolidation analysis of seabed foundation under the gravitational forces including the body forces of the structure is pre assessed and incorporated it is demonstrated from numerical results that the development of residual pore pressure is asymmetric in nature around the tunnel which may result in the uneven liquefaction depth and deformation in the seabed near the bottom of the tunnel thus compromising the stability of the structure parametric studies show that wave induced residual liquefaction is more likely to occur in the shallow seabed with lower relative density and permeability under the wave loading with higher wave height and longer period keywords residual liquefaction immersed tunnel biot s theory porous seabed pore pressure accumulation 1 introduction the underwater tunnels have been used extensively as a kind of underwater transporting passage crossing a river a canal a gulf or a strait these tunnels are placed on the ocean floor with different ways among which the immersed tube tunnel is an effective option by in turn dredging a trench on the sea bottom transporting and immersing the prefabricated tunnel elements to the trench connecting the elements to one another backfilling the trench and installing interior equipment an immersed tunnel can be constructed in the seabed because the immersed tunnels are embedded in a surface ground layer which is usually soft or loose the stability of an immersed tunnel depends largely on the behavior of the ambient ground in addition immersed tunnels are particularly sensitive to tensile and compressive deformations due to the ground failure and uneven settlement underneath consequently the stability of the seabed around the tunnel should be recognized as an important factor in the tunnel design the issue of ocean wave induced seabed response and instability has attracted great attention from geotechnical and coastal engineers since 1970s e g yamamoto et al 1978 mei and foda 1981 jeng 1997 jeng et al 2013 ye et al 2014 in general when the ocean waves propagate over a porous seabed the dynamic wave pressure acting on the seabed surface will further induce excess pore pressure in the seabed as the pore pressure exceeds a certain level the effective stress in soils vanishes and part of the seabed may be liquefied and become unstable two mechanisms for wave induced liquefaction have been reported in the literature depending on how the excess pore pressure is generated one is transient or oscillatory liquefaction which generally occurs momentarily under wave troughs when there is an upward seepage force due to the dissipation of pore pressure in seabed e g zen and yamamoto 1990 the other is termed as residual liquefaction which is due to the buildup of excess pore pressure caused by the volumetric contraction of soil under cyclic shearing e g sumer and fredsøe 2002 jeng et al 2007 sumer 2014 this paper is focused on the second mechanism of liquefaction the floatation of buried objects such as pipelines in liquefied soils under waves has been studied experimentally e g sumer et al 2006a generally sandy soil that has completely liquefied behaves like a liquid with a unit weight of about 2 t m3 whereas the apparent density of the immersed tunnel is usually around 1 t m3 e g kiyomiya 1995 that is the immersed tunnel in liquefied sandy soil will be subjected to a kind of upward buoyancy because the unit weight of liquefied soil is much heavier than that of the immersed tunnel therefore the evaluation of wave induced liquefaction is one of the key factors that should be considered in the construction of underwater tunnels seed and rahman 1978 were the first to set out a theory for checking for residual liquefaction in the case of waves which shows that the seabed subject to a progressive wave will be compressed under the wave crest and expanded under the wave trough accompanying with the generation of cyclic shear stresses in the seabed soils then the shear stresses and their associated shear deformations gradually rearrange the soil grains at the expense of the pore volume of the soil pressurizing the pore water leading to the buildup of pore pressure and presumably resulting in the residual liquefaction based on the 1d form of biot consolidation equation 1941 in yamamoto et al 1978 mcdougal et al 1989 subsequently introduced an accumulation source term associated with the surface water waves to calculate the accumulation of pore pressure in the seabed cheng et al 2001 proposed an analytical solution to re examine the solution developed by mcdougal et al 1989 sumer and fredsøe 2002 developed an analytical solution using fourier transforms to evaluate the buildup of pore pressure jeng et al 2007 re examined the wave induced residual soil response by developing both an analytical approximation and a numerical solution thereby providing a better prediction another approach for the wave induced residual soil response is poro elastoplastic model sekiguchi et al 1995 ignored the wave number and firstly proposed a 1d model for analyzing the response of cohesionless soil bed to standing waves based on centrifugal tests later an advanced finite element analysis involving rotation of the principal stresses was carried out by sassa and sekiguchi 2001 to date although the seismic response of undersea immersed tunnel has been studied in the last several decades e g kiyomiya 1995 cheng et al 2014 the research of wave induced response around immersed tunnels is quite limited e g kasper et al 2008 however the theoretical and numerical framework for embedded structures such as marine pipelines e g cheng and liu 1986 magda 1997 sumer et al 1999 2006a wang et al 2011 gao et al 2002 2012 kirca 2013 zhou et al 2013 zhao and jeng 2014 zhao et al 2016 could be referenced as it may affect the pore pressure in a similar manner as immersed tunnels the main objective of this paper is to investigate the wave induced liquefaction in the vicinity of an immersed tunnel due to the build up of pore pressure under cyclic shearing the model is developed by using the biot s consolidation equations for the solid fluid interactions and a diffusion equation with the new definition of the source term for the residual pore pressure generations in which the consolidation of porous seabed under gravitational forces of soils and tunnel is pre assessed and being applied as initial conditions the developed numerical framework is firstly compared with previous experimental data and analytical results to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness then the model is further applied to investigate the physical process involved in the dynamic response of porous seabed under the wave loading with a focus on the development of residual pore pressure and the resulting liquefaction around the tunnel finally the influences of various wave conditions and soil characteristics on the distribution of wave induced residual liquefaction around the tunnel are examined through a sensitivity analysis 1 1 governing equations and general solutions in a wave seabed interactions system the cyclic wave induced load at the surface of the seabed increases the pore water pressure in a cyclic manner as shown in fig 1 the wave induced pore pressure generated in a porous seabed p can be from two sources residual pore pressure also called period averaged pore pressure and oscillatory pore pressure at a fixed depth below the seabed surface the pore pressure development in the liquefiable soils or sediments can be expressed as 1 p p p where p is wave induced dynamic pore

x 9 τ x z τ z x g s w s x u s z where g s is shear modulus of soils which is related to young s modulus e s and poisson s ratio ν s as g s e s 2 1 ν s 1 3 residual soil response the residual pore pressure in a homogeneous isotropic soil could be derived from 1 d biot s consolidation equation and the empirical relation of pore pressure accumulation seed and rahman 1978 mcdougal et al 1989 sumer and fredsøe 2002 the 2 d residual soil response model used here is a continuation of these previous works and can be expressed as jeng and zhao 2014 10 p t c v 2 p x 2 2 p z 2 f x z t where c v is the coefficient of consolidation based on the plain strain when the compressibility of pore fluid is neglected and the expression of c v for saturated soils is 11 c v g s k f 1 2 ν s ρ f g f x z t in eg 10 is the source term which is defined as a function of both space and time 12 f x z t σ 0 t τ x z x z t α r σ 0 1 β r where τ x z x z t is the value of phase resolved oscillatory shear stress in the seabed σ 0 is the initial effective stress hence the term τ x z x z t σ 0 represents the cyclic phase resolved shear stress ratio which decides the pore pressure accumulation rate α r and β r are two empirical constants that were obtained with a large scale shear test and can be written as the functions of the relative density of soil d r as follows sumer et al 2012 13 α r 0 34 d r 0 084 β r 0 37 d r 0 46 actually there are many studies that revealed that the dynamic terms of solid skeleton and pore fluid might be important in evaluating the true dynamic response of seabed soil under wave action e g jeng and rahman 2000 ulker et al 2009 2010 in fact the extra source term on the right hand side of eq 10 i e f x z t was firstly obtained by research group of sumer sumer and fredsøe 2002 and then validated by the experimental data e g sumer et al 2012 and implemented in numerical calculation with satisfactory results e g zhao and jeng 2016 hence considering the inertial terms associated particularly with the soil solid motion could make the analysis in the present study more complete however it should be noted that eq 10 is derived directly from biot consolidation equations for a homogeneous isotropic soil mcdougal et al 1989 if the inertial term is considered eq 10 will be in a different form and the expression of the source term f x z t in eq 10 needs to be modified see appendix from the perspective of practice engineering however the simplified model proposed in this paper could predict the pore pressure growth in the seabed with satisfactory accuracy and is beneficial to be popularized and applied in ocean engineering in this study the initial stress status in the seabed foundation due to the existence of immersed tunnel is determined using the present model through an elastic consolidation process based on the plain strain condition the initial mean effective stress σ 0 σ x x 0 σ y y 0 σ z z 0 3 with σ y y 0 ν s σ x x 0 σ z z 0 then the distribution of initial mean effective stress σ 0 can be obtained using 14 σ 0 1 ν s 3 σ x x 0 σ z z 0 where σ x x 0 and σ z z 0 are the horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the seabed foundation after its completeness of consolidation process respectively 1 4 governing equations for tunnel the buried tunnel considered in this paper is assumed to be impermeable elastic medium with large stiffness hence the equations of motion for buried tunnel are governed by hooke s law 15 g t 2 u t x 2 2 u t z 2 g t 1 2 ν t x u t x w t z 0 16 g t 2 w t x 2 2 w t z 2 g t 1 2 ν t z u t x w t z ρ t g 0 where u t and w t are the displacements of tunnel in the x and z directions respectively ρ t is density of tunnel g t and ν t denote the shear modulus and poisson s ratio of the tunnel respectively 2 boundary conditions in this study a series of water waves are assumed to propagate over the porous seafloor with a finite thickness above a rigid impermeable bottom as shown in fig 2 a herein the water wave level is located at z h d and along the positive x direction and the vertical z axis is assumed upward from the rigid impermeable bottom at z 0 the depth of seawater is d and the thickness of the seabed is h the buried tunnel is placed on the bedding locating at the middle of the system and surrounded by the backfilling soils the main cross sectional dimensions of the tunnel are depicted in fig 2 b the thickness of overburden layer on the top of tunnel is h 1 and the thickness of the bedding is h 2 the slope gradient of backfill trench is 1 m 2 1 boundary conditions at the seabed surface the appropriate boundary conditions are required for the evaluation of the wave induced response in seabed at the seabed surface the vertical effective stress and shear stress vanish the residual pore pressure becomes zero and the pore pressure is equal to the wave pressure at the seabed surface 17 σ z z τ x z 0 p 0 p p b at z h the cyclic variation of pore pressure is estimated by an analytic formulation of wave pressure on the seabed surface as 18 p b x t p 0 cos k x ω t in which k is the wave number of progressive wave k 2π l l is the wave length ω is the wave frequency ω 2π t the relationship between the wave period t wave length l and water depth d is governed by 19 ω 2 g k tanh k d and p 0 denotes the amplitude of the wave pressure at the surface of seabed and can be presented as 20 p 0 ρ f g h 2 cosh k d where h is the wave height 2 2 boundary conditions at the seabed bottom and lateral boundaries since the soils rest on an impermeable and rigid base zero displacement and no vertical flow occurs at this bottom boundary which can be expressed as 21 u s w s 0 p z p z 0 at z 0 the lateral boundary of seabed is considered to be impermeable zero flux with no horizontal displacement 22 u s 0 p z p z 0 at x 0 and at x b 2 3 boundary conditions at the tunnel surface the inner surface of tunnel is free of stress while the outer surface is assumed as impermeable with zero pore pressure gradient i e 23 p z p z 0 it is assumed that there is no relative displacement between the soil and the outer surface of tunnel this is physically consistent since the immersed tunnel is made of concrete which would generate a high friction at the soil tunnel interface however for some marine objects i e submerged pipelines made of carbon polymers such as hdpe relative displacement may occur at the soil structure interface making the pore water pressure buildup behavior around the structure become totally different as demonstrated by sumer et al 2006b 3 numerical method and results the porous seabed model can be constructed with the aid of the pde partial differential equation module of comsol multiphysics comsol 5 2 which is a fem software with an internal solver algorithm based on theory of poroelasticity many problems of dynamic response in seabed 2 d and 3 d have been estimated using comsol multiphysics zhou et al 2013 zhao and jeng 2016 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 fem finite element model codes could be constructed within the comsol multiphysics by designing user s own governing equations and boundary conditions in a certain physical model the discretized equations in time are solved by using mumps a parallel sparse direct solver the seabed model configuration is 200 m 30 5 m the system is discretized into unstructured lagrange elements with a maximum global element size of 1 5 m while the local refinement of mesh is used in the region near the tunnel with a maximum element size of 0 3 m see fig 3 which helps to obtain more precise and detailed results in these regions the method of time stepping is bdf and the maximum time step is set to be 0 01 the input data for standard case computation are tabulated in table 1 3 1 model validations first the present model is verified for linear wave induced oscillatory stresses and pore pressure in the homogeneous poroelastic seabed without structure fig 4 shows the numerical results of the normalized values of maximum oscillatory pore pressure p p 0 stresses σ x x p 0 σ z z p 0 τ x z p 0 versus relative soil depth z h these results are compared with analytical solutions hsu and jeng 1994 and experiment results liu and jeng 2013 in liu and jeng 2013 an improved one dimensional facility was set up to investigate the vertical profile of pore pressure distributions in marine sediments which could simulate the case with large waves in natural ocean environments the parameters for the comparison are wave period t 9 s water depth d 5 m seabed thickness h 1 8 m soil permeability k f 1 8 10 4 m s shear modulus g s 12 7 mpa poisson s 1 8 10 4 m s ratio ν s 0 3 soil porosity n 0 425 saturation degree s r 0 975 as shown in fig 4 the present model overall agrees with the analytical solutions and slightly different from the laboratory experiments so far lots of laboratory test or field investigations have been carried out on the response of marine structures such as subsea pipelines e g cheng and liu 1986 however the available data related with immersed tunnel are quite limited so the present model is simplified to the case without tunnel and further comparisons between the experimental data sumer et al 2012 and the wave induced residual pore pressures from present model are carried out as demonstrated by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the initial mean effective stress in a porous seabed without structures can be calculated as σ 0 1 2 k 0 ρ ρ f g z 3 where k 0 is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure the input data are again given here wave period t 1 6 s wave height h 0 18 m seabed thickness h 0 4 m water depth d 0 55 m soil permeability k f 1 5 10 5 m s density of soil grain ρ s 2650 kg m3 soil porosity n 0 51 shear modulus g s 1 92 mpa poisson s ratio ν s 0 29 relative density of soil d r 0 28 coefficient of lateral earth pressure k 0 0 42 saturation degree s r 1 0 as depicted in fig 5 a and b the time variations of the period averaged residual pore pressures p calculated from present 2 d numerical mode are compared with the time series of the pore water pressure p observed in the experiments of sumer et al 2012 at two depths z 8 5 cm and z 24 cm respectively fig 6 compares the depth variation of the period averaged residual pore pressures from the present model with the experimental data at four different times from figs 5 and 6 it is observed that the results of the present model are qualitatively similar to those observed in the laboratory experiment the discrepancy in magnitude seems to increase as the location becomes closer to the seabed bottom this may be attributed to the theory of poro elasticity used in the present study in which some sophisticated plastic properties of soil such as densification which is nearly always associated with cyclic shearing due to soil skeleton dilation at large shear strains cannot be reflected appropriately as shown in fig 6 the difference between the two is less notable at the location not near the bottom of the soil except for the case of t 6 4 s moreover combined with fig 5 the calculated process of pore pressure growth in the interior of soil could basically be verified through the comparison with the experimental results in practical engineering most of the coastal structures are located near the seabed surface such as the immersed tunnel depicted in fig 2 a thus our model could provide a reasonable prediction of pore pressure accumulation in the seabed near the immersed structure 3 2 consolidation of the seabed in general the seabed has completed the consolidation process under the self gravity in natural marine environments however after the tube tunnel system including backfill and bedding materials is constructed the seabed in the vicinity of the immersed tunnel will be deformed due to the change of stress state then the seabed near the tunnel will reach a new balanced state hence to simulate the interaction between ocean waves seabed and tunnel the initial state of consolidation in the seabed due to the load of tube tunnel system should be determined before the ocean wave load is applied in the numerical model ye 2012 zhao and jeng 2016 in this study the actual mean effective stress considering the influence of structure in the seabed is obtained with the help of eq 16 in the design of the subsea tunnel the gravity of tunnel structure is usually set to be slightly greater than the buoyancy for the sake of simplicity the gravity of tunnel is assumed to be equal to the buoyancy in the numerical calculation while the earth pressure from the soils overlying the tunnel is viewed as a safety reserve of anti floating design in this case the gravity term of immersed tunnel in eq 16 could be neglected in fig 7 the distributions of the displacements v and u and initial mean effective stress σ 0 near the tunnel after consolidation of seabed under the loads of static water pressure and self gravity of tunnel are demonstrated respectively the distributions of vertical displacement and initial effective stress are shown to be layered in the region far away from tunnel which comes from the self gravity of seabed soils it is also noted from fig 7 a that the vertical displacement in the vicinity of tunnel is relatively smaller this upward relative displacement causes the soils near the seabed surface to move toward different sides of tunnel as shown in fig 7 b the maximum magnitudes of horizontal and vertical displacement are approximately 6 mm and 70 mm respectively the initial mean effective stress in fig 7 c is also shown to be significantly influenced by the existence of tunnel since the effective stress near the tunnel is shown to be reduced and the liquefaction becomes more likely to occur which will be discussed in detail in the following section 3 3 wave induced residual liquefaction of seabed the cumulative contraction of the soil under the action of ocean waves may cause a progressive buildup of pore pressure when the accumulated pore pressure reaches the level of the initial mean normal effective stress the residual liquefaction occurs and may cause the soils to lose the carrying capability thus failing to support tunnel the criterion for identifying the residual liquefaction zone under a 2d progressive wave sumer and fredsøe 2002 jeng 2013 is adopted as 24 p x z t σ 0 x z 1 where σ 0 x z is the initial mean effective stress after the consolidation process is completed as shown in fig 7 c the parameters for the numerical computation are given in table 1 at first 6 representative locations are selected at both sides of tunnel as a1 x 84 m z 23 m b1 x 84 m z 20 m c1 x 84 m z 19 m a2 x 116 m z 23 m b2 x 116 m z 20 m c2 x 116 m z 19 m with the horizontal distance from the outside of tunnel equal to 1 0 m see fig 2 a the developments of the residual pore pressure p σ 0 with time t t for these six points are depicted in fig 8 a it is found that for the considered three depths the liquefaction occurs earlier in the seabed closer to the seabed surface furthermore it should again be noted that the ocean waves are assumed to propagate along the positive direction of x axis i e from the left side of tunnel to the right as shown in fig 2 a the soils at the downstream region i e the seabed outside the right side of tunnel of the tunnel are liquefied earlier as shown in fig 8 a this could result in the uneven liquefaction distribution in the seabed at the bottom of the tunnel in practical engineering the cement deep mixing cdm soil improvement technique e g kasper et al 2008 may also be adopted to limit and control the differential settlements of the individual tunnel segments due to the asymmetric liquefaction distribution for comparison fig 8 b also gives the period averaged pore pressure buildup at the 6 positions in the same trench without immersed tunnel due to the construction of tunnel the distribution of wave induced cyclic shear stress in the computational domain may be changed significantly see later fig 12 which could further influence the growth of residual pore pressure generally the pore pressure near the tunnel in fig 8 a is demonstrated to increase faster than those in the free field to have a more comprehensive understanding of the residual pressure in the vicinity of the tunnel base the horizontal distribution of residual pore pressure at z 19 m i e 1 0 m below the tunnel bottom and vertical distribution of residual pore pressure at both sides of tunnel outsides x 84 m and z 116 m i e 1 0 m from the both sides of tunnel are respectively illustrated in figs 9 and 10 for various time t t the gray area represents the scope of vertical horizontal projection of the tunnel it can be seen from fig 9 that the soils near both sides of the tunnel basement are more apt to be liquefied compared the middle and the distance moreover the residual pressures in the soils of downstream region i e right side seabed accumulate faster than the upstream region i e left side seabed which is consistent with fig 8 as shown in fig 10 the liquefaction develops originally from a certain depth of seabed based on the initial consolidation status as well as the criterion of residual liquefaction zone i e eq 24 the development of liquefaction zone in the vicinity of an immersed tunnel with the increasing wave cycle t t is then illustrated in fig 11 the liquefaction emerges near the depth of 4 0 m in the seabed foundation below the mudline and then develops upward downward and outward as demonstrated in eq 14 the growth rate of pore pressure is closely related with the phase resolved oscillatory shear stress hence the generation of residual pressure and the corresponding liquefaction potential zone in the seabed could be significantly influenced by the distribution of shear stress for that reason the distribution of wave induced cyclic shear stress ratio τ x z σ 0 in the vicinity of immersed tunnel over a wave period is also calculated and given in fig 12 it is also noted that there always exist two shear stress concentration zones at the outside of tunnel near z 26 5 m this phenomenon is attributed to the shear strain concentrating in the seabed near the external parts of tunnel with irregular shape as well as the significant different stiffness at the interface between the tunnel structure and seabed foundation therefore the accumulation of pore pressure is more remarkable in these shear stress concentration zones which is also reflected from fig 10 3 4 effects of backfill properties on the residual liquefaction the soil characteristics have been recognized as dominant factors for both the wave induced transient liquefaction zhou et al 2013 and residual liquefaction sumer and fredsøe 2002 jeng et al 2007 jeng and zhao 2014 in the seabed in this paper the properties of the backfilling soils around the immersed tunnel could directly affect the liquefaction phenomenon which is closely related to the stability of the tunnel the properties of backfill examined here include the soil permeability k f shear modulus g s and relative density of the soils d r unless otherwise indicated the input data are selected from the standard case in table 1 the significant influence of soil permeability on the liquefaction zone in the vicinity of tunnel when t t 300 is shown in fig 13 the soil permeability is taken to be 1 10 5 m s 5 10 5 m s and 1 10 4 m s respectively under the same wave condition the maximum depth of residual liquefaction increases as permeability decreases since the pore fluids are more difficult to drain out in the soils with lower permeability the pore pressure builds up faster and is more likely to accumulate to a critical value inducing liquefaction in engineering practice after the immersion and localization of tunnel element the backfilling materials are placed around the tube until the whole trench is filled up in general the backfilling materials are normally loosely deposited and are difficult to be compacted to be sufficiently dense as a demonstration three relative densities 0 28 0 38 and 0 48 are used here to investigate the effects of various relative densities on the residual soil response around an immersed tunnel as shown in fig 14 the maximum depth of residual liquefaction reaches to a greater value in the loose backfill with low relative density this is due to that the liquefaction resistance of soils could increase with the increasing of relative density which has been verified experimentally e g yoshimi et al 1994 the shear modulus of soil is defined as the proportional coefficient in the shear stress strain relationship it varies from about 500 mpa for gravel or very dense sand to 0 5 mpa for silt and clay yamamoto et al 1978 since the shear modulus of a soil has been recognized as one of the dominant soil properties in the literature of soil mechanics it is beneficial to examine its effect on the residual liquefaction of seabed the shear modulus of backfill g s is assumed to be 2 mpa 20 mpa and 200 mpa respectively it is indicated from fig 15 that the liquefaction zone for g s 200 mpa has the deepest depth of liquefaction and smallest horizontal distribution range while that for g s 2 mpa has a wider range to figure out the reason behind this mechanism fig 16 gives the distribution of wave induced cyclic shear stress at a given moment t t 4 in the vicinity of tunnel which is embedded in the backfill with various shear moduli actually fig 16 b corresponds to the case when both the seabed and backfill materials have same shear modulus of 20 mpa as shown in see fig 16 a when the shear modulus of backfill materials g s 2 mpa is smaller than that of original seabed the wave induced shear stress is concentrated near the interface between the backfill and seabed especially the outside of the backfill due to the significant difference of shear modulus in this case compared with fig 16 b the wave induced shear stress could result in a more widely horizontal distribution of liquefaction see black line in fig 15 in the case when the backfill materials g s 200 mpa are harder than the seabed as illustrated in 16 c the shear stress is also induced near the slope side of the trench however unlike fig 16 a the shear stress is concentrated in the side of backfill in the trench which could limit the horizontal development of liquefaction under the trench see red line in fig 15 to reduce the liquefaction depth and width around the immersed tunnel the shear modulus of backfill should be close to that of original seabed 3 5 effects of wave characteristics on the residual liquefaction besides the soil characteristics the characteristics of ocean waves are also important for wave induced pore pressure accumulation in marine sediments in this section the dependence of residual liquefaction in the vicinity of a buried tunnel on two major wave characteristics wave period t and wave heights h is respectively discussed with a fixed still water depth the other input data for numerical examples are also listed in table 1 the wave height could directly influence the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface and then affect the wave induced pore pressure and effective stresses in the marine sediments the liquefaction zones in the vicinity of tunnel for the cases with three different wave heights h 3 4 and 5 m are illustrated in fig 17 the wave height has been commonly expressed in term of wave steepness h l in this example the wave steepness varies from 0 035 to 0 060 which is below the critical value for breaking wave additionally h d ratio is an important parameter for the non breaking stability of progressive waves and its maximum value is 0 31 which is also under the breaking limit the liquefaction potential in the case of h 5 m is observed to develop faster in the seabed adjacent to the tunnel compared to the other cases with h 3 m and h 4 m indicating that the seabed is more apt to be liquefied under larger wave loading the wave period is another wave parameter directly affecting the wavelength and is set to be t 6 s 8 s and 10 s respectively generally speaking the wave with longer wave period results in longer wavelength and leads to smaller relative depth d l with fixed water depth therefore as the wave period increases the pore pressure could accumulate to a greater value during each wave cycle which is consistent with the numerical results demonstrated in fig 18 the thickness of overburden over the tunnel could not only determine the distribution of initial mean normal effective stress but also has a further effect on pore water pressure buildup since the seabed including the backfilling soils is not a homogeneous material the configuration of the calculation model see fig 2 a will be changed when the buried depth for the tunnel is changed in fig 19 the result for the case with a deeper buried depth 3 m is demonstrated in this case the total thickness of seabed and other parameters are assumed to be the same as those in fig 11 as expected the increasing of embedded depth remarkably decreases the liquefaction potential around the tunnel 4 conclusions in this study a simplified quasi static numerical model is developed to investigate the problem of residual liquefaction around an immersed tunnel in the liquefiable seabed under the action of ocean waves the seabed is treated as a porous medium and characterized by biot s theory the present model is validated by laboratory experiments and analytical solutions available in the literature special attention is paid on the residual mechanism of pore pressure in the vicinity of immersed tunnel based on the numerical results main conclusions can be drawn 1 the wave induced residual liquefaction is closely associated with the initial consolidation status of seabed foundation under hydrostatic pressure and self gravity of seabed soils and immersed tunnel 2 since the buildup of pore pressure is closely related with the magnitude and distribution of wave induced shear stress in the seabed the residual liquefaction is observed to emerge initially from the shear stress concentration zones in the seabed near the external parts of tunnel with irregular shape and then extend laterally and vertically 3 the development of liquefaction zone around the tunnel is asymmetric in nature as the wave induced pore pressures near the downstream region of the tunnel accumulate faster than those near the upstream region this could result in the uneven liquefaction depth and inhomogeneous deformation in the seabed at the bottom of the tunnel the adverse effects from which the immersed tunnel should be sufficiently stable against 4 the maximum depth of residual liquefaction in the vicinity of immersed tunnel increases significantly with the decreasing permeability and relative density of backfilling soils hence controlling the permeability coefficient and compactness of the backfill will be an efficient way to reduce or to avoid the negative effects of residual liquefaction on the tunnel stability 5 the influences of wave characteristics such as wave period and wave height on the wave induced residual liquefaction are also significant the liquefaction potential in the seabed near the tunnel increases with the increase of wave height and wave period 6 another efficient way to reduce liquefaction potential around the tunnel is increasing embedded depth the downside of which is that it requires extra engineering work to excavate deeper trench and more backfill material acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments and constructive

23707,evaluation of wave induced soil response is particularly important for coastal geotechnical engineers involved in the foundation design for marine structures such as immersed tunnels breakwaters platforms etc in this study a finite element model for the wave induced soil response around an immersed tunnel is developed in which the seabed is treated as a porous medium and characterized by biot s consolidation equations while the tunnel is considered as a single phase medium and behaves under a linear elastic law a new conceptual pore pressure buildup model is developed to investigate the wave induced residual liquefaction around the tunnel due to the accumulation of pore pressures under cyclic shearing the consolidation analysis of seabed foundation under the gravitational forces including the body forces of the structure is pre assessed and incorporated it is demonstrated from numerical results that the development of residual pore pressure is asymmetric in nature around the tunnel which may result in the uneven liquefaction depth and deformation in the seabed near the bottom of the tunnel thus compromising the stability of the structure parametric studies show that wave induced residual liquefaction is more likely to occur in the shallow seabed with lower relative density and permeability under the wave loading with higher wave height and longer period keywords residual liquefaction immersed tunnel biot s theory porous seabed pore pressure accumulation 1 introduction the underwater tunnels have been used extensively as a kind of underwater transporting passage crossing a river a canal a gulf or a strait these tunnels are placed on the ocean floor with different ways among which the immersed tube tunnel is an effective option by in turn dredging a trench on the sea bottom transporting and immersing the prefabricated tunnel elements to the trench connecting the elements to one another backfilling the trench and installing interior equipment an immersed tunnel can be constructed in the seabed because the immersed tunnels are embedded in a surface ground layer which is usually soft or loose the stability of an immersed tunnel depends largely on the behavior of the ambient ground in addition immersed tunnels are particularly sensitive to tensile and compressive deformations due to the ground failure and uneven settlement underneath consequently the stability of the seabed around the tunnel should be recognized as an important factor in the tunnel design the issue of ocean wave induced seabed response and instability has attracted great attention from geotechnical and coastal engineers since 1970s e g yamamoto et al 1978 mei and foda 1981 jeng 1997 jeng et al 2013 ye et al 2014 in general when the ocean waves propagate over a porous seabed the dynamic wave pressure acting on the seabed surface will further induce excess pore pressure in the seabed as the pore pressure exceeds a certain level the effective stress in soils vanishes and part of the seabed may be liquefied and become unstable two mechanisms for wave induced liquefaction have been reported in the literature depending on how the excess pore pressure is generated one is transient or oscillatory liquefaction which generally occurs momentarily under wave troughs when there is an upward seepage force due to the dissipation of pore pressure in seabed e g zen and yamamoto 1990 the other is termed as residual liquefaction which is due to the buildup of excess pore pressure caused by the volumetric contraction of soil under cyclic shearing e g sumer and fredsøe 2002 jeng et al 2007 sumer 2014 this paper is focused on the second mechanism of liquefaction the floatation of buried objects such as pipelines in liquefied soils under waves has been studied experimentally e g sumer et al 2006a generally sandy soil that has completely liquefied behaves like a liquid with a unit weight of about 2 t m3 whereas the apparent density of the immersed tunnel is usually around 1 t m3 e g kiyomiya 1995 that is the immersed tunnel in liquefied sandy soil will be subjected to a kind of upward buoyancy because the unit weight of liquefied soil is much heavier than that of the immersed tunnel therefore the evaluation of wave induced liquefaction is one of the key factors that should be considered in the construction of underwater tunnels seed and rahman 1978 were the first to set out a theory for checking for residual liquefaction in the case of waves which shows that the seabed subject to a progressive wave will be compressed under the wave crest and expanded under the wave trough accompanying with the generation of cyclic shear stresses in the seabed soils then the shear stresses and their associated shear deformations gradually rearrange the soil grains at the expense of the pore volume of the soil pressurizing the pore water leading to the buildup of pore pressure and presumably resulting in the residual liquefaction based on the 1d form of biot consolidation equation 1941 in yamamoto et al 1978 mcdougal et al 1989 subsequently introduced an accumulation source term associated with the surface water waves to calculate the accumulation of pore pressure in the seabed cheng et al 2001 proposed an analytical solution to re examine the solution developed by mcdougal et al 1989 sumer and fredsøe 2002 developed an analytical solution using fourier transforms to evaluate the buildup of pore pressure jeng et al 2007 re examined the wave induced residual soil response by developing both an analytical approximation and a numerical solution thereby providing a better prediction another approach for the wave induced residual soil response is poro elastoplastic model sekiguchi et al 1995 ignored the wave number and firstly proposed a 1d model for analyzing the response of cohesionless soil bed to standing waves based on centrifugal tests later an advanced finite element analysis involving rotation of the principal stresses was carried out by sassa and sekiguchi 2001 to date although the seismic response of undersea immersed tunnel has been studied in the last several decades e g kiyomiya 1995 cheng et al 2014 the research of wave induced response around immersed tunnels is quite limited e g kasper et al 2008 however the theoretical and numerical framework for embedded structures such as marine pipelines e g cheng and liu 1986 magda 1997 sumer et al 1999 2006a wang et al 2011 gao et al 2002 2012 kirca 2013 zhou et al 2013 zhao and jeng 2014 zhao et al 2016 could be referenced as it may affect the pore pressure in a similar manner as immersed tunnels the main objective of this paper is to investigate the wave induced liquefaction in the vicinity of an immersed tunnel due to the build up of pore pressure under cyclic shearing the model is developed by using the biot s consolidation equations for the solid fluid interactions and a diffusion equation with the new definition of the source term for the residual pore pressure generations in which the consolidation of porous seabed under gravitational forces of soils and tunnel is pre assessed and being applied as initial conditions the developed numerical framework is firstly compared with previous experimental data and analytical results to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness then the model is further applied to investigate the physical process involved in the dynamic response of porous seabed under the wave loading with a focus on the development of residual pore pressure and the resulting liquefaction around the tunnel finally the influences of various wave conditions and soil characteristics on the distribution of wave induced residual liquefaction around the tunnel are examined through a sensitivity analysis 1 1 governing equations and general solutions in a wave seabed interactions system the cyclic wave induced load at the surface of the seabed increases the pore water pressure in a cyclic manner as shown in fig 1 the wave induced pore pressure generated in a porous seabed p can be from two sources residual pore pressure also called period averaged pore pressure and oscillatory pore pressure at a fixed depth below the seabed surface the pore pressure development in the liquefiable soils or sediments can be expressed as 1 p p p where p is wave induced dynamic pore pressures p denotes the oscillatory component that may lead to momentary liquefaction e g jeng 1997 zen and yamamoto 1990 and k f ρ f g 2 p z 2 2 u t z n β p t k f g 3 u t 2 z 0 denotes the residual component that may lead to residual liquefaction e g sumer and fredsøe 2002 sassa and sekiguchi 2001 and can be defined by 2 p 1 t t t t p d t where t is wave period and t is time 1 2 oscillatory soil response considering the porous seabed as hydraulically isotropic with the same permeability k f in all directions the conservation of mass can be written as 3 k f 2 p x 2 2 p z 2 ρ f g n β p t ρ f g t u s x w s z 0 where ρ f is the density of pore water g is the gravitational acceleration n is the soil porosity 3 p t 3 and w s are the soil displacements in the x and z directions respectively β is the compressibility of the pore fluid which can be expressed by the apparent bulk modulus of the pore fluid k f and the saturation degree s r verruijt 1969 as 4 β 1 k f 1 k w 1 s r p 0 where k w is the true bulk modulus of water and p o is the absolute not excess pore water pressure which can be taken to be p o ρ f g d d is the water depth when the pore water is gas air free s r will be unity therefore k f will be equal to k w here the inertial terms are ignored in flow and deformation formulation then the governing equations become biot 1941 5 σ x x x τ x z z p x 0 6 τ x z x σ z z z ρ g p z 0 where σ x x and σ z z are the effective normal stresses in the x and z directions respectively τ x z is the shear stress ρ is the total density of the porous soil ρ 1 n ρ s n ρ f ρ s is the density of solid grain this conventional consolidation theory has been widely used for the wave induced soil response in marine environment and hence used in this study based on the poro elastic theory the relationships between the elastic incremental effective stresses and displacements are further given as 7 σ x x 2 g s 1 2 ν s 1 ν s u s x ν s w s z 8 σ z z 2 g s 1 2 ν s 1 ν s w s z ν s u s

pressure in a homogeneous isotropic soil could be derived from 1 d biot s consolidation equation and the empirical relation of pore pressure accumulation seed and rahman 1978 mcdougal et al 1989 sumer and fredsøe 2002 the 2 d residual soil response model used here is a continuation of these previous works and can be expressed as jeng and zhao 2014 10 p t c v 2 p x 2 2 p z 2 f x z t where c v is the coefficient of consolidation based on the plain strain when the compressibility of pore fluid is neglected and the expression of c v for saturated soils is 11 c v g s k f 1 2 ν s ρ f g f x z t in eg 10 is the source term which is defined as a function of both space and time 12 f x z t σ 0 t τ x z x z t α r σ 0 1 β r where τ x z x z t is the value of phase resolved oscillatory shear stress in the seabed σ 0 is the initial effective stress hence the term τ x z x z t σ 0 represents the cyclic phase resolved shear stress ratio which decides the pore pressure accumulation rate α r and β r are two empirical constants that were obtained with a large scale shear test and can be written as the functions of the relative density of soil d r as follows sumer et al 2012 13 α r 0 34 d r 0 084 β r 0 37 d r 0 46 actually there are many studies that revealed that the dynamic terms of solid skeleton and pore fluid might be important in evaluating the true dynamic response of seabed soil under wave action e g jeng and rahman 2000 ulker et al 2009 2010 in fact the extra source term on the right hand side of eq 10 i e f x z t was firstly obtained by research group of sumer sumer and fredsøe 2002 and then validated by the experimental data e g sumer et al 2012 and implemented in numerical calculation with satisfactory results e g zhao and jeng 2016 hence considering the inertial terms associated particularly with the soil solid motion could make the analysis in the present study more complete however it should be noted that eq 10 is derived directly from biot consolidation equations for a homogeneous isotropic soil mcdougal et al 1989 if the inertial term is considered eq 10 will be in a different form and the expression of the source term f x z t in eq 10 needs to be modified see appendix from the perspective of practice engineering however the simplified model proposed in this paper could predict the pore pressure growth in the seabed with satisfactory accuracy and is beneficial to be popularized and applied in ocean engineering in this study the initial stress status in the seabed foundation due to the existence of immersed tunnel is determined using the present model through an elastic consolidation process based on the plain strain condition the initial mean effective stress σ 0 σ x x 0 σ y y 0 σ z z 0 3 with σ y y 0 ν s σ x x 0 σ z z 0 then the distribution of initial mean effective stress σ 0 can be obtained using 14 σ 0 1 ν s 3 σ x x 0 σ z z 0 where σ x x 0 and σ z z 0 are the horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the seabed foundation after its completeness of consolidation process respectively 1 4 governing equations for tunnel the buried tunnel considered in this paper is assumed to be impermeable elastic medium with large stiffness hence the equations of motion for buried tunnel are governed by hooke s law 15 g t 2 u t x 2 2 u t z 2 g t 1 2 ν t x u t x w t z 0 16 g t 2 w t x 2 2 w t z 2 g t 1 2 ν t z u t x w t z ρ t g 0 where u t and w t are the displacements of tunnel in the x and z directions respectively ρ t is density of tunnel g t and ν t denote the shear modulus and poisson s ratio of the tunnel respectively 2 boundary conditions in this study a series of water waves are assumed to propagate over the porous seafloor with a finite thickness above a rigid impermeable bottom as shown in fig 2 a herein the water wave level is located at z h d and along the positive x direction and the vertical z axis is assumed upward from the rigid impermeable bottom at z 0 the depth of seawater is d and the thickness of the seabed is h the buried tunnel is placed on the bedding locating at the middle of the system and surrounded by the backfilling soils the main cross sectional dimensions of the tunnel are depicted in fig 2 b the thickness of overburden layer on the top of tunnel is h 1 and the thickness of the bedding is h 2 the slope gradient of backfill trench is 1 m 2 1 boundary conditions at the seabed surface the appropriate boundary conditions are required for the evaluation of the wave induced response in seabed at the seabed surface the vertical effective stress and shear stress vanish the residual pore pressure becomes zero and the pore pressure is equal to the wave pressure at the seabed surface 17 σ z z τ x z 0 p 0 p p b at z h the cyclic variation of pore pressure is estimated by an analytic formulation of wave pressure on the seabed surface as 18 p b x t p 0 cos k x ω t in which k is the wave number of progressive wave k 2π l l is the wave length ω is the wave frequency ω 2π t the relationship between the wave period t wave length l and water depth d is governed by 19 ω 2 g k tanh k d and p 0 denotes the amplitude of the wave pressure at the surface of seabed and can be presented as 20 p 0 ρ f g h 2 cosh k d where h is the wave height 2 2 boundary conditions at the seabed bottom and lateral boundaries since the soils rest on an impermeable and rigid base zero displacement and no vertical flow occurs at this bottom boundary which can be expressed as 21 u s w s 0 p z p z 0 at z 0 the lateral boundary of seabed is considered to be impermeable zero flux with no horizontal displacement 22 u s 0 p z p z 0 at x 0 and at x b 2 3 boundary conditions at the tunnel surface the inner surface of tunnel is free of stress while the outer surface is assumed as impermeable with zero pore pressure gradient i e 23 p z p z 0 it is assumed that there is no relative displacement between the soil and the outer surface of tunnel this is physically consistent since the immersed tunnel is made of concrete which would generate a high friction at the soil tunnel interface however for some marine objects i e submerged pipelines made of carbon polymers such as hdpe relative displacement may occur at the soil structure interface making the pore water pressure buildup behavior around the structure become totally different as demonstrated by sumer et al 2006b 3 numerical method and results the porous seabed model can be constructed with the aid of the pde partial differential equation module of comsol multiphysics comsol 5 2 which is a fem software with an internal solver algorithm based on theory of poroelasticity many problems of dynamic response in seabed 2 d and 3 d have been estimated using comsol multiphysics zhou et al 2013 zhao and jeng 2016 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 fem finite element model codes could be constructed within the comsol multiphysics by designing user s own governing equations and boundary conditions in a certain physical model the discretized equations in time are solved by using mumps a parallel sparse direct solver the seabed model configuration is 200 m 30 5 m the system is discretized into unstructured lagrange elements with a maximum global element size of 1 5 m while the local refinement of mesh is used in the region near the tunnel with a maximum element size of 0 3 m see fig 3 which helps to obtain more precise and detailed results in these regions the method of time stepping is bdf and the maximum time step is set to be 0 01 the input data for standard case computation are tabulated in table 1 3 1 model validations first the present model is verified for linear wave induced oscillatory stresses and pore pressure in the homogeneous poroelastic seabed without structure fig 4 shows the numerical results of the normalized values of maximum oscillatory pore pressure p p 0 stresses σ x x p 0 σ z z p 0 τ x z p 0 versus relative soil depth z h these results are compared with analytical solutions hsu and jeng 1994 and experiment results liu and jeng 2013 in liu and jeng 2013 an improved one dimensional facility was set up to investigate the vertical profile of pore pressure distributions in marine sediments which could simulate the case with large waves in natural ocean environments the parameters for the comparison are wave period t 9 s water depth d 5 m seabed thickness h 1 8 m soil permeability k f 1 8 10 4 m s shear modulus g s 12 7 mpa poisson s 1 8 10 4 m s ratio ν s 0 3 soil porosity n 0 425 saturation degree s r 0 975 as shown in fig 4 the present model overall agrees with the analytical solutions and slightly different from the laboratory experiments so far lots of laboratory test or field investigations have been carried out on the response of marine structures such as subsea pipelines e g cheng and liu 1986 however the available data related with immersed tunnel are quite limited so the present model is simplified to the case without tunnel and further comparisons between the experimental data sumer et al 2012 and the wave induced residual pore pressures from present model are carried out as demonstrated by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the initial mean effective stress in a porous seabed without structures can be calculated as σ 0 1 2 k 0 ρ ρ f g z 3 where k 0 is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure the input data are again given here wave period t 1 6 s wave height h 0 18 m seabed thickness h 0 4 m water depth d 0 55 m soil permeability k f 1 5 10 5 m s density of soil grain ρ s 2650 kg m3 soil porosity n 0 51 shear modulus g s 1 92 mpa poisson s ratio ν s 0 29 relative density of soil d r 0 28 coefficient of lateral earth pressure k 0 0 42 saturation degree s r 1 0 as depicted in fig 5 a and b the time variations of the period averaged residual pore pressures p calculated from present 2 d numerical mode are compared with the time series of the pore water pressure p observed in the experiments of sumer et al 2012 at two depths z 8 5 cm and z 24 cm respectively fig 6 compares the depth variation of the period averaged residual pore pressures from the present model with the experimental data at four different times from figs 5 and 6 it is observed that the results of the present model are qualitatively similar to those observed in the laboratory experiment the discrepancy in magnitude seems to increase as the location becomes closer to the seabed bottom this may be attributed to the theory of poro elasticity used in the present study in which some sophisticated plastic properties of soil such as densification which is nearly always associated with cyclic shearing due to soil skeleton dilation at large shear strains cannot be reflected appropriately as shown in fig 6 the difference between the two is less notable at the location not near the bottom of the soil except for the case of t 6 4 s moreover combined with fig 5 the calculated process of pore pressure growth in the interior of soil could basically be verified through the comparison with the experimental results in practical engineering most of the coastal structures are located near the seabed surface such as the immersed tunnel depicted in fig 2 a thus our model could provide a reasonable prediction of pore pressure accumulation in the seabed near the immersed structure 3 2 consolidation of the seabed in general the seabed has completed the consolidation process under the self gravity in natural marine environments however after the tube tunnel system including backfill and bedding materials is constructed the seabed in the vicinity of the immersed tunnel will be deformed due to the change of stress state then the seabed near the tunnel will reach a new balanced state hence to simulate the interaction between ocean waves seabed and tunnel the initial state of consolidation in the seabed due to the load of tube tunnel system should be determined before the ocean wave load is applied in the numerical model ye 2012 zhao and jeng 2016 in this study the actual mean effective stress considering the influence of structure in the seabed is obtained with the help of eq 16 in the design of the subsea tunnel the gravity of tunnel structure is usually set to be slightly greater than the buoyancy for the sake of simplicity the gravity of tunnel is assumed to be equal to the buoyancy in the numerical calculation while the earth pressure from the soils overlying the tunnel is viewed as a safety reserve of anti floating design in this case the gravity term of immersed tunnel in eq 16 could be neglected in fig 7 the distributions of the displacements v and u and initial mean effective stress σ 0 near the tunnel after consolidation of seabed under the loads of static water pressure and self gravity of tunnel are demonstrated respectively the distributions of vertical displacement and initial effective stress are shown to be layered in the region far away from tunnel which comes from the self gravity of seabed soils it is also noted from fig 7 a that the vertical displacement in the vicinity of tunnel is relatively smaller this upward relative displacement causes the soils near the seabed surface to move toward different sides of tunnel as shown in fig 7 b the maximum magnitudes of horizontal and vertical displacement are approximately 6 mm and 70 mm respectively the initial mean effective stress in fig 7 c is also shown to be significantly influenced by the existence of tunnel since the effective stress near the tunnel is shown to be reduced and the liquefaction becomes more likely to occur which will be discussed in detail in the following section 3 3 wave induced residual liquefaction of seabed the cumulative contraction of the soil under the action of ocean waves may cause a progressive buildup of pore pressure when the accumulated pore pressure reaches the level of the initial mean normal effective stress the residual liquefaction occurs and may cause the soils to lose the carrying capability thus failing to support tunnel the criterion for identifying the residual liquefaction zone under a 2d progressive wave sumer and fredsøe 2002 jeng 2013 is adopted as 24 p x z t σ 0 x z 1 where σ 0 x z is the initial mean effective stress after the consolidation process is completed as shown in fig 7 c the parameters for the numerical computation are given in table 1 at first 6 representative locations are selected at both sides of tunnel as a1 x 84 m z 23 m b1 x 84 m z 20 m c1 x 84 m z 19 m a2 x 116 m z 23 m b2 x 116 m z 20 m c2 x 116 m z 19 m with the horizontal distance from the outside of tunnel equal to 1 0 m see fig 2 a the developments of the residual pore pressure p σ 0 with time t t for these six points are depicted in fig 8 a it is found that for the considered three depths the liquefaction occurs earlier in the seabed closer to the seabed surface furthermore it should again be noted that the ocean waves are assumed to propagate along the positive direction of x axis i e from the left side of tunnel to the right as shown in fig 2 a the soils at the downstream region i e the seabed outside the right side of tunnel of the tunnel are liquefied earlier as shown in fig 8 a this could result in the uneven liquefaction distribution in the seabed at the bottom of the tunnel in practical engineering the cement deep mixing cdm soil improvement technique e g kasper et al 2008 may also be adopted to limit and control the differential settlements of the individual tunnel segments due to the asymmetric liquefaction distribution for comparison fig 8 b also gives the period averaged pore pressure buildup at the 6 positions in the same trench without immersed tunnel due to the construction of tunnel the distribution of wave induced cyclic shear stress in the computational domain may be changed significantly see later fig 12 which could further influence the growth of residual pore pressure generally the pore pressure near the tunnel in fig 8 a is demonstrated to increase faster than those in the free field to have a more comprehensive understanding of the residual pressure in the vicinity of the tunnel base the horizontal distribution of residual pore pressure at z 19 m i e 1 0 m below the tunnel bottom and vertical distribution of residual pore pressure at both sides of tunnel outsides x 84 m and z 116 m i e 1 0 m from the both sides of tunnel are respectively illustrated in figs 9 and 10 for various time t t the gray area represents the scope of vertical horizontal projection of the tunnel it can be seen from fig 9 that the soils near both sides of the tunnel basement are more apt to be liquefied compared the middle and the distance moreover the residual pressures in the soils of downstream region i e right side seabed accumulate faster than the upstream region i e left side seabed which is consistent with fig 8 as shown in fig 10 the liquefaction develops originally from a certain depth of seabed based on the initial consolidation status as well as the criterion of residual liquefaction zone i e eq 24 the development of liquefaction zone in the vicinity of an immersed tunnel with the increasing wave cycle t t is then illustrated in fig 11 the liquefaction emerges near the depth of 4 0 m in the seabed foundation below the mudline and then develops upward downward and outward as demonstrated in eq 14 the growth rate of pore pressure is closely related with the phase resolved oscillatory shear stress hence the generation of residual pressure and the corresponding liquefaction potential zone in the seabed could be significantly influenced by the distribution of shear stress for that reason the distribution of wave induced cyclic shear stress ratio τ x z σ 0 in the vicinity of immersed tunnel over a wave period is also calculated and given in fig 12 it is also noted that there always exist two shear stress concentration zones at the outside of tunnel near z 26 5 m this phenomenon is attributed to the shear strain concentrating in the seabed near the external parts of tunnel with irregular shape as well as the significant different stiffness at the interface between the tunnel structure and seabed foundation therefore the accumulation of pore pressure is more remarkable in these shear stress concentration zones which is also reflected from fig 10 3 4 effects of backfill properties on the residual liquefaction the soil characteristics have been recognized as dominant factors for both the wave induced transient liquefaction zhou et al 2013 and residual liquefaction sumer and fredsøe 2002 jeng et al 2007 jeng and zhao 2014 in the seabed in this paper the properties of the backfilling soils around the immersed tunnel could directly affect the liquefaction phenomenon which is closely related to the stability of the tunnel the properties of backfill examined here include the soil permeability k f shear modulus g s and relative density of the soils d r unless otherwise indicated the input data are selected from the standard case in table 1 the significant influence of soil permeability on the liquefaction zone in the vicinity of tunnel when t t 300 is shown in fig 13 the soil permeability is taken to be 1 10 5 m s 5 10 5 m s and 1 10 4 m s respectively under the same wave condition the maximum depth of residual liquefaction increases as permeability decreases since the pore fluids are more difficult to drain out in the soils with lower permeability the pore pressure builds up faster and is more likely to accumulate to a critical value inducing liquefaction in engineering practice after the immersion and localization of tunnel element the backfilling materials are placed around the tube until the whole trench is filled up in general the backfilling materials are normally loosely deposited and are difficult to be compacted to be sufficiently dense as a demonstration three relative densities 0 28 0 38 and 0 48 are used here to investigate the effects of various relative densities on the residual soil response around an immersed tunnel as shown in fig 14 the maximum depth of residual liquefaction reaches to a greater value in the loose backfill with low relative density this is due to that the liquefaction resistance of soils could increase with the increasing of relative density which has been verified experimentally e g yoshimi et al 1994 the shear modulus of soil is defined as the proportional coefficient in the shear stress strain relationship it varies from about 500 mpa for gravel or very dense sand to 0 5 mpa for silt and clay yamamoto et al 1978 since the shear modulus of a soil has been recognized as one of the dominant soil properties in the literature of soil mechanics it is beneficial to examine its effect on the residual liquefaction of seabed the shear modulus of backfill g s is assumed to be 2 mpa 20 mpa and 200 mpa respectively it is indicated from fig 15 that the liquefaction zone for g s 200 mpa has the deepest depth of liquefaction and smallest horizontal distribution range while that for g s 2 mpa has a wider range to figure out the reason behind this mechanism fig 16 gives the distribution of wave induced cyclic shear stress at a given moment t t 4 in the vicinity of tunnel which is embedded in the backfill with various shear moduli actually fig 16 b corresponds to the case when both the seabed and backfill materials have same shear modulus of 20 mpa as shown in see fig 16 a when the shear modulus of backfill materials g s 2 mpa is smaller than that of original seabed the wave induced shear stress is concentrated near the interface between the backfill and seabed especially the outside of the backfill due to the significant difference of shear modulus in this case compared with fig 16 b the wave induced shear stress could result in a more widely horizontal distribution of liquefaction see black line in fig 15 in the case when the backfill materials g s 200 mpa are harder than the seabed as illustrated in 16 c the shear stress is also induced near the slope side of the trench however unlike fig 16 a the shear stress is concentrated in the side of backfill in the trench which could limit the horizontal development of liquefaction under the trench see red line in fig 15 to reduce the liquefaction depth and width around the immersed tunnel the shear modulus of backfill should be close to that of original seabed 3 5 effects of wave characteristics on the residual liquefaction besides the soil characteristics the characteristics of ocean waves are also important for wave induced pore pressure accumulation in marine sediments in this section the dependence of residual liquefaction in the vicinity of a buried tunnel on two major wave characteristics wave period t and wave heights h is respectively discussed with a fixed still water depth the other input data for numerical examples are also listed in table 1 the wave height could directly influence the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface and then affect the wave induced pore pressure and effective stresses in the marine sediments the liquefaction zones in the vicinity of tunnel for the cases with three different wave heights h 3 4 and 5 m are illustrated in fig 17 the wave height has been commonly expressed in term of wave steepness h l in this example the wave steepness varies from 0 035 to 0 060 which is below the critical value for breaking wave additionally h d ratio is an important parameter for the non breaking stability of progressive waves and its maximum value is 0 31 which is also under the breaking limit the liquefaction potential in the case of h 5 m is observed to develop faster in the seabed adjacent to the tunnel compared to the other cases with h 3 m and h 4 m indicating that the seabed is more apt to be liquefied under larger wave loading the wave period is another wave parameter directly affecting the wavelength and is set to be t 6 s 8 s and 10 s respectively generally speaking the wave with longer wave period results in longer wavelength and leads to smaller relative depth d l with fixed water depth therefore as the wave period increases the pore pressure could accumulate to a greater value during each wave cycle which is consistent with the numerical results demonstrated in fig 18 the thickness of overburden over the tunnel could not only determine the distribution of initial mean normal effective stress but also has a further effect on pore water pressure buildup since the seabed including the backfilling soils is not a homogeneous material the configuration of the calculation model see fig 2 a will be changed when the buried depth for the tunnel is changed in fig 19 the result for the case with a deeper buried depth 3 m is demonstrated in this case the total thickness of seabed and other parameters are assumed to be the same as those in fig 11 as expected the increasing of embedded depth remarkably decreases the liquefaction potential around the tunnel 4 conclusions in this study a simplified quasi static numerical model is developed to investigate the problem of residual liquefaction around an immersed tunnel in the liquefiable seabed under the action of ocean waves the seabed is treated as a porous medium and characterized by biot s theory the present model is validated by laboratory experiments and analytical solutions available in the literature special attention is paid on the residual mechanism of pore pressure in the vicinity of immersed tunnel based on the numerical results main conclusions can be drawn 1 the wave induced residual liquefaction is closely associated with the initial consolidation status of seabed foundation under hydrostatic pressure and self gravity of seabed soils and immersed tunnel 2 since the buildup of pore pressure is closely related with the magnitude and distribution of wave induced shear stress in the seabed the residual liquefaction is observed to emerge initially from the shear stress concentration zones in the seabed near the external parts of tunnel with irregular shape and then extend laterally and vertically 3 the development of liquefaction zone around the tunnel is asymmetric in nature as the wave induced pore pressures near the downstream region of the tunnel accumulate faster than those near the upstream region this could result in the uneven liquefaction depth and inhomogeneous deformation in the seabed at the bottom of the tunnel the adverse effects from which the immersed tunnel should be sufficiently stable against 4 the maximum depth of residual liquefaction in the vicinity of immersed tunnel increases significantly with the decreasing permeability and relative density of backfilling soils hence controlling the permeability coefficient and compactness of the backfill will be an efficient way to reduce or to avoid the negative effects of residual liquefaction on the tunnel stability 5 the influences of wave characteristics such as wave period and wave height on the wave induced residual liquefaction are also significant the liquefaction potential in the seabed near the tunnel increases with the increase of wave height and wave period 6 another efficient way to reduce liquefaction potential around the tunnel is increasing embedded depth the downside of which is that it requires extra engineering work to excavate deeper trench and more backfill material acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments and constructive

23708,the emergence of commercial offshore floating renewable energy devices that are expected to be deployed in large integrated arrays in relatively shallow water requires anchor types that are suited to sandy seabeds this paper considers centrifuge test data that quantify the capacity of a novel dynamically installed plate anchor in sand under drained monotonic and cyclic loading the monotonic tests investigated the role of the eccentricity of the load attachment point from the plate the mooring line load inclination at the seabed and the plate embedment depth whereas the cyclic tests examined the capacity mobilisation due to both regular and irregular drained cyclic loading for a fixed embedment depth and seabed load inclination the test data indicate that an optimal anchor design would employ a load attachment point that is eccentric from the plate by at least 0 6 times the plate height and that the anchor provides higher capacity when the seabed load inclination is horizontal catenary mooring than when it is vertical vertical taut mooring the centrifuge data show that drained cyclic loading does not degrade anchor capacity and may be beneficial provided the cyclic loading involves a history of lower level cyclic loading that densifies the sand keywords anchors sands offshore engineering renewable energy capacity 1 introduction offshore renewable energy

station using mooring lines that terminate at anchors located on or embedded in the seabed knappett et al 2015 diaz et al 2016 and gaudin et al 2017 review existing anchor technology in the context of the technical requirements and economic constraints associated with offshore floating renewable energy these studies note that plate anchors are attractive due to their high holding capacity yet low size and weight although difficulties in installing plate anchors in the sand dominated seabeds that floating energy devices are likely to be located may constrain their use plate anchors may be installed by drag embedment although adequate penetration of drag anchors in sand is notoriously difficult and challenging to predict neubecker and randolph 1996 heurlin et al 2015 o loughlin et al 2017 other anchor types such as driven piles may be used although they are less efficient and installation requirements and durations are considerable this has the potential to seriously impact the economics of emerging marine renewable energy technologies which will be deployed in large integrated arrays requiring a large number of accurately positioned anchors an alternative solution could be dynamically installed anchors which require minimal installation time and can be deployed without the need for dedicated ancillary equipment such as pile hammers dynamically installed anchors are installed by allowing them to free fall through the water column such that the combination of their self weight and the kinetic energy gained through free fall embed them into the seabed various anchor designs have been proposed for deep water soft sediments e g lieng et al 2000 medeiros jr 2002 shelton 2007 o loughlin et al 2014 and have been used or considered for offshore oil and gas floating facilities current dynamically installed anchors are generally perceived to be less suitable for sand due to the dilatant behaviour of sand and concerns regarding embedment potential however alternative dynamically installed anchor designs may achieve higher penetrations in sand and prove to be a viable anchoring solution for granular seabed deposits e g gerkus et al 2016 this paper considers one such dynamically installed anchor concept that has been designed primarily for sand although may also prove to be feasible in other seabed sediments the anchor and the installation process is conceptually shown in fig 1 the anchor adopts a thin blade like design which contrasts with the majority of existing dynamically installed anchor designs that typically utilise solid cylindrical shafts with conical or ellipsoidal tips o loughlin et al 2004 the anchor features a plate at its lower end that is attached to an upper removable follower that provides the additional mass to increase penetration potential in cross section the plate is comprised of two thin blades that project from a central core and taper from a maximum width at the top of the plate to zero width at the bottom of the plate two additional fins at the trailing end of the upper follower fig 1 are included to improve hydrodynamic stability during freefall in water following embedment the follower is retrieved to the installation vessel for re use in the next installation leaving the plate anchor vertically embedded in the seabed the embedment potential of the anchor has been demonstrated through centrifuge tests in loose and dense silica sand chow et al 2017 anchor tip embedments were in the range 0 9 2 2 times the plate height in these centrifuge tests and were strongly dependent on impact velocity follower mass and sand density this suggests that deeper anchor embedment could be achieved by geometrically optimising the follower subsequent centrifuge studies investigated the monotonic and cyclic capacity of the anchor in saturated dense silica sand to quantify the capacity potential of the anchor the results from these studies are considered in this paper 2 centrifuge tests 2 1 soil properties and sample preparation the centrifuge tests were conducted in medium dense sand samples that were prepared using a commercially available fine sub angular silica sand with properties as listed in table 1 seven sand samples were prepared at 1g in centrifuge sample containers with internal dimensions of 650 390 325 mm length width depth by air pluviation to give final sample heights of approximately 200 mm each sample was vacuum levelled to create a level surface and then saturated with water from the base of the container about 40 mm of free water was maintained above the sand surface during the centrifuge testing the relative density was d r 66 3 saturated densities ρ sat 2034 2043 kg cm3 with the exception of one slightly looser sample for which d r 53 ρ sat 2017 kg cm3 each sample was spun to the testing acceleration of 50 g and two cone penetrometer tests cpts were conducted to characterise the samples the cone penetrometer tests were performed using a model cone penetrometer with a diameter of 10 mm penetrated at a velocity v 1 mm s such that the response is expected to be drained silva and bolton 2004 as shown in fig 2 the cone tip resistance q c increases with depth in all samples which reflects the increasing vertical effective stress with depth variations in q c between samples are consistent with the measured range in d r and indicate that the profile of strength and density is relatively consistent across the seven samples 2 2 model anchors and mooring line four model anchors a1 a2 a3 a4 were manufactured for the centrifuge tests as shown in fig 3 each model anchor was wire cut electrical discharge machining from a single block of stainless steel followed by precision machining to achieve the detail around the anchor padeye and the taper on the plate the models are at a 1 50 reduced scale and maintain the same material density as the field scale anchor such that the centrifuge scaling laws garnier et al 2007 apply these imply that a practically sized full scale anchor would have a plate height of 2 4 m a follower length of 7 25 m with a mass of 5134 kg and an anchor mass of between 1290 and 1960 kg depending on the anchor although variations on this are to be expected based on the mooring requirements the mooring line was modelled using 1 mm diameter stainless steel wire rated to a minimum breaking load of 1 1 kn fig 3d anchor a1 fig 3 reflects the original design as shown in fig 1 and has a plate mass m 10 32 g plate width w 36 mm plate length l p 48 mm and plate thickness t 1 52 mm at the central core thinning out to t 0 1 mm at the edge the anchor padeye in the original design and hence in anchor a1 is located at an eccentricity normal to the plate e n 7 mm padeye eccentricity ratio e n l p 0 15 initial tests using the a1 anchor revealed that when loaded through a catenary mooring the anchor moved vertically upwards with little or no rotation which limited the capacity to frictional resistance along the surface area of the plate this behaviour was attributed to the low padeye eccentricity which limited the moment loading on the plate and hence the rotation necessary to mobilise bearing resistance similar behaviour has been observed for plate anchors in clay e g o loughlin et al 2006 tian et al 2015 this prompted a reconsideration of the anchor design and led to fabrication of three additional anchors with padeye eccentricities e n 14 29 and 48 as shown in fig 3a which correspond to padeye eccentricity ratios e n l p 0 3 0 6 and 1 these designs were expected to encourage anchor rotation or keying allowing bearing resistance to be mobilised more readily and higher anchor capacity to be generated all four anchors share a common follower fig 3c which had the wall thickness and profile of the anchors and was 145 mm in length as this series of centrifuge tests involved jacked in rather than dynamic installation the follower was only used to penetrate the plate anchor to the required embedment depth as testing advanced it became apparent that continuous measurement of anchor rotation would benefit the interpretation for this reason anchor a4 was instrumented with a dual axis micro electro mechanical system mems accelerometer analog devices adxl278 the adxl278 accelerometer has a measurement range of 70 g and 35 g in its two measurement axes it was located in an epoxy resin filled void in the padeye of the anchor see fig 3d such that the 70 g measurement axis was parallel to the centripetal acceleration vector in the centrifuge and normal to the plate making the accelerometer suited to these experiments conducted at 50 g and involving moderate anchor rotations anchor rotation can be determined from the ratio of the two accelerometer measurements 1 α tan 1 a y a x where a x is the measured acceleration in the x axis parallel to the plate and a y is the measured acceleration in the y axis normal to the plate the accuracy of this measurement technique in a centrifuge environment is influenced by changes in anchor depth as the acceleration level varies with radius however the change in accelerometer output is 0 03 g for every millimeter change in anchor depth model scale at 50g which would result in an error in the interpreted rotation using equation 1 that is only 0 06 for every millimeter change in anchor depth as shown later in the paper fig 11 anchor rotation established using equation 2 was within 1 2 of direct measurements made after testing 2 3 experimental arrangement and procedures the centrifuge tests were carried out at an acceleration of 50 g using the 1 8 m radius fixed beam centrifuge located at the university of western australia the experimental arrangement is shown in fig 4 with notation for anchor embedment depth anchor displacements load inclination and anchor rotation shown in fig 5 each centrifuge test involved first installing the model anchor vertically at 1g to the required penetration depth using the follower that was connected to the vertical axis of an electrically driven actuator the model anchor was jacked in at 1g rather than dynamically installed to ensure consistent embedment depths and hence identical initial stress conditions between tests more details on the dynamic installation and embedment potential of the anchor are reported in chow et al 2017 after anchor installation at 1g the centrifuge was spun up to 50g with the follower and anchor position maintained using actuator 1 see fig 4 and the follower removed before loading the anchor the rational for removing the follower at 50g was to counter the tendency for the plate anchor to displace upwards with the follower as observed in initial tests in which the follower was extracted at 1g the anchor was loaded with the mooring line either at a load inclination at the mudline θ m 0 or θ m 90 representing a catenary or vertical taut leg mooring respectively the experimental arrangement was different for vertical taut leg and catenary loading as shown in fig 4 for tests involving a catenary mooring θ m 0 the mooring line was connected to a second actuator by way of a pulley located at the mudline directly beneath the vertical axis of the second actuator such that the mooring line was maintained horizontal and along the mudline during loading see fig 4a for the vertical taut leg mooring tests θ m 90 the actuator used to install the anchor and retrieve the follower was also used to load the anchor as shown in fig 4b anchor capacity was measured using a cylindrical load cell 6 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length with a measurement range of 1 kn this load cell was located in series with the mooring line at a position that ensured it remained above the mudline as the anchor was loaded displacement of the mooring line was measured by the encoder on the motor of the vertical axis of the actuator used to load the anchor the experimental programme involved both monotonic and cyclic loading monotonic loading was performed at an actuator velocity v 1 mm s such that the response is expected to be drained for this sand cyclic loading was performed in load control using both irregular and regular loading at a frequency of 0 5 hz this value was selected to achieve a balance between high quality load control and moderate test durations noting that this relatively low frequency will generate the targeted drained response in this sand each cyclic test commenced with an initial displacement controlled pre load stage at v 1 mm s to a cyclic load ratio clr f f u 0 7 where f is the imposed cyclic load and f u is the anchor capacity measured in the equivalent monotonic test before starting the cyclic loading sequence a post cyclic loading monotonic test was conducted in tests where the anchor did not fail during cyclic loading the monotonic tests were generally continued to beyond the ultimate anchor capacity although in a number of tests the loading was stopped at or before the ultimate capacity to allow for a post test visual assessment of the orientation and position of the anchor and its mooring line in these instances the anchor was left in the sample until completion of the tests after which a longitudinal side wall of the sample container was removed and the sand excavated to expose the anchor and mooring line allowing for measurement of the vertical and horizontal anchor displacement the anchor inclination and the mooring line inclination at the padeye in all other instances the anchor was recovered from the sample at 1 g for reuse in a subsequent test 3 test programme the centrifuge test programme comprises 29 monontonic tests and 5 cyclic tests as summarised in table 2 the monotonic tests consider variations in padeye eccentricity ratio e n l p 0 15 0 3 0 6 1 anchor embedment ratio h tip l p 2 3 and load inclination θ m 0 90 although the cyclic tests considered only e n l p 1 h tip l p 2 and θ m 0 both regular and irregular cyclic loading were investigated with different magnitudes of peak cyclic load to examine anchor performance when the cyclic loading included load magnitudes lower and higher than the monotonic capacity the tests are identified as lniex where l denotes the type of loading and is either m for monotonic loading rc for regular cyclic loading or ic for irregular cyclic loading n is the anchor embedment ratio equal to 2 or 3 for h tip l p 2 and 3 respectively i denotes the load inclination at the mudline and is either c for a catenary mooring θ m 0 or v for a taut leg vertical mooring θ m 90 e is the padeye eccentricity ratio normal to the anchor that is either 0 15 0 3 0 6 or 1 for e n l p 0 15 0 3 0 6 and 1 respectively x is an alphabetic character denoting the test recurrence a for the first test b for the second test etc for instance m2c0 15b refers to the second occurrence of a monotonic test involving θ m 0 h tip l p 2 and e n l p 0 15 for the two irregular cyclic loading tests in table 2 the test name is appended with the peak clr either 1 or 1 5 table 2 also indicates if the tests involved a post test visual assessment of the anchor and mooring line orientation and position these were generally conducted either before at or after the ultimate anchor capacity as detailed in table 2 examination of table 2 reveals that when tests were repeated the results were consistent with measurements varying typically by less than 10 results from the monotonic tests are summarised in prototype scale or dimensionless form in table 2 and include the ultimate capacity f u and the corresponding normalised mooring line displacement δ u l p anchor rotation α u and the dimensionless anchor capacity factor n γ determined as 2 n γ f u γ h a p where γ is the effective unit weight of the sand a p is the projected area of the anchor plate and h is the initial depth to the anchor padeye coincident with the initial depth to the centroid of the anchor it is worth noting that eq 2 is expected to provide a conservative estimate of n γ as the depth to the centroid h will become progressively shallower during loading as discussed later 4 results monotonic capacity 4 1 behaviour at low padeye eccentricity the centrifuge modelling initially considered only anchor a1 which most closely replicates the original anchor design shown in fig 1 these tests considered both catenary and taut leg mooring θ m 0 and 90 at two different embedment ratios h tip l p 2 and 3 the anchor capacity response during the taut vertical mooring tests i e tests m2v0 15a and m3v0 15a with the anchor embedded at h tip l p 2 and 3 are shown in fig 6 a the capacity mobilisation response for each test is similar with an initial stiff response towards the ultimate capacity followed by a rapid reduction in capacity as the plate displaces through the soil anchor capacity is evidently higher for the more deeply embedded anchor f u 94 kn at h tip l p 2 and f u 336 kn at h tip l p 3 a 3 6 fold increase the kinematic response of the anchor is evident from a post test image of the exposed anchor in test m2v0 15a which was loaded beyond the ultimate capacity until the capacity reduced to about 0 7f u the image is provided in fig 6b and shows that the anchor displaced vertically with minimal rotation α 87 such that anchor capacity is dominated by frictional resistance at the anchor soil interfaces anchor capacity improves for the same anchor e n l p 0 15 when loaded under a catenary mooring θ m 0 as shown in fig 7 a the ultimate anchor capacity in tests m2c0 15a and m3c0 15c are f u 455 kn at h tip l p 2 and 920 kn at h tip l p 3 which is 4 8 and 2 7 times higher than the respective ultimate anchor capacities under vertical loading the capacity mobilisation response on fig 7a is different from that observed under vertical loading with an initial soft response that becomes stiffer with increasing mooring line displacement and as the capacity approaches the peak value the mooring line displacement at the peak capacity is higher for the more deeply embedded anchor which reflects the higher amount of line displacement that is required to form the inverse catenary when the anchor padeye is deeper fig 7b shows the position and orientation of the anchor and mooring line in a repeat test at h tip l p 3 test m3c0 15b where the loading was stopped immediately after a peak capacity was observed f u 999 kn although the anchor did not rotate α u 90 the mooring line cut through the sand to form an inclination at the anchor padeye θ a 27 8 such that the anchor displaced both laterally and vertically δx l p 0 26 δz l p 0 83 and a component of resistance was mobilised in bearing the movement of the mooring line through the soil is the likely reason for the initial soft response on fig 7a as the stiffness due to vertical translation of the anchor due to a vertical mooring line is much higher see fig 6a this is explored further in fig 8 which compares the tests at h tip l p 2 with θ m 0 and 90 i e as shown on figs 6a and 7a with a further test test m2c0 15c also at h tip l p 2 and with θ m 0 but in which the follower was held in position using actuator 1 see fig 4a whilst the anchor was loaded using actuator 2 see fig 4a this was maintained until the follower was observed to displace horizontally at which point loading was temporarily paused to extract the follower this approach restricted displacement and potential rotation of the anchor permitting an observation of the response due to mooring line cutting alone fig 8 shows that the initial response in the two tests with θ m 0 are consistent to about 100 kn but then diverge with the test with the follower in place continuing along a much stiffer response this divergence indicates that in test m2c0 15a with no follower in place the capacity response is initially due to mooring line cutting to f 100 kn but then involves a combination of plate mobilisation and mooring line cutting this first set of tests highlights the importance of considering the coupled response of the anchor and its embedded mooring line in assessing the overall capacity for a given anchor embedment the highest potential anchor capacity is when the load is normal to the anchor for an initially vertical anchor and mooring line this requires a combination of anchor rotation and cutting of the mooring line through the soil anchor rotation is governed by the moment acting at the centroid of the anchor which itself is governed by the eccentricity of the padeye and the inclination of the mooring line the inclination of the mooring line is also influenced by the anchor rotation and displacement with a higher likelihood of a lower inclination at the anchor padeye lower θ a as the anchor rotates and becomes shallower 4 2 effect of a higher padeye eccentricity prompted by the lack of anchor rotation in tests with anchor a1 e n l p 0 15 the focus in the centrifuge tests turned to the response of anchors with different padeye eccentricity ratios fig 9 compares the capacity mobilisation response for the different padeye eccentricities and embedment depths when loaded through a catenary mooring θ m 0 the embedment effect is clear with f u increasing by between 39 and 96 as h tip l p increases from 2 to 3 fig 9 also shows the effect due to padeye eccentricity with increases in f u of 73 at h tip l p 2 and 100 at h tip lp 3 as e n l p increases from 0 15 to 1 although the increase appears to be non linear with only a marginal increase in f u between e n l p 0 6 and e n l p 1 images taken of repeat tests at h tip l p 3 that were stopped at approximately the ultimate capacity are provided in fig 10 and assist with understanding the effect of change in e n l p these images show at the ultimate anchor capacity that as e n l p increases from 0 15 to 1 anchor rotation increases from 0 to 16 αu 90 to 74 the inclination of the mooring line at the anchor padeye increases from θ a 27 8 to 53 2 and the vertical embedment of the plate reduces from δz l p 0 83 to δz l p 0 38 these effects are due to the magnitude of the moment generated at the centroid of the plate at low e n l p the load in the initially vertical mooring line will result in a relatively low moment meaning that it will be easier for the anchor to displace and for the mooring line to cut through the soil than for the anchor to rotate in contrast at high e n l p the mooring line load generates a greater moment and an associated higher plate rotation this anchor rotation has two effects firstly it reduces the potential for the anchor to displace vertically as also observed for plate anchors in clay e g o loughlin et al 2006 which has the effect of increasing the capacity secondly it reduces the potential for the mooring line to cut through the soil as the limiting mooring line inclination at the anchor padeye is normal to the plate i e θ a 90 α u a more thorough consideration of the anchor capacity kinematic response can be made by examining the anchor capacity and rotation derived from the accelerometer measurements equation 2 for anchor a4 e n l p 1 the capacity and rotation response of test m3c1g is shown on fig 11 together with post testing images from repeat tests where loading was stopped before at and after the ultimate anchor capacity the response on fig 11 can be considered as three stages stage 1 the capacity mobilisation response is initially soft with very little anchor rotation α 87 which suggests that this stage is dominated by the mooring line cutting through the soil stage 2 the mooring line load tends to increase plate rotation rather than further cutting of the mooring line through the soil eventuating in an ultimate capacity at an anchor rotation α u 75 6 and a loss in anchor embedment δz l p 0 38 stage 3 anchor capacity and plate rotation reduces similar to observations made in chow et al 2015 the reduction in plate rotation is considered to be due to the mooring line reaching an inclination that causes the plate to rotate back towards it initial orientation note point iii in the post testing images with a capacity reduction that is considered to be due to the anchor becoming shallower the a4 anchor with the highest normalised padeye eccentricity e n l p 1 was also loaded vertically at two embedment depths tests m2v1a and m3v1b fig 12 a shows the capacity mobilisation response together with the corresponding anchor rotation measurements for test m2v1a at h tip l p 2 three stages are apparent stage 1 under vertical loading the anchor is immediately loaded and the load displacement response is initially stiff as the plate begins to rotate and develop capacity before becoming softer at a rotation of around 77 when the capacity starts to reduce stage 2 the capacity initially reduces by about 20 as the anchor rotates from 77 to 47 before increasing towards a maximum capacity at a rotation of 14 the magnitude of this ultimate capacity is approximately equal to that observed at the end of stage 1 load oscillations in the capacity curve are evident particularly as the capacity maximises such oscillations are typical of those observed in vertical tensile loading tests of anchors and pipes in sand e g trautmann et al 1985 dickin 1994 cheuk et al 2008 o loughlin and barron 2012 and are attributed to the progressive infilling of the void that forms behind the plate as the anchor displaces and rotates stage 3 the capacity reduces sharply despite continued plate rotation to the limiting value of 0 this is consistent with observations reported by o loughlin and barron 2012 which showed that the ultimate capacity can occur before the full bearing area of the plate is mobilised when the rotation is sufficient to trigger a transition from a deep to a shallow failure mechanism fig 12b shows that the response is somewhat similar when the embedment is higher h tip l p 3 test m3v1b although unlike for the shallower case the ultimate capacity i e at the end of stage 2 is about 50 higher than the capacity at the end of stage 1 this is due to the deeper embedment i e examination of fig 12 reveals that the anchor embedment depth at ultimate capacity is approximately l p and 2l p for tests m2v1a and m3v1b respectively although there were no anchor rotation measurements in this test fig 12b also shows the capacity and rotation response for a vertically loaded strip anchor test m5v1 with a length to width ratio of 7 with e n b 1 and h b 5 h tip b 5 5 in dense silica sand reported in o loughlin and barron 2012 the capacity response is similar noting that the comparison is facilitated by normalising the displacement by the plate width b for the strip anchor and by the plate height l p for the anchor tests considered here which suggests that the rotation response in test m3v1b is likely to be similar to that of the strip anchor 4 3 anchor capacity factors experimentally determined anchor capacity factors n γ from the monotonic tests are summarised in fig 13 and clearly show the dependence of capacity on embedment depth load inclination and padeye eccentricity ratio the dependence on padeye eccentricity is best demonstrated through the tests with θ m 0 fig 13a these data show a strong positive effect on anchor capacity up to e n l p 0 6 with increases in n γ of up to 56 and 108 at h tip l p 2 and 3 respectively but negligible effects thereafter the lower experimentally n γ at lower e n l p reflects the higher loss in embedment as n γ is calculated using the initial embedment depth h and not the reduced embedment depth at the ultimate capacity and the reduced plate rotation and hence projection of the plate towards the loading direction similar effects of padeye eccentricity on keying induced loss in embedment and hence potential anchor capacity have been observed in both clay e g o loughlin et al 2006 gaudin et al 2009 and sand barron 2014 fig 13 also shows the strong effects due to embedment depth and mudline load inclination for instance for an anchor with e n l p 1 capacity increases by 427 from n γ 2 6 at h tip l p 2 and for θ m 90 fig 13b to a maximum n γ 13 7 at h tip l p 3 and for θ m 0 fig 13a this increase in n γ with increasing embedment depth and reducing mudline load inclination is due to the extent of the failure mechanism which increases as the load direction becomes more horizontal and as the embedment depth increases e g see merifield and sloan 2006 also shown on fig 13b are the numerical solutions for horizontal plate anchors in sand under vertical loading reported by merifield and sloan 2006 and merifield et al 2006 which serve as comparisons to the centrifuge data for vertical loading noting that at high e n l p the anchor approached a near horizontal orientation at ultimate capacity the solutions on fig 13b are provided for a friction angle ϕ 37 as appropriate for the relative density and stress levels in these centrifuge tests bolton 1987 although the aspect ratio l p w 1 33 i e close to a square the plate width tapers towards the anchor tip such that the equivalent aspect ratio near the tip is closer to 3 5 for this reason and given the complex geometry of the plate anchor solutions for both strip and square anchors are provided experimentally determined values of n γ lie between the solutions for the strip and square at e n l p 1 but lie beneath both solutions at e n l p 0 15 although merifield and sloan 2006 also provide solutions for horizontally loaded vertical plate anchors i e a horizontal load applied to the padeye of a vertical plate anchor there are no existing theoretical or numerical solutions relevant to the more realistic scenario offshore and modelled in these centrifuge tests where the load is horizontal at the mudline and consequently inclined at the padeye 5 results cyclic capacity as outlined earlier in the paper the cyclic tests considered the a4 anchor with e n l p 1 at a fixed embedment ratio h tip l p 2 and load inclination at the mudline θ m 0 the loading sequences for both the regular and irregular cyclic loading are shown in fig 14 a slack mooring was modelled using a nominal mooring line load clr 0 05 in the regular cyclic loading tests and 20 n in the irregular cyclic loading tests to avoid issues with the load control algorithm trying to achieve 0 n key results from the cyclic tests and the equivalent monotonic test are summarised in table 2 5 1 regular cyclic loading as shown in fig 14a the regular cyclic loading involved a sinusoidal wave with a fixed minimum load clr 0 05 but with an increasing amplitude starting at a maximum load of clr 0 2 that was maintained for packets of 300 cycles before being stepped to the next amplitude at a fixed clr increment of 0 10 until failure occurred fig 15 compares the results from the two repeat cyclic tests with the equivalent monotonic test the initial loading to 70 of the monotonic anchor capacity is identical but the subsequent cyclic loading is seen to lead to improvements in the anchor capacity with an average ultimate capacity f u 1002 8 kn n γ 11 6 that is 28 8 higher than the monotonic ultimate capacity f u 780 kn n γ 9 a third cyclic test was conducted but stopped when the clr reached 0 7 to permit a visual comparison with the corresponding monotonic test that was also stopped at 70 of the monotonic anchor capacity test rc2c1c the comparison is provided in fig 16 which shows consistent anchor and mooring line inclinations between the two tests differing by 0 5 for the anchor and 1 2 for the mooring line but significantly lower loss in embedment for the cyclically loaded anchor δz l p 0 08 compared to δz l p 0 31 which explains the higher ultimate cyclic capacity 5 2 irregular cyclic loading the irregular cyclic loading tests involved a pre programmed storm of irregular cyclic loads fig 14b and c established from wave tank tests on a wave energy converter with catenary moorings casaubieilh et al 2014 two irregular cyclic loading tests were conducted using the storm shown on fig 14b and c but with both the storm duration and the peak cyclic load scaled test ic2c1a1 involved 15 storms with the peak cyclic load equal to the monotonic anchor capacity clrpeak 1 whereas test ic2c1a1 5 involved a single storm in which the peak cyclic load was 50 higher than the monotonic anchor capacity i e clrpeak 1 5 the irregular cyclic loading test results are compared with the equivalent monotonic test in fig 17 where it can be seen that the anchor was capable of withstanding 15 storms at clr peak 1 but not a single storm with clr peak 1 5 the post cyclic monotonic test following the 15 storms resulted in an eventual anchor capacity f u 1030 0 kn n γ 12 3 43 higher than the reference monotonic ultimate capacity f u 721 2 kn n γ 8 6 failure occurred quickly in test ic2c1a1 5 with significant mooring line displacement at a clr 1 17 with an observed cyclic ultimate capacity f u 863 4 kn n γ 10 2 20 higher than the reference monotonic ultimate capacity fig 17b shows that the rotation response of the anchor is similar albeit with some minor differences in rotation at the peak capacity the higher drained anchor capacity measured during or after cyclic loading is consistent with other plate anchor studies involving drained cyclic loading e g chow et al 2015 and also the response of piles due to drained cyclic loading in sand e g nicolai et al 2017 relatively low magnitude cyclic loading such as in test ic2c1a1 allows for densification that improves anchor capacity whereas the more onerous cyclic loading in test ic2c1a1 5 involved load cycles that approached the anchor capacity before significant densification such that the higher peak cyclic loads could not be tolerated such behaviour can be captured by kinematic hardening soil models that account for stress history e g corti et al 2016 6 conclusions this paper considers the drained capacity of a dynamically installed plate anchor in dense sand under monotonic and cyclic loading the blade like anchor design was prompted by a requirement to minimise penetration resistance during dynamic installation which resulted in an anchor padeye that was located close to the plate however the centrifuge data considered in this paper reveal that the low padeye eccentricity is problematic for mobilising anchor capacity as there is insufficient lever arm to develop the moment loading that will initiate anchor rotation and subsequently develop the highest bearing resistance on the anchor plate a more optimal anchor design would be to employ a padeye eccentricity equal to about 0 6 times the plate height consideration would need to be given to the influence of an eccentric padeye during dynamic installation as this may affect both the verticality of the anchor during free fall and the potential to achieve adequate penetration in this respect a bridle arrangement or a rotating padeye arm may be a practical solution that would allow the padeye to be located parallel and close to the plate during installation and eccentric from the plate during loading the centrifuge tests involved jacked installation to an anchor tip embedment that was either two or three times the plate height as the dynamic installation centrifuge tests reported in chow et al 2017 indicate that this level of embedment is achievable the test data show that the plate anchor is most efficient in sand when loaded through a catenary rather than a vertical mooring this is partly due to the anchor kinematics as for a high padeye eccentricity a vertical mooring causes significant anchor rotation and loss of embedment whereas a catenary mooring leads to much more moderate rotation and embedment loss a catenary mooring is also more efficient as the loading at the padeye is inclined rather than vertical such that the failure mechanism is likely to involve a much larger soil mass the centrifuge test data indicate that an anchor capacity factor n γ 13 is achievable with an equivalent anchor capacity of approximately 2 mn for the 2 4 m high prototype plate anchor considered here in the context of mooring line loads for marine renewable energy devices azcona et al 2017 calculate a maximum dynamic mooring line load of approximately 3 mn for a 5 mn offshore wind turbine stabilised by a spar platform whereas palm et al 2013 calculate a maximum dynamic mooring line load of approximately 550 kn for a wave energy converter that was modelled as a cylinder with a mass of 100 tonnes hence the prototype equivalence of the anchor considered in the centrifuge tests would require moderate upscaling for the wind turbine but significant downscaling for the wave energy converter comparisons with existing theoretical and numerical solutions for anchor capacity in sand is hampered by the limiting and unrealistic assumptions regarding load direction and plate inclination which are unrealistic for offshore anchors that are installed vertically the centrifuge data show that drained cyclic loading improves anchor capacity by up to 43 with lower level cyclic loading leading to the greatest gains the effect of partially drained cyclic loading is unclear and warrants further attention given the dynamic nature of

23708,the emergence of commercial offshore floating renewable energy devices that are expected to be deployed in large integrated arrays in relatively shallow water requires anchor types that are suited to sandy seabeds this paper considers centrifuge test data that quantify the capacity of a novel dynamically installed plate anchor in sand under drained monotonic and cyclic loading the monotonic tests investigated the role of the eccentricity of the load attachment point from the plate the mooring line load inclination at the seabed and the plate embedment depth whereas the cyclic tests examined the capacity mobilisation due to both regular and irregular drained cyclic loading for a fixed embedment depth and seabed load inclination the test data indicate that an optimal anchor design would employ a load attachment point that is eccentric from the plate by at least 0 6 times the plate height and that the anchor provides higher capacity when the seabed load inclination is horizontal catenary mooring than when it is vertical vertical taut mooring the centrifuge data show that drained cyclic loading does not degrade anchor capacity and may be beneficial provided the cyclic loading involves a history of lower level cyclic loading that densifies the sand keywords anchors sands offshore engineering renewable energy capacity 1 introduction offshore renewable energy devices including wind turbines wave and tidal energy converters offer significant potential to move towards clean renewable energy floating wave energy convertor and wind turbines are maintained on station using mooring lines that terminate at anchors located on or embedded in the seabed knappett et al 2015 diaz et al 2016 and gaudin et al 2017 review existing anchor technology in the context of the technical requirements and economic constraints associated with offshore floating renewable energy these studies note that plate anchors are attractive due to their high holding capacity yet low size and weight although difficulties in installing plate anchors in the sand dominated seabeds that floating energy devices are likely to be located may constrain their use plate anchors may be installed by drag embedment although adequate penetration of drag anchors in sand is notoriously difficult and challenging to predict neubecker and randolph 1996 heurlin et al 2015 o loughlin et al 2017 other anchor types such as driven piles may be used although they are less efficient and installation requirements and durations are considerable this has the potential to seriously impact the economics of emerging marine renewable energy technologies which will be deployed in large integrated arrays requiring a large number of accurately positioned anchors an alternative solution could be dynamically installed anchors which require minimal installation time and can be deployed without the need for dedicated ancillary equipment such as pile hammers dynamically installed anchors are installed by allowing them to free fall through the water column such that the combination of their self weight and the kinetic energy gained through free fall embed them into the seabed various anchor designs have been proposed for deep water soft sediments e g lieng et al 2000 medeiros jr 2002 shelton 2007 o loughlin et al 2014 and have been used or considered for offshore oil and gas floating facilities current dynamically installed anchors are generally perceived to be less suitable for sand due to the dilatant behaviour of sand and concerns regarding embedment potential however alternative dynamically installed anchor designs may achieve higher penetrations in sand and prove to be a viable anchoring solution for granular seabed deposits e g gerkus et al 2016 this paper considers one such dynamically installed anchor concept that has been designed primarily for sand although may also prove to be feasible in other seabed sediments the anchor and the installation process is conceptually shown in fig 1 the anchor adopts a thin blade like design which contrasts with the majority of existing dynamically installed anchor designs that typically utilise solid cylindrical shafts with conical or ellipsoidal tips o loughlin et al 2004 the anchor features a plate at its lower end that is attached to an upper removable follower that provides the additional mass to increase penetration potential in cross section the plate is comprised of two thin blades that project from a central core and taper from a maximum width at the top of the plate to zero width at the bottom of the plate two additional fins at the trailing end of the upper follower fig 1 are included to improve hydrodynamic stability during freefall in water following embedment the follower is retrieved to the installation vessel for re use in the next installation leaving the plate anchor vertically embedded in the seabed the embedment potential of the anchor has been demonstrated through centrifuge tests in loose and dense silica sand chow et al 2017 anchor tip embedments were in the range 0 9 2 2 times the plate height in these centrifuge tests and were strongly dependent on impact velocity follower mass and sand density this suggests that deeper anchor embedment could be achieved by geometrically optimising the follower subsequent centrifuge studies investigated the monotonic and cyclic capacity of the anchor in saturated dense silica sand to quantify the capacity potential of the anchor the results from these studies are considered in this paper 2 centrifuge tests 2 1 soil properties and sample preparation the centrifuge tests were conducted in medium dense sand samples that were prepared using a commercially available fine sub angular silica sand with properties as listed in table 1 seven sand samples were prepared at 1g in centrifuge sample containers with internal dimensions of 650 390 325 mm length width depth by air pluviation to give final sample heights of approximately 200 mm each sample was vacuum levelled to create a level surface and then saturated with water from the base of the container about 40 mm of free water was maintained above the sand surface during the centrifuge testing the relative density was d r 66 3 saturated densities ρ sat 2034 2043 kg cm3 with the exception of one slightly looser sample for which d r 53 ρ sat 2017 kg cm3 each sample was spun to the testing acceleration of 50 g and two cone penetrometer tests cpts were conducted to characterise the samples the cone penetrometer tests were performed using a model cone penetrometer with a diameter of 10 mm penetrated at a velocity v 1 mm s such that the response is expected to be drained silva and bolton 2004 as shown in fig 2 the cone tip resistance q c increases with depth in all samples which reflects the increasing vertical effective stress with depth variations in q c between samples are consistent with the measured range in d r and indicate that the profile of strength and density is relatively consistent across the seven samples 2 2 model anchors and mooring line four model anchors a1 a2 a3 a4 were manufactured for the centrifuge tests as shown in fig 3 each model anchor was wire cut electrical discharge machining from a single block of stainless steel followed by precision machining to achieve the detail around the anchor padeye and the taper on the plate the models are at a 1 50 reduced scale and maintain the same material density as the field scale anchor such that the centrifuge scaling laws garnier et al 2007 apply these imply that a practically sized full scale anchor would have a plate height of 2 4 m a follower length of 7 25 m with a mass of 5134 kg and an anchor mass of between 1290 and 1960 kg depending on the anchor although variations on this are to be expected based on the mooring requirements the mooring line was modelled using 1 mm diameter stainless steel wire rated to a minimum breaking load of 1 1 kn fig 3d anchor a1 fig 3 reflects the original design as shown in fig 1 and has a plate mass m 10 32 g plate width w 36 mm plate length l p 48 mm and plate thickness t 1 52 mm at the central core thinning out to t 0 1 mm at the edge the anchor padeye in the original design and hence in anchor a1 is located at an eccentricity normal to the plate e n 7 mm padeye eccentricity ratio e n l p 0 15 initial tests using the a1 anchor revealed that when loaded through a catenary mooring the anchor moved vertically upwards with little or no rotation which limited the capacity to frictional resistance along the surface area of the plate this behaviour was attributed to the low padeye eccentricity which limited the moment loading on the plate and hence the rotation necessary to mobilise bearing resistance similar behaviour has been observed for plate anchors in clay e g o loughlin et al 2006 tian et al 2015 this prompted a reconsideration of the anchor design and led to fabrication of three additional anchors with padeye eccentricities e n 14 29 and 48 as shown in fig 3a which correspond to padeye eccentricity ratios e n l p 0 3 0 6 and 1 these designs were expected to encourage anchor rotation or keying allowing bearing resistance to be mobilised more readily and higher anchor capacity to be generated all four anchors share a common follower fig 3c which had the wall thickness and profile of the anchors and was 145 mm in length as this series of centrifuge tests involved jacked in rather than dynamic installation the follower was only used to penetrate the plate anchor to the required embedment depth as testing advanced it became apparent that continuous measurement of anchor rotation would benefit the interpretation for this reason anchor a4 was instrumented with a dual axis micro electro mechanical system mems accelerometer analog devices adxl278 the adxl278 accelerometer has a measurement range of 70 g and 35 g in its two measurement axes it was located in an epoxy resin filled void in the padeye of the anchor see fig 3d such that the 70 g measurement axis was parallel to the centripetal acceleration vector in the centrifuge and normal to the plate making the accelerometer suited to these experiments conducted at 50 g and involving moderate anchor rotations anchor rotation can be determined from the ratio of the two accelerometer measurements 1 α tan 1 a y a x where a x is the measured acceleration in the x axis parallel to the plate and a y is the measured acceleration in the y axis normal to the plate the accuracy of this measurement technique in a centrifuge environment is influenced by changes in anchor depth as the acceleration level varies with radius however the change in accelerometer output is 0 03 g for every millimeter change in anchor depth model scale at 50g which would result in an error in the interpreted rotation using equation 1 that is only 0 06 for every millimeter change in anchor depth as shown later in the paper fig 11 anchor rotation established using equation 2 was within 1 2 of direct measurements made after testing 2 3 experimental arrangement and procedures the centrifuge tests were carried out at an acceleration of 50 g using the 1 8 m radius fixed beam centrifuge located at the university of western australia the experimental arrangement is shown in fig 4 with notation for anchor embedment depth anchor displacements load inclination and anchor rotation shown in fig 5 each centrifuge test involved first installing the model anchor vertically at 1g to the required penetration depth using the follower that was connected to the vertical axis of an electrically driven actuator the model anchor was jacked in at 1g rather than dynamically installed to ensure consistent embedment depths and hence identical initial stress conditions between tests more details on the dynamic installation and embedment potential of the anchor are reported in chow et al 2017 after anchor installation at 1g the centrifuge was spun up to 50g with the follower and anchor position maintained using actuator 1 see fig 4 and the follower removed before loading the anchor the rational for removing the follower at 50g was to counter the tendency for the plate anchor to displace upwards with the follower as observed in initial tests in which the follower was extracted at 1g the anchor was loaded with the mooring line either at a load inclination at the mudline θ m 0 or θ m 90 representing a catenary or vertical taut leg mooring respectively the experimental arrangement was different for vertical taut leg and catenary loading as shown in fig 4 for tests involving a catenary mooring θ m 0 the mooring line was connected to a second actuator by way of a pulley located at the mudline directly beneath the vertical axis of the second actuator such that the mooring line was maintained horizontal and along the mudline during loading see fig 4a for the vertical taut leg mooring tests θ m 90 the actuator used to install the anchor and retrieve the follower was also used to load the anchor as shown in fig 4b anchor capacity was measured using a cylindrical load cell 6 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length with a measurement range of 1 kn this load cell was located in series with the mooring line at a position that ensured it remained above the mudline as the anchor was loaded displacement of the mooring line was measured by the encoder on the motor of the vertical axis of the actuator used to load the anchor the experimental programme involved both monotonic and cyclic loading monotonic loading was performed at an actuator velocity v 1 mm s such that the response is expected to be drained for this sand cyclic loading was performed in load control using both irregular and regular loading at a frequency of 0 5 hz this value was selected to achieve a balance between high quality load control and moderate test durations noting that this relatively low frequency will generate the targeted drained response in this sand each cyclic test commenced with an initial displacement controlled pre load stage at v 1 mm s to a cyclic load ratio clr f f u 0 7 where f is the imposed cyclic load and f u is the anchor capacity measured in the equivalent monotonic test before starting the cyclic loading sequence a post cyclic loading monotonic test was conducted in tests where the anchor did not fail during cyclic loading the monotonic tests were generally continued to beyond the ultimate anchor capacity although in a number of tests the loading was stopped at or before the ultimate capacity to allow for a post test visual assessment of the orientation and position of the anchor and its mooring line in these instances the anchor was left in the sample until completion of the tests after which a longitudinal side wall of the sample container was removed and the sand excavated to expose the anchor and mooring line allowing for measurement of the vertical and horizontal anchor displacement the anchor inclination and the mooring line inclination at the padeye in all other instances the anchor was recovered from the sample at 1 g for reuse in a subsequent test 3 test programme the centrifuge test programme comprises 29 monontonic tests and 5 cyclic tests as summarised in table 2 the monotonic tests consider variations in padeye eccentricity ratio e n l p 0 15 0 3 0 6 1 anchor embedment ratio h tip l p 2 3 and load inclination θ m 0 90 although the cyclic tests considered only e n l p 1 h tip l p 2 and θ m 0 both regular and irregular cyclic loading were investigated with different magnitudes of peak cyclic load to examine anchor performance when the cyclic loading included load magnitudes lower and higher than the monotonic capacity the tests are identified as lniex where l denotes the type of loading and is either m for monotonic loading rc for regular cyclic loading or ic for irregular cyclic loading n is the anchor embedment ratio equal to 2 or 3 for h tip l p 2 and 3 respectively i denotes the load inclination at the mudline and is either c for a catenary mooring θ m 0 or v for a taut leg vertical mooring θ m 90 e is the padeye eccentricity ratio normal to the anchor that is either 0 15 0 3 0 6 or 1 for e n l p 0 15 0 3 0 6 and 1 respectively x is an alphabetic character denoting the test recurrence a for the first test b for the second test etc for instance m2c0 15b refers to the second occurrence of a monotonic test involving θ m 0 h tip l p 2 and e n l p 0 15 for the two irregular cyclic loading tests in table 2 the test name is appended with the peak clr either 1 or 1 5 table 2 also indicates if the tests involved a post test visual assessment of the anchor and mooring line orientation and position these were generally conducted either before at or after the ultimate anchor capacity as detailed in table 2 examination of table 2 reveals that when tests were repeated the results were consistent with measurements varying typically by less than 10 results from the monotonic tests are summarised in prototype scale or dimensionless form in table 2 and include the ultimate capacity f u and the corresponding normalised mooring line displacement δ u l p anchor rotation α u and the dimensionless anchor capacity factor n γ determined as 2 n γ f u γ h a p where γ is the effective unit weight of the sand a p is the projected area of the anchor plate and h is the initial depth to the anchor padeye coincident with the initial depth to the centroid of the anchor it is worth noting that eq 2 is expected to provide a conservative estimate of n γ as the depth to the centroid h will become progressively shallower during loading as discussed later 4 results monotonic capacity 4 1 behaviour at low padeye eccentricity the centrifuge modelling initially considered only anchor a1 which most closely replicates the original anchor design shown in fig 1 these tests considered both catenary and taut leg mooring θ m 0 and 90 at two different embedment ratios h tip l p 2 and 3 the anchor capacity response during the taut vertical mooring tests i e tests m2v0 15a and m3v0 15a with the anchor embedded at h tip l p 2 and 3 are shown in fig 6 a the capacity mobilisation response for each test is similar with an initial stiff response towards the ultimate capacity followed by a rapid reduction in capacity as the plate displaces through the soil anchor capacity is evidently higher for the more deeply embedded anchor f u 94 kn at h tip l p 2 and f u 336 kn at h tip l p 3 a 3 6 fold increase the kinematic response of the anchor is evident from a post test image of the exposed anchor in test m2v0 15a which was loaded beyond the ultimate capacity until the capacity reduced to about 0 7f u the image is provided in fig 6b and shows that the anchor displaced vertically with minimal rotation α 87 such that anchor capacity is dominated by frictional resistance at the anchor soil interfaces anchor capacity improves for the same anchor e n l p 0 15 when loaded under a catenary mooring θ m 0 as shown in fig 7 a the ultimate anchor capacity in tests m2c0 15a and m3c0 15c are f u 455 kn at h tip l p 2 and 920 kn at h tip l p 3 which is 4 8 and 2 7 times higher than the respective ultimate anchor capacities under vertical loading the capacity mobilisation response on fig 7a is different from that observed under vertical loading with an initial soft response that becomes stiffer with increasing mooring line displacement and as the capacity approaches the peak value the mooring line displacement at the peak capacity is higher for the more deeply embedded anchor which reflects the higher amount of line displacement that is required to form the inverse catenary when the anchor padeye is deeper fig 7b shows the position and orientation of the anchor and mooring line in a repeat test at h tip l p 3 test m3c0 15b where the loading was stopped immediately after a peak capacity was observed f u 999 kn although the anchor did not rotate α u 90 the mooring line cut through the sand to form an inclination at the anchor padeye θ a 27 8 such that the anchor displaced both laterally and vertically δx l p 0 26 δz l p 0 83 and a component of resistance was mobilised in bearing the movement of the mooring line through the soil is the likely reason for the initial soft response on fig 7a as the stiffness due to vertical translation of the anchor due to a vertical mooring line is much higher see fig 6a this is explored further in fig 8 which compares the tests at h tip l p 2 with θ m 0 and 90 i e as shown on figs 6a and 7a with a further test test m2c0 15c also at h tip l p 2 and with θ m 0 but in which the follower was held in position using actuator 1 see fig 4a whilst the anchor was loaded using actuator 2 see fig 4a this was maintained until the follower was observed to displace horizontally at which point loading was temporarily paused to extract the follower this approach restricted displacement and potential rotation of the anchor permitting an observation of the response due to mooring line cutting alone fig 8 shows that the initial response in the two tests with θ m 0 are consistent to about 100 kn but then diverge with the test with the follower in place continuing along a much stiffer response this divergence indicates that in test m2c0 15a with no follower in place the capacity response is initially due to mooring line cutting to f 100 kn but then involves a combination of plate mobilisation and mooring line cutting this first set of tests highlights the importance of considering the coupled response of the anchor and its embedded mooring line in assessing the overall capacity for a given anchor embedment the highest potential anchor capacity is when the load is normal to the anchor for an initially vertical anchor and mooring line this requires a combination of anchor rotation and cutting of the mooring line through the soil anchor rotation is governed by the moment acting at the centroid of the anchor which itself is governed by the eccentricity of the padeye and the inclination of the mooring line the inclination of the mooring line is also influenced by the anchor rotation and displacement with a higher likelihood of a lower inclination at the anchor padeye lower θ a as the anchor rotates and becomes shallower 4 2 effect of a higher padeye eccentricity prompted by the lack of anchor rotation in tests with anchor a1 e n l p 0 15 the focus in the centrifuge tests turned to the response of anchors with different padeye eccentricity ratios fig 9 compares the capacity mobilisation response for the different padeye eccentricities and embedment depths when loaded through a catenary mooring θ m 0 the embedment effect is clear with f u increasing by between 39 and 96 as h tip l p increases from 2 to 3 fig 9 also shows the effect due to padeye eccentricity with increases in f u of 73 at h tip l p 2 and 100 at h tip lp 3 as e n l p increases from 0 15 to 1 although the increase appears to be non linear with only a marginal increase in f u between e n l p 0 6 and e n l p 1 images taken of repeat tests at h tip l p 3 that were stopped at approximately the ultimate capacity are provided in fig 10 and assist with understanding the effect of change in e n l p these images show at the ultimate anchor capacity that as e n l p increases from 0 15 to 1 anchor rotation increases from 0 to 16 αu 90 to 74 the inclination of the mooring line at the anchor padeye increases from θ a 27 8 to 53 2 and the vertical embedment of the plate reduces from δz l p 0 83 to δz l p 0 38 these effects are due to the magnitude of the moment generated at the centroid of the plate at low e n l p the load in the initially vertical mooring line will result in a relatively low moment meaning that it will be easier for the anchor to displace and for the mooring line to cut through the soil than for the anchor to rotate in contrast at high e n l p the mooring line load generates a greater moment and an associated higher plate rotation this anchor rotation has two effects firstly it reduces the potential for the anchor to displace vertically as also observed for plate anchors in clay e g o loughlin et al 2006 which has the effect of increasing the capacity secondly it reduces the potential for the mooring line to cut through the soil as the limiting mooring line inclination at the anchor padeye is normal to the plate i e θ a 90 α u a more thorough consideration of the anchor capacity kinematic response can be made by examining the anchor capacity and rotation derived from the accelerometer measurements equation 2 for anchor a4 e n l p 1 the capacity and rotation response of test m3c1g is shown on fig 11 together with post testing images from repeat tests where loading was stopped before at and after the ultimate anchor capacity the response on fig 11 can be considered as three stages stage 1 the capacity mobilisation response is initially soft with very little anchor rotation α 87 which suggests that this stage is dominated by the mooring line cutting through the soil stage 2 the mooring line load tends to increase plate rotation rather than further cutting of the mooring line through the soil eventuating in an ultimate capacity at an anchor rotation α u 75 6 and a loss in anchor embedment δz l p 0 38 stage 3 anchor capacity and plate rotation reduces similar to observations made in chow et al 2015 the reduction in plate rotation is considered to be due to the mooring line reaching an inclination that causes the plate to rotate back towards it initial orientation note point iii in the post testing images with a capacity reduction that is considered to be due to the anchor becoming shallower the a4 anchor with the highest normalised padeye eccentricity e n l p 1 was also loaded vertically at two embedment depths tests m2v1a and m3v1b fig 12 a shows the capacity mobilisation response together with the corresponding anchor rotation measurements for test m2v1a at h tip l p 2 three stages are apparent stage 1 under vertical loading the anchor is immediately loaded and the load displacement response is initially stiff as the plate begins to rotate and develop capacity before becoming softer at a rotation of around 77 when the capacity starts to reduce stage 2 the capacity initially reduces by about 20 as the anchor rotates from 77 to 47 before increasing towards a maximum capacity at a rotation of 14 the magnitude of this ultimate capacity is approximately equal to that observed at the end of stage 1 load oscillations in the capacity curve are evident particularly as the capacity maximises such oscillations are typical of those observed in vertical tensile loading tests of anchors and pipes in sand e g trautmann et al 1985 dickin 1994 cheuk et al 2008 o loughlin and barron 2012 and are attributed to the progressive infilling of the void that forms behind the plate as the anchor displaces and rotates stage 3 the capacity reduces sharply despite continued plate rotation to the limiting value of 0 this is consistent with observations reported by o loughlin and barron 2012 which showed that the ultimate capacity can occur before the full bearing area of the plate is mobilised when the rotation is sufficient to trigger a transition from a deep to a shallow failure mechanism fig 12b shows that the response is somewhat similar when the embedment is higher h tip l p 3 test m3v1b although unlike for the shallower case the ultimate capacity i e at the end of stage 2 is about 50 higher than the capacity at the end of stage 1 this is due to the deeper embedment i e examination of fig 12 reveals that the anchor embedment depth at ultimate capacity is approximately l p and 2l p for tests m2v1a and m3v1b respectively although there were no anchor rotation measurements in this test fig 12b also shows the capacity and rotation response for a vertically loaded strip anchor test m5v1 with a length to width ratio of 7 with e n b 1 and h b 5 h tip b 5 5 in dense silica sand reported in o loughlin and barron 2012 the capacity response is similar noting that the comparison is facilitated by normalising the displacement by the plate width b for the strip anchor and by the plate height l p for the anchor tests considered here which suggests that the rotation response in test m3v1b is likely to be similar to that of the strip anchor 4 3 anchor capacity factors experimentally determined anchor capacity factors n γ from the monotonic tests are summarised in fig 13 and clearly show the dependence of capacity on embedment depth load inclination and padeye eccentricity ratio the dependence on padeye eccentricity is best demonstrated through the tests with θ m 0 fig 13a these data show a strong positive effect on anchor capacity up to e n l p 0 6 with increases in n γ of up to 56 and 108 at h tip l p 2 and 3 respectively but negligible effects thereafter the lower experimentally n γ at lower e n l p reflects the higher loss in embedment as n γ is calculated using the initial embedment depth h and not the reduced embedment depth at the ultimate capacity and the reduced plate rotation and hence projection of the plate towards the loading direction similar effects of padeye eccentricity on keying induced loss in embedment and hence potential anchor capacity have been observed in both clay e g o loughlin et al 2006 gaudin et al 2009 and sand barron 2014 fig 13 also shows the strong effects due to embedment depth and mudline load inclination for instance for an anchor with e n l p 1 capacity increases by 427 from n γ 2 6 at h tip l p 2 and for θ m 90 fig 13b to a maximum n γ 13 7 at h tip l p 3 and for θ m 0 fig 13a this increase in n γ with increasing embedment depth and reducing mudline load inclination is due to the extent of the failure mechanism which increases as the load direction becomes more horizontal and as the embedment depth increases e g see merifield and sloan 2006 also shown on fig 13b are the numerical solutions for horizontal plate anchors in sand under vertical loading reported by merifield and sloan 2006 and merifield et al 2006 which serve as comparisons to the centrifuge data for vertical loading noting that at high e n l p the anchor approached a near horizontal orientation at ultimate capacity the solutions on fig 13b are provided for a friction angle ϕ 37 as appropriate for the relative density and stress levels in these centrifuge tests bolton 1987 although the aspect ratio l p w 1 33 i e close to a square the plate width tapers towards the anchor tip such that the equivalent aspect ratio near the tip is closer to 3 5 for this reason and given the complex geometry of the plate anchor solutions for both strip and square anchors are provided experimentally determined values of n γ lie between the solutions for the strip and square at e n l p 1 but lie beneath both solutions at e n l p 0 15 although merifield and sloan 2006 also provide solutions for horizontally loaded vertical plate anchors i e a horizontal load applied to the padeye of a vertical plate anchor there are no existing theoretical or numerical solutions relevant to the more realistic scenario offshore and modelled in these centrifuge tests where the load is horizontal at the mudline and consequently inclined at the padeye 5 results cyclic capacity as outlined earlier in the paper the cyclic tests considered the a4 anchor with e n l p 1 at a fixed embedment ratio h tip l p 2 and load inclination at the mudline θ m 0 the loading sequences for both the regular and irregular cyclic loading are shown in fig 14 a slack mooring was modelled using a nominal mooring line load clr 0 05 in the regular cyclic loading tests and 20 n in the irregular cyclic loading tests to avoid issues with the load control algorithm trying to achieve 0 n key results from the cyclic tests and the equivalent monotonic test are summarised in table 2 5 1 regular cyclic loading as shown in fig 14a the regular cyclic loading involved a sinusoidal wave with a fixed minimum load clr 0 05 but with an increasing amplitude starting at a maximum load of clr 0 2 that was maintained for packets of 300 cycles before being stepped to the next amplitude at a fixed clr increment of 0 10 until failure occurred fig 15 compares the results from the two repeat cyclic tests with the equivalent monotonic test the initial loading to 70 of the monotonic anchor capacity is identical but the subsequent cyclic loading is seen to lead to improvements in the anchor capacity with an average ultimate capacity f u 1002 8 kn n γ 11 6 that is 28 8 higher than the monotonic ultimate capacity f u 780 kn n γ 9 a third cyclic test was conducted but stopped when the clr reached 0 7 to permit a visual comparison with the corresponding monotonic test that was also stopped at 70 of the monotonic anchor capacity test rc2c1c the comparison is provided in fig 16 which shows consistent anchor and mooring line inclinations between the two tests differing by 0 5 for the anchor and 1 2 for the mooring line but significantly lower loss in embedment for the cyclically loaded anchor δz l p 0 08 compared to δz l p 0 31 which explains the higher ultimate cyclic capacity 5 2 irregular cyclic loading the irregular cyclic loading tests involved a pre programmed storm of irregular cyclic loads fig 14b and c established from wave tank tests on a wave energy converter with catenary moorings casaubieilh et al 2014 two irregular cyclic loading tests were conducted using the storm shown on fig 14b and c but with both the storm duration and the peak cyclic load scaled test ic2c1a1 involved 15 storms with the peak cyclic load equal to the monotonic anchor capacity clrpeak 1 whereas test ic2c1a1 5 involved a single storm in which the peak cyclic load was 50 higher than the monotonic anchor capacity i e clrpeak 1 5 the irregular cyclic loading test results are compared with the equivalent monotonic test in fig 17 where it can be seen that the anchor was capable of withstanding 15 storms at clr peak 1 but not a single storm with clr peak 1 5 the post cyclic monotonic test following the 15 storms resulted in an eventual anchor capacity f u 1030 0 kn n γ 12 3 43 higher than the reference monotonic ultimate capacity f u 721 2 kn n γ 8 6 failure occurred quickly in test ic2c1a1 5 with significant mooring line displacement at a clr 1 17 with an observed cyclic ultimate capacity f u 863 4 kn n γ 10 2 20 higher than the reference monotonic ultimate capacity fig 17b shows that the rotation response of the anchor is similar albeit with some minor differences in rotation at the peak capacity the higher drained anchor capacity measured during or after cyclic loading is consistent with other plate anchor studies involving drained cyclic loading e g chow et al 2015 and also the response of piles due to drained cyclic loading in sand e g nicolai et al 2017 relatively low magnitude cyclic loading such as in test ic2c1a1 allows for densification that improves anchor capacity whereas the more onerous cyclic loading in test ic2c1a1 5 involved load cycles that approached the anchor capacity before significant densification such that the higher peak cyclic loads could not be tolerated such behaviour can be captured by kinematic hardening soil models that account for stress history e g corti et al 2016 6 conclusions this paper considers the drained capacity of a dynamically installed plate anchor in dense sand under monotonic and cyclic loading the blade like anchor design was prompted by a requirement to minimise penetration resistance during dynamic installation which resulted in an anchor padeye that was located close to the plate however the centrifuge data considered in this paper reveal that the low padeye eccentricity is problematic for mobilising anchor capacity as there is insufficient lever arm to develop the moment loading that will initiate anchor rotation and subsequently develop the highest bearing resistance on the anchor plate a more optimal anchor design would be to employ a padeye eccentricity equal to about 0 6 times the plate height consideration would need to be given to the influence of an eccentric padeye during dynamic installation as this may affect both the verticality of the anchor during free fall and the potential to achieve adequate penetration in this respect a bridle arrangement or a rotating padeye arm may be a practical solution that would allow the padeye to be located parallel and close to the plate during installation and eccentric from the plate during loading the centrifuge tests involved jacked installation to an anchor tip embedment that was either two or three times the plate height as the dynamic installation centrifuge tests reported in chow et al 2017 indicate that this level of embedment is achievable the test data show that the plate anchor is most efficient in sand when loaded through a catenary rather than a vertical mooring this is partly due to the anchor kinematics as for a high padeye eccentricity a vertical mooring causes significant anchor rotation and loss of embedment whereas a catenary mooring leads to much more moderate rotation and embedment loss a catenary mooring is also more efficient as the loading at the padeye is inclined rather than vertical such that the failure mechanism is likely to involve a much larger soil mass the centrifuge test data indicate that an anchor capacity factor n γ 13 is achievable with an equivalent anchor capacity of approximately 2 mn for the 2 4 m high prototype plate anchor considered here in the context of mooring line loads for marine renewable energy devices azcona et al 2017 calculate a maximum dynamic mooring line load of approximately 3 mn for a 5 mn offshore wind turbine stabilised by a spar platform whereas palm et al 2013 calculate a maximum dynamic mooring line load of approximately 550 kn for a wave energy converter that was modelled as a cylinder with a mass of 100 tonnes hence the prototype equivalence of the anchor considered in the centrifuge tests would require moderate upscaling for the wind turbine but significant downscaling for the wave energy converter comparisons with existing theoretical and numerical solutions for anchor capacity in sand is hampered by the limiting and unrealistic assumptions regarding load direction and plate inclination which are unrealistic for offshore anchors that are installed vertically the centrifuge data show that drained cyclic loading improves anchor capacity by up to 43 with lower level cyclic loading leading to the greatest gains the effect of partially drained cyclic loading is unclear and warrants further attention given the dynamic nature of cyclic loading on offshore renewable energy devices including the potential for high magnitude short duration snap or snatch loads e g hann et al 2015 hsu et al 2017 acknowledgements this work forms

lee and singh 2014 used the l1 control method to design a depth controller they conducted depth keeping simulations under random disturbances to verify the controller robustness 1 3 envelope protection system eps studies have been conducted since the 1990s in the aeronautical field some algorithms are available for eps including the peak response estimation and the dynamic trim algorithm the peak response estimation algorithm is suitable for dynamics with overshoot the algorithm is used to estimate the peak value of the limit parameter induced by control input it is used to avoid the limit of the rotor hub moment and flapping of a helicopter sahani 2005 horn et al 2001 the dynamic trim algorithm was proposed by horn et al 1998 and is widely used for eps the algorithm can predict the control input that forces the limit parameter to exceed the restricted limit using the quasi steady state condition the algorithm was modified by horn et al 2002 yavrucuk 2003 and unnikrishnan et al 2011 into an online training method using a neural network nn that is adaptable to various operational conditions applications of the above algorithms to various aircraft such as fixed wing rotary wing and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles have been undertaken in aeronautics yavrucuk et al 2009 yavrucuk and prasad 2012 shin et al 2011 gursoy and yavrucuk 2014 tekles et al 2016 studies on submarine operational stability mainly deal with the course keeping ability instability of roll motion or depth keeping in waves based on the experimental data and cfd research on the carefree maneuvering system for the submarine using eps is in nascent stages the aim of this study is to design an eps that ensures the speed depth and pitch angle of the submarine within a predefined soe a six degrees of freedom equation of motion deduction of hydrodynamic coefficients from experimental results and soe calculation of the submarine are required to design the eps the maneuvering motion

performance the remainder of this paper is structured as follows equations of motion and the external force modeling are provided in section 2 in section 3 the submarine soe is calculated based on the maneuvering simulation the eps designs for speed depth and pitch angle are described in section 4 and simulation results with and without the eps are presented in section 5 finally conclusions are provided in section 6 2 equations of motion in this section the submarine equations of motion are described the coordinate system consists of the space fixed coordinate o x s y s z s and body fixed coordinate o x y z the coordinate system used in this study is shown in fig 1 the origin of the body fixed coordinate is located at the mid ship on the center line the six degrees of freedom equations of motion can be expressed as 1 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q x m v w p u r y g r 2 p 2 z g q r p x g q p r y m w u q v p z g p 2 q 2 x g r p q y g r q p z i x p i z i y q r i x z r p q

p m x g v w p u r y g u v r w q n where m is the submarine mass i i j is the moment of inertia and the coordinate x g y g z g locates the center of gravity in the body fixed coordinate the terms on the right side of 1 represent the external forces acting on the submarine in this paper the coefficient based external force model is used the hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by the captive model test results in a subsonic wind tunnel and towing tank the expression and description of the model are shown in park and kim 2017 2 1 main ballast tank blowing main ballast tank mbt blowing is conducted by a gas generator system or high pressure air system water emission by a gas generator system uses hydrazine or inert gas the system can empty the mbts more rapidly than a high pressure air system however the equipment is expensive and cannot be stopped in an emergency rising maneuver the high pressure air system uses massive highly compressed air inside the reservoir most submarines adopt this system for emergency rising maneuvers in this paper it is assumed that the submarine is equipped with the high pressure air system for emergency rising maneuvers fig 2 illustrates the release of ballast water from a high pressure air system when the mbt blowing begins the water inside the mbt is expelled and the air volume is increased the volume ratio of air in the mbt from the blowing is formulated as 2 v a i v t i a 1 a 1 2 a 2 where a 1 p a t ρ g z 0 x t i sin θ 0 45 d cos θ 1 8 ρ g d cos θ a 2 m r o r t 1 e c 2 t t 0 0 9 ρ g d v t cos θ where v a i is the volume of air in mbt i v t i denotes the total volume of mbt i v t represents the volume of all mbts and p a t is the atmospheric pressure in addition g is the gravitational constant z 0 denotes the depth x t i is the axial coordinate of the centroid of mbt i and d represents the maximum hull diameter moreover t is the current time t 0 is the time at which blowing was initiated m r 0 denotes the mass of air in the bottled air reservoir at time t 0 r is the gas constant for air t denotes the ambient temperature in the mbts and c 2 represents a blowing constant bettle et al 2009 as the mbts are emptied the mass weight moments of inertia and center of gravity are changed the derivation of 2 and changes in inertias are described in detail by watt 2007 our target submarine has four mbts distributed along the longitudinal axis based on the body fixed coordinate origin two mbts are located on the bow side the others are situated on the stern side the locations of the mbts are determined by the length ratio between that of watt 2007 and our target submarine the air mass and volumes of the mbts are determined by the displacement ratio the used values of the mbt blowing model parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 propeller generally the thrust function is formulated using advance ratio j the advance ratio extends to infinity when the propeller revolution arrives to zero thus the function can be diverged during the crash stop simulation in this research the advance ratio is replaced by the velocity ratio to address the singularity the velocity ratio is defined as 3 3 η u c u where u c denotes the expected speed with propeller revolution n p and it can be defined as 10 4 u c c η n p coefficient c η depends on the hull form and propeller characteristics and 0 2555 is chosen as the value when the submarine must change its speed the propeller revolution corresponding with the command speed is obtained using 4 the command of the propeller revolution is defined as n p c the propeller revolution cannot simultaneously follow the command on account of the propeller inertia the propeller revolution dynamics are assumed to be second order dynamics as 5 n p 2 ζ ω n n p ω n 2 n p ω n 2 n p c natural frequency ω n and damping ratio ζ in the propeller dynamics are chosen to be 0 1 and 0 7 respectively by referencing watt 2007 if the propeller revolution changes the expected speed is changed and the velocity ratio is likewise changed according to 3 and 4 the thrust function using the velocity ratio was proposed by shin 2006 the thrust function is established based on various actual submarine data it is shown as fig 3 if the velocity ratio is 1 i e the present speed is equal to the expected speed with the present propeller revolution the thrust function is zero thus the submarine maintains its speed if the velocity ratio is greater than 1 the thrust function becomes positive the positive thrust function value provides the additional thrust to the submarine and the submarine speed is increased until the velocity ratio converges to 1 3 safety operational envelope in this section the overall soe content and method to establish the soe are described based on the research of park et al 2017 the soe is defined as the region that guarantees the safety of a submarine from accidents such as jamming and flooding the relation between the submarine speed and depth is used to define the soe as shown in fig 4 the definitions of the parameters in fig 4 are the following maximum safety depth z m a x maximum depth in a normal operation condition maximum excursion depth z e x c depth limit according to which the submarine does not exceed the collapse depth by jam to dive or flooding when it takes a recovery action minimum safety depth z m i n depth limit to avoid a collision with surface ships periscope depth z p e r i depth limit to operate the periscope or snorkel flood avoidance zone limited zone to prevent sinking of the submarine by flooding in a low speed range broach limited zone limited zone to avoid a collision with a surface ship or exposure above the free surface by a jam to rise pitch limited zone limited pitch angle to prevent the malfunction of onboard machinery and equipment by excessive pitch the maximum pitch angle applied in practice is conventionally limited to 5 10 burcher and rydill 1995 the soe can be variously established according to the accident situation such as jamming or flooding in this paper only jamming is considered as the submarine accident the jamming is divided into jam to dive and jam to rise types according to the direction of the control surface deflection the submarine should variously handle each situation the submarine takes an emergency rising maneuver to cope with a jam to dive the emergency rising maneuver consists of three steps in the first phase the propeller revolution is reduced to decrease the diving speed bow side mbt blowing and bow plane deflection are performed to increase the pitch angle in the second phase if the pitch angle becomes positive the propeller revolution is finally increased and stern side mbt blowing is conducted to increase the submarine rising speed the soe jam to dive boundary is determined by the maximum safety depth or maximum excursion depth for each speed conditions for each speed condition the maximum excursion depths are calculated by finding the maximum initial depth to guarantee that the submarine does not exceed the collapse depth by taking an emergency rising maneuver from the jam to dive situation the smaller value between the maximum safety depth and maximum excursion depth is chosen for the jam to dive boundary the crash stop is conducted to cope with the jam to rise because the use of mbt blowing is not appropriate for the situation the submarine reduces its speed and stops by reversing its propeller the jam to rise boundary can be obtained by calculating the excursion depth during the crash stop and by adding the variation in depth to the minimum safety depth moreover the reaction time should be considered when the soe is determined the reaction time is defined as the time consumed until the crews recognize the danger and take the proper action to address the accident the reaction time depends on the training proficiency of the crews it is generally assumed to be 15 s the emergency rising maneuver and the crash stop simulations are performed to establish the soe of the submarine based on the procedure explained above the non dimensionalized initial speed by the design speed is chosen as 0 1 1 with a 0 1 interval the simulation conditions for the soe setup are listed in table 2 the results and discussion of the emergency rising maneuver and crash stop simulations are shown in park et al 2017 and the soe established by the simulations is shown in fig 5 the soe boundary becomes narrow as a high speed is approached because the excursion depth becomes large as the speed is increased the jam to dive region calculated by the emergency rising maneuver simulation is larger than the jam to rise region obtained by the crash stop 4 envelope protection system the eps can be configured using limit detection and limit avoidance limit detection is the process of predicting the future response of the limit parameter and the control limit which makes the parameter exceed the prescribed restriction the ideal approach to predicting the future response of the limit parameter is to perfectly know its dynamics however this endeavor is impossible and the limit parameter dynamics can be changed under different operation conditions the estimation model for the limit parameter dynamics is needed to predict the future response an adaptive control method should be used to enhance the robustness of the estimation model in this research the estimation model is designed using nn to compensate the modeling error between the true response and approximation model response the dynamic trim algorithm is applied to the estimation model to obtain the future response of the limit parameter and the control limit the limit avoidance is used to prevent the limit parameter from exceeding its predetermined limit based on the control limit there are two approaches to achieving automatic limit avoidance control limiting is used to calculate the allowable control travel and the information is used to artificially limit actuator control inputs unnikrishnan et al 2011 a high level controller is a controller that generates the command while a low level controller causes the plant to follow the command in command limiting the combined system of the vehicle dynamics and low level controller is regarded as a new form of plant dynamics the command to the low level controller is considered the control input of the combined system it is restricted by the limit avoidance to prevent exceeding the limit parameter most research on eps design has applied the command limiting algorithm for limit avoidance falkena et al 2011 revealed that command limiting is robust to modeling uncertainty measurement noise and time delay in this paper the command limiting method is used for limit avoidance 4 1 estimation model in this section the methods for establishing the estimation model that is used to predict the limit parameter response are presented yavrucuk et al 2009 provided a theoretical development of limit parameter estimation using an online nn and park and kim 2017 employed the method to estimate the submarine pitch dynamics in this paper the method is applied to predict the closed loop dynamics of the limit parameters such as the speed depth and pitch angle of the submarine let us define the limit parameter by y p r then the closed loop dynamics of the parameter can be expressed as the nonlinear equation shown in 6 6 y p r f x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c where x r n is a state vector and u c r l is the command to the low level controller in closed loop dynamics the command to the low level controller is regarded as the control input of the submarine and low level controller combined system the relative degree r means the number of times one must differentiate an output before an input explicitly appears nonlinear function f can be expressed by using approximation model h the difference between the approximation model and the true nonlinear dynamics is defined as modeling uncertainty δ then 6 can be shown as 7 y p r h y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c δ x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c the approximation model can be chosen based on the knowledge of the limit parameter dynamics or by the nominal model the linear model shown in 7 is adopted for the approximation model 8 h y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c i 1 r a i y p r i b u c the coefficients a i r and b r are arbitrary constants that can be determined by the controller designer the estimation model of the limit parameter dynamics is obtained by augmenting linear dynamic compensator v d c and adaptive signal v a d to the approximation model let y ˆ p be the response of the estimation model then the model can be expressed as 9 y ˆ p r i 1 r a i y ˆ p r i b u c v d c v a d the estimation error dynamics can be obtained by subtracting 7 from 9 let y p be the estimation error y ˆ p y p then 10 y p r i 1 r a i y p r i v d c v a d δ x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c the adaptive signal is used to estimate and compensate the modeling uncertainty the linear dynamic compensator provides additional stability to the estimation error dynamics the estimation error dynamics can be expressed as the matrix form shown in 11 11 e a e b v d c b v a d δ x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c where a 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 a r a r 1 a r 2 a 1 e y p y p 1 y p 2 y p r 1 t b 0 0 0 1 t the adaptive signal is designed based on the nn which approximates the unknown function by the nonlinear combination of the nn inputs the nn consists of the input layer hidden layer and output layer each layer is comprised of a number of neurons let n i n p n h i d and n o u t be the number of neurons in the input hidden and output layers respectively the nn input is constructed in the input layer nn input μ r n i n p 1 should be determined by considering which states affect the limit parameters and bias b v is added to the determined nn input the nn input is weighted by hidden layer weight matrix v ˆ r n i n p 1 n h i d and it becomes the sigmoid function variable as shown in 12 12 σ z 1 1 e a z where z v t μ where a is called the activation potential bias b w is added to the variables through the hidden layer it is weighted by output weight matrix w ˆ r n i n p 1 n h i d to make the adaptive signal v a d 13 v a d w ˆ t σ v ˆ t μ assuming the existence of ideal weight matrices for v ˆ w ˆ which can approximate the modeling uncertainty within a ball of radius ε the modeling uncertainty can be written as 14 14 δ w t σ v t μ ε where ε is called the function reconstruction error the following lyapunov function candidate is chosen to derive the adaptive law that makes the estimation error stable 15 l e t p e t r w t γ w 1 w t r v t γ v 1 v where w and v mean w ˆ w and v ˆ v respectively p is the solution of the following lyapunov equation 16 a t p p a q 0 and q is a positive definite matrix the matrices γ v 0 and γ w 0 determine the learning rate of the nn the adaptive law that makes the time derivative of the lyapunov function candidate negative outside a compact set was derived by calise et al 2001 the nn weights w v and estimation error e in the lyapunov function candidate are ultimately bounded by the adaptive law shown in 17 17 v ˆ γ v μ e t p b w ˆ t σ λ e t p b v ˆ w ˆ γ w σ σ v ˆ t μ e t p b λ e t p b w ˆ where λ is a positive constant the terms with λ are used to prevent the divergence of the adaptive law 4 2 dynamic trim algorithm the dynamic trim algorithm is used to predict the future response and determine the control limit which prevents the limit parameter from being exceeded the algorithm can be applied to the system in which its maximum response is shown in steady states if the limit parameter dynamics can use the dynamic trim algorithm assumption the maximum value of the future response corresponding with the present input occurs in a steady state the maximum value is called the dynamic trim response and it is defined as y ˆ d t the dynamic trim response can be obtained by applying the dynamic trim assumption to the approximation model in 9 18 y ˆ d t b u c v d c v a d y ˆ d t u c a r the command limit u c l i m is a value of the command for which the dynamic trim response is equal to the limited value let the limit be denoted as y l i m then the command limit can be expressed as 19 using 18 19 u c lim a r y lim v d c v a d y lim u c lim b the variable to be solved exists on both sides of the nonlinear equation thus the iteration method is needed to solve the equation according to yavrucuk et al 2002 19 always has at least one fixed point solution as long as the modeling uncertainty δ is bounded a guaranteed fixed point solution will result in the convergence of the dynamic trim values accordingly the fixed point iteration is used to obtain the solution of the nonlinear equation the command limit of the previous time step is chosen for the initial iteration value of the next time step 4 3 limit avoidance the output of the limit detection is regarded as the virtual limit of the command the command is restricted by the virtual limit shown in 20 20 u c mod u c lim u p p e r i f u c lim u p p e r u c u c i f u c lim l o w e r u c u c lim u p p e r u c lim l o w e r i f u c u c lim l o w e r according to 20 if the command is within the upper command limit and lower command limit then the incoming command passes through the eps unmodified on the other hand if the command exceeds the command limit boundaries then the eps overrides the command 4 4 submarine envelope protection system architecture it is assumed that the closed loop dynamics of limit parameters with the low level controller can be expressed as first order linear dynamics 21 θ ˆ a 1 θ ˆ b θ c v a d μ k l c θ ˆ θ 22 u ˆ a 1 u ˆ b u c v a d μ k l c u ˆ u 23 z ˆ a 1 z ˆ b z c v a d μ k l c z ˆ z the constants of approximation model a 1 and b are determined as the same value by assuming that the limit parameters effectively follow each command by the low level controllers the variables that affect the function are chosen as the nn inputs since there is no systematic method to determine the number of neurons and the value of activation potential one can start with a relatively large number of neurons and decrease the number of neurons until the control performance deteriorates the number can be fixed thereafter for the simulation park et al 2016 the nn learning rates in the adaptive law γ v and γ w 0 are tuned by comparing the adaptive signals and modeling uncertainty the design parameters for the estimation model are listed in table 3 the designed eps architecture is presented in fig 6 5 simulation depth change simulations were conducted to verify the designed eps capabilities in this study the pitch limit was set to 5 the initial depth of the submarine was set to 0 64 z max with a design speed according to the predefined soe shown in fig 5 the safe depth range with a design speed was 0 59 z max 0 78 z max thus the submarine was initially in the soe at 50 s from the simulation start the command depth was changed to z max which exceeded the depth limit range in the initial speed if the depth reached z max the speed should have been reduced to less than 0 7 u design thus we simultaneously changed the speed command to 0 69 u design with the depth command change the depth limit was also less than z max before the speed was reduced therefore the depth change should have been performed without the exceeded depth limit corresponding to its speed for each time step fig 7 shows the depth change simulation results without eps without eps refers to the situation in which the control system conducts the estimation and limit detection for speed depth pitch dynamics but the limit avoidance is not applied the first rows of fig 7a b and c respectively represent the true response estimation model response and limit of the corresponding limit parameters speed depth pitch angle the second rows show the command and command limit calculated by the limit detection algorithm the information on the adaptive signal and modeling error of the dynamics is presented in the third rows of the graphs the fourth rows of fig 7a and b indicate the propeller revolution and deflection angles of the bow plane and stern plane respectively the adaptive signals are initially set to zero and they estimate the modeling errors according to the update law expressed in 23 thus the estimation model responses estimate the true responses of each limit parameter as shown in fig 7a the speed is reduced as the speed command changes to 0 69 u design the speed violates its limit at approximately 155 s from 70 s because the speed limit is decreased as the submarine moves to a deeper depth fig 7b presents the time responses related with depth although the depth limit is increased as the submarine speed is reduced the violation of the depth limit is observed at approximately 72 s because the depth command exceeds the command limit which is predicted by the limit detection algorithm the submarine depth is controlled by changing the pitch angle an excessive pitch command is applied to the control system when the submarine performs the depth change accordingly the pitch angle exceeds 5 the response of the eps augmented depth change simulation is shown in fig 8 the pitch command which is modified by the eps is decreased as the pitch angle approaches its limit it can thus be observed that the pitch angle is regulated to the limit it is evident that the depth limit violations are prevented by overriding the depth command within the predicted limits the depth is gradually changed by the depth protection system the gradual change of depth makes the speed limit change smoothly hence the speed is indirectly protected by the eps the depth change simulation results with and without eps are compared in fig 9 while the submarine exceeds the soe boundary when the control system is not applied the trajectory with eps is within the soe the designed eps guarantees that the submarine can maneuver in the soe without exceeding its boundary it is thereby confirmed that the eps enhances the operational stability 6 conclusion in this paper a submarine envelope protection system was proposed to prevent submarine excursion from the soe specific conclusions can be drawn from the results of this research when the stern plane is jammed a higher initial speed increases both the excursion depth from the initial depth and the time required to recover from the accident the proposed estimation model is composed of a linear approximation model linear compensator and artificial nn which are appropriate for estimating the submarine dynamics of speed depth and pitch angle the designed eps prevents the submarine from exceeding the limit boundary and the control system can thereby enhance the operational stability this study suggests that verification of the eps algorithm itself was completed to apply the algorithm to a real submarine the following research limitations should be resolved first as described in section 4 4 a systematic method for determining the design parameters in the eps algorithm should be established in this study we had to adjust the parameter value depending on the simulation results second there may be differences in control performance due to differences between the actual environment and simulation environment some uncertainties remain including the maneuvering model hydrodynamic coefficients and scale effect in this paper an adaptive control method was chosen to estimate the submarine dynamics however some unexpected problems can occur in a real condition further studies are required to ensure the proposed eps performance by resolving the research limitations acknowledgments this research

1995 designed a depth controller based on gain scheduling for operation in various sea conditions a mathematical model was proposed for calculating the wave forces on the submarine and a pid control method was used to confirm the possibility of control through simulations choi 2006 kim et al 2009 analyzed the limitations of pid control and designed a depth controller using the lqr control method lee and singh 2014 used the l1 control method to design a depth controller they conducted depth keeping simulations under random disturbances to verify the controller robustness 1 3 envelope protection system eps studies have been conducted since the 1990s in the aeronautical field some algorithms are available for eps including the peak response estimation and the dynamic trim algorithm the peak response estimation algorithm is suitable for dynamics with overshoot the algorithm is used to estimate the peak value of the limit parameter induced by control input it is used to avoid the limit of the rotor hub moment and flapping of a helicopter sahani 2005 horn et al 2001 the dynamic trim algorithm was proposed by horn et al 1998 and is widely used for eps the algorithm can predict the control input that forces the limit parameter to exceed the restricted limit using the quasi steady state condition the algorithm was modified by horn et al 2002 yavrucuk 2003 and unnikrishnan et al 2011 into an online training method using a neural network nn that is adaptable to various operational conditions applications of the above algorithms to various aircraft such as fixed wing rotary wing and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles have been undertaken in aeronautics yavrucuk et al 2009 yavrucuk and prasad 2012 shin et al 2011 gursoy and yavrucuk 2014 tekles et al 2016 studies on submarine operational stability mainly deal with the course keeping ability instability of roll motion or depth keeping in waves based on the experimental data and cfd research on the carefree maneuvering system for the submarine using eps is in nascent stages the aim of this study is to design an eps that ensures the speed depth and pitch angle of the submarine within a predefined soe a six degrees of freedom equation of motion deduction of hydrodynamic coefficients from experimental results and soe calculation of the submarine are required to design the eps the maneuvering motion

performance the remainder of this paper is structured as follows equations of motion and the external force modeling are provided in section 2 in section 3 the submarine soe is calculated based on the maneuvering simulation the eps designs for speed depth and pitch angle are described in section 4 and simulation results with and without the eps are presented in section 5 finally conclusions are provided in section 6 2 equations of motion in this section the submarine equations of motion are described the coordinate system consists of the space fixed coordinate o x s y s z s and body fixed coordinate o x y z the coordinate system used in this study is shown in fig 1 the origin of the body fixed coordinate is located at the mid ship on the center line the six degrees of freedom equations of motion can be expressed as 1 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q x m v w p u r y g r 2 p 2 z g q r p x g q p r y m w u q v p z g p 2 q 2 x g r p q y g r q p z i x p i z i y q r i x z r p q

p m x g v w p u r y g u v r w q n where m is the submarine mass i i j is the moment of inertia and the coordinate x g y g z g locates the center of gravity in the body fixed coordinate the terms on the right side of 1 represent the external forces acting on the submarine in this paper the coefficient based external force model is used the hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by the captive model test results in a subsonic wind tunnel and towing tank the expression and description of the model are shown in park and kim 2017 2 1 main ballast tank blowing main ballast tank mbt blowing is conducted by a gas generator system or high pressure air system water emission by a gas generator system uses hydrazine or inert gas the system can empty the mbts more rapidly than a high pressure air system however the equipment is expensive and cannot be stopped in an emergency rising maneuver the high pressure air system uses massive highly compressed air inside the reservoir most submarines adopt this system for emergency rising maneuvers in this paper it is assumed that the submarine is equipped with the high pressure air system for emergency rising maneuvers fig 2 illustrates the release of ballast water from a high pressure air system when the mbt blowing begins the water inside the mbt is expelled and the air volume is increased the volume ratio of air in the mbt from the blowing is formulated as 2 v a i v t i a 1 a 1 2 a 2 where a 1 p a t ρ g z 0 x t i sin θ 0 45 d cos θ 1 8 ρ g d cos θ a 2 m r o r t 1 e c 2 t t 0 0 9 ρ g d v t cos θ where v a i is the volume of air in mbt i v t i denotes the total volume of mbt i v t represents the volume of all mbts and p a t is the atmospheric pressure in addition g is the gravitational constant z 0 denotes the depth x t i is the axial coordinate of the centroid of mbt i and d represents the maximum hull diameter moreover t is the current time t 0 is the time at which blowing was initiated m r 0 denotes the mass of air in the bottled air reservoir at time t 0 r is the gas constant for air t denotes the ambient temperature in the mbts and c 2 represents a blowing constant bettle et al 2009 as the mbts are emptied the mass weight moments of inertia and center of gravity are changed the derivation of 2 and changes in inertias are described in detail by watt 2007 our target submarine has four mbts distributed along the longitudinal axis based on the body fixed coordinate origin two mbts are located on the bow side the others are situated on the stern side the locations of the mbts are determined by the length ratio between that of watt 2007 and our target submarine the air mass and volumes of the mbts are determined by the displacement ratio the used values of the mbt blowing model parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 propeller generally the thrust function is formulated using advance ratio j the advance ratio extends to infinity when the propeller revolution arrives to zero thus the function can be diverged during the crash stop simulation in this research the advance ratio is replaced by the velocity ratio to address the singularity the velocity ratio is defined as 3 3 η u c u where u c denotes the expected speed with propeller revolution n p and it can be defined as 10 4 u c c η n p coefficient c η depends on the hull form and propeller characteristics and 0 2555 is chosen as the value when the submarine must change its speed the propeller revolution corresponding with the command speed is obtained using 4 the command of the propeller revolution is defined as n p c the propeller revolution cannot simultaneously follow the command on account of the propeller inertia the propeller revolution dynamics are assumed to be second order dynamics as 5 n p 2 ζ ω n n p ω n 2 n p ω n 2 n p c natural frequency ω n and damping ratio ζ in the propeller dynamics are chosen to be 0 1 and 0 7 respectively by referencing watt 2007 if the propeller revolution changes the expected speed is changed and the velocity ratio is likewise changed according to 3 and 4 the thrust function using the velocity ratio was proposed by shin 2006 the thrust function is established based on various actual submarine data it is shown as fig 3 if the velocity ratio is 1 i e the present speed is equal to the expected speed with the present propeller revolution the thrust function is zero thus the submarine maintains its speed if the velocity ratio is greater than 1 the thrust function becomes positive the positive thrust function value provides the additional thrust to the submarine and the submarine speed is increased until the velocity ratio converges to 1 3 safety operational envelope in this section the overall soe content and method to establish the soe are described based on the research of park et al 2017 the soe is defined as the region that guarantees the safety of a submarine from accidents such as jamming and flooding the relation between the submarine speed and depth is used to define the soe as shown in fig 4 the definitions of the parameters in fig 4 are the following maximum safety depth z m a x maximum depth in a normal operation condition maximum excursion depth z e x c depth limit according to which the submarine does not exceed the collapse depth by jam to dive or flooding when it takes a recovery action minimum safety depth z m i n depth limit to avoid a collision with surface ships periscope depth z p e r i depth limit to operate the periscope or snorkel flood avoidance zone limited zone to prevent sinking of the submarine by flooding in a low speed range broach limited zone limited zone to avoid a collision with a surface ship or exposure above the free surface by a jam to rise pitch limited zone limited pitch angle to prevent the malfunction of onboard machinery and equipment by excessive pitch the maximum pitch angle applied in practice is conventionally limited to 5 10 burcher and rydill 1995 the soe can be variously established according to the accident situation such as jamming or flooding in this paper only jamming is considered as the submarine accident the jamming is divided into jam to dive and jam to rise types according to the direction of the control surface deflection the submarine should variously handle each situation the submarine takes an emergency rising maneuver to cope with a jam to dive the emergency rising maneuver consists of three steps in the first phase the propeller revolution is reduced to decrease the diving speed bow side mbt blowing and bow plane deflection are performed to increase the pitch angle in the second phase if the pitch angle becomes positive the propeller revolution is finally increased and stern side mbt blowing is conducted to increase the submarine rising speed the soe jam to dive boundary is determined by the maximum safety depth or maximum excursion depth for each speed conditions for each speed condition the maximum excursion depths are calculated by finding the maximum initial depth to guarantee that the submarine does not exceed the collapse depth by taking an emergency rising maneuver from the jam to dive situation the smaller value between the maximum safety depth and maximum excursion depth is chosen for the jam to dive boundary the crash stop is conducted to cope with the jam to rise because the use of mbt blowing is not appropriate for the situation the submarine reduces its speed and stops by reversing its propeller the jam to rise boundary can be obtained by calculating the excursion depth during the crash stop and by adding the variation in depth to the minimum safety depth moreover the reaction time should be considered when the soe is determined the reaction time is defined as the time consumed until the crews recognize the danger and take the proper action to address the accident the reaction time depends on the training proficiency of the crews it is generally assumed to be 15 s the emergency rising maneuver and the crash stop simulations are performed to establish the soe of the submarine based on the procedure explained above the non dimensionalized initial speed by the design speed is chosen as 0 1 1 with a 0 1 interval the simulation conditions for the soe setup are listed in table 2 the results and discussion of the emergency rising maneuver and crash stop simulations are shown in park et al 2017 and the soe established by the simulations is shown in fig 5 the soe boundary becomes narrow as a high speed is approached because the excursion depth becomes large as the speed is increased the jam to dive region calculated by the emergency rising maneuver simulation is larger than the jam to rise region obtained by the crash stop 4 envelope protection system the eps can be configured using limit detection and limit avoidance limit detection is the process of predicting the future response of the limit parameter and the control limit which makes the parameter exceed the prescribed restriction the ideal approach to predicting the future response of the limit parameter is to perfectly know its dynamics however this endeavor is impossible and the limit parameter dynamics can be changed under different operation conditions the estimation model for the limit parameter dynamics is needed to predict the future response an adaptive control method should be used to enhance the robustness of the estimation model in this research the estimation model is designed using nn to compensate the modeling error between the true response and approximation model response the dynamic trim algorithm is applied to the estimation model to obtain the future response of the limit parameter and the control limit the limit avoidance is used to prevent the limit parameter from exceeding its predetermined limit based on the control limit there are two approaches to achieving automatic limit avoidance control limiting is used to calculate the allowable control travel and the information is used to artificially limit actuator control inputs unnikrishnan et al 2011 a high level controller is a controller that generates the command while a low level controller causes the plant to follow the command in command limiting the combined system of the vehicle dynamics and low level controller is regarded as a new form of plant dynamics the command to the low level controller is considered the control input of the combined system it is restricted by the limit avoidance to prevent exceeding the limit parameter most research on eps design has applied the command limiting algorithm for limit avoidance falkena et al 2011 revealed that command limiting is robust to modeling uncertainty measurement noise and time delay in this paper the command limiting method is used for limit avoidance 4 1 estimation model in this section the methods for establishing the estimation model that is used to predict the limit parameter response are presented yavrucuk et al 2009 provided a theoretical development of limit parameter estimation using an online nn and park and kim 2017 employed the method to estimate the submarine pitch dynamics in this paper the method is applied to predict the closed loop dynamics of the limit parameters such as the speed depth and pitch angle of the submarine let us define the limit parameter by y p r then the closed loop dynamics of the parameter can be expressed as the nonlinear equation shown in 6 6 y p r f x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c where x r n is a state vector and u c r l is the command to the low level controller in closed loop dynamics the command to the low level controller is regarded as the control input of the submarine and low level controller combined system the relative degree r means the number of times one must differentiate an output before an input explicitly appears nonlinear function f can be expressed by using approximation model h the difference between the approximation model and the true nonlinear dynamics is defined as modeling uncertainty δ then 6 can be shown as 7 y p r h y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c δ x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c the approximation model can be chosen based on the knowledge of the limit parameter dynamics or by the nominal model the linear model shown in 7 is adopted for the approximation model 8 h y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c i 1 r a i y p r i b u c the coefficients a i r and b r are arbitrary constants that can be determined by the controller designer the estimation model of the limit parameter dynamics is obtained by augmenting linear dynamic compensator v d c and adaptive signal v a d to the approximation model let y ˆ p be the response of the estimation model then the model can be expressed as 9 y ˆ p r i 1 r a i y ˆ p r i b u c v d c v a d the estimation error dynamics can be obtained by subtracting 7 from 9 let y p be the estimation error y ˆ p y p then 10 y p r i 1 r a i y p r i v d c v a d δ x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c the adaptive signal is used to estimate and compensate the modeling uncertainty the linear dynamic compensator provides additional stability to the estimation error dynamics the estimation error dynamics can be expressed as the matrix form shown in 11 11 e a e b v d c b v a d δ x y p y p 1 y p r 1 u c where a 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 a r a r 1 a r 2 a 1 e y p y p 1 y p 2 y p r 1 t b 0 0 0 1 t the adaptive signal is designed based on the nn which approximates the unknown function by the nonlinear combination of the nn inputs the nn consists of the input layer hidden layer and output layer each layer is comprised of a number of neurons let n i n p n h i d and n o u t be the number of neurons in the input hidden and output layers respectively the nn input is constructed in the input layer nn input μ r n i n p 1 should be determined by considering which states affect the limit parameters and bias b v is added to the determined nn input the nn input is weighted by hidden layer weight matrix v ˆ r n i n p 1 n h i d and it becomes the sigmoid function variable as shown in 12 12 σ z 1 1 e a z where z v t μ where a is called the activation potential bias b w is added to the variables through the hidden layer it is weighted by output weight matrix w ˆ r n i n p 1 n h i d to make the adaptive signal v a d 13 v a d w ˆ t σ v ˆ t μ assuming the existence of ideal weight matrices for v ˆ w ˆ which can approximate the modeling uncertainty within a ball of radius ε the modeling uncertainty can be written as 14 14 δ w t σ v t μ ε where ε is called the function reconstruction error the following lyapunov function candidate is chosen to derive the adaptive law that makes the estimation error stable 15 l e t p e t r w t γ w 1 w t r v t γ v 1 v where w and v mean w ˆ w and v ˆ v respectively p is the solution of the following lyapunov equation 16 a t p p a q 0 and q is a positive definite matrix the matrices γ v 0 and γ w 0 determine the learning rate of the nn the adaptive law that makes the time derivative of the lyapunov function candidate negative outside a compact set was derived by calise et al 2001 the nn weights w v and estimation error e in the lyapunov function candidate are ultimately bounded by the adaptive law shown in 17 17 v ˆ γ v μ e t p b w ˆ t σ λ e t p b v ˆ w ˆ γ w σ σ v ˆ t μ e t p b λ e t p b w ˆ where λ is a positive constant the terms with λ are used to prevent the divergence of the adaptive law 4 2 dynamic trim algorithm the dynamic trim algorithm is used to predict the future response and determine the control limit which prevents the limit parameter from being exceeded the algorithm can be applied to the system in which its maximum response is shown in steady states if the limit parameter dynamics can use the dynamic trim algorithm assumption the maximum value of the future response corresponding with the present input occurs in a steady state the maximum value is called the dynamic trim response and it is defined as y ˆ d t the dynamic trim response can be obtained by applying the dynamic trim assumption to the approximation model in 9 18 y ˆ d t b u c v d c v a d y ˆ d t u c a r the command limit u c l i m is a value of the command for which the dynamic trim response is equal to the limited value let the limit be denoted as y l i m then the command limit can be expressed as 19 using 18 19 u c lim a r y lim v d c v a d y lim u c lim b the variable to be solved exists on both sides of the nonlinear equation thus the iteration method is needed to solve the equation according to yavrucuk et al 2002 19 always has at least one fixed point solution as long as the modeling uncertainty δ is bounded a guaranteed fixed point solution will result in the convergence of the dynamic trim values accordingly the fixed point iteration is used to obtain the solution of the nonlinear equation the command limit of the previous time step is chosen for the initial iteration value of the next time step 4 3 limit avoidance the output of the limit detection is regarded as the virtual limit of the command the command is restricted by the virtual limit shown in 20 20 u c mod u c lim u p p e r i f u c lim u p p e r u c u c i f u c lim l o w e r u c u c lim u p p e r u c lim l o w e r i f u c u c lim l o w e r according to 20 if the command is within the upper command limit and lower command limit then the incoming command passes through the eps unmodified on the other hand if the command exceeds the command limit boundaries then the eps overrides the command 4 4 submarine envelope protection system architecture it is assumed that the closed loop dynamics of limit parameters with the low level controller can be expressed as first order linear dynamics 21 θ ˆ a 1 θ ˆ b θ c v a d μ k l c θ ˆ θ 22 u ˆ a 1 u ˆ b u c v a d μ k l c u ˆ u 23 z ˆ a 1 z ˆ b z c v a d μ k l c z ˆ z the constants of approximation model a 1 and b are determined as the same value by assuming that the limit parameters effectively follow each command by the low level controllers the variables that affect the function are chosen as the nn inputs since there is no systematic method to determine the number of neurons and the value of activation potential one can start with a relatively large number of neurons and decrease the number of neurons until the control performance deteriorates the number can be fixed thereafter for the simulation park et al 2016 the nn learning rates in the adaptive law γ v and γ w 0 are tuned by comparing the adaptive signals and modeling uncertainty the design parameters for the estimation model are listed in table 3 the designed eps architecture is presented in fig 6 5 simulation depth change simulations were conducted to verify the designed eps capabilities in this study the pitch limit was set to 5 the initial depth of the submarine was set to 0 64 z max with a design speed according to the predefined soe shown in fig 5 the safe depth range with a design speed was 0 59 z max 0 78 z max thus the submarine was initially in the soe at 50 s from the simulation start the command depth was changed to z max which exceeded the depth limit range in the initial speed if the depth reached z max the speed should have been reduced to less than 0 7 u design thus we simultaneously changed the speed command to 0 69 u design with the depth command change the depth limit was also less than z max before the speed was reduced therefore the depth change should have been performed without the exceeded depth limit corresponding to its speed for each time step fig 7 shows the depth change simulation results without eps without eps refers to the situation in which the control system conducts the estimation and limit detection for speed depth pitch dynamics but the limit avoidance is not applied the first rows of fig 7a b and c respectively represent the true response estimation model response and limit of the corresponding limit parameters speed depth pitch angle the second rows show the command and command limit calculated by the limit detection algorithm the information on the adaptive signal and modeling error of the dynamics is presented in the third rows of the graphs the fourth rows of fig 7a and b indicate the propeller revolution and deflection angles of the bow plane and stern plane respectively the adaptive signals are initially set to zero and they estimate the modeling errors according to the update law expressed in 23 thus the estimation model responses estimate the true responses of each limit parameter as shown in fig 7a the speed is reduced as the speed command changes to 0 69 u design the speed violates its limit at approximately 155 s from 70 s because the speed limit is decreased as the submarine moves to a deeper depth fig 7b presents the time responses related with depth although the depth limit is increased as the submarine speed is reduced the violation of the depth limit is observed at approximately 72 s because the depth command exceeds the command limit which is predicted by the limit detection algorithm the submarine depth is controlled by changing the pitch angle an excessive pitch command is applied to the control system when the submarine performs the depth change accordingly the pitch angle exceeds 5 the response of the eps augmented depth change simulation is shown in fig 8 the pitch command which is modified by the eps is decreased as the pitch angle approaches its limit it can thus be observed that the pitch angle is regulated to the limit it is evident that the depth limit violations are prevented by overriding the depth command within the predicted limits the depth is gradually changed by the depth protection system the gradual change of depth makes the speed limit change smoothly hence the speed is indirectly protected by the eps the depth change simulation results with and without eps are compared in fig 9 while the submarine exceeds the soe boundary when the control system is not applied the trajectory with eps is within the soe the designed eps guarantees that the submarine can maneuver in the soe without exceeding its boundary it is thereby confirmed that the eps enhances the operational stability 6 conclusion in this paper a submarine envelope protection system was proposed to prevent submarine excursion from the soe specific conclusions can be drawn from the results of this research when the stern plane is jammed a higher initial speed increases both the excursion depth from the initial depth and the time required to recover from the accident the proposed estimation model is composed of a linear approximation model linear compensator and artificial nn which are appropriate for estimating the submarine dynamics of speed depth and pitch angle the designed eps prevents the submarine from exceeding the limit boundary and the control system can thereby enhance the operational stability this study suggests that verification of the eps algorithm itself was completed to apply the algorithm to a real submarine the following research limitations should be resolved first as described in section 4 4 a systematic method for determining the design parameters in the eps algorithm should be established in this study we had to adjust the parameter value depending on the simulation results second there may be differences in control performance due to differences between the actual environment and simulation environment some uncertainties remain including the maneuvering model hydrodynamic coefficients and scale effect in this paper an adaptive control method was chosen to estimate the submarine dynamics however some unexpected problems can occur in a real condition further studies are required to ensure the proposed eps performance by resolving the research limitations acknowledgments this research
