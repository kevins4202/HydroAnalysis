20895,a numerical method for solving 3d unsteady potential flow problem of ship advancing in waves is proposed the flow field is divided into inner and outer domain by an artificial matching surface the inner domain includes ship wetted surface matching surface and free surface inside the free surface condition is formulated by perturbation about the double body flow db model or uniform incoming flow assumption nk model the outer domain contains matching surface free surface outside and infinite far field boundary where only nk model is applied the simple green function and transient free surface green function are used to form the boundary integral equation bie by the impulse response function method for the inner and outer domain taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is utilized to solve the bies matching conditions for the inner domain and outer domain flow are enforced by the continuity of velocity potential and normal velocity on the matching surface in this paper several ships are selected to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients and displacement at different forward speed the experiment measurements in physical tank is also used to validate the accuracy of numerical results good agreement of 6dof ship motions in various wave headings can be obtained using tebem method keywords tebem method impulse response function domain decomposition added mass damping coefficient full wave heading 1 introduction in recent years the importance of a reliable prediction of the seakeeping behavior of ships in real seas has significantly increased traditionally the problem is linearized and formulated in frequency domain an alternative to the frequency domain approach is to formulate the problem in time domain in the context of time domain potential flow boundary element methods bem the most commonly used approaches fall in two categories 1 methods of using the transient green s function and 2 methods of using the rankine source in first category the analysis of wave loads and marine structure motions by transient green s function methods has attracted many investigations see for example yeung 1982 newman 1985 beck and liapis 1987 king et al 1988 korsmeyer et al 1988 beck and magee 1990 lin and yue 1990 zhang and dai 1993 bingham et al 1994 duan and dai 1997 korsmeyer and bingham 1998 the time domain green s function method appears to have advantages over the frequency domain green s function method especially for forward speed problems however for many practical ships like container ships the included angle between hull surface and the calm water surface commonly named as flared angle hereafter could be as small as nearly 10 during the calculation of the linear or body nonlinear hydrodynamic problem of these large flared ships the time stepping calculations could give divergent results which prevents the practical application of transient green s function method of ship seakeeping problem for rankine source method sources and dipoles can be distributed on all boundaries of fluid fields therefore it is suitable to deal with various kinds of free surface conditions a computer code called ship wave analysis swan has been developed for steady wave resistance and unsteady seakeeping problems by continual efforts of nakos 1990 kring 1994 and huang 1997 kim and kim 2011 developed a computer code called wave induced loads and ship motion wish for the time domain seakeeping analysis using the rankine panel method shao and faltinsen 2012 developed a program called seakeeping and added resistance of ships searos for seakeeping analysis and added resistance prediction by means of the body fixed coordinate system in addition zhang et al 2010a he and kashiwagi 2014 and so on analyzed the seakeeping of ship by rankine source method however a large geometry domain of the free surface elements need to be discretized in the numerical simulation which is highly cpu time consuming in view of pros and cons of the two methods a natural and optimal choice is to take full advantage of the two methods by using a combination of the transient green s function and rankine source in formulating the approach a matching integral equation with inner domain distributed by rankine source and outer domain distributed by transient green s function was proposed by sierevogel et al 1996 zhang et al 1998 and tang et al 2014 this strategy is very useful for zero forward speed problems but not so robust for forward speed cases calculating second order derivatives in the free surface condition accurately is the main difficulty related to the stability of forward speed hydrodynamic simulation that urge to realize the origin advantage of transient green s function method motivate the present research for this difficulty to avoid the difficulty of hobem in dealing with corner boundary and overcome the short comings of lobem for deriving the velocity near the corners duan 2012 proposed the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem for solving 2 d linear hydrodynamic problems it is found that the accuracy of induced velocity at the sharp corner boundary improved greatly by first order tebem for second order radiation and diffraction problems there exist second order derivatives of first order velocity potential on the body surface and free surface boundary condition so the second order tebem is developed see duan et al 2015a duan et al 2015b which solved the second order radiation and diffraction potential problem in the time domain for zero speed problems the progress made in the present study includes development and validation of matching method the mathematical formulations of boundary value problems of radiation and diffraction impulse potential are shortly reviewed in section 2 and 3 respectively section 4 describes the motion equations of ships advancing in waves section 5 discusses the implementation of the far field boundary condition numerical implementation of tebem method is illustrated in section 6 finally the numerical results of the wigley s60 afra and modified kvlcc2 ship will show the superiority of the tebem method 2 boundary value problem of radiation impulse potential consider a 3d ship on the water surface advancing at constant forward speed and undergoing 6 dof motions in response to an incident wave an inertial cartesian coordinate system o xyz moving with ship average forward speed is chosen with the plane xoy coincident with the undisturbed free surface x axis pointing to the ship advancing direction and z axis pointing upwards through the ship s mass centroid as shown in fig 1 the incompressible and inviscid water is assumed the flow is irrotational the motion of the water can be described by the velocity potential ϕ based on the linearization assumption velocity potential ϕ could be divided into the steady and unsteady potential 1 ϕ u x φ ϕ i j 1 6 ϕ j ϕ 7 ϕ j 0 t η j t τ φ j τ d τ j 1 6 where u means the forward speed of ships η j j 1 6 means the 6 dof motion displacement of ships φ is the basis flow velocity potential which is based on the double body db assumption and its order is ο 1 while it would be zero for the neumann kelvin nk assumption the boundary value problem of the basic potential is as follows 2 2 φ 0 φ n u n x o n s h φ z 0 o n s f φ 0 x 2 y 2 z 2 where the normal vector n points towards the fluid ϕ i and ϕ 7 in formula 1 represent the unsteady incident and diffraction potential ϕ j j 1 6 is the unsteady 6 dof motion radiation potential and then the radiation potential ϕ j can be expressed as the convolution scheme of unit radiation potential φ j and ship motion velocity η j all unsteady potential are ο ε for saving the computational cost the impulse response function irf method is utilized to solve the radiation and diffraction potential in this paper the boundary value problem bvp of unit radiation potential φ j is discussed firstly in this section it can be divided into the instantaneous term and memory term such as 3 φ j ψ 1 j δ t ψ 2 j h t χ j where the delta function δ t 1 t 0 0 t 0 and the jump function h t 1 t 0 0 t 0 the bvps of ψ 1 j and ψ 2 j are shown as follows 4 2 ψ 1 j 0 ψ 1 j n n j o n s h ψ 1 j 0 o n s f f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n 5 2 ψ 2 j 0 ψ 2 j n m j o n s h ψ 2 j 0 o n s f f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n where m j terms involved in the body surface condition of the bvp 5 reflect the influence of the steady potential on unsteady potential and can be represented as m 1 m 2 m 3 n w m 4 m 5 m 6 n r w where w φ x u φ y φ z while for the nk assumption w u and the expression for m j terms can be written as m 1 m 2 m 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 4 m 5 m 6 0 0 u n 3 u n 2 the initial bvp of memory term χ j is expressed as 6 2 χ j 0 t w 2 g z χ j ψ 2 j f φ χ j o n s f χ j n 0 o n s h f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n χ j 0 χ j t g ψ 1 j z t 0 where the comprehensive free surface boundary condition is applied the right side term f φ χ j based on the db assumption is shown as follows f 2 φ z 2 χ j t w χ j u φ x φ x x χ j x u φ x φ x y χ j y φ y φ x y χ j x φ y φ y y χ j y while for the nk assumption f is equal to zero in numerical process the integral scheme of free surface boundary condition is used which can be referred in duan et al 2020 finally the time history of radiation potential can be transformed from the impulse signal by using the fournier transformation method the added mass and damping coefficient are got based on the radiation potential and its derivatives which would be discussed in section 4 3 boundary value problem of diffraction impulse potential be similar with the radiation potential the impulse response function method is also used to solve the diffraction potential hence the bvp of diffraction impulse potential is discussed in this section firstly it is very important to model the impulse incident potential properly when we consider the bvp under the coordinate system described in section 2 the encounter frequency ω would be involved 7 ω ω 0 k 0 u cos α where ω 0 k 0 and α represent frequency wave number and wave heading for the incident wave respectively while in following seas the incident waves come from the ship stern side and the ship has forward speed in this case the encounter frequency is not a single valued function of the absolute frequency hence the expression of impulse incident potential should be discussed in heading seas and following seas respectively in heading seas α 90 270 the impulse incident wave elevation ζ t δ t can be calculated by the fourier inverse transformation method 8 ζ t δ t 1 π 0 cos ω t d ω 1 π re 0 e i ω t d ω where re means taking the real part of complex value be similar with impulse incident wave elevation the impulse incident potential in heading seas can also be obtained through fourier inverse transformation for the incident potential 9 ϕ i δ t 1 π 0 ϕ i d ω where the expression of the incident potential ϕ i is written as eq 10 10 ϕ i re i g ω 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x cos α y sin α i ω t where g denotes the gravity acceleration in following seas α 0 90 o r 270 360 korsmeyer and bingham 1998 discussed the modelling method of impulse incident wave potential by fourier transformation method and divided the encounter frequency value into three domain where the encounter frequency was single valued function in each domain the three integral domains were 0 g 2 u cos α g 2 u cos α g u cos α and g u cos α respectively in following seas the representation of the impulse wave elevation ζ 0 t under the earth fixed coordinate system is as follows based on the fourier transformation 11 ζ 0 ω 0 ζ 0 t e i ω 0 t d t 12 ζ 0 t 1 π re 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e i ω 0 t d ω 0 similarly the impulse potential under the earth fixed coordinate system can also be written as 13 ϕ i re i g π 0 1 ω 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x cos α y sin α i ω 0 t d ω 0 where x y z means the location of fluid point under the earth fixed coordinate system meanwhile it also can be written as the following formula under the moving inertial coordinate system described in section 2 14 ϕ i re i g π 0 1 ω 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x u t cos α y sin α i ω 0 t d ω 0 then the impulse incident wave elevation ζ t at the moving inertial coordinate origin can be written as eq 15 according to the dynamic free surface boundary condition 15 ζ t 1 π re 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 according to three integral domains described in korsmeyer and bingham 1998 the impulse wave elevation can be written as the summation of three corresponding parts 16 ζ t ζ 1 t ζ 2 t ζ 3 t ζ 1 t 1 π re 0 g 2 u cos α ζ ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 ζ 2 t 1 π re g 2 u cos α g u cos α ζ ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 ζ 3 t 1 π re g u cos α ζ ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 following eq 11 the impulse incident wave elevation is ζ 0 t δ t so ζ 0 ω 0 1 finally the impulse incident potential of the corresponding impulse incident wave elevation can be written as 17 ϕ i δ t 1 re i g π 0 g 2 u cos α 1 ω 0 e k z i k x u t cos α y sin α i ω 0 t 1 2 ω 0 g u cos α d ω 0 ϕ i δ t 2 re i g π g 2 u cos α g u cos α 1 ω 0 e k z i k x u t cos α y sin α i ω 0 t 1 2 ω 0 g u cos α d ω 0 ϕ i δ t 3 re i g π g u cos α 1 ω 0 e k z i k x u t cos α y sin α i ω 0 t 1 2 ω 0 g u cos α d ω 0 in conclusions three bvps need to be solved in the following cases while only one bvp is involved in heading seas the trapezoidal method is used to calculate the impulse incident potential and its derivatives here we take the bvp of impulse diffraction potential in heading seas for example which is given as 18 2 ϕ 7 δ t 0 t w 2 g z ϕ 7 δ t f φ ϕ i δ t ϕ 7 δ t o n s f ϕ 7 δ t n ϕ i δ t n o n s h f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n ϕ 7 δ t t 0 0 ϕ 7 δ t n t 0 0 t 0 where the comprehensive free surface boundary condition is also applied the right side term f φ ϕ i δ t ϕ 7 δ t is shown as follows f 2 φ ϕ i δ t u φ x 2 2 ϕ i δ t u 2 2 ϕ i δ t x 2 φ z 2 ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t t w ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t u φ x φ x x ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t x u φ x φ x y ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t y φ y φ x y ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t x φ y φ y y ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t y while f is also equal to zero based on the nk assumption be similar with the memory term of the impulse radiation potential here the integral scheme of free surface boundary condition is also used the bvp of each impulse diffraction potential in following seas is the same with the heading seas only the impulse incident wave potential in body surface boundary condition is different which is determined by eq 17 finally according to the impulse diffraction potential in heading or following seas the diffraction potential can be computed by the fournier transformation based on the bernoulli equation the wave excitation force can be obtained by integrating the pressure on the wetted surface of ships the details can refer in section 4 4 wave loads and ship motion equation displacement and acceleration are the key parameters in the assessment of ship seakeeping performance which can be predicted by the 6 dof motion equations hence the wave loads acting on the ship should be computed firstly in this section the radiation and diffraction wave loads are calculated and discussed respectively 4 1 radiation wave load and hydrodynamics coefficients based on the bernoulli equation and near field pressure integral method the radiation wave load can be written as following 19 f i r ρ s h t w ϕ j n i d s q substitute eq 3 into eq 19 the expression of the radiation wave load is written as eq 20 20 f i r t μ i j η j t b i j η j t c i j η j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ where μ i j ρ s h ψ 1 j q n i d s q b i j ρ s h ψ 2 j q n i w ψ 1 j q n i d s q k i j ρ s h t χ j q t n i w χ j q t n i d s q c i j ρ s h w ψ 2 j q n i d s q assuming the wave elevation ζ t e i ω t and substitute this expression into eq 20 consequently the representation of radiation wave load in time domain is written as 21 f i r t ω 2 μ i j i ω b i j c i j i ω 0 t k i j τ e i ω τ d τ e i ω t according to the frequency domain potential flow theory the radiation force can be written as the sum of added mass force and wave damping force in frequency domain such as 22 f i r t ω 2 a i j ω i ω b i j ω e i ω t compared with the time domain and frequency domain expression of the radiation wave load the added mass and wave damping can be written as 23 a i j ω μ i j 1 ω 0 t k i j τ sin ω τ d τ c i j ω 2 24 b i j ω b i j 0 t k i j τ cos ω τ d τ 4 2 wave exciting load and ship motion equation be similar with the radiation wave load the bernoulli equation and near field pressure integral method is also used to calculate the wave exciting load which can be written as 25 f i i d t ρ s h t w ϕ i ϕ 7 n i d s assuming the incident wave elevation ζ t e i ω t and apply the fournier transformation the incident and diffraction potential in regular seas can be represented as 26 ϕ i ζ τ ϕ

seas then ζ 0 ω 0 δ ω 0 which determine the value of ζ j τ in each integral domain based on eq 16 finally substitute these expressions into eq 25 the wave exciting load can be written as eq 28 based on the impulse incident and diffraction potential 28 f i i d t ρ ζ τ d τ s h t w ϕ i δ t ϕ 7 δ t n i d s once the added mass wave damping and exciting load have been predicted the ship motion equation can be solved in this paper the 4th order runge kutta method is utilized to update the ship motion velocity and displacement at each new time step 29 m i j μ i j η j t b i j η j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ c i j c i j η j t f i i d t i j 1 6 where m i j and c i j mean the mass matrix and restoring force matrix of ships respectively the viscous damping coefficients are calculated by ikeda formula which could refer to ikeda 2004 5 the implementation of far field boundary condition it is assumed the radiation and diffraction wave satisfy the linearized free surface condition with uniform incoming flow the flow domain is divided into the inner and outer domain by the imaginary control surface sc as shown in fig 1 in inner domain it is bounded by the wetted body surface the free surface inside and the control surface for these bvps the simple rankine source is chosen as the green function by a mixed distribution of sources and dipoles the boundary integral equation takes the form of 30 2 π φ p t s h s f s c φ q t n q 1 r p q φ q t n q 1 r p q d s q where r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 x y z and ξ η ζ are the coordinate of the field point p and source point q respectively the ship body surface sh inner free surface sh and control surface sc are discretized into nb nf and nc elements hence the discretization scheme of boundary integral equation 30 can be written as 31 d h h d h f d h c d f h d f f d f c d c h d c f d c c φ h φ f φ c s h h s h f s h c s f h s f f s f c s c h s c f s c c φ n h φ n f φ n c where d q n q 1 r p q d s q s q 1 r p q d s q the diagonal terms of d are 2 π the subscript h f means the field point p and source point q locate on the body surface sh and inner free surface sf respectively when the corresponding influence coefficient is computed the outer domain is bounded by the imaginary control surface the free surface outside the virtual control surface and the boundary surface at infinity for the bvp 4 and 5 rankine source is also employed in the outer domain 32 g g 0 1 r 1 r where r represents the distance between the field point and image point of the source point about plane xoy the boundary integral equation of the outer domain is as follows 33 2 π φ p t s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q for the memory term of impulse radiation potential and impulse diffraction potential the transient green function is employed as follows 34 g g 0 g p q t τ 1 r 1 r 2 0 g k e k z ζ j 0 k r sin g k t τ d k where j 0 is the first kind bessel function r is the horizontal distance between the field and source point the transient green s function satisfies the linearized free surface condition and far field radiation condition it is only necessary to distribute the sources and dipoles on the imaginary control surface the boundary integral equation of outer domain is as follows 35 2 π φ p t s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q 0 t d τ s c g φ n q φ g n q d s q 1 g w l u 2 g φ ξ φ g ξ u g φ τ φ g τ d η the discretization scheme of boundary integral equation 35 can also be written as 36 d c c φ c s c c φ n c m where d q n q 1 r 1 r d s q s q 1 r 1 r d s q the diagonal terms of d are 2 π m means the integral contribution of the memory term in eq 36 hence the relation between the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the control surface can be shown as follows 37 φ c d c c 1 s c c φ n c d c c 1 m according to the integral scheme of free surface condition and eq 37 the unknowns on the inner free surface and control surface are the normal derivatives of potentials so eq 31 can be written as 38 d h h d h f d h c s f h s f f s f c s c h s c f s c c φ h φ n f φ n c s h h s h f s h c d f h d f f d f c d c h d c f d c c φ n h φ f φ c matching condition is enforced by the continuity of velocity potential and normal velocity on the control surface hence φ c in eq 38 can be substituted by eq 37 39 d h h d h f d h c d c c d c c 1 s c c s f h s f f s f c d c c d c c 1 s c c s c h s c

normal derivatives and the boundary integral equation of inner fluid domain can be solved by the matching method for the impulse potential ψ 1 j ψ 2 j the final boundary integral equations are similar only the memory term m 0 6 taylor expansion boundary element method in the formulation of the boundary value problem of radiation and diffraction impulse potential the first and second order derivatives of the basic flow potential and impulse potential are involved which would affect the accuracy of the solutions while it brings great numerical challenge to estimate accurately and robustly these potential first second order derivatives on the non smooth boundary like the waterline locations consequently three dimensional 3d taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is applied to solve eq 30 here numerical implementation of tebem method is illustrated in this section the tebem method proposed in this paper is based on the framework of the source and dipole mixed distribution method for three dimensional hydrodynamic problems the boundary surface is dispersed into small quadrilateral or triangular elements and the average values of the nodes are taken as the center in each panel hence the discretization scheme of boundary integral equation 30 can be written as 40 2 π φ p t i 1 n δ s φ q t n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n δ s φ q t n q 1 r p q d s q where n means the total element number on the body surface free surface and matching surface and n nb nf nc the corresponding dipole strength at the centroid of each panel is expressed as φ q 0 it is apparently different with the constant panel method the diploe strength on each panel in tebem can be expressed through the taylor expansion and reserve the first order derivatives which presented as eq 41 ξ and η are the local coordinates of the source point in an element q as shown in fig 2 41 φ q φ q 0 φ ξ q 0 ξ φ η q 0 η substitute eq 41 into the discretization boundary integral equation 40 the new boundary integral equation for tebem method can be obtained such as 42 2 π φ p t i 1 n φ q 0 t δ s n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t ξ δ s ξ n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t η δ s η n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t n q δ s 1 r p q d s q in order to supply the integral equations for tebem method the first order derivatives of potential at the field point of eq 30 are determined along the two mutually orthogonal tangential directions denoted as x and y respectively as shown in fig 2 43 2 π φ x x s h s f s c φ n q 1 r d s q x s h s f s c 1 r φ n d s q 44 2 π φ y y s h s f s c φ n q 1 r d s q y s h s f s c 1 r φ n d s q the same discretization method on the boundary surface is applied the taylor expansion formula 41 is also used for eqs 43 and 44 and give the following equations 45 2 π φ p t x i 1 n φ q 0 t δ s 2 x n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t ξ δ s ξ 2 x n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t η δ s η 2 x n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t n q δ s x 1 r p q d s q 46 2 π φ p t y i 1 n φ q 0 t δ s 2 y n

through eqs 42 45 and 46 where the dipole strength and its first order derivatives are the unknowns and the source strength is the known the integral principal values are obtained analytically such as the tangential first order derivatives of the dipole strength normalized to positive negative 1 2 all the influence coefficients involved in the tebem method can be referred to duan et al 2015a 2015b for the second order derivatives the auxiliary functions ψ φ x and ψ φ y are introduced in turn the boundary integral equation of auxiliary functions are constructed by green s third formula and solved by tebem method again consequently the second derivatives are obtained correctly 7 numerical results and discussions in this chapter the mathematical wigley ship s60 cb 0 7 ship one afra oil tanker and the modified kvlcc2 ship are chosen to validate the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper for predicting the 6 dof ship motion in various wave headings the main dimensions of these ships are shown in table 1 as follows the expression of wigley ship can be written as eq 47 47 η 1 ζ 2 1 ξ 2 1 0 2 ξ 2 ζ 2 1 ζ 8 1 ξ 2 4 ξ x l 2 η y b 2 ζ z d 7 1 the influence of the control surface as shown in section 5 the imaginal control surface divides the fluid domain into the inner domain and outer domain and the matching method is used to construct the boundary integral equation db and nk scheme of the free surface condition is applied in the inner and outer fluid domain respectively hence the inconsistency of the free surface condition in the inner and outer fluid domain should be discussed compared with the slender ship db scheme free surface boundary condition is more important so we choose the modified kvlcc2 ship to discuss the influence of the control surface which cb 0 84 and belong to the blunt ship fig 3 shows the absolute value of the induce velocity by the steady velocity potential φ of the modified kvlcc2 ship with forward speed u 4 112 m s the inner domain free surface area is 2l 1 73l where l means the ship length it can be found that the induced velocity by the steady velocity potential locates at the stern and bow part of the modified kvlcc2 ship and disappear rapidly away from the ship the values of the induced velocity at the element center near the control surface are mostly equal to 0 005 m s compared to the uniform coming flow u 4 112 m s the induced velocity values can be neglected at the element center near the control surface hence this inconsistency of the free surface condition in the inner and outer domain can be neglected when the free surface area is 2l 1 73l in the inner fluid domain consequently this paper would set the location of the control surface following this empirical parameter for other ship cases 7 2 convergence verification of impulse response function here the convergence verification is investigated based on the wigley ship model from several aspects such as the ship hull surface free surface matching surface element number and time step scale the numerical results of time delayed function based on the radiation impulse potential and time history of wave force due to the diffraction impulse potential are discussed in this section the sketch of element discretization on the fluid boundary is shown as fig 4 firstly the convergence of ship hull surface is developed four models are used which are nb1 nb 180 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nb2 nb 360 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nb3 nb 721 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 and nb4 nb 1440 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 respectively where the nb nf and nc mean the panel number of half of the ship hull surface the free surface and matching surface respectively fig 5 shows the numerical results of the time retardation function k33 which is produced by the memory term of radiation impulse potential in heave motion direction except for nb1 a good agreement can be obtained among the rest three models for time retardation function k33 hence the convergence of the body surface element is confirmed time retardation function k55 produced by the radiation impulse potential in pitch motion direction is shown in fig 6 to confirm the convergence of the free surface elements three kinds of free surface models are used which are model nf1 nb 721 nf 945 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nf2 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 and nf3 nb 721 nf 3780 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 it can be found that good convergence can be obtained the convergence of the matching surface element number for the diffraction wave force in heave motion direction is developed which are shown in fig 7 three models are utilized they are the model nc1 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 320 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nc2 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 and nc3 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 1292 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 respectively numerical results agree well too many elements would increase the computational burden especial for the matching surface panels because time domain green function and its derivatives in normal direction need to be solved on the matching surface according to the convergence research nc3 model is recommend for the space discretization of fluid domain time step scale is the important parameter for time domain simulation three different time step scales are studied the diffraction wave moment in pitch motion direction is shown in fig 8 a good agreement can be obtained according to the above analysis the convergent results of the radiation and diffraction impulse potential can be obtained for wigley ship 7 3 comparison of hydrodynamic coefficient between db and nk assumption as we know that the hydrodynamic coefficient is the key parameters for the ship motion equation in this section the radiation added mass and damping coefficient are calculated based on the db and nk assumption then comparison is made the between the experimental solution and numerical results similar researches also are developed by zhang et al 2010b figs 9 and 10 show the cross coupling added mass coefficient a35 and a53 for wigley ship in heave and pitch at fn 0 2 based on the db and nk assumption the added mass coefficient a35 and a53 are non dimensional by ρ δ and ρ δ l 2 where δ and l means the displacement and ship length figs 11 and 12 show the cross coupling damping coefficient b35 and b53 for wigley ship in heave and pitch at fn 0 20 the damping coefficient b35 and b53 are nondimensionalized by ρ δ g l and ρ δ l 2 g l kashiwagi 2017 performed the experimental study for this ship and provides the benchmark physical data it can be found the result of db

15 and 16 show the diagonal damping coefficient b33 and b55 in heave and pitch at fn 0 2 be similar the result of db assumption agrees well with experimental solutions it can be concluded that db assumption provide more accurate hydrodynamic coefficient of ships as the accuracy even for the slender ship 7 4 comparison of ship motions between db and nk assumption for the assessment of ship seakeeping performance the rao of ship motion displacement is the importance parameter here wigley s60 afra and modified kvlcc2 ship are chosen as the target ships for the motion rao computation comparison between the numerical result and experimental solution are performed to validate the accuracy of tebem method proposed in this paper figs 17 and 18 show the raos of heave and pitch motion for wigley ship at fn 0 2 at head wave headings 1800 rao of heave and pitch motion are nondimensionalized by ζ a and k ζ a where ζ a and k represent the wave amplitude and wave number of the incident wave compared with the experimental data the accuracy of db scheme is better especially for the resonance frequency range kashiwagi 2017 applied the eut method to predict the ship motion for wigley ship from the results it can be seen that the results of tebem method provide the better prediction at the resonance frequency range figs 19 and 20 show the raos of heave and pitch motion for s60 ship at fn 0 2 at heading regular seas it is found the ship motion displacement result based on db assumption agree well with the experimental data it is confirmed again that numerical simulation of hydrodynamic problem of ships with forward speed should be based on the db assumption even for the slender ship 7 5 the numerical validation of ship motion responses for modern commercial type ships in various wave headings finally the rao of ship advancing in the oblique wave is predicted by tebem method proposed in this paper an afra type oil tanker ship is calculated and the rao of heave roll and pitch motion at fn 0 127 are shown from figs 21 23 respectively wave heading is 1 35 china ship scientific research center cssrc performed the experimental study for this ship model according to the comparison between the numerical results and experimental solutions good agreement is obtained for the heave and pitch motion while for roll motion the peak of numerical results at the resonance frequency domain is larger compared with the experimental solutions presently the viscous roll damping is modelled by the simplified ikeda empirical formula and the underestimation of the roll damping could be attributed to the over estimation the natural roll peak value the modified kvlcc2 ship is also used to calculate the rao of the 6 dof ship motion at different forward speeds and the numerical results are shown from figs 24 29 respectively the wave heading is at the stern oblique seas 30 yasukawa et al 2019 carried out the physical test study for the modified kvlcc2 ship with different forward speeds f n 0 0 049 0 099 it can be found that tebem method could capture well the motion characteristic at different forward speeds and good agreement can be obtained compared with the experimental solutions 8 conclusions in this paper the matching bem method based on the impulse response function formulation is utilized to solve the seakeeping problem of ships the rankine source and time domain green function are applied to construct the boundary integral equation for radiation and diffraction impulse potential in the inner and outer flow domain respectively which are solved by a novel boundary element method tebem the wigley s60 afra and modified kvlcc2 ship are chosen as the validation ships the hydrodynamic coefficients and heave roll and pitch motions are analyzed some conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the matching method based on the impulse response function formulation could simulate the hydrodynamic problem of ships with forward speed in time domain stably matching surface element number of half domain is around 500 good convergence can be obtained too much panels would increase the computational expense of transient time domain green function 2

20895,a numerical method for solving 3d unsteady potential flow problem of ship advancing in waves is proposed the flow field is divided into inner and outer domain by an artificial matching surface the inner domain includes ship wetted surface matching surface and free surface inside the free surface condition is formulated by perturbation about the double body flow db model or uniform incoming flow assumption nk model the outer domain contains matching surface free surface outside and infinite far field boundary where only nk model is applied the simple green function and transient free surface green function are used to form the boundary integral equation bie by the impulse response function method for the inner and outer domain taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is utilized to solve the bies matching conditions for the inner domain and outer domain flow are enforced by the continuity of velocity potential and normal velocity on the matching surface in this paper several ships are selected to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients and displacement at different forward speed the experiment measurements in physical tank is also used to validate the accuracy of numerical results good agreement of 6dof ship motions in various wave headings can be obtained using tebem method keywords tebem method impulse response function domain decomposition added mass damping coefficient full wave heading 1 introduction in recent years the importance of a reliable prediction of the seakeeping behavior of ships in real seas has significantly increased traditionally the problem is linearized and formulated in frequency domain an alternative to the frequency domain approach is to formulate the problem in time domain in the context of time domain potential flow boundary element methods bem the most commonly used approaches fall in two categories 1 methods of using the transient green s function and 2 methods of using the rankine source in first category the analysis of wave loads and marine structure motions by transient green s function methods has attracted many investigations see for example yeung 1982 newman 1985 beck and liapis 1987 king et al 1988 korsmeyer et al 1988 beck and magee 1990 lin and yue 1990 zhang and dai 1993 bingham et al 1994 duan and dai 1997 korsmeyer and bingham 1998 the time domain green s function method appears to have advantages over the frequency domain green s function method especially for forward speed problems however for many practical ships like container ships the included angle between hull surface and the calm water surface commonly named as flared angle hereafter could be as small as nearly 10 during the calculation of the linear or body nonlinear hydrodynamic problem of these large flared ships the time stepping calculations could give divergent results which prevents the practical application of transient green s function method of ship seakeeping problem for rankine source method sources and dipoles can be distributed on all boundaries of fluid fields therefore it is suitable to deal with various kinds of free surface conditions a computer code called ship wave analysis swan has been developed for steady wave resistance and unsteady seakeeping problems by continual efforts of nakos 1990 kring 1994 and huang 1997 kim and kim 2011 developed a computer code called wave induced loads and ship motion wish for the time domain seakeeping analysis using the rankine panel method shao and faltinsen 2012 developed a program called seakeeping and added resistance of ships searos for seakeeping analysis and added resistance prediction by means of the body fixed coordinate system in addition zhang et al 2010a he and kashiwagi 2014 and so on analyzed the seakeeping of ship by rankine source method however a large geometry domain of the free surface elements need to be discretized in the numerical simulation which is highly cpu time consuming in view of pros and cons of the two methods a natural and optimal choice is to take full advantage of the two methods by using a combination of the transient green s function and rankine source in formulating the approach a matching integral equation with inner domain distributed by rankine source and outer domain distributed by transient green s function was proposed by sierevogel et al 1996 zhang et al 1998 and tang et al 2014 this strategy is very useful for zero forward speed problems but not so robust for forward speed cases calculating second order derivatives in the free surface condition accurately is the main difficulty related to the stability of forward speed hydrodynamic simulation that urge to realize the origin advantage of transient green s function method motivate the present research for this difficulty to avoid the difficulty of hobem in dealing with corner boundary and overcome the short comings of lobem for deriving the velocity near the corners duan 2012 proposed the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem for solving 2 d linear hydrodynamic problems it is found that the accuracy of induced velocity at the sharp corner boundary improved greatly by first order tebem for second order radiation and diffraction problems there exist second order derivatives of first order velocity potential on the body surface and free surface boundary condition so the second order tebem is developed see duan et al 2015a duan et al 2015b which solved the second order radiation and diffraction potential problem in the time domain for zero speed problems the progress made in the present study includes development and validation of matching method the mathematical formulations of boundary value problems of radiation and diffraction impulse potential are shortly reviewed in section 2 and 3 respectively section 4 describes the motion equations of ships advancing in waves section 5 discusses the implementation of the far field boundary condition numerical implementation of tebem method is illustrated in section 6 finally the numerical results of the wigley s60 afra and modified kvlcc2 ship will show the superiority of the tebem method 2 boundary value problem of radiation impulse potential consider a 3d ship on the water surface advancing at constant forward speed and undergoing 6 dof motions in response to an incident wave an inertial cartesian coordinate system o xyz moving with ship average forward speed is chosen with the plane xoy coincident with the undisturbed free surface x axis pointing to the ship advancing direction and z axis pointing upwards through the ship s mass centroid as shown in fig 1 the incompressible and inviscid water is assumed the flow is irrotational the motion of the water can be described by the velocity potential ϕ based on the linearization assumption velocity potential ϕ could be divided into the steady and unsteady potential 1 ϕ u x φ ϕ i j 1 6 ϕ j ϕ 7 ϕ j 0 t η j t τ φ j τ d τ j 1 6 where u means the forward speed of ships η j j 1 6 means the 6 dof motion displacement of ships φ is the basis flow velocity potential which is based on the double body db assumption and its order is ο 1 while it would be zero for the neumann kelvin nk assumption the boundary value problem of the basic potential is as follows 2 2 φ 0 φ n u n x o n s h φ z 0 o n s f φ 0 x 2 y 2 z 2 where the normal vector n points towards the fluid ϕ i and ϕ 7 in formula 1 represent the unsteady incident and diffraction potential ϕ j j 1 6 is the unsteady 6 dof motion radiation potential and then the radiation potential ϕ j can be expressed as the convolution scheme of unit radiation potential φ j and ship motion velocity η j all unsteady potential are ο ε for saving the computational cost the impulse response function irf method is utilized to solve the radiation and diffraction potential in this paper the boundary value problem bvp of unit radiation potential φ j is discussed firstly in this section it can be divided into the instantaneous term and memory term such as 3 φ j ψ 1 j δ t ψ 2 j h t χ j where the delta function δ t 1 t 0 0 t 0 and the jump function h t 1 t 0 0 t 0 the bvps of ψ 1 j and ψ 2 j are shown as follows 4 2 ψ 1 j 0 ψ 1 j n n j o n s h ψ 1 j 0 o n s f f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n 5 2 ψ 2 j 0 ψ 2 j n m j o n s h ψ 2 j 0 o n s f f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n where m j terms involved in the body surface condition of the bvp 5 reflect the influence of the steady potential on unsteady potential and can be represented as m 1 m 2 m 3 n w m 4 m 5 m 6 n r w where w φ x u φ y φ z while for the nk assumption w u and the expression for m j terms can be written as m 1 m 2 m 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 4 m 5 m 6 0 0 u n 3 u n 2 the initial bvp of memory term χ j is expressed as 6 2 χ j 0 t w 2 g z χ j ψ 2 j f φ χ j o n s f χ j n 0 o n s h f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n χ j 0 χ j t g ψ 1 j z t 0 where the comprehensive free surface boundary condition is applied the right side term f φ χ j based on the db assumption is shown as follows f 2 φ z 2 χ j t w χ j u φ x φ x x χ j x u φ x φ x y χ j y φ y φ x y χ j x φ y φ y y χ j y while for the nk assumption f is equal to zero in numerical process the integral scheme of free surface boundary condition is used which can be referred in duan et al 2020 finally the time history of radiation potential can be transformed from the impulse signal by using the fournier transformation method the added mass and damping coefficient are got based on the radiation potential and its derivatives which would be discussed in section 4 3 boundary value problem of diffraction impulse potential be similar with the radiation potential the impulse response function method is also used to solve the diffraction potential hence the bvp of diffraction impulse potential is discussed in this section firstly it is very important to model the impulse incident potential properly when we consider the bvp under the coordinate system described in section 2 the encounter frequency ω would be involved 7 ω ω 0 k 0 u cos α where ω 0 k 0 and α represent frequency wave number and wave heading for the incident wave respectively while in following seas the incident waves come from the ship stern side and the ship has forward speed in this case the encounter frequency is not a single valued function of the absolute frequency hence the expression of impulse incident potential should be discussed in heading seas and following seas respectively in heading seas α 90 270 the impulse incident wave elevation ζ t δ t can be calculated by the fourier inverse transformation method 8 ζ t δ t 1 π 0 cos ω t d ω 1 π re 0 e i ω t d ω where re means taking the real part of complex value be similar with impulse incident wave elevation the impulse incident potential in heading seas can also be obtained through fourier inverse transformation for the incident potential 9 ϕ i δ t 1 π 0 ϕ i d ω where the expression of the incident potential ϕ i is written as eq 10 10 ϕ i re i g ω 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x cos α y sin α i ω t where g denotes the gravity acceleration in following seas α 0 90 o r 270 360 korsmeyer and bingham 1998 discussed the modelling method of impulse incident wave potential by fourier transformation method and divided the encounter frequency value into three domain where the encounter frequency was single valued function in each domain the three integral domains were 0 g 2 u cos α g 2 u cos α g u cos α and g u cos α respectively in following seas the representation of the impulse wave elevation ζ 0 t under the earth fixed coordinate system is as follows based on the fourier transformation 11 ζ 0 ω 0 ζ 0 t e i ω 0 t d t 12 ζ 0 t 1 π re 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e i ω 0 t d ω 0 similarly the impulse potential under the earth fixed coordinate system can also be written as 13 ϕ i re i g π 0 1 ω 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x cos α y sin α i ω 0 t d ω 0 where x y z means the location of fluid point under the earth fixed coordinate system meanwhile it also can be written as the following formula under the moving inertial coordinate system described in section 2 14 ϕ i re i g π 0 1 ω 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x u t cos α y sin α i ω 0 t d ω 0 then the impulse incident wave elevation ζ t at the moving inertial coordinate origin can be written as eq 15 according to the dynamic free surface boundary condition 15 ζ t 1 π re 0 ζ 0 ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 according to three integral domains described in korsmeyer and bingham 1998 the impulse wave elevation can be written as the summation of three corresponding parts 16 ζ t ζ 1 t ζ 2 t ζ 3 t ζ 1 t 1 π re 0 g 2 u cos α ζ ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 ζ 2 t 1 π re g 2 u cos α g u cos α ζ ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 ζ 3 t 1 π re g u cos α ζ ω 0 e i ω 0 1 ω 0 g u cos α t d ω 0 following eq 11 the impulse incident wave elevation is ζ 0 t δ t so ζ 0 ω 0 1 finally the impulse incident potential of the corresponding impulse incident wave elevation can be written as 17 ϕ i δ t 1 re i g π 0 g 2 u cos α 1 ω 0 e k z i k x u t cos α y sin α i ω 0 t 1 2 ω 0 g u cos α d ω 0 ϕ i δ t 2 re i

conclusions three bvps need to be solved in the following cases while only one bvp is involved in heading seas the trapezoidal method is used to calculate the impulse incident potential and its derivatives here we take the bvp of impulse diffraction potential in heading seas for example which is given as 18 2 ϕ 7 δ t 0 t w 2 g z ϕ 7 δ t f φ ϕ i δ t ϕ 7 δ t o n s f ϕ 7 δ t n ϕ i δ t n o n s h f a r f i e l d b o u n d a r y c o n d i t i o n ϕ 7 δ t t 0 0 ϕ 7 δ t n t 0 0 t 0 where the comprehensive free surface boundary condition is also applied the right side term f φ ϕ i δ t ϕ 7 δ t is shown as follows f 2 φ ϕ i δ t u φ x 2 2 ϕ i δ t u 2 2 ϕ i δ t x 2 φ z 2 ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t t w ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t u φ x φ x x ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t x u φ x φ x y ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t y φ y φ x y ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t x φ y φ y y ϕ 7 δ t ϕ i δ t y while f is also equal to zero based on the nk assumption be similar with the memory term of the impulse radiation potential here the integral scheme of free surface boundary condition is also used the bvp of each impulse diffraction potential in following seas is the same with the heading seas only the impulse incident wave potential in body surface boundary condition is different which is determined by eq 17 finally according to the impulse diffraction potential in heading or following seas the diffraction potential can be computed by the fournier transformation based on the bernoulli equation the wave excitation force can be obtained by integrating the pressure on the wetted surface of ships the details can refer in section 4 4 wave loads and ship motion equation displacement and acceleration are the key parameters in the assessment of ship seakeeping performance which can be predicted by the 6 dof motion equations hence the wave loads acting on the ship should be computed firstly in this section the radiation and diffraction wave loads are calculated and discussed respectively 4 1 radiation wave load and hydrodynamics coefficients based on the bernoulli equation and near field pressure integral method the radiation wave load can be written as following 19 f i r ρ s h t w ϕ j n i d s q substitute eq 3 into eq 19 the expression of the radiation wave load is written as eq 20 20 f i r t μ i j η j t b i j η j t c i j η j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ where μ i j ρ s h ψ 1 j q n i d s q b i j ρ s h ψ 2 j q n i w ψ 1 j q n i d s q k i j ρ s h t χ j q t n i w χ j q t n i d s q c i j ρ s h w ψ 2 j q n i d s q assuming the wave elevation ζ t e i ω t and substitute this expression into eq 20 consequently the representation of radiation wave load in time domain is written as 21 f i r t ω 2 μ i j i ω b i j c i j i ω 0 t k i j τ e i ω τ d τ e i ω t according to the frequency domain potential flow theory the radiation force can be written as the sum of added mass force and wave damping force in frequency domain such as 22 f i r t ω 2 a i j ω i ω b i j ω e i ω t compared with the time domain and frequency domain expression of the radiation wave load the added mass and wave damping can be written as 23 a i j ω μ i j 1 ω 0 t k i j τ sin ω τ d τ c i j ω 2 24 b i j ω b i j 0 t k i j τ cos ω τ d τ 4 2 wave exciting load and ship motion equation be similar with the radiation wave load the bernoulli equation and near field pressure integral method is also used to calculate the wave exciting load which can be written as 25 f i i d t ρ s h t w ϕ i ϕ 7 n i d s assuming the incident wave elevation ζ t e i ω t and apply the fournier transformation the incident and diffraction potential in regular seas can be represented as 26 ϕ i ζ τ ϕ

seas then ζ 0 ω 0 δ ω 0 which determine the value of ζ j τ in each integral domain based on eq 16 finally substitute these expressions into eq 25 the wave exciting load can be written as eq 28 based on the impulse incident and diffraction potential 28 f i i d t ρ ζ τ d τ s h t w ϕ i δ t ϕ 7 δ t n i d s once the added mass wave damping and exciting load have been predicted the ship motion equation can be solved in this paper the 4th order runge kutta method is utilized to update the ship motion velocity and displacement at each new time step 29 m i j μ i j η j t b i j η j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ c i j c i j η j t f i i d t i j 1 6 where m i j and c i j mean the mass matrix and restoring force matrix of ships respectively the viscous damping coefficients are calculated by ikeda formula which could refer to ikeda 2004 5 the implementation of far field boundary condition it is assumed the radiation and diffraction wave satisfy the linearized free surface condition with uniform incoming flow the flow domain is divided into the inner and outer domain by the imaginary control surface sc as shown in fig 1 in inner domain it is bounded by the wetted body surface the free surface inside and the control surface for these bvps the simple rankine source is chosen as the green function by a mixed distribution of sources and dipoles the boundary integral equation takes the form of 30 2 π φ p t s h s f s c φ q t n q 1 r p q φ q t n q 1 r p q d s q where r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 x y z and ξ η ζ are the coordinate of the field point p and source point q respectively the ship body surface sh inner free surface sh and control surface sc are discretized into nb nf and nc elements hence the discretization scheme of boundary integral equation 30 can be written as 31 d h h d h f d h c d f h d f f d f c d c h d c f d c c φ h φ f φ c s h h s h f s h c s f h s f f s f c s c h s c f s c c φ n h φ n f φ n c where d q n q 1 r p q d s q s q 1 r p q d s q the diagonal terms of d are 2 π the subscript h f means the field point p and source point q locate on the body surface sh and inner free surface sf respectively when the corresponding influence coefficient is computed the outer domain is bounded by the imaginary control surface the free surface outside the virtual control surface and the boundary surface at infinity for the bvp 4 and 5 rankine source is also employed in the outer domain 32 g g 0 1 r 1 r where r represents the distance between the field point and image point of the source point about plane xoy the boundary integral equation of the outer domain is as follows 33 2 π φ p t s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q for the memory term of impulse radiation potential and impulse diffraction potential the transient green function is employed as follows 34 g g 0 g p q t τ 1 r 1 r 2 0 g k e k z ζ j 0 k r sin g k t τ d k where j 0 is the first kind bessel function r is the horizontal distance between the field and source point the transient green s function satisfies the linearized free surface condition and far field radiation condition it is only necessary to distribute the sources and dipoles on the imaginary control surface the boundary integral equation of outer domain is as follows 35 2 π φ p t s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q s c φ q t n q 1 r 1 r d s q 0 t d τ s c g φ n q φ g n q d s q 1 g w l u 2 g φ ξ φ g ξ u g φ τ φ g τ d η the discretization scheme of boundary integral equation 35 can also be written as 36 d c c φ c s c c φ n c m where d q n q 1 r 1 r d s q s q 1 r 1 r d s q the diagonal terms of d are 2 π m means the integral contribution of the memory term in eq 36 hence the relation between the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the control surface can be shown as follows 37 φ c d c c 1 s c c φ n c d c c 1 m according to the integral scheme of free surface condition and eq 37 the unknowns on the inner free surface and control surface are the normal derivatives of potentials so eq 31 can be written as 38 d h h d h f d h c s f h s f f s f c s c h s c f s c c φ h φ n f φ n c s h h s h f s h c d f h d f f d f c d c h d c f d c c φ n h φ f φ c matching condition is enforced by the continuity of velocity potential and normal velocity on the control surface hence φ c in eq 38 can be substituted by eq 37 39 d h h d h f d h c d c c d c c 1 s c c s f h s f f s f c d c c d c c 1 s c c s c h s c

normal derivatives and the boundary integral equation of inner fluid domain can be solved by the matching method for the impulse potential ψ 1 j ψ 2 j the final boundary integral equations are similar only the memory term m 0 6 taylor expansion boundary element method in the formulation of the boundary value problem of radiation and diffraction impulse potential the first and second order derivatives of the basic flow potential and impulse potential are involved which would affect the accuracy of the solutions while it brings great numerical challenge to estimate accurately and robustly these potential first second order derivatives on the non smooth boundary like the waterline locations consequently three dimensional 3d taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is applied to solve eq 30 here numerical implementation of tebem method is illustrated in this section the tebem method proposed in this paper is based on the framework of the source and dipole mixed distribution method for three dimensional hydrodynamic problems the boundary surface is dispersed into small quadrilateral or triangular elements and the average values of the nodes are taken as the center in each panel hence the discretization scheme of boundary integral equation 30 can be written as 40 2 π φ p t i 1 n δ s φ q t n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n δ s φ q t n q 1 r p q d s q where n means the total element number on the body surface free surface and matching surface and n nb nf nc the corresponding dipole strength at the centroid of each panel is expressed as φ q 0 it is apparently different with the constant panel method the diploe strength on each panel in tebem can be expressed through the taylor expansion and reserve the first order derivatives which presented as eq 41 ξ and η are the local coordinates of the source point in an element q as shown in fig 2 41 φ q φ q 0 φ ξ q 0 ξ φ η q 0 η substitute eq 41 into the discretization boundary integral equation 40 the new boundary integral equation for tebem method can be obtained such as 42 2 π φ p t i 1 n φ q 0 t δ s n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t ξ δ s ξ n q 1 r p q d s q i 1 n φ q 0 t η δ s η n q 1 r p q d s q i 1

through eqs 42 45 and 46 where the dipole strength and its first order derivatives are the unknowns and the source strength is the known the integral principal values are obtained analytically such as the tangential first order derivatives of the dipole strength normalized to positive negative 1 2 all the influence coefficients involved in the tebem method can be referred to duan et al 2015a 2015b for the second order derivatives the auxiliary functions ψ φ x and ψ φ y are introduced in turn the boundary integral equation of auxiliary functions are constructed by green s third formula and solved by tebem method again consequently the second derivatives are obtained correctly 7 numerical results and discussions in this chapter the mathematical wigley ship s60 cb 0 7 ship one afra oil tanker and the modified kvlcc2 ship are chosen to validate the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper for predicting the 6 dof ship motion in various wave headings the main dimensions of these ships are shown in table 1 as follows the expression of wigley ship can be written as eq 47 47 η 1 ζ 2 1 ξ 2 1 0 2 ξ 2 ζ 2 1 ζ 8 1 ξ 2 4 ξ x l 2 η y b 2 ζ z d 7 1 the influence of the control surface as shown in section 5 the imaginal control surface divides the fluid domain into the inner domain and outer domain and the matching method is used to construct the boundary integral equation db and nk scheme of the free surface condition is applied in the inner and outer fluid domain respectively hence the inconsistency of the free surface condition in the inner and outer fluid domain should be discussed compared with the slender ship db scheme free surface boundary condition is more important so we choose the modified kvlcc2 ship to discuss the influence of the control surface which cb 0 84 and belong to the blunt ship fig 3 shows the absolute value of the induce velocity by the steady velocity potential φ of the modified kvlcc2 ship with forward speed u 4 112 m s the inner domain free surface area is 2l 1 73l where l means the ship length it can be found that the induced velocity by the steady velocity potential locates at the stern and bow part of the modified kvlcc2 ship and disappear rapidly away from the ship the values of the induced velocity at the element center near the control surface are mostly equal to 0 005 m s compared to the uniform coming flow u 4 112 m s the induced velocity values can be neglected at the element center near the control surface hence this inconsistency of the free surface condition in the inner and outer domain can be neglected when the free surface area is 2l 1 73l in the inner fluid domain consequently this paper would set the location of the control surface following this empirical parameter for other ship cases 7 2 convergence verification of impulse response function here the convergence verification is investigated based on the wigley ship model from several aspects such as the ship hull surface free surface matching surface element number and time step scale the numerical results of time delayed function based on the radiation impulse potential and time history of wave force due to the diffraction impulse potential are discussed in this section the sketch of element discretization on the fluid boundary is shown as fig 4 firstly the convergence of ship hull surface is developed four models are used which are nb1 nb 180 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nb2 nb 360 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nb3 nb 721 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 and nb4 nb 1440 nf 1298 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 respectively where the nb nf and nc mean the panel number of half of the ship hull surface the free surface and matching surface respectively fig 5 shows the numerical results of the time retardation function k33 which is produced by the memory term of radiation impulse potential in heave motion direction except for nb1 a good agreement can be obtained among the rest three models for time retardation function k33 hence the convergence of the body surface element is confirmed time retardation function k55 produced by the radiation impulse potential in pitch motion direction is shown in fig 6 to confirm the convergence of the free surface elements three kinds of free surface models are used which are model nf1 nb 721 nf 945 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nf2 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 and nf3 nb 721 nf 3780 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 it can be found that good convergence can be obtained the convergence of the matching surface element number for the diffraction wave force in heave motion direction is developed which are shown in fig 7 three models are utilized they are the model nc1 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 320 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 nc2 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 640 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 and nc3 nb 721 nf 1890 nc 1292 δ t g l 0 5 0 11 respectively numerical results agree well too many elements would increase the computational burden especial for the matching surface panels because time domain green function and its derivatives in normal direction need to be solved on the matching surface according to the convergence research nc3 model is recommend for the space discretization of fluid domain time step scale is the important parameter for time domain simulation three different time step scales are studied the diffraction wave moment in pitch motion direction is shown in fig 8 a good agreement can be obtained according to the above analysis the convergent results of the radiation and diffraction impulse potential can be obtained for wigley ship 7 3 comparison of hydrodynamic coefficient between db and nk assumption as we know that the hydrodynamic coefficient is the key parameters for the ship motion equation in this section the radiation added mass and damping coefficient are calculated based on the db and nk assumption then comparison is made the between the experimental solution and numerical results similar researches also are developed by zhang et al 2010b figs 9 and 10 show the cross coupling added mass coefficient a35 and a53 for wigley ship in heave and pitch at fn 0 2 based on the db and nk assumption the added mass coefficient a35 and a53 are non dimensional by ρ δ and ρ δ l 2 where δ and l means the displacement and ship length figs 11 and 12 show the cross coupling damping coefficient b35 and b53 for wigley ship in heave and pitch at fn 0 20 the damping coefficient b35 and b53 are nondimensionalized by ρ δ g l and ρ δ l 2 g l kashiwagi 2017 performed the experimental study for this ship and provides the benchmark physical data it can be found the result of db assumption agree better with the experimental solutions compared with the results of nk assumption figs 13 and 14 show the diagonal added mass coefficient a33 and a55 in heave and pitch at fn 0 2 figs 15 and 16 show the diagonal damping coefficient b33 and b55 in heave and pitch at fn 0 2 be similar the result of db assumption agrees well with experimental solutions it can be concluded that db assumption provide more accurate hydrodynamic coefficient of ships as the accuracy even for the slender ship 7 4 comparison of ship motions between db and nk assumption for the assessment of ship seakeeping performance the rao of ship motion displacement is the importance parameter here wigley s60 afra and modified kvlcc2 ship are chosen as the target ships for the motion rao computation comparison between the numerical result and experimental solution are performed to validate the accuracy of tebem method proposed in this paper figs 17 and 18 show the raos of heave and pitch motion for wigley ship at fn 0 2 at head wave headings 1800 rao of heave and pitch motion are nondimensionalized by ζ a and k ζ a where ζ a and k represent the wave amplitude and wave number of the incident wave compared with the experimental data the accuracy of db scheme is better especially for the resonance frequency range kashiwagi 2017 applied the eut method to predict the ship motion for wigley ship from the results it can be seen that the results of tebem method provide the better prediction at the resonance frequency range figs 19 and 20 show the raos of heave and pitch motion for s60 ship at fn 0 2 at heading regular seas it is found the ship motion displacement result based on db assumption agree well with the experimental data it is confirmed again that numerical simulation of hydrodynamic problem of ships with forward speed should be based on the db assumption even for the slender ship 7 5 the numerical validation of ship motion responses for modern commercial type ships in various wave headings finally the rao of ship advancing in the oblique wave is predicted by tebem method proposed in this paper an afra type oil tanker ship is calculated and the rao of heave roll and pitch motion at fn 0 127 are shown from figs 21 23 respectively wave heading is 1 35 china ship scientific research center cssrc performed the experimental study for this ship model according to the comparison between the numerical results and experimental solutions good agreement is obtained for the heave and pitch motion while for roll motion the peak of numerical results at the resonance frequency domain is larger compared with the experimental solutions presently the viscous roll damping is modelled by the simplified ikeda empirical formula and the underestimation of the roll damping could be attributed to the over estimation the natural roll peak value the modified kvlcc2 ship is also used to calculate the rao of the 6 dof ship motion at different forward speeds and the numerical results are shown from figs 24 29 respectively the wave heading is at the stern oblique seas 30 yasukawa et al 2019 carried out the physical test study for the modified kvlcc2 ship with different forward speeds f n 0 0 049 0 099 it can be found that tebem method could capture well the motion characteristic at different forward speeds and good agreement can be obtained compared with the experimental solutions 8 conclusions in this paper the matching bem method based on the impulse response function formulation is utilized to solve the seakeeping problem of ships the rankine source and time domain green function are applied to construct the boundary integral equation for radiation and diffraction impulse potential in the inner and outer flow domain respectively which are solved by a novel boundary element method tebem the wigley s60 afra and modified kvlcc2 ship are chosen as the validation ships the hydrodynamic coefficients and heave roll and pitch motions are analyzed some conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the matching method based on the impulse response function formulation could simulate the hydrodynamic problem of ships with forward speed in time domain stably matching surface element number of half domain is around 500 good convergence can be obtained too much panels would increase the computational expense of transient time domain green function 2 through the comparison of hydrodynamic coefficients and motion of ship db assumption should be used for the solving of unsteady potential even for the slender ship good agreement can be obtained for the ship motion based on db assumption compared with experimental data 3 second order derivatives of the steady and unsteady potential are involved in the bvp of the impulse radiation and diffraction potentials it can be concluded that tebem method could solve these values accurately 4 numerical solutions show that tebem method proposed in the paper could predict accurately the hydrodynamic coefficients and the 6 dof ship motion in full wave headings declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

20896,the use of plate anchors on permanent offshore facilities with taut or semi taut moorings requires a thorough understanding of their long term capacity under sustained loading in this paper a programme of centrifuge tests and numerical simulations is reported to investigate the capacity of a plate anchor deeply embedded in normally consolidated clay during and after vertical sustained loading experimental data show that a sustained load higher than 85 of the ultimate monotonic anchor capacity leads to anchor failure characterised by acceleration of anchor movement with a large accumulation of vertical displacements towards the soil surface at sustained loads lower than 85 of the monotonic anchor capacity the undrained anchor capacity increases due to consolidation and hence strengthening of the soil mobilised by the anchor the maximum increase in capacity relative to the monotonic capacity is 23 when the sustained load is approximately half the monotonic anchor capacity a gap filling technique was proposed and incorporated into large deformation finite element analyses which are shown to reproduce the experimental observations well keywords plate anchor consolidation centrifuge test finite element methods sustained loading capacity 1 introduction plate anchors are an efficient and cost effective anchoring system to maintain offshore floating structures on station a popular application is the suction embedded plate anchor sepla wilde et al 2001 which has been used for temporary facilities and is being considered for use on permanent facilities wong et al 2012 the short term monotonic capacity of plate anchors has been studied extensively using both experimental and numerical methods e g rowe 1978 das and singh 1994 gaudin et al 2006 wang et al 2010 tho et al 2013 liu et al 2018 whereas few studies have considered the influence of sustained loading arising from long term operational and environmental loads associated with the use of taut or semi taut moorings wong et al 2012 reported six centrifuge tests in normally consolidated west african clay that showed that plate anchors embedded at about 4 4b with b being the anchor breadth could indefinitely sustain loads up to 85 of the monotonic ultimate capacity under these conditions of prolonged sustained loading the soil mobilised by the anchor will undergo consolidation that results in an increase in strength after consolidation wong et al 2012 measured capacity increases of 55 and 90 for a sustained loading equal to 60 and 74 of the initial monotonic capacity respectively however this investigation was limited to sustained load levels in the range 60 85 of the monotonic capacity and the experimental arrangement prevented direct measurement of the anchor displacement additional centrifuge data from tests on a circular plate anchor in a reconstituted normally consolidated carbonate silt zhou et al 2019 showed that sustained loading at 50 of the anchor s monotonic capacity led to displacements of 0 1 times the anchor diameter with a subsequent 50 increase in the monotonic capacity experimental data presented by han et al 2016 demonstrated that sustained vertical loading applied to a horizontal anchor can be maintained indefinitely if upon the application of the sustained load the anchor displacement and associated loss of embedment does not exceed 40 of that associated with monotonic failure which corresponds to a sustained load that is about 88 of the monotonic capacity however the tests in han et al 2016 were conducted adjacent to a perspex viewing window which despite enabling a visual assessment of the behaviour during sustained loading induced a varying amount of unquantified friction at the interface between the anchor and the window the threshold loading ratio of 88 reported in han et al 2016 was arrived at on the basis of complementary numerical analyses which requires validation to overcome the above limitations and to quantify anchor performance under sustained uplift this paper reports results from a combined experimental and numerical modelling study that establishes the threshold level of sustained load relative to the anchor s monotonic capacity that can be applied safely the experimental arrangement enables accurate measurement of anchor resistance in order to validate the analogously postulated threshold from han et al 2016 therefore for a thorough understanding of anchor performance under sustained loading the readers are encouraged to read this paper in conjunction with han et al 2016 the numerical methodology adopted in this paper improves the robustness of the calculation compared to that in han et al 2016 which enables further assessment of anchor behaviour after anchor soil breakaway 2 experimental arrangement and procedures 2 1 testing apparatus the tests were carried out at 100 g in the 3 6 m diameter beam centrifuge at the national geotechnical centrifuge facility in the university of western australia randolph and gaudin 2017 four identical plate anchor models see fig 1 were fabricated from stainless steel to have a length l 60 mm a breadth b 30 mm i e the geometrical aspect ratio l b 2 and a thickness t 5 mm i e l 6 m b 3 m and t 0 5 m in the equivalent prototype scale the anchor models were loaded using an electrical actuator located on top of the sample container strongbox as show in fig 1 the actuator was controlled to position a hook at the end of a shaft on the vertical axis of the actuator over an anchor cap at the end of a 5 mm diameter steel rod that extended from the centre of the plate to above the sample the plan area of the steel rod is negligible compared with the plan area of the plate 1 1 such that it does not affect the mechanism generated by the anchor during vertical loading the vertical resistance was measured by a load cell located on the vertical axis of the actuator and the vertical displacement was measured by the optical encoder on the actuator motor 2 2 clay sample preparation a normally consolidated clay sample was prepared by mixing kaolin clay powder with water under vacuum at 120 moisture content the slurry was poured into the strongbox for self weight consolidation at 100 g for 4 days additional slurry was added to the sample surface after the initial 24 h to ensure a final sample height of 230 mm two way drainage was allowed during consolidation and approximately 40 mm of free water maintained above the sample surface to ensure sample saturation over the course of the testing the sample strength was assessed by t bar tests conducted in flight before and or after each anchor test at a constant penetration rate of v 1 mm s which corresponds to a dimensionless velocity v vd cv in the range of 44 158 where the coefficient of consolidation cv 1 3 6 m2 yr over the t bar penetration range and d is the t bar diameter 5 mm to ensure that the response is primarily undrained house et al 2001 the undrained shear strength su of the sample was determined from the penetration resistance using a t bar factor of 10 5 martin and randolph 2006 randolph et al 1991 the profile of su with depth is shown in fig 2 and is approximately linear with an approximately zero mudline strength and an undrained shear strength gradient with depth in the range k 1 03 1 29 kpa m in prototype scale over the duration of the anchor tests the average effective unit weight γ was 6 8 kn m3 assessed from moisture content measurements from a sample core taken over the entire sample depth after testing the coefficient of vertical consolidation cv of the kaolin clay was derived from rowe cell data reported in richardson et al 2009 which shows cv to be a function of vertical effective stress level varying from 1 4 m2 yr at σ v 20 kpa i e at a sample depth of 1b to around 3 4 m2 yr at σ v 73 kpa i e at a sample depth of 3 6b 2 3 testing procedures and programme after self weight consolidation of the sample the centrifuge was stopped and a longer side of the modular strongbox was removed to expose the clay sample four anchor models were inserted in the clay at pre determined depths in the range zi 3 57b 3 77b in order to minimise sample disturbance during anchor installation the anchors were inserted horizontally from the side of the sample for subsequent vertical loading tests the testing locations see fig 3 were selected carefully to minimise boundary effects and a minimum spacing of at least 4b was provided between adjacent plate anchor test locations the strongbox was then reassembled and the sample reconsolidated at 100 g for a period at least equal to that spent at 1 g typically 1 5 h before conducting the t bar and anchor tests during reconsolidation of the sample the anchor depth was not controlled such that the anchor was free to displace vertically in the sample ensuring that no gap would form between the plate and the soil the post installation and pre testing embedment depths were also cross examined to ensure any marginal anchor settlement due to self weight during reconsolidation at 100g was accounted for the testing programme comprised eight vertical loading tests as listed in table 1 in which the tests are identified according to the type of loading m for monotonic loading and s for sustained loading in the monotonic tests as shown schematically in fig 4 the loading rod and hence the anchor was displaced at a velocity v 0 3 mm s until a peak anchor resistance was observed at which point the loading was stopped the maximum net resistance the measured anchor resistance minus the submerged anchor weight fmax and the corresponding anchor displacement wf were used to establish the anchor capacity factor 1 nc fmax asu where su was inferred from the corresponding t bar test at the anchor embedment depth associated with the peak resistance su k zi wf this capacity factor provided a reference for the subsequent sustained tests the dimensionless anchor velocity v vb cv 83 is sufficient to develop an undrained soil response house et al 2001 in order to examine the uniqueness of the dimensionless load displacement relationship in any given monotonic test and to ensure the reliability of the reference load two monotonic tests ep m1 and ep m2 were conducted in the remaining sustained loading tests the anchor was initially loaded at a velocity v 0 3 mm s until a targeted net force fsus the measured resistance minus the submerged anchor weight was reached determination of fsus as a proportion of the monotonic capacity fmax needs to account for the variation in soil strength at the anchor embedment depth in each test in each sustained loading test the reference fmax was calculated from equation 1 using the value of nc established in the monotonic tests with the exception of test ep s34u fsus was maintained using the output from the load cell as an analogue feedback to the actuator s motion control loop over a period of up to 2 5 h equivalent to 2 9 yr in prototype scale to achieve either essentially full consolidation or failure characterised by accelerating anchor movement consolidation was deemed to be complete when the anchor velocity was at least two orders of magnitude lower than at the beginning of the sustained loading in test ep s34u the influence of the degree of consolidation was investigated by ending the sustained loading stage when the displacement under sustained loading reached 60 of that measured in the full consolidation sustained loading test ep s34 the reduced displacement under sustained loading was assumed to correspond to a degree of consolidation u 60 the subsequent monotonic anchor capacity after sustained loading was quantified in all tests where failure did not occur during sustained loading by loading the anchor in displacement control at the same velocity v 0 3 mm s adopted in the monotonic tests and the monotonic stages of the sustained loading tests 3 experimental results 3 1 monotonic response the evolution of dimensionless net anchor resistance f asu against normalised anchor displacement w b measured in the two monotonic tests is shown in fig 5 where su was taken at the current anchor embedment depth good agreement is evident between the two tests with an anchor capacity factor in the range nc 15 2 15 3 mobilised at a normalised displacement wf b 0 18 0 2 these experimentally determined capacity factors are slightly higher than those established numerically for deeply embedded plate anchors with the same aspect ratio l b 2 and also shown on fig 5 the lower bound nc 11 8 for ultrathin plates in uniform clay merifield et al 2003 nc 13 3 for a plate thickness t 0 05b provided by the three dimensional large deformation finite element ldfe analyses in wang et al 2010 which also suggested nc 14 0 for square plates accounting for frictional resistance along the shaft assuming mobilisation of the initial undrained shear strength would adjust the experimental nc to 14 8 with i the higher plate thickness of the model anchor t b 0 17 relative to the plate thickness in the numerical studies t b 0 05 and ii consolidation induced soil strength increases associated with dissipation of excess pore pressures developed during installation of the anchor also expected to contribute to the higher experimental nc values e g wang and o loughlin 2014 zhou et al 2019 note that frictional resistance along the shaft is included in all reported uplift forces 3 2 behaviour under sustained load the threshold sustained load can be identified from the development of anchor displacement under various levels of sustained loading the normalised consolidation displacement ws wf and the corresponding dimensionless velocity v are presented separately in fig 6 with dimensionless consolidation time t cvts b2 where ts is time measured relative to the start of the sustained loading phase the value of cv was taken as 3 4 m2 yr as appropriate for the vertical effective stress at the initial embedment depth 3 6b the current tests on rectangular plate anchors are compared with the piv tests from han et al 2016 on strip anchors and similar patterns of displacement evolution are observed observations from the current test data in fig 6 lead to the following comments a for a sustained load fsus fmax 0 7 the induced consolidation displacement stabilises i e the anchor velocity was at least two orders of magnitude lower than at the beginning of the sustained loading identified as points a d on the corresponding curves in fig 6 in the range of t 0 1 0 7 with longer durations required at the higher load levels b in contrast when fsus fmax 0 85 anchor displacement increased continuously during consolidation eventually becoming unstable with failure occurring as characterised by accelerating anchor displacements failure initiated approximately at point e in fig 6 corresponding to an embedment in the range z b 3 47 3 49 although this embedment depth remains sufficient to ensure that anchor capacity is not affected by the free surface embedment depth larger than 2b wang et al 2010 it would be useful to confirm these observations at a greater initial anchor embedment depth c therefore the threshold sustained load is established in the range 0 7 0 85 fmax which is consistent with the range 0 8 0 85 fmax from the centrifuge tests on west african clays for l b 1 7 wong et al 2012 and is slightly lower than 0 88fmax as estimated from the ldfe analyses of strip plates han et al 2016 3 3 post consolidation capacity for tests in which the anchor eventually stabilised under sustained loading a subsequent monotonic loading stage was performed at the same velocity v 0 3 mm s used in the reference monotonic tests this allowed the consolidation induced increase in anchor capacity to be quantified the post consolidation peak anchor resistance see fig 4 fcon is expressed in dimensionless form as fcon asu where su is the undrained shear strength at the current anchor embedment depth as defined and utilised earlier for the monotonic anchor capacity eq 1 the normalised load displacement curves including the pre and post consolidation phases are plotted in fig 7 and lead to the following observations a in all tests where anchor failure did not occur during consolidation i e when fsus fmax 0 7 the dimensionless post consolidated anchor capacity fcon asu mobilised at points a d in fig 7 is higher than the anchor capacity factor mobilised at points m1 and m2 in the monotonic tests nc fmax asu the increase in capacity is interpreted as an increase in su with nc remaining constant as shown by numerical analyses reported by stanier and white 2019 the level of su increase due to consolidation may be quantified through fcon ncasu as listed in table 1 where su k zi wpost and hence ncasu represents the equivalent capacity without consolidation at the same depth the maximum value of fcon ncasu is 1 25 observed in test with fsus fmax 0 52 while the lowest value is 1 15 observed in the test with fsus fmax 0 7 b the two tests at fsus fmax 0 34 but with different degrees of consolidation u 60 and 100 resulted in almost identical responses see fig 7 with fcon ncasu differing by a mere 1 see table 1 suggesting that the additional 40 anchor displacement under this low sustained load level had a marginal effect on capacity enhancement c fig 7 also shows that for the tests with 0 52 fsus fmax 0 7 the total displacement wpost corresponding to fcon at points b d is larger than the corresponding wf associated with fmax in tests where a consolidation phase was not included i e at points m1 and m2 this is shown more clearly in fig 8 which presents the total displacement at each loading stage before consolidation after consolidation and at the consolidated peak resistance for the tests with full consolidation evidently wpost increases with fsus fmax by an amount that is controlled by both the anchor displacement that occurs during consolidation and the anchor displacement that is required to mobilise the enhanced anchor capacity for fsus fmax 0 6 the contribution to anchor displacement due to consolidation is in the range 11 45 of that due to capacity mobilisation whereas for fsus fmax 0 6 i e the test at fsus fmax 0 7 the contribution due to consolidation and capacity mobilisation are approximately equal 4 finite element analyses the model tests in the centrifuge were reproduced using coupled pore water effective stress ldfe analyses adopting the modified cam clay constitutive model to improve computational efficiency the rectangular plate anchor used in the centrifuge tests was idealised as a rigid strip anchor with an in plane breadth b and a thickness t 0 17 b whilst this simplification prevents a quantitative comparison between the experimental and numerical results it still allows for an examination of how anchor displacement and velocity vary as fsus fmax increases the anchor was assumed to be smooth and the corners were filleted as semicircles for numerical stability separation at the anchor soil interfaces was allowed and the pore water flowed into the gap beneath the plate base if separation occurred as reported in rowe and davis 1982 and wang et al 2010 the discrepancy in uplift capacities for the smooth and rough plates is less than 10 it remains minimal as the gap under the plate base is formed since the occurrence of the gap depends on evolution of suction normal to the anchor base rather than friction along the base prior to any loading the anchor was wished in place at 3 67 b similar to the embedment depth in the centrifuge tests the horizontal and vertical extents of the soil mesh were 8 b and 11 83 b respectively as trial analyses showed these were sufficiently large to avoid boundary effects drainage was allowed at the top and bottom surfaces of the soil simulating the two way drainage conditions in the centrifuge tests the material properties of the modified cam clay model are listed in table 2 the normally consolidated clay at geostatic state had a coefficient of earth pressure k0 1 sinφ where φ is the effective internal friction angle a detailed description of the ldfe approach can be found in wang et al 2010 2013 wang and bienen 2016 and han et al 2016 the ldfe analyses by han et al 2016 was able to capture how the gap geometry evolved during sustained loading but the simulation had to be terminated when severe mesh distortion occurred after breakaway in one incremental step as a result a sustained load close to the threshold level could not be imposed towards full consolidation this limitation was overcome here by filling the gap between the anchor base and the soil with an analogue material this material had identical parameters to those listed in table 2 and was assigned effective stresses and pore pressures similar to those in the ambient soil at the beginning of the subsequent incremental step if separation occurred and led to a gap width greater than 0 5 b during the current incremental step this technique was used in the simulations with fsus fmax 0 7 and 0 85 in which an apparent gap formed during sustained loading compared with the approach in han et al 2016 this gap filling technique provides similar but more robust solutions as shown in fig 9 and it can be used in similar boundary value problems involving dissipation and potential structure soil separation the anchor capacity factor predicted by the ldfe approach was nc 11 33 for the filleted strip anchor close to the corresponding value of 11 03 in han et al 2016 for an anchor with a plate thickness t 0 22b seven sustained loading simulations see table 1 were carried out with fsus fmax in the range 0 34 0 95 the development of anchor displacement and velocity under various levels of sustained load is shown in fig 10 together with the centrifuge results for a given sustained loading ratio fsus fmax the normalised consolidation displacement ws wf and the dimensionless velocity v predicted by the ldfe analysis is lower than that measured in the centrifuge tests this is possibly due to the geometric simplification of idealising rectangular plates as strips since consolidation is likely to occur more quickly around a rectangular plate with l b 2 than a strip anchor due to the potential for additional drainage around the plate ends hence for a given value of dimensionless time t there will be less consolidation and hence less displacement at a lower velocity for a strip plate anchor than a rectangular plate anchor however and more importantly the numerical analyses capture the same trend of increasing consolidation displacement and anchor velocity with increasing fsus fmax that was observed in the centrifuge tests with anchor displacements becoming unstable at fsus fmax 0 90 slightly higher than the threshold fsus fmax 0 85 in the centrifuge tests according to this trend the threshold level of sustained load can be established numerically when anchor movement starts to accelerate during

seplas is usually in the range of l b 2 3 wilde et al 2001 the threshold loading ratio can be bracketed between 0 7 and 0 9 based on the experimental and numerical studies in han et al 2016 and the present study 5 conclusions this paper has considered the performance of plate anchors with l b 2 and t b 0 17 embedded in normally consolidated clay at depth of about 3 6b under various levels of sustained loading through a combination of centrifuge and numerical modelling the main conclusion that can be drawn from the experimental work is that stable behaviour is to be expected when the sustained load on the plate anchor does not exceed 70 of the monotonic capacity this conclusion is supported by the numerical modelling albeit that the numerical threshold is slightly higher at 85 owing to the two dimensional geometric idealisation when the sustained load is lower than the threshold consolidation leads to increases in soil strength that increases anchor capacity whereas when the sustained load is above the threshold the anchor displacement velocities are high and displace the plate vertically upwards into weaker soil that cannot withstand the applied sustained load the consolidation induced soil strength gains led to corresponding increases in anchor capacity the increases reported here are up to 25 for a single consolidation event but as shown by zhou et al 2019 can be much higher for multiple episodic consolidation events such increases may potentially be relied upon in design provided that the sustained load can be assured e g from offloading or tidal

20896,the use of plate anchors on permanent offshore facilities with taut or semi taut moorings requires a thorough understanding of their long term capacity under sustained loading in this paper a programme of centrifuge tests and numerical simulations is reported to investigate the capacity of a plate anchor deeply embedded in normally consolidated clay during and after vertical sustained loading experimental data show that a sustained load higher than 85 of the ultimate monotonic anchor capacity leads to anchor failure characterised by acceleration of anchor movement with a large accumulation of vertical displacements towards the soil surface at sustained loads lower than 85 of the monotonic anchor capacity the undrained anchor capacity increases due to consolidation and hence strengthening of the soil mobilised by the anchor the maximum increase in capacity relative to the monotonic capacity is 23 when the sustained load is approximately half the monotonic anchor capacity a gap filling technique was proposed and incorporated into large deformation finite element analyses which are shown to reproduce the experimental observations well keywords plate anchor consolidation centrifuge test finite element methods sustained loading capacity 1 introduction plate anchors are an efficient and cost effective anchoring system to maintain offshore floating structures on station a popular application is the suction embedded plate anchor sepla wilde et al 2001 which has been used for temporary facilities and is being considered for use on permanent facilities wong et al 2012 the short term monotonic capacity of plate anchors has been studied extensively using both experimental and numerical methods e g rowe 1978 das and singh 1994 gaudin et al 2006 wang et al 2010 tho et al 2013 liu et al 2018 whereas few studies have considered the influence of sustained loading arising from long term operational and environmental loads associated with the use of taut or semi taut moorings wong et al 2012 reported six centrifuge tests in normally consolidated west african clay that showed that plate anchors embedded at about 4 4b with b being the anchor breadth could indefinitely sustain loads up to 85 of the monotonic ultimate capacity under these conditions of prolonged sustained loading the soil mobilised by the anchor will undergo consolidation that results in an increase in strength after consolidation wong et al 2012 measured capacity increases of 55 and 90 for a sustained loading equal to 60 and 74 of the initial monotonic capacity respectively however this investigation was limited to sustained load levels in the range 60 85 of the monotonic capacity and the experimental arrangement prevented direct measurement of the anchor displacement additional centrifuge data from tests on a circular plate anchor in a reconstituted normally consolidated carbonate silt zhou et al 2019 showed that sustained loading at 50 of the anchor s monotonic capacity led to displacements of 0 1 times the anchor diameter with a subsequent 50 increase in the monotonic capacity experimental data presented by han et al 2016 demonstrated that sustained vertical loading applied to a horizontal anchor can be maintained indefinitely if upon the application of the sustained load the anchor displacement and associated loss of embedment does not exceed 40 of that associated with monotonic failure which corresponds to a sustained load that is about 88 of the monotonic capacity however the tests in han et al 2016 were conducted adjacent to a perspex viewing window which despite enabling a visual assessment of the behaviour during sustained loading induced a varying amount of unquantified friction at the interface between the anchor and the window the threshold loading ratio of 88 reported in han et al 2016 was arrived at on the basis of complementary numerical analyses which requires validation to overcome the above limitations and to quantify anchor performance under sustained uplift this paper reports results from a combined experimental and numerical modelling study that establishes the threshold level of sustained load relative to the anchor s monotonic capacity that can be applied safely the experimental arrangement enables accurate measurement of anchor resistance in order to validate the analogously postulated threshold from han et al 2016 therefore for a thorough understanding of anchor performance under sustained loading the readers are encouraged to read this paper in conjunction with han et al 2016 the numerical methodology adopted in this paper improves the robustness of the calculation compared to that in han et al 2016 which enables further assessment of anchor behaviour after anchor soil breakaway 2 experimental arrangement and procedures 2 1 testing apparatus the tests were carried out at 100 g in the 3 6 m diameter beam centrifuge at the national geotechnical centrifuge facility in the university of western australia randolph and gaudin 2017 four identical plate anchor models see fig 1 were fabricated from stainless steel to have a length l 60 mm a breadth b 30 mm i e the geometrical aspect ratio l b 2 and a thickness t 5 mm i e l 6 m b 3 m and t 0 5 m in the equivalent prototype scale the anchor models were loaded using an electrical actuator located on top of the sample container strongbox as show in fig 1 the actuator was controlled to position a hook at the end of a shaft on the vertical axis of the actuator over an anchor cap at the end of a 5 mm diameter steel rod that extended from the centre of the plate to above the sample the plan area of the steel rod is negligible compared with the plan area of the plate 1 1 such that it does not affect the mechanism generated by the anchor during vertical loading the vertical resistance was measured by a load cell located on the vertical axis of the actuator and the vertical displacement was measured by the optical encoder on the actuator motor 2 2 clay sample preparation a normally consolidated clay sample was prepared by mixing kaolin clay powder with water under vacuum at 120 moisture content the slurry was poured into the strongbox for self weight consolidation at 100 g for 4 days additional slurry was added to the sample surface after the initial 24 h to ensure a final sample height of 230 mm two way drainage was allowed during consolidation and approximately 40 mm of free water maintained above the sample surface to ensure sample saturation over the course of the testing the sample strength was assessed by t bar tests conducted in flight before and or after each anchor test at a constant penetration rate of v 1 mm s which corresponds to a dimensionless velocity v vd cv in the range of 44 158 where the coefficient of consolidation cv 1 3 6 m2 yr over the t bar penetration range and d is the t bar diameter 5 mm to ensure that the response is primarily undrained house et al 2001 the undrained shear strength su of the sample was determined from the penetration resistance using a t bar factor of 10 5 martin and randolph 2006 randolph et al 1991 the profile of su with depth is shown in fig 2 and is approximately linear with an approximately zero mudline strength and an undrained shear strength gradient with depth in the range k 1 03 1 29 kpa m in prototype scale over the duration of the anchor tests the average effective unit weight γ was 6 8 kn m3 assessed from moisture content measurements from a sample core taken over the entire sample depth after testing the coefficient of vertical consolidation cv of the kaolin clay was derived from rowe cell data reported in richardson et al 2009 which shows cv to be a function of vertical effective stress level varying from 1 4 m2 yr at σ v 20 kpa i e at a sample depth of 1b to around 3 4 m2 yr at σ v 73 kpa i e at a sample depth of 3 6b 2 3 testing procedures and programme after self weight consolidation of the sample the centrifuge was stopped and a longer side of the modular strongbox was removed to expose the clay sample four anchor models were inserted in the clay at pre determined depths in the range zi 3 57b 3 77b in order to minimise sample disturbance during anchor installation the anchors were inserted horizontally from the side of the sample for subsequent vertical loading tests the testing locations see fig 3 were selected carefully to minimise boundary effects and a minimum spacing of at least 4b was provided between adjacent plate anchor test locations the strongbox was then reassembled and the sample reconsolidated at 100 g for a period at least equal to that spent at 1 g typically 1 5 h before conducting the t bar and anchor tests during reconsolidation of the sample the anchor depth was not controlled such that the anchor was free to displace vertically in the sample ensuring that no gap would form between the plate and the soil the post installation and pre testing embedment depths were also cross examined to ensure any marginal anchor settlement due to self weight during reconsolidation at 100g was accounted for the testing programme comprised eight vertical loading tests as listed in table 1 in which the tests are identified according to the type of loading m for monotonic loading and s for sustained loading in the monotonic tests as shown schematically in fig 4 the loading rod and hence the anchor was displaced at a velocity v 0 3 mm s until a peak anchor resistance was observed at which point the loading was stopped the maximum net resistance the measured anchor resistance minus the submerged anchor weight fmax and the corresponding anchor displacement wf were used to establish the anchor capacity factor 1 nc fmax asu where su was inferred from the corresponding t bar test at the anchor embedment depth associated with the peak resistance su k zi wf this capacity factor provided a reference for the subsequent sustained tests the dimensionless anchor velocity v vb cv 83 is sufficient to develop an undrained soil response house et al 2001 in order to examine the uniqueness of the dimensionless load displacement relationship in any given monotonic test and to ensure the reliability of the reference load two monotonic tests ep m1 and ep m2 were conducted in the remaining sustained loading tests the anchor was initially loaded at a velocity v 0 3 mm s until a targeted net force fsus the measured resistance minus the submerged anchor weight was reached determination of fsus as a proportion of the monotonic capacity fmax needs to account for the variation in soil strength at the anchor embedment depth in each test in each sustained loading test the reference fmax was calculated from equation 1 using the value of nc established in the monotonic tests with the exception of test ep s34u fsus was maintained using the output from the load cell as an analogue feedback to the actuator s motion control loop over a period of up to 2 5 h equivalent to 2 9 yr in prototype scale to achieve either essentially full consolidation or failure characterised by accelerating anchor movement consolidation was deemed to be complete when the anchor velocity was at least two orders of magnitude lower than at the beginning of the sustained loading in test ep s34u the influence of the degree of consolidation was investigated by ending the sustained loading stage when the displacement under sustained loading reached 60 of that measured in the full consolidation sustained loading test ep s34 the reduced displacement under sustained loading was assumed to correspond to a degree of consolidation u 60 the subsequent monotonic anchor capacity after sustained loading was quantified in all tests where failure did not occur during sustained loading by loading the anchor in displacement control at the same velocity v 0 3 mm s adopted in the monotonic tests and the monotonic stages of the sustained loading tests 3 experimental results 3 1 monotonic response the evolution of dimensionless net anchor resistance f asu against normalised anchor displacement w b measured in the two monotonic tests is shown in fig 5 where su was taken at the current anchor embedment depth good agreement is evident between the two tests with an anchor capacity factor in the range nc 15 2 15 3 mobilised at a normalised displacement wf b 0 18 0 2 these experimentally determined capacity factors are slightly higher than those established numerically for deeply embedded plate anchors with the same aspect ratio l b 2 and also shown on fig 5 the lower bound nc 11 8 for ultrathin plates in uniform clay merifield et al 2003 nc 13 3 for a plate thickness t 0 05b provided by the three dimensional large deformation finite element ldfe analyses in wang et al 2010 which also suggested nc 14 0 for square plates accounting for frictional resistance along the shaft assuming mobilisation of the initial undrained shear strength would adjust the experimental nc to 14 8 with i the higher plate thickness of the model anchor t b 0 17 relative to the plate thickness in the numerical studies t b 0 05 and ii consolidation induced soil strength increases associated with dissipation of excess pore pressures developed during installation of the anchor also expected to contribute to the higher experimental nc values e g wang and o loughlin 2014 zhou et al 2019 note that frictional resistance along the shaft is included in all reported uplift forces 3 2 behaviour under sustained load the threshold sustained load can be identified from the development of anchor displacement under various levels of sustained loading the normalised consolidation displacement ws wf and the corresponding dimensionless velocity v are presented separately in fig 6 with dimensionless consolidation time t cvts b2 where ts is time measured relative to the start of the sustained loading phase the value of cv was taken as 3 4 m2 yr as appropriate for the vertical effective stress at the initial embedment depth 3 6b the current tests on rectangular plate anchors are compared with the piv tests from han et al 2016 on strip anchors and similar patterns of displacement evolution are observed observations from the current test data in fig 6 lead to the following comments a for a sustained load fsus fmax 0 7 the induced consolidation displacement stabilises i e the anchor velocity was at least two orders of magnitude lower than at the beginning of the sustained loading identified as points a d on the corresponding curves in fig 6 in the range of t 0 1 0 7 with longer durations required at the higher load levels b in contrast when fsus fmax 0 85 anchor displacement increased continuously during consolidation eventually becoming unstable with failure occurring as characterised by accelerating anchor displacements failure initiated approximately at point e in fig 6 corresponding to an embedment in the range z b 3 47 3 49 although this embedment depth remains sufficient to ensure that anchor capacity is not affected by the free surface embedment depth larger than 2b wang et al 2010 it would be useful to confirm these observations at a greater initial anchor embedment depth c therefore the threshold sustained load is established in the range 0 7 0 85 fmax which is consistent with the range 0 8 0 85 fmax from the centrifuge tests on west african clays for l b 1 7 wong et al 2012 and is slightly lower than 0 88fmax as estimated from the ldfe analyses of strip plates han et al 2016 3 3 post consolidation capacity for tests in which the anchor eventually stabilised under sustained loading a subsequent monotonic loading stage was performed at the same velocity v 0 3 mm s used in the reference monotonic tests this allowed the consolidation induced increase in anchor capacity to be quantified the post consolidation peak anchor resistance see fig 4 fcon is expressed in dimensionless form as fcon asu where su is the undrained shear strength at the current anchor embedment depth as defined and utilised earlier for the monotonic anchor capacity eq 1 the normalised load displacement curves including the pre and post consolidation phases are plotted in fig 7 and lead to the following observations a in all tests where anchor failure did not occur during consolidation i e when fsus fmax 0 7 the dimensionless post consolidated anchor capacity fcon asu mobilised at points a d in fig 7 is higher than the anchor capacity factor mobilised at points m1 and m2 in the monotonic tests nc fmax asu the increase in capacity is interpreted as an increase in su with nc remaining constant as shown by numerical analyses reported by stanier and white 2019 the level of su increase due to consolidation may be quantified through fcon ncasu as listed in table 1 where su k zi wpost and hence ncasu represents the equivalent capacity without consolidation at the same depth the maximum value of fcon ncasu is 1 25 observed in test with fsus fmax 0 52 while the lowest value is 1 15 observed in the test with fsus fmax 0 7 b the two tests at fsus fmax 0 34 but with different degrees of consolidation u 60 and 100 resulted in almost identical responses see fig 7 with fcon ncasu differing by a mere 1 see table 1 suggesting that the additional 40 anchor displacement under this low sustained load level had a marginal effect on capacity enhancement c fig 7 also shows that for the tests with 0 52 fsus fmax 0 7 the total displacement wpost corresponding to fcon at points b d is larger than the corresponding wf associated with fmax in tests where a consolidation phase was not included i e at points m1 and m2 this is shown more clearly in fig 8 which presents the total displacement at each loading stage before consolidation after consolidation and at the consolidated peak resistance for the tests with full consolidation evidently wpost increases with fsus fmax by an amount that is controlled by both the anchor displacement that occurs during consolidation and the anchor displacement that is required to mobilise the enhanced anchor capacity for fsus fmax 0 6 the contribution to anchor displacement due to consolidation is in the range 11 45 of that due to capacity mobilisation whereas for fsus fmax 0 6 i e the test at fsus fmax 0 7 the contribution due to consolidation and capacity mobilisation are approximately equal 4 finite element analyses the model tests in the centrifuge were reproduced using coupled pore water effective stress ldfe analyses adopting the modified cam clay constitutive model to improve computational efficiency the rectangular plate anchor used in the centrifuge tests was idealised as a rigid strip anchor with an in plane breadth b and a thickness t 0 17 b whilst this simplification prevents a quantitative comparison between the experimental and numerical results it still allows for an examination of how anchor displacement and velocity vary as fsus fmax increases the anchor was assumed to be smooth and the corners were filleted as semicircles for numerical stability separation at the anchor soil interfaces was allowed and the pore water flowed into the gap beneath the plate base if separation occurred as reported in rowe and davis 1982 and wang et al 2010 the discrepancy in uplift capacities for the smooth and rough plates is less than 10 it remains minimal as the gap under the plate base is formed since the occurrence of the gap depends on evolution of suction normal to the anchor base rather than friction along the base prior to any loading the anchor was wished in place at 3 67 b similar to the embedment depth in the centrifuge tests the horizontal and vertical extents of the soil mesh were 8 b and 11 83 b respectively as trial analyses showed these were sufficiently large to avoid boundary effects drainage was allowed at the top and bottom surfaces of the soil simulating the two way drainage conditions in the centrifuge tests the material properties of the modified cam clay model are listed in table 2 the normally consolidated clay at geostatic state had a coefficient of earth pressure k0 1 sinφ where φ is the effective internal friction angle a detailed description of the ldfe approach can be found in wang et al 2010 2013 wang and bienen 2016 and han et al 2016 the ldfe analyses by han et al 2016 was able to capture how the gap geometry evolved during sustained loading but the simulation had to be terminated when severe mesh distortion occurred after breakaway in one incremental step as a result a sustained load close to the threshold level could not be imposed towards full consolidation this limitation was overcome here by filling the gap between the anchor base and the soil with an analogue material this material had identical parameters to those listed in table 2 and was assigned effective stresses and pore pressures similar to those in the ambient soil at the beginning of the subsequent incremental step if separation occurred and led to a gap width greater than 0 5 b during the current incremental step this technique was used in the simulations with fsus fmax 0 7 and 0 85 in which an apparent gap formed during sustained loading compared with the approach in han et al 2016 this gap filling technique provides similar but more robust solutions as shown in fig 9 and it can be used in similar boundary value problems involving dissipation and potential structure soil separation the anchor capacity factor predicted by the ldfe approach was nc 11 33 for the filleted strip anchor close to the corresponding value of 11 03 in han et al 2016 for an anchor with a plate thickness t 0 22b seven sustained loading simulations see table 1 were carried out with fsus fmax in the range 0 34 0 95 the development of anchor displacement and velocity under various levels of sustained load is shown in fig 10 together with the centrifuge results for a given sustained loading ratio fsus fmax the normalised consolidation displacement ws wf and the dimensionless velocity v predicted by the ldfe analysis is lower than that measured in the centrifuge tests this is possibly due to the geometric simplification of idealising rectangular plates as strips since consolidation is likely to occur more quickly around a rectangular plate with l b 2 than a strip anchor due to the potential for additional drainage around the plate ends hence for a given value of dimensionless time t there will be less consolidation and hence less displacement at a lower velocity for a strip plate anchor than a rectangular plate anchor however and more importantly the numerical analyses capture the same trend of increasing consolidation displacement and anchor velocity with increasing fsus fmax that was observed in the centrifuge tests with anchor displacements becoming unstable at fsus fmax 0 90 slightly higher than the threshold fsus fmax 0 85 in the centrifuge tests according to this trend the threshold level of sustained load can be established numerically when anchor movement starts to accelerate during consolidation and thus a transition is observed with fsus fmax between 0 85 and 0 9 which is higher than but close to the range 0 7 0 85 from the centrifuge tests since the aspect ratio of practical seplas is usually in the range of l b 2 3 wilde et al 2001 the threshold loading ratio can be bracketed between 0 7 and 0 9 based on the experimental and numerical studies in han et al 2016 and the present study 5 conclusions this paper has considered the performance of plate anchors with l b 2 and t b 0 17 embedded in normally consolidated clay at depth of about 3 6b under various levels of sustained loading through a combination of centrifuge and numerical modelling the main conclusion that can be drawn from the experimental work is that stable behaviour is to be expected when the sustained load on the plate anchor does not exceed 70 of the monotonic capacity this conclusion is supported by the numerical modelling albeit that the numerical threshold is slightly higher at 85

20897,the marine current turbine mct is becoming more and more popular to produce eco friendly electricity however its performance is negatively affected by mct imbalance fault in this paper an integration fault detection method using stator voltage for mct is proposed this method uses an integration way to detect the imbalance fault the proposed method comprises three steps first the data conversion is based on hilbert transform and the extreme value searching and then the imbalance fault signature extraction based on the frequency sequences subtraction fss last to reduce the data dimension and to set the fault detection limit a data vector selection method based on principal components analysis pca called preliminary selection based pca ps pca is proposed the adaptive fault detection is realized by calculating hotelling t2 and spe squared prediction error finally a marine current prototype experimental platform was built to verify the proposed methods the experimental results show that the method in this paper has high detection accuracy in the fault detection of mct imbalance under the variable flow rate keywords marine current turbine mct fault detection hilbert transform ht frequency sequences subtraction fss preliminary selection based pca ps pca 1 introduction in recent years ocean energy has attracted more and more attention thanks to its renewability and cleanability touimi et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 and marine current turbines mcts have been widely used qin et al 2019a 2019b ren et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 however mcts installed under the sea can easily be worn or corroded because of the marine environment chen et al 2018 touimi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 moreover marine biological growths or marine pollutants attached to the rotating blades will affect the mct by introducing imbalance fault li et al 2016 fig 1 shows two underwater equipment with an imbalance fault flickr com 2020a flickr com 2020b the imbalance fault would influence the operation of the turbine and lead to continuous damages therefore it is highly desirable to detect the imbalance fault of the mct system in early time to prevent the damages of the mct system mcts are always operating under nonstationary conditions zhou et al 2014 xie et al 2020 reviewed different fault detection methods for mct blades in terms of the sensor based and sensorless based methods the specific sensor based methods require additional external equipment which is usually installed in a harsh environment it may be in direct contact with the seawater increasing the installation and maintenance cost begg et al 2018 many methods based on the build in sensor have been proposed to detect the fault under nonstationary conditions the technique proposed in zhao et al 2017 uses the variation mode decomposition vmd to decompose the raw signal and diagnose the shaft faults to detect the imbalance fault many methods have been proposed and can get good detection results authors in jing et al 2017 analyze the electrical characteristics under the blade imbalance fault and use the hilbert transform ht to process the current signal so that the fault signature can be highlighted the methods proposed in zhang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 use the empirical mode decomposition emd to decompose the stator current signal into intrinsic mode functions imfs and extract the imf containing the fault signature to detect the imbalance fault authors in xie et al 2020 propose an imbalance fault detection method named adaptive proportional frequency sampling apfs method to eliminate the interference caused by the fault signature frequency changes in a wide marine current range however it requires a three phase stator current meanwhile when the stator current signal is obtained online it cannot prevent the harmonics generated by the faulty mct from polluting the grid these methods achieve fault detection by searching the fault impulse near the fault signature frequency which is sensitive to the shaft rotation frequency therefore further research is needed to detect the imbalance fault automatically to solve these problems mentioned above we proposed an integration fault detection method for direct drive mcts using voltage signals in this paper in the proposed method the spectrum of the stator voltage is proposed for mct imbalance fault detection the advantage of using the stator voltage is that the blade imbalance fault can be detected when the generator is not connected to the network and it is not loaded this prevents the generator from further damage and reduces the harmonic pollution to the grid the proposed method is composed of three steps data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching and the imbalance fault signature extraction based on the frequency sequences subtraction fss method and a data vector selection method based on pca called preliminary selection based pca ps pca finally an adaptive imbalance fault detection is realized by calculating hotelling t2 and spe squared prediction error statistics the experimental results show that the method in this paper has high detection performance in the fault detection of the imbalance fault of mct blades under variable water flow rate the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the detection problems of mcts are described in section 3 the proposed imbalance fault detection method is described in section 4 simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different fault severity finally the conclusion is given in section 5 2 problem description in this section the fault detection problems of mcts are described mcts always operate in different conditions under variable marine current and complex marine environment kolahan et al 2019 a signal reflects the imbalance fault with a specific shaft rotation frequency 1 p frequency gong and qiao 2012 2015 superimposed on the original normal electric signal this 1 p frequency can be introduced by imbalance fault or hydrodynamic asymmetry the main purpose of the imbalance fault detection is to extract the shaft rotation frequency changes when the tidal current velocity is a constant value the kinetic energy absorbed by the turbine can be described as zhao and li 2017 1 c p ρ a v c 3 2 t m ω m where c p denotes the power coefficient ρ denotes the water density a denotes the cross sectional area of the turbine v c denotes the tidal current velocity t m and ω m are the mechanical torque and speed respectively then the turbine drives the electrical generator considering the generator as a permanent magnet synchronous motor the motion equation can be written as 2 j m d ω m d t t m t e where j m denotes the moment of inertia t e denotes the electromagnetic torque as shown in fig 2 when the imbalance fault happens on the mct the force acting on the blade will become imbalanced bringing an imbalance torque to the shaft this imbalance torque is the effect of an equivalent mass therefore no matter what type of imbalance fault occurs on the mct it can be modeled as an equivalent mass on the blade the imbalance torque of a direct drive mct can be expressed as 3 t im t f c r u sin ω m t where f c is the composite torque of the equivalent mass r u is the distance between the equivalent mass to the center of the shaft the variation of the rotation speed of mct cause by the fault can be expressed as 4 δ ω m f c j m ω m r u cos ω m t the voltage with imbalance is given by 5 u s t u m sin p ω m δ ω m t γ where u m denotes the amplitude of the voltage γ denotes the initial angle p denotes the number of pole pairs therefore the frequency of the voltage can be expressed as 6 f e t p f m t p δ f m t where f m t ω m t 2 π and δ f m t δ ω m t 2 π the healthy condition is obtained when δ f m t 0 if the one turbine turning period is considered as a working period the shaft rotation frequency of one working period in the normal state without any fault can be estimated as the reciprocal of the time spent in this working period 7 f ri 1 t r f m where t r is the cycle time of the working period therefore the voltage frequency of the turbine turning period in normal state can be estimated as 8 f ei p f ri therefore the imbalance fault signature δ f e t p δ f m t in one turbine rotation period can be extracted by calculating the difference between the frequencies of the voltage in the normal and imbalance fault state under the same working condition as 9 δ f e t f e t f ei t therefore the imbalance fault signature can be extracted by calculating the difference between the actual and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequencies with the extracted imbalance fault signature the fault detection can be easily detected because there is little interference in this signal the total energy of the imbalance fault signature can represent the fault conditions of the mct system with the imbalance fault signature s total energy the imbalance fault under different shaft rotation frequency conditions can be detected 3 the integration fault detection method using stator voltage the proposed imbalance fault detection method includes three steps data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching method imbalance fault signature extraction based on the cubic spline interpolation and imbalance fault detection based on wt data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching method is used to transform the voltage signal measured from the mct system into the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei imbalanced fault signature extraction based on the cubic spline interpolation is used to extract the imbalance fault signal δ f e imbalanced fault detection based on ps pca is proposed to process f e in both the time and frequency domain the imbalance fault detection can be achieved by calculating hotelling t2 and spe statistics 3 1 data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching the main objective of this part is to convert the voltage signal acquired from the mct system into both the actual and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequencies when the imbalance fault influences are small the mct system s voltage signal is approximated as a narrow band signal in this condition ht has an excellent performance to estimate the instantaneous frequency therefore the ht method is used to convert the voltage signal to the instantaneous frequency the ht of the voltage signal u s t measured from an mct denoted by y t is defined as 10 y t h u s t 1 π u s t t τ d τ the ht is the convolution of u s t with 1 t the complex conjugate pair formed by u s t and y t is given as 11 z t u s t j y t a t e j φ t in this case the amplitude a t and the phase φ t are given respectively by 12 a t u s 2 t y 2 t 13 φ t arctan y t u s t the actual instantaneous frequency of the voltage signal can be further computed by 14 f e t 1 2 π d φ t d t in one shaft rotation period the ideal state s shaft rotation frequency can be estimated using eq 7 the extreme value searching method is employed for estimating the cycle time of every shaft rotation period the peaks of the original sampling voltage signal u s n in t seconds is calculated to estimate the cycle time where n 1 2 3 n and n is the length of the voltage signal the sampling interval t s t n if a k a 1 a 2 a k are the sampling points which are the peaks of u s n a 0 0 and k is the total number of peaks in u s n there are 15 u s a k 1 0 u s a k 1 0 u s a k u s a k 1 the cycle time of the k th shaft rotation period t r k can be calculated by 16 t r k a k a k 1 p t s therefore f ri of the k th shaft rotation period can be estimated by t r k and in this condition the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei can be calculated using 8 3 2 imbalance fault signature extraction based on frequency sequences subtraction fss this part aims to extract the imbalance fault signature to facilitate the fault detection as mentioned in section 2 the imbalance fault signature δ f e can be extracted by calculating the difference between the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei the length of f e and f ei is lower than that of the raw voltage signal because of the ht and the extreme value searching with f e and f ei the calculated δ f e is quite different from the actual imbalance fault signature an imbalance fault extraction method based on the cubic spline interpolation is proposed to accurately estimate the imbalance fault signature the cubic spline interpolation interpolates the obtained data to a consistent number of points to facilitate subtraction finally the frequency difference is projected into the frequency domain to observe whether the fault occurs fig 3 shows the interpolation effects of spline interpolation nearest interpolation and cubic spline interpolation with the simulated signal it can be found that the errors of cubic spline interpolation and the original signal are smaller than the other methods therefore the cubic spline interpolation method is employed in our proposed method to minimize the estimation error according to the length n of the original sampling voltage signal u s n the sampling interval t s the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei a new n point equal interval sequence f ei n are reconstructed by cubic spline interpolation then the frequency difference is calculated by the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the interpolated instantaneous voltage frequency f ei n as follows 17 δ f e t f e t f ei t 3 3 ps pca based imbalance fault detection method 3 3 1 pre processing frequency difference signal data pre processing and fss method is performed on the instantaneous frequency of the mct stator voltage signal and then the processed voltage frequency difference signal is divided into p segments of samples with a window of length q as shown in fig 4 and then the fast fourier transform fft is performed on each segment as follows 18 x ω δ f e t e j ω t d t in practical applications a fast fourier transform fft is often used to achieve the efficient conversion from the time domain to frequency domain after the above processing the following matrix can be constructed where p is the number of training samples as shown in fig 4 only by taking enough training samples that a pca detection model with a better detection effect is established the samples matrix is as follows 19 x ω p q x 11 x 12 x 1 q x 21 x 22 x 2 q x p 1 x p 2 x p q 3 3 2 preliminary selection based fault features from frequency difference matrix in this step preliminary selection is mainly performed on the frequency domain signal x ω p q to extract the variable that largely represents the characteristics of the imbalance fault and reduces the amount of data to extract the frequency domain information containing the fault characteristics it is only necessary to extract the frequency domain information around the 1 p frequency first the characteristic frequency value of the imbalance fault needs to be estimated the average value of the instantaneous frequency of the stator voltage f e n can be calculated as follows 20 f e 1 n n 1 n f e n the average value of the 1 p frequency in its corresponding state can be estimated as 21 f m f e p therefore we can use f m to estimate the fault characteristic frequency value by extracting the frequency centred f m bandwidth r r is set according to the specific situation it can select the certain characteristics that largely represent imbalance faults and reduce the amount of data the newly constructed feature information matrix x ω p r is as follows 22 x ω p r x 11 x 12 x 1 r x 21 x 22 x 2 r x p 1 x p 2 x p r 3 3 3 control limit calculated for imbalance fault alarm assuming x ω p r is a data matrix of p r p is the number of samples after data pre processing and r is the selected dimension of the data then x can be decomposed as follows 23 x ω p r i 1 b t i w i t e where t and w are the scoring matrix and the loading matrix and b is the main component number and e donates residual space in the perspective of statistical monitoring λ k 1 is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues then hotelling s t2 is commonly defined by 24 t 2 x t w k λ k 1 w k t x t α 2 the spe statistical index measures the change of the projection of the data sample in the residual subspace which is obtained by 25 s p e x t i w k w k t t i w k w k t x δ α 2 where t α 2 and δ α 2 are the upper limit for the t2 statistic and spe statistic respectively if the statistic exceeds their upper limit we assume that the mct blade is biofouling and imbalanced 3 4 the flow chart of the integration fault detection method the proposed method is described in fig 5 it is implemented through the following steps sample the voltage signal sample the measured stator voltage signal with uniformly sampling data conversion the actual instantaneous frequency and the interpolated shaft rotating frequency sequences are converted based on ht extreme value searching and cubic spline interpolation frequency sequences subtraction the frequency difference is calculated by frequency sequences subtraction and then projected into the frequency domain mct imbalance fault detection an off line data is used to build the preliminary selection pca reference model for calculating the control limit in which the on line data is detected 4 simulation and experimental results 4 1 simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mass imbalance fault detection a simulation model is built in matlab simulink and the model is shown in fig 6 which includes the turbine permanent magnet synchronous generators pmsg imbalanced fault generation module and load in order to be close to the actual situation the simulation of wave and turbulence is added to the simulation and the current velocity varies from 1 2 m s to 1 4 m s the sampling frequency is set to 1 khz two scenarios are simulated with different masses for mct blade by 1 2 accounted for the mass of the entire blade fig 7 shows the stimulated stator voltage signal under different fault severities fig 8 a shows the actual instantaneous frequency of stator voltage under different fault severities the variations of the amplitude of the 1 p frequency component can be used as a fault indicator however the actual instantaneous frequency contains strong interference supply frequency or trend component so the fss method is employed to the actual instantaneous frequency and the processed instantaneous frequency is shown in fig 9 a from figs 8 b and fig 9 b it can see that after the fss method the main frequency and some interference are reduced which improves the detection efficiency of the subsequent fault detection algorithm fig 10 shows the frequency spectrum of processed instantaneous frequency with two scenarios it is also noted that the amplitude at 1 p frequency increases with the fault severities 4 2 experimental results a 230 w direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg prototype experimental platform zhang et al 2019 is used the generator has eight pole pairs the experimental platform consists of the following three parts 1 a marine current simulation system 2 a marine turbine the turbine blade radius is 0 3 m 3 a pmsg prototype to simulate the imbalance fault ropes are winded around the blade fig 11 two imbalance scenarios are simulated by winding ropes of 80 g the rotation radius is 0 124 m and 150 g the rotation radius is 0 153 m around the blade respectively with the changes of attachments the experimental parameters are shown in table 1 in the experiment the load resistance is fixed to 100 ω the water velocity is adjusted from 0 8 m s to 1 3 m s to keep the mct working under different shaft rotation frequency conditions three different shaft rotation frequency conditions are set up 1 46 hz 1 71 hz and 1 90 hz fig 11 shows the voltages measured from the experiment under different conditions fig 12 a is the voltage signal under healthy condition fig 12 b is under imbalance fault condition of 80 g attachments and fig 12 c is under imbalance fault condition of 150 g attachments the amplitude of voltage changes continuously due to the influence of turbulence it is difficult to find the differences between these figures the proposed method is applied to detect the imbalance fault the emergence of the high energy near 1 p frequency will increase the probability of failure fig 13 shows the actual instantaneous voltage frequency under different fault severities fig 14 shows the processed instantaneous voltage frequency after the fss method under different fault severities it indicates that the proposed method can eliminate almost all the interference signals the main frequency and some interference are reduced after the fss method which improves the detection efficiency of the subsequent fault detection algorithm fig 15 a and fig 15 b are the spectrum diagrams before and after the frequency sequences subtraction respectively the amplitude of frequency corresponding to fig 15 a is much lower than that of fig 15 b after the fss method the main frequency and some interference are reduced which improves the detection efficiency of the subsequent fault detection algorithm it can be seen from fig 16 that the performance of fault detection under variable flow rate conditions is not satisfactory the false alarm rate is high by using the fswt frequency slice wavelet transform method wang et al 2020 fig 17 shows the method of using stft short time fourier transform method pan 2019 from the perspective of t2 statistics and spe the statistical information of the false alarm rate of t2 becomes low but the false alarm rate is too high for fault detection fig 18 shows the detection results using wavelet denoising based method li et al 2020 the detection requirements are generally met but the false negative rate is still too high fig 19 shows the detection results of the proposed method the results show that although the effect of t2 statistics is better than the previous methods in comparison the results of spe are much better and meet the requirements of fault detection table 2 shows the imbalance fault detection result false negatives rate fnr and false alarm rate far under a 95 control limit with different methods from tab 2 we can see the fault detection results of all the method has a disadvantage against variable water flow condition but the proposed method shows strong robustness and anti interference ability in terms of fault detection rate 5 conclusion to make the imbalance fault detection easier and more effective and solve the problems in the imbalance fault detection under different shaft rotation frequency conditions this paper has proposed an integration imbalance fault detection method based on ht extreme value searching cubic spline interpolation and ps pca for direct drive mcts using voltage signals the proposed method is divided into three steps first the actual instantaneous voltage frequency and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency are converted by ht and extreme value searching then the imbalance fault signature is extracted based on the frequency sequences subtraction fss and a data vector selection method in conjunction with principal components analysis pca called preliminary selection based pca ps pca is then proposed finally an adaptive imbalance fault detection is realized by calculating hotelling t2 and spe statistics the

20897,the marine current turbine mct is becoming more and more popular to produce eco friendly electricity however its performance is negatively affected by mct imbalance fault in this paper an

results show that the method in this paper has high detection accuracy in the fault detection of mct imbalance under the variable flow rate keywords marine current turbine mct fault detection hilbert transform ht frequency sequences subtraction fss preliminary selection based pca ps pca 1 introduction in recent years ocean energy has attracted more and more attention thanks to its renewability and cleanability touimi et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 and marine current turbines mcts have been widely used qin et al 2019a 2019b ren et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 however mcts installed under the sea can easily be worn or corroded because of the marine environment chen et al 2018 touimi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 moreover marine biological growths or marine pollutants attached to the rotating blades will affect the mct by introducing imbalance fault li et al 2016 fig 1 shows two underwater equipment with an imbalance fault flickr com 2020a flickr com 2020b the imbalance fault would influence the operation of the turbine and lead to continuous damages therefore it is highly desirable to detect the imbalance fault of the mct system in early time to prevent the damages of the mct system mcts are always operating under nonstationary conditions zhou et al 2014 xie et al 2020 reviewed different fault detection methods for mct blades in terms of the sensor based and sensorless based methods the specific sensor based methods require additional external equipment which is usually installed in a harsh environment it may be in direct contact with the seawater increasing the installation and maintenance cost begg et al 2018 many methods based on the build in sensor have been proposed to detect the fault under nonstationary conditions the technique proposed in zhao et al 2017 uses the variation mode decomposition vmd to decompose the raw signal and diagnose the shaft faults to detect the imbalance fault many methods have been proposed and can get good detection results authors in jing et al 2017 analyze the electrical characteristics under the blade imbalance fault and use the hilbert transform ht to process the current signal so that the fault signature can be highlighted the methods proposed in zhang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 use the empirical mode decomposition emd to decompose the stator current signal into intrinsic mode functions imfs and extract the imf containing the fault signature to detect the imbalance fault authors in xie et al 2020 propose an imbalance fault detection method named adaptive proportional frequency sampling apfs method to eliminate the interference caused by the fault signature frequency changes in a wide marine current range however it requires a three phase stator current meanwhile when the stator current signal is obtained online it cannot prevent the harmonics generated by the faulty mct from polluting the grid these methods achieve fault detection by searching the fault impulse near the fault signature frequency which is sensitive to the shaft rotation frequency therefore further research is needed to detect the imbalance fault automatically to solve these problems mentioned above we proposed an integration fault detection method for direct drive mcts using voltage signals in this paper in the proposed method the spectrum of the stator voltage is proposed for mct imbalance fault detection the advantage of using the stator voltage is that the blade imbalance fault can be detected when the generator is not connected to the network and it is not loaded this prevents the generator from further damage and reduces the harmonic pollution to the grid the proposed method is composed of three steps data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching and the imbalance fault signature extraction based on the frequency sequences subtraction fss method and a data vector selection method based on pca called preliminary selection based pca ps pca finally an adaptive imbalance fault detection is realized by calculating hotelling t2 and spe squared prediction error statistics the experimental results show that the method in this paper has high detection performance in the fault detection of the imbalance fault of mct blades under variable water flow rate the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the detection problems of mcts are described in section 3 the proposed imbalance fault detection method is described in section 4 simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different fault severity finally the conclusion is given in section 5 2 problem description in this section the fault detection problems of mcts are described mcts always operate in different conditions under variable marine current and complex marine environment kolahan et al 2019 a signal reflects the imbalance fault with a specific shaft rotation frequency 1 p frequency gong and qiao 2012 2015 superimposed on the original normal electric signal this 1 p frequency can be introduced by imbalance fault or hydrodynamic asymmetry the main purpose of the imbalance fault detection is to extract the shaft rotation frequency changes when the tidal current velocity is a constant value the kinetic energy absorbed by the turbine can be described as zhao and li 2017 1 c p ρ a v c 3 2 t m ω m where c p denotes the power coefficient ρ denotes the water density a denotes the cross sectional area of the turbine v c denotes the tidal current velocity t m and ω m are the mechanical torque and speed respectively then the turbine drives the electrical generator considering the generator as a permanent magnet synchronous motor the motion equation can be written as 2 j m d ω m d t t m t e where j m denotes the moment of inertia t e denotes the electromagnetic torque as shown in fig 2 when the imbalance fault happens on the mct the force acting on the blade will become imbalanced bringing an imbalance torque to the shaft this imbalance torque is the effect of an equivalent mass therefore no matter what type of imbalance fault occurs on the mct it can be modeled as an equivalent mass on the blade the imbalance torque of a direct drive mct can be expressed as 3 t im t f c r u sin ω m t where f c is the composite torque of the equivalent mass r u is the distance between the equivalent mass to the center of the shaft the variation of the rotation speed of mct cause by the fault can be expressed as 4 δ ω m f c j m ω m r u cos ω m t the voltage with imbalance is given by 5 u s t u m sin p ω m δ ω m t γ where u m denotes the amplitude of the voltage γ denotes the initial angle p denotes the number of pole pairs therefore the frequency of the voltage can be expressed as 6 f e t p f m t p δ f m t where f m t ω m t 2 π and δ f m t δ ω m t 2 π the healthy condition is obtained when δ f m t 0 if the one turbine turning period is considered as a working period the shaft rotation frequency of one working period in the normal state without any fault can be estimated as the reciprocal of the time spent in this working period 7 f ri 1 t r f m where t r is the cycle time of the working period therefore the voltage frequency of the turbine turning period in normal state can be estimated as 8 f ei p f ri therefore the imbalance fault signature δ f e t p δ f m t in one turbine rotation period can be extracted by calculating the difference between the frequencies of the voltage in the normal and imbalance fault state under the same working condition as 9 δ f e t f e t f ei t therefore the imbalance fault signature can be extracted by calculating the difference between the actual and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequencies with the extracted imbalance fault signature the fault detection can be easily detected because there is little interference in this signal the total energy of the imbalance fault signature can represent the fault conditions of the mct system with the imbalance fault signature s total energy the imbalance fault under different shaft rotation frequency conditions can be detected 3 the integration fault detection method using stator voltage the proposed imbalance fault detection method includes three steps data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching method imbalance fault signature extraction based on the cubic spline interpolation and imbalance fault detection based on wt data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching method is used to transform the voltage signal measured from the mct system into the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei imbalanced fault signature extraction based on the cubic spline interpolation is used to extract the imbalance fault signal δ f e imbalanced fault detection based on ps pca is proposed to process f e in both the time and frequency domain the imbalance fault detection can be achieved by calculating hotelling t2 and spe statistics 3 1 data conversion based on ht and extreme value searching the main objective of this part is to convert the voltage signal acquired from the mct system into both the actual and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequencies when the imbalance fault influences are small the mct system s voltage signal is approximated as a narrow band signal in this condition ht has an excellent performance to estimate the instantaneous frequency therefore the ht method is used to convert the voltage signal to the instantaneous frequency the ht of the voltage signal u s t measured from an mct denoted by y t is defined as 10 y t h u s t 1 π u s t t τ d τ the ht is the convolution of u s t with 1 t the complex conjugate pair formed by u s t and y t is given as 11 z t u s t j y t a t e j φ t in this case the amplitude a t and the phase φ t are given respectively by 12 a t u s 2 t y 2 t 13 φ t arctan y t u s t the actual instantaneous frequency of the voltage signal can be further computed by 14 f e t 1 2 π d φ t d t in one shaft rotation period the ideal state s shaft rotation frequency can be estimated using eq 7 the extreme value searching method is employed for estimating the cycle time of every shaft rotation period the peaks of the original sampling voltage signal u s n in t seconds is calculated to estimate the cycle time where n 1 2 3 n and n is the length of the voltage signal the sampling interval t s t n if a k a 1 a 2 a k are the sampling points which are the peaks of u s n a 0 0 and k is the total number of peaks in u s n there are 15 u s a k 1 0 u s a k 1 0 u s a k u s a k 1 the cycle time of the k th shaft rotation period t r k can be calculated by 16 t r k a k a k 1 p t s therefore f ri of the k th shaft rotation period can be estimated by t r k and in this condition the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei can be calculated using 8 3 2 imbalance fault signature extraction based on frequency sequences subtraction fss this part aims to extract the imbalance fault signature to facilitate the fault detection as mentioned in section 2 the imbalance fault signature δ f e can be extracted by calculating the difference between the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei the length of f e and f ei is lower than that of the raw voltage signal because of the ht and the extreme value searching with f e and f ei the calculated δ f e is quite different from the actual imbalance fault signature an imbalance fault extraction method based on the cubic spline interpolation is proposed to accurately estimate the imbalance fault signature the cubic spline interpolation interpolates the obtained data to a consistent number of points to facilitate subtraction finally the frequency difference is projected into the frequency domain to observe whether the fault occurs fig 3 shows the interpolation effects of spline interpolation nearest interpolation and cubic spline interpolation with the simulated signal it can be found that the errors of cubic spline interpolation and the original signal are smaller than the other methods therefore the cubic spline interpolation method is employed in our proposed method to minimize the estimation error according to the length n of the original sampling voltage signal u s n the sampling interval t s the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the ideal instantaneous voltage frequency f ei a new n point equal interval sequence f ei n are reconstructed by cubic spline interpolation then the frequency difference is calculated by the actual instantaneous voltage frequency f e and the interpolated instantaneous voltage frequency f ei n as follows 17 δ f e t f e t f ei t 3 3 ps pca based imbalance fault detection method 3 3 1 pre processing frequency difference signal data pre processing and fss method is performed on the instantaneous frequency of the mct stator voltage signal and then the processed voltage frequency difference signal is divided into p segments of samples with a window of length q as shown in fig 4 and then the fast fourier transform fft is performed on each segment as follows 18 x ω δ f e t e j ω t d t in practical applications a fast fourier transform fft is often used to achieve the efficient conversion from the time domain to frequency domain after the above processing the following matrix can be constructed where p is the number of training samples as shown in fig 4 only by taking enough training samples that a pca detection model with a better detection effect is established the samples matrix is as follows 19 x ω p q x 11 x 12 x 1 q x 21 x 22 x 2 q x p 1 x p 2 x p q 3 3 2 preliminary selection based fault features from frequency difference matrix in this step preliminary selection is mainly performed on the frequency domain signal x ω p q to extract the variable that largely represents the characteristics of the imbalance fault and reduces the amount of data to extract the frequency domain information containing the fault characteristics it is only necessary to extract the frequency domain information around the 1 p frequency first the characteristic frequency value of the imbalance fault needs to be estimated the average value of the instantaneous frequency of the stator voltage f e n can be calculated as follows 20 f e 1 n n 1 n f e n the average value of the 1 p frequency in its corresponding state can be estimated as 21 f m f e p therefore we can use f m to estimate the fault characteristic frequency value by extracting the frequency centred f m bandwidth r r is set according to the specific situation it can select the certain characteristics that largely represent imbalance faults and reduce the amount of data the newly constructed feature information matrix x ω p r is as follows 22 x ω p r x 11 x 12 x 1 r x 21 x 22 x 2 r x p 1 x p 2 x p r 3 3 3 control limit calculated for imbalance fault alarm assuming x ω p r is a data matrix of p r p is the number of samples after data pre processing and r is the selected dimension of the data then x can be decomposed as follows 23 x ω p r i 1 b t i w i t e where t and w are the scoring matrix and the loading matrix and b is the main component number and e donates residual space in the perspective of statistical monitoring λ k 1 is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues then hotelling s t2 is commonly defined by 24 t 2 x t w k λ k 1 w k t x t α 2 the spe statistical index measures the change of the projection of the data sample in the residual subspace which is obtained by 25 s p e x t i w k w k t t i w k w k t x δ α 2 where t α 2 and δ α 2 are the upper limit for the t2 statistic and spe statistic respectively if the statistic exceeds their upper limit we assume that the mct blade is biofouling and imbalanced 3 4 the flow chart of the integration fault detection method the proposed method is described in fig 5 it is implemented through the following steps sample the voltage signal sample the measured stator voltage signal with uniformly sampling data conversion the actual instantaneous frequency and the interpolated shaft rotating frequency sequences are converted based on ht extreme value searching and cubic spline interpolation frequency sequences subtraction the frequency difference is calculated by frequency sequences subtraction and then projected into the frequency domain mct imbalance fault detection an off line data is used to build the preliminary selection pca reference model for calculating the control limit in which the on line data is detected 4 simulation and experimental results 4 1 simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mass imbalance fault detection a simulation model is built in matlab simulink and the model is shown in fig 6 which includes the turbine permanent magnet synchronous generators pmsg imbalanced fault generation module and load in order to be close to the actual situation the simulation of wave and turbulence is added to the simulation and the current velocity varies from 1 2 m s to 1 4 m s the sampling frequency is set to 1 khz two scenarios are simulated with different masses for mct blade by 1 2 accounted for the mass of the entire blade fig 7 shows the stimulated stator voltage signal under different fault severities fig 8 a shows the actual instantaneous frequency of stator voltage under different fault severities the variations of the amplitude of the 1 p frequency component can be used as a fault indicator however the actual instantaneous frequency contains strong interference supply frequency or trend component so the fss method is employed to the actual instantaneous frequency and the processed instantaneous frequency is shown in fig 9 a from figs 8 b and fig 9 b it can see that after the fss method the main frequency and some interference are reduced which improves the detection efficiency of the subsequent fault detection algorithm fig 10 shows the frequency spectrum of processed instantaneous frequency with two scenarios it is also noted that the amplitude at 1 p frequency increases with the fault severities

experiment under different conditions fig 12 a is the voltage signal under healthy condition fig 12 b is under imbalance fault condition of 80 g attachments and fig 12 c is under imbalance fault condition of 150 g attachments the amplitude of voltage changes continuously due to the influence of turbulence it is difficult to find the differences between these figures the proposed method is applied to detect the imbalance fault the emergence of the high energy near 1 p frequency will increase the probability of failure fig 13 shows the actual instantaneous voltage frequency under different fault severities fig 14 shows the processed instantaneous voltage frequency after the fss method under different fault severities it indicates that the proposed method can eliminate almost all the interference signals the main frequency and some interference are reduced after the fss method which improves the detection efficiency of the subsequent fault detection algorithm fig 15 a and fig 15 b are the spectrum diagrams before and after the frequency sequences subtraction respectively the amplitude of frequency corresponding to fig 15 a is much lower than that of fig 15 b after the fss method the main frequency and some interference are reduced which improves the detection efficiency of the subsequent fault detection algorithm it can be seen from fig 16 that the performance of fault detection under variable flow rate conditions is not satisfactory the false alarm rate is high by using the fswt frequency slice wavelet transform method wang et al 2020 fig 17 shows the method of using stft short time fourier transform method pan 2019 from the perspective of t2 statistics and spe the statistical information of the false alarm rate of t2 becomes low but the false alarm rate is too high for fault detection fig 18 shows the detection results using wavelet denoising based method li et al 2020 the detection requirements are generally met but the false negative rate is still too high fig 19 shows the detection results of the proposed method the results show that although the effect of t2 statistics is better than the previous methods in comparison the results of spe are much better and meet the requirements of fault detection table 2 shows the imbalance fault detection result false negatives rate fnr and false alarm rate far under a 95 control limit with different methods from tab 2 we can see the fault detection results of all the method has a disadvantage against variable water flow condition but the proposed method shows strong robustness and anti interference ability in terms of fault detection rate 5 conclusion to make the imbalance fault detection easier and more effective and solve the problems in the imbalance fault detection under different shaft rotation frequency conditions this paper has proposed an integration imbalance fault detection method based on ht extreme value searching cubic spline interpolation and ps pca for

20898,glacial ice features pose great threats on the safety of ships and offshore structures in the arctic house sized bergy bits or growlers are of particular concern because of the detection capability limits of marine radars analysis and design of structures against collisions from such glacial ice bodies has always been challenging due to the complicated hydrodynamic ice structure interaction this paper proposes a numerical solver for coupled simulation of glacial ice impacts accounting for the effects of hydrodynamic ice structure interaction the solver adopts user subroutines provided in ls dyna and combines three different modules i e the bwh bressan williams hill criterion for the prediction of fracture of steels a hydrostatic pressure dependent plasticity based material model for constitutive modelling of ice and the linear potential flow theory for hydrodynamic loads the proposed solver is verified and calibrated to ice resistance data from field tests and is then applied to simulate ice collisions on a semi submersible platform column collision scenarios with both in plane 3dof and full 6dof ice motions are considered the results are discussed with respect to ice motion trajectories ice crushing and structural damage under the combined action of ice indentation and sliding loads the dissipated energy predicted by external dynamic models is compared with simulation results and discussed keywords glacial ice impacts hydrodynamic ice structure interaction coupled simulation moving loads energy dissipation 1 introduction human activities increase continuously in the arctic regions related to exploration and production of natural resources e g oil and gas and maritime shipping this raises great concern on the safe operation of ships and offshore platforms in ice infested waters potential impacts from glacial ice may cause significant structural damage leading to economic loss environmental polution and in the extreme cases fatalities and progressive collapse of structures it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanics of glacial ice impacts and design crashworthy structures to withstand such actions relatively small glacial ice features house sized are of major concern because they are more difficult to be detected by marine radars and handled by ice management operations especially in extreme sea states fig 1 shows an example ice feature with a waterline of 30 m moving in waves analysis and design of ships and offshore structures against glacial ice impacts is challenging with multiple interaction effects including hydrodynamic loads ice mechanics and structural mechanics each of the three requires significant efforts to analyse rationally the mechanical behavior of ice during impact is very complicated and a mature ice material model that describes comprehensively the behavior is still lacking a few material models are available in the literature for the constitutive modelling of ice gagnon 2011 modelled ice as a crushable foam plasticity material with volumetric hardening overlapping mesh layers were adopted to mimic high pressure and low pressure zones during ice crushing ice spalling was simulated by predefined death time of contact between layers the model was used by gagnon and wang 2012 in numerical simulation of a ship ice collision to estimate damage to the vessel an alternative is to model ice using elastic plastic material models with the yield stress dependent on the hydrostatic pressure examples are fish 1991 derradji aouat 2000 and liu et al 2011 in addition ince et al 2017a proposed a constitutive equation for ice materials associating the failure stress with the effects of strain rate salinity and temperature both ductile and brittle behavior are accounted for according to the level of strain rate ice fracture was modelled using a cohesive zone model to define the crack opening displacement the ice model was used by ince et al 2017b to reproduce a drop test of ice on a deformable plate han et al 2017 studied several constitutive ice models and used them to reproduce an ice crushing test as regards structural mechanics with nonlinear finite element analysis nlfea it is essential to describe material behavior up to fracture and correctly calibrate it into theoretical material models the isotropic power law hardening model with a yield plateau is often used to describe steel behavior in the structural design stage often only nominal material properties are provided the statistical variability of material properties needs to be carefully considered to maintain sufficient margins of structural capacity in addition it is still challenging to accurately predict steel fracture initiation and propagation with coarsely meshed shell elements the complexity lies in the fact that fracture is a very localized phenomenon with a length scale in the range of plate thickness and is difficult to capture with large shell elements that are several times larger than the plate thickness in addition ductile fracture of steel depends highly on stress states loading path and is sensitive to the mesh size adopted yu and amdahl 2018 modelling of fracture is however crucial for capturing ice structure interaction during glacial ice impact because rupture of side panels may completely change relative strengths of the interacting ice and structure quite a few models showed good performance for the prediction of steel fracture modelled with large scale shell elements e g the bwh bressan williams hill criterion by alsos et al 2008 the rtcl rice tracey and cockcroft latham criterion by tørnqvist 2003 etc the models were validated with various small and large scale tests in several benchmark studies and showed reasonable and consistent predictions in general calle et al 2017 ehlers et al 2008 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 for hydrodynamic loads during ice impacts traditional collision analysis often decouples the problem into external dynamics and internal mechanics and the hydrodynamic effects during collisions are often considered simply as constant added masses for the calculation of dissipated energy in external dynamics in the assessment of internal mechanics the striking ice typically moves in a prescribed motion path and hits the structure the decoupled approach uses the crude assumption of constant added masses for hydrodynamic loads and neglects ice motion effects the approach was shown to perform with less accuracy for collisions with long durations or significant structural penetration yu et al 2019c the decoupled method generally works for head on collisions which are often considered as the worst condition this however includes only the indentation type of structural damage recent research by alsos 2008 and quinton 2008 showed that the structure may be more vulnerable to sliding induced moving loads which could cause the same structural damage with almost half of the magnitude compared to that by indentation loads alone an example of the sliding damage is shown in fig 2 where the bulk carrier reduta ordona was hit by an iceberg and the hull structure was severely damaged as ice slid along proper hydrodynamic modelling is essential to understand the evolution of hydrodynamic loads during collision the effect of ice motions and the influence of combined ice indentation and sliding on the structural damage computational fluid dynamic cfd packages are useful tools for the simulation of hydrodynamic loads with high accuracy and significant flow details the effects of viscosity and multi body interactions are well included an example of cfd simulations with application to ice can be found in huang et al 2020 using star ccm to calculate ship resistance operating in level ice cfd simulations on the other hand require significant modelling efforts and computational resources especially when very large fluid domains are involved it is also challenging to couple cfd simulations with ice material modelling and structural responses smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is another potential method to simulate ice structure interactions sph employs nodes rather than finite elements and these nodes may interact through kernel functions which smooth the properties a set distance from the center node sph may be used to model both fluids and solids examples of sph applications are pernas sánchez et al 2012 for the simulation of ice behavior under high speed ice impact and das and ehlers 2015 for simulating crushing and bending failure of ice the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is a widely used approach to model hydrodynamics during collisions as it is readily available in nlfea softwares and can be conveniently coupled with structural analysis in an ale simulation the eulerian mesh is used for modelling the fluid while the lagrangian mesh is used for the structure in each timestep loads and boundaries are transferred between the structure and fluid examples of ale simulations for ship ice collisions and water slamming impacts can be found in song et al 2016 gagnon and wang 2012 rudan et al 2019 and yu et al 2019a the ale method however requires significant efforts for modelling and computation and the results are sensitive to adopted mesh sizes and numerical parameters alternatively the hydrodynamic loads can be modelled based on linear potential flow theory using the mcol routine in ls dyna or the user defined load subroutine in ls dyna mcol is a 3d external dynamics program for ship collision embedded in ls dyna and examples of applications can be found in le sourne et al 2012 and kim et al 2021 through a user defined load subroutine in ls dyna yu et al 2016 and yu and amdahl 2016 implemented a traditional maneuvering model and linear potential flow theory respectively into ls dyna allowing coupled simulations of ship collisions the methods are computationally more efficient compared to ale and cfd simulations and is reasonably accurate this paper presents a numerical solver for coupled simulation of glacial ice impacts accounting for hydrodynamic ice structure interactions the solver adopts user subroutines in ls dyna and combines three different modules i e the bwh criterion proposed by alsos et al 2008 for steel fracture prediction the material model proposed by liu et al 2011 for constitutive modelling of ice and linear potential flow theory for hydrodynamic loads implemented by yu et al 2016 for ship collisions the proposed solver is used to simulate ice impacts on a semi submersible platform as an example application and the results are compared with predictions from external dynamic models the effects of combined indentation and sliding loads on structural damage are studied and discussed in detail 2 a numerical solver for glacial ice impact analysis considering hydrodynamic ice structure interaction the coupled numerical solver is developed by adopting user subroutines in the nlfea software ls dyna where hydrodynamic loads based on linear potential flow theory are implemented with the user defined load subroutine in addition the user defined material subroutine is adopted for constitutive modelling of the ice material and implementation of the bwh fracture criterion for the steel material 2 1 linear potential flow theory for hydrodynamics 2 1 1 hydrodynamic loads using linear potential flow theory in analogy with ship collision analysis yu et al 2016 it is assumed that before glacial ice impact the striking ice body is in force equilibrium where the excitation forces such as current and wave loads are balanced by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ice primarily drag forces departure from this state due to a sudden change in the external forces causes a change in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ice petersen 1982 the governing motion equations are 1 k 1 6 m j k a j k η k 0 t k j k t τ η k τ η k t 0 d τ c j k η k f j t j 1 2 6 where m j k a j k and c j k are components of the generalized mass matrix the added mass matrix at infinite frequency and the restoring matrix of the ice the index j 1 6 represents surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motion of the ice respectively η k t 0 is the velocity component of the striking ice feature in the k th degree of freedom just before impact and f j t is the generalized collision force in the j th degree of freedom 0 t k t τ η τ d τ is the convolution integral connected with free surface memory effects and k j k t is the so called impulse response function connected with directions j and k it provides a radiation load in j direction acting on the ice at the actual time t as a consequence of an impulse speed in k direction experienced by the ice at a previous time instant t τ k j k t is given alternatively by 2 k j k t 2 π 0 b j k ω cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 a j k a j k ω ω sin ω t d ω a j k ω and b j k ω are the frequency dependent added mass and linear wave radiation damping respectively 2 1 2 implementation of the hydrodynamic loads the user defined load subroutine is adopted for the application of hydrodynamic loads calculated from the linear potential flow theory the coupling procedure between structural and hydrodynamic solvers is shown in fig 3 during simulation ls dyna first passes information of nodal displacements and velocities at the ice center of gravity cog to the user subroutine the velocity history of cog is then stored in the user common variables the impulse response functions k j k t in the motion equations shall be prepared externally and read and stored in the subroutine in the first timestep the time increment is typically in the order of 10 6 s in ship or ice collision simulation to maintain efficiency without losing accuracy the velocity histories are stored every 10 3 s one challenge is that nodal accelerations at cog are needed in order to apply added mass related forces but are not provided in the subroutine for rigid bodies nodal accelerations are recommended to be approximated by the slope of linearly fitted curves of the velocity history data more details can be found in yu et al 2019c with the above information hydrodynamic loads are calculated in the user load subroutine and are applied to the cog of the ice ls dyna main solver then calculates structural deformation and ice motions and provides information of ice motions for the next timestep 2 2 an elastic plastic ice material model for practical design of structures against abnormal ice loading we implemented an elastic plastic material model proposed by liu et al 2011 for constitutive modelling of ice the tsai wu elliptic yield criterion given in eq 3 is used where the yield surface is a function of both the second invariant of the deviatoric stress j 2 1 2 s i j s i j and the hydrostatic pressure p σ k k 3 pressure positive in compression to mimic ice confinement 3 f p j 2 j 2 a 0 a 1 p a 2 p 2 0 where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are material coefficients to be specified by users and s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor to simulate ice failure an empirical failure criterion is adopted based on the effective plastic strain ε e q p and the hydrostatic pressure p 4 ε f ε 0 p p 2 γ 2 where p 2 is the larger root of the yield function ε 0 and γ are the parameters to be calibrated to ice crushing experiments or target ice properties the ice material properties used in the simulation are given in table 1 the material coefficients a 0 a 1 and a 2 correspond to an ice uniaxial compressive strength of 9 0 mpa and a uniaxial tensile strength of 0 82 mpa 2 3 the bwh fracture criterion for structural damage when ice structure interactions are accounted for proper modelling of the material behavior is essential because the relative strength of the striking ice body and the structure is sensitive to the selected material strength and fracture parameters the power law hardening with a yield plateau is used to model the material the hardening is described by the yield criterion 5 f σ e q σ f ε e q 0 where σ e q is the von mises equivalent stress the current flow stress σ f is a function of the equivalent plastic strain ε e q via the power law hardening rule 6 σ f ε e q σ 0 i f ε e q ε p l a t e a u k ε 0 e f f ε e q n i f ε e q ε p l a t e a u where k and n are the hardening parameters and σ 0 is the initial yield stress the bwh bressan williams hill instability criterion is used to model fracture of steel in the ice collision simulation the criterion which was proposed by alsos et al 2008 combines hill s local necking model hill 1952 and the shear stress criterion by bressan and williams 1983 it assumes that fracture occurs at the onset of local necking instability neglecting the post necking regime which is conservative it has been validated to be of good accuracy by comparison with various collision experiments marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 the bwh criterion can be expressed in the principle stress space as follows 7 σ 1 2 k 3 1 1 2 β β 2 β 1 2 3 ε ˆ 1 1 β β 2 β 1 n i f 1 β 0 2 k 3 2 3 ε ˆ 1 n 1 β 2 β 2 i f 0 β 1 β is the ratio of the minor and major principal strain rates β ε 2 ε 1 the critical strain ε ˆ 1 can be assumed to be equal to the power law coefficient n in accordance with hill s criterion the bwh fracture criterion is implemented with the user defined material subroutine in ls dyna fracture is enabled by eroding elements when the criterion is fulfilled a through thickness integration point is failed by setting the stresses to zero once the failure criterion is satisfied element erosion occurs once the middle integration point fails 3 verification and calibration of the numerical solver 3 1 description of the global and local ice geometries before any verification can be carried out a careful selection of the global ice geometry and local ice sharpness is necessary it is important to distinguish between local and global geometries of an ice feature the global geometry is decisive with respect to the mass and inertia of the ice body and the demand for energy dissipation while the local geometry is essential with respect to resistance of the ice subjected to deformation crushing extrusion etc at the contact point amdahl 2019 the global geometry of the ice is selected to be a cuboid with the same length and width of 30 m and a height of 10 m as shown in fig 4 this yields a total ice displacement of 8100 tons the selection is based on the finding by lu et al 2019 that the lower limit of the detection capability of marine radars under extreme wave conditions is an ice body with a waterline of about 30 m yu et al 2020 studied the effect of local ice sharpness on the collision response of a stiffened panel in a platform column and found that a critical sharpness exists which maximizes the structural damage for a given energy demand ice with blunter local geometries will deform the structure as if the ice is virtually rigid but with less structural indentation compared to that caused by ice with the critical sharpness ice with sharper local geometries will be crushed substantially we select two different ellipsoidal local ice models as used in yu et al 2020 representing a blunt radius of curvature 2 35 m and a sharp radius of curvature 0 68 m geometry respectively as shown in fig 4 the local ice bodies are modelled with detailed solid meshes and the constitutive ice material as collisions and deformations are assumed to occur only in the local ice region different locations of the local ice relative to the global ice cube will yield different eccentricities of the collision loads with respect to the ice cog two load eccentricities are assumed in case 1 the center of the local ice is placed close to the waterline with a direction vector of 15 m 6 m 3 m relative to the global ice cog see fig 4 including both in plane and out of plane eccentricities case 2 contains only in plane eccentricities where the center of the local ice is given by vector 15 m 6 m 0 m see fig 5 for each load case two local ice models with different sharpness are employed rigid beams are used to connect the center of gravity cog of the ice block as a whole to the rear of the crushable local ice model the beam properties are calibrated to represent correctly the total mass and inertia of the entire ice block with respect to the cog the 6dof hydrodynamic forces and moments are applied as user defined loads at the ice cog the contribution of local ice to the total mass and inertia of the global ice is considered small therefore the ice blocks in both case 1 and case 2 with either sharp or blunt local ice share the same global properties as shown in table 2 3 2 verification of the implementation of hydrodynamic loads in order to verify the implementation of hydrodynamic loads in ls dyna numerical simulations were conducted with the ice configuration in fig 4 as an example case 1 the ice cube with a radius of curvature of 2 35 m blunt is given an initial velocity of 3 m s and impacts a rigid plate refer fig 6 the rigid plate is oriented with a normal vector of 0 9254 0 1632 0 342 such that all 6dof ice motions will be excited contact is considered only for the local ice body the material parameters for the ice model and its calibration can be found in section 3 3 fig 7 shows snapshots of the ice cube motions during and after collisions with the initial ice state at t 0 0 s as the reference configuration the transparent part shows the current ice configuration at different time instants the time histories of collision forces and moments are plotted in fig 8 with respect to the ice cog in the early stage the local ellipsoidal ice is crushed substantially by the rigid plate the ice cube moves initially in the negative heave direction under the action of negative vertical collision forces the out of plane loading eccentricity induces significant pitch motions while large yaw motions are observed due to in plane loading eccentricity in order to verify the implementation of hydrodynamic loads in ls dyna a user code was developed to solve numerically the motion equation in eq 1 the code uses the same information of mass moments of inertial and hydrodynamic coefficients as used in ls dyna the collision forces and moments with reference to the ice cog calculated in ls dyna are used as inputs the euler method with midpoint integration is employed which yields second order accuracy for the position the adopted timestep is 10 3 s and is considered sufficiently small the time displacement curves for the 6dof ice motions calculated using ls dyna and the user code are compared in fig 9 good agreement is obtained in general but with small differences in the amplitudes of the roll and pitch motions however the periods of both motions agree well the implementation of the hydrodynamic loads is thus considered successful the model is shown to be very versatile for simulation of complicated collision scenarios with reasonable accuracy 3 3 verification and calibration of the ice material model the code for the ice material model was used consistently by liu et al 2011 and yu et al 2020 the implementation has been verified in a single element test where nodes on one end of the solid element is fixed against all degrees of freedom and nodes on the opposite plane are forced to move in a displacement controlled manner the resulting evolution of the yield stress with the hydrostatic pressure agrees well with the theoretical curve in als ice collisions the behavior of ice and structures are sensitive to their relative strength it is therefore crucial to calibrate correctly the energy absorption capability of ice in order to obtain a realistic structural response a series of medium scale indentation tests that were conducted in 1984 were employed to calibrate the ice material model the tests kennedy 1990 were conducted using a spherical indenter with a radius of 2 3 m driven by 4 hydraulic actuators each hydraulic actuator had a capacity of 4 mn the indented ice face was located in a lateral tunnel excavated into the side of a grounded iceberg near the settlement of pond inlet on the northern coast of baffin island nwt daley 1994 fig 10 shows a sketch of the test arrangement fig 11 a shows plots of the force displacement curves of 4 different cases from the pond inlet tests with a common indenter radius of 2 3 m the ice force indentation curves exhibit significant scatter which demonstrates the inherent uncertainties of ice mechanical properties and responses an analysis of the experimental data is carried out by averaging the ice energy absorption per unit crushed volume which yields an ice crushing energy density of approximately 3 mj m3 lu et al 2018 this energy density correlates with a pressure area relationship of p 3 2 a 0 1 mpa which is the local ice load for pc3 vessels in the iacs polar class code iacs 2011 pc3 represents the vessel capability in the year round operation in second year sea ice which may include multiyear ice inclusions it differs greatly from the design pressure curve for uls actions for uls design the iso 19906 standard iso 19906 2010 recommends an ice pressure area relationship of p 7 4 a 0 7 mpa w h e n a 10 m 2 p 1 48 mpa w h e n a 10 m 2 for designing structures against local ice loading a comparison of the iacs pc3 curve and the iso curve for the ice pressure is given in fig 11 b the iso curve gives a very large pressure for small contact areas but the pressure decreases rapidly when the contact area increases the local pressure is smaller than the iso pressure area curves for a 4 m 2 and larger for a 4 m 2 the iso curve was derived from a series of indentation tests in the beaufort sea including the pond inlet tests and the values were determined by the mean value plus three times the standard deviation this yields an approximate upper envelope of ice strength the corresponding ice energy density is much larger than the average value from the tests especially when the contact area is small refer fig 11 a in als conditions large deformations are expected either in ice or the structure or both and thus require a more realistic representation of ice energy absorption capability the iacs pc3 pressure area relationship of p 3 2 a 0 1 mpa fits well the average ice energy absorption of the pond inlet experimental data and is adopted for further analysis the ice model employs a strain based fracture criterion in eq 4 which renders the model sensitive to the adopted mesh size furthermore as modelling of the target ellipsoidal shapes with the same mesh size is difficult calibration of the ice failure criterion has to be performed on a case by case basis the two ellipsoidal ice models with different sharpnesses are meshed with solid elements with a size ranging from 35 to 75 mm the two models are calibrated to the target ice design curve of f 3 2 a 0 9 mn in fig 12 by crushing with rigid plates as done in yu et al 2020 the calibrated force curves follow the design ice resistance curve well with small oscillations the calibrated ice failure strain tends to decrease as the ice geometry becomes sharper 3 4 validation of the bwh fracture criterion the code for the bwh bressan williams hill instability criterion was initially proposed and implemented by alsos et al 2008 and has been validated of good accuracy by comparison of various collision experiments in alsos et al 2008 and storheim et al 2015 4 application of the proposed solver to glacial ice impacts on a semi submersible platform column the proposed solver can be used to simulate various glacial ice impact problems considering hydrodynamic ice structure interactions an example is given below for ice collision on a semi submersible platform column 4 1 finite element models of the platform column the column leg of the midgard structure was modelled by tavakoli and amdahl 2010 for the assessment of structural strength against supply vessel collisions the drawings of the platform column are shown in fig 13 the column was modelled from el8125 through el39000 in fig 13 only the front part of one leg was modelled the overall dimension of the fe model shown in fig 14 is 17200 mm 30875 mm x 6100 mm w x h x d the outer shell thickness is in the range of 16 18 mm the vertical stiffeners are equally spaced with a distance of 0 625 m the stiffeners are modelled as l bars with dimensions of 320x50x12x40 mm 300x50x11x50 mm and 240x40x10x30 mm depending on the locations the column decks and the vertical bulkheads are equipped with stiffeners every 0 625 m the thickness of the deck shell plating is 12 mm and 14 mm for the bulkhead plating the column model was meshed using approximately 245 000 shell elements the general element size is 120 mm two steel material grades are used for the structure the material properties and power law parameters are listed in table 3 the column plates have a yield stress of 420 mpa while the column stiffeners are fabricated with a yield stress of 355 mpa the bwh fracture criterion and element erosion are described in section 2 3 4 2 in plane 3dof coupled simulation of ice platform collisions first in plane 3dof case 2 ice collisions on the platform column are studied with the ice configuration given in fig 5 the two calibrated local ice models with an initial curvature radius of 0 68 m and 2 35 m were adopted representing sharp and blunt local ice body respectively the collision scenarios are defined in fig 15 where the ice body hits the panel with an initial surge velocity v 3 m s the mass and inertia of the semi submersible platform are considerably larger than the studied ice such that any motion of the platform is neglected the nodes on the top bottom and rear sides of the platform column are fixed against translations and rotations the eroded single surface contact is used to define the internal contact of the ice model and the eroded surface to surface contact for the contact between ice and the structure using the pinball segment based contact with soft 2 an ice friction coefficient of 0 15 is used the collision angle as defined in fig 15 is θ 60 70 80 and 90 respectively 4 2 1 ice motions and structural damage ice collisions with sharp local ice for ice platform collisions with the sharp local ice fig 16 displays time history of the 3dof planar motions of the ice block during and after collision for different collision angles and fig 17 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the local x o y coordinate as shown in fig 15 the collision angles in the studied cases are quite large however due to the small ice friction μ0 0 15 and the load eccentricity ice blocks can still slide to different extents and detach from the platform in the four cases in general a smaller collision angle yields larger yaw and sway motions for cases with collision angles of 60 and 70 the ice sway motions increase continuously with time this is the typical sliding case as defined in external dynamics an example of the sliding trajectory and structural damage is given in fig 18 for case sharp ice θ 60 where the ice slides smoothly away from the platform for the case with a collision angle of 80 the sway motion increases initially but starts to decrease after a while for the case with a collision angle of 90 the sway motion goes directly to a negative value fig 19 illustrates the negative sway motion and ice trajectories for the case sharp ice θ 90 the reason for negative sway motions is that the deformed structure at the contact region tends to prevent the local ice from further sliding and then the rotation center of the ice shifts from the ice cog to the contact region the ice turns out to rotate anti clockwise about the contact region and thus yields a negative sway this is termed as the motion locking effect and a direct result of this effect is the shift of rotation center from cog to the contact region this effect is also observed in ship collisions e g yu et al 2016 in addition due to the rebound effect the ice still manages to detach from the platform from figs 18 and 19 the local sharp ice gets crushed significantly in both cases due to its relatively weak strength the stiffened panel deforms but no rupture of the outer shell occurs the collision resistance is governed by combined ice crushing and structural deformation the deformation of either side increases the contact area and thus the resistance the ice structure interactions in als conditions are explained in detail in yu et al 2020 when hydrodynamic loads are introduced successfully realistic ice motions during collision enable simulations of the combined ice indentation and sliding damage simultaneously fig 20 presents sectional views of ice crushing and structural damage under combined indentation and sliding action at different time instants for the case sharp ice θ 80 in the first 0 5s the ice collides into the structure virtually straight with little lateral motions during this period both the ice and the structure deform and the ice continuously decelerates in surge and accelerates in sway and yaw from 0 6s the sliding motion becomes evident and the ice moves continuously along the panel over time stiffeners along the sliding path deform slightly without tripping the ice slides away from the platform after 2 5s with little damage imposed on the bulkhead in general the combined indentation and sliding loads tend to extend structural damage to a broader region compared to cases with indentation only however because of the relatively low strength of the sharp local ice the damage extension is moderate in this case ice collisions with blunt local ice for the blunt local ice collision with the platform fig 21 displays time histories of the 3dof planar motions of the ice block during and after collision for different collision angles fig 22 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the local x o y coordinate the ice motion trajectories and structural damage before and after collisions are shown in figs 23 and 24 for two representative cases i e blunt ice θ 60 and blunt ice θ 90 from fig 22 the collision resistance is dominated by damage of the structure and the force curves in the x direction virtually overlap with each other in the first quarter second for the case with a collision angle of 60 ice sliding is dominant but the motion locking effect also exists with a negative sway velocity after 2s due to the presence of the bulkhead as shown in fig 21 the bulkhead represents strong points of the structures and is capable of crushing the blunt ice significantly it tends to prevent the ice from further sliding with a strong negative force in sway but the ice manages to detach from the platform with significant kinetic energy as shown in fig 23 sliding of the blunt ice causes severe damage and fracture of the structure fig 25 shows fracture initiation and propagation as well as contour plots of element stress triaxialities during ice sliding triaxialities in the range of 0 66 indicate significant biaxial stretching once an initial crack occurs stress concentration at the crack tip will cause continuous tearing of the panel for cases with collision angles of 70 80 and 90 the motion locking effect becomes significant the strong ice penetrates into the stiffened panel with large structural damage as shown in fig 24 the ice motion is locked by the deformed structure and the strong bulkhead the contact bodies are not able to separate via ice sliding the rotation center of the ice then shifts from cog to the contact region this yields a large negative sway motion and an anti clockwise yaw motion about the contact region however due to the rebound effect and the yaw motion the striking ice can still detach from the platform in the end fig 26 presents sectional views of ice crushing and structural damage at different time instants for the case blunt ice θ 60 in the initial half second the ice collides into the structure in virtually straight line with little lateral motions but the initial inclination introduces loads in the tangential direction the ice remains virtually undamaged during this period while the stiffened panel deforms significantly with large indentation and tripping of stiffeners from 0 6 s the sliding motion becomes evident and the ice slides continuously along the panel causing large deformation and tripping of stiffeners along its path the ice deformation is small until it hits the bulkhead of the column and starts to be crushed significantly the curves in fig 22 show that the collision resistance drops drastically at about 0 3 s due to outer shell rupture and remains small during sliding because of the large kinetic energy the ice slides away from the platform at about 3 8s with a significant part of the local ice body completely removed by the bulkhead it is interesting to find from fig 26 8 that some removed ice pieces are left in the corner close to the bulkhead the results indicate that with strong ice the combined indentation and sliding loads can cause significant extension of structural damage at a much smaller force level than for lateral indentation this may induce progressive damage of the structure and significant degradation of the residual strength in addition the combined indentation and sliding loads may also speed up propagation of cracks and cause rupture in a wide area 4 2 2 energy dissipation external dynamic models based on rigid body dynamics are often used for rapid prediction of the dissipated energy in a collision figs 27 and 28 compare the dissipated energy calculated from the coupled simulations and that predicted by the external dynamics model by liu and amdahl 2010 for collisions from blunt and sharp ice with different collision angles for the external dynamics model the infinite frequency added masses of the ice body calculated by the boundary element method in the hydrod software are used a restitution factor of 0 0 is adopted to be conservative in the external dynamic models the status of the striking and struck objects after collision can be classified into two categories i e sliding and sticking it is governed by the ratio of the impact impulse μ i t i n relative to the friction coefficient μ 0 where i t and i n are the impact impulses in the tangential and normal directions respectively collisions are categorized as sliding when μ μ 0 and are sticking otherwise because of a small ice friction coefficient of μ 0 0 15 and the load eccentricities the external dynamic model predicts all the above eight cases to be sliding in addition given the same collision angle and friction coefficient the external dynamic models do not distinguish whether the striking ice is sharp or blunt and predicts the same dissipated internal and friction energy from the coupled simulations it is not quite straightforward to tell whether collision for a specific scenario belongs to sliding or sticking and the prediction accuracy differs greatly for cases with sharp and blunt ice for the cases with sharp local ice the model by liu and amdahl 2010 predicts the dissipated energy with reasonably good accuracy in general for collision angles of 60 and 70 with the sharp ice the external dynamic model underestimates the internal energy to some extent this may be due to underestimation of the tangential force by considering only friction but not the sliding forces liu and amdahl 2019 proposed to use an equivalent friction coefficient by adding the columbic friction coefficient and the sliding force indentation load ratio fig 29 plots the ratio of forces in the tangential and normal directions in fig 17 for both the sharp and blunt collision cases from fig 29 a for sharp ice the force ratio starts with the columbic coefficient of 0 15 and decreases in the initial 0 25 s because the deformation is governed by indentation with little sliding and friction forces after that the ratio increases continuously with increasing sliding motions up to a value of about 0 6 at 1 5s by averaging the ratios over time we may adopt an equivalent friction coefficient of 0 3 the results are shown in figs 27 and 28 it seems that the predicted internal energy agrees better with the coupled simulation when μ 0 0 30 theoretically an increase of the friction coefficient will lead to two conditions as follows the ratio of the impact impulse μ remains larger than the new equivalent friction coefficient i e μ μ 0 e q and the collision stays in the sliding regime the internal energy increases continuously with increasing equivalent friction coefficients the ratio of the impact impulse μ becomes smaller than the equivalent friction coefficient i e μ μ 0 e q and the collision shifts to the sticking regime the internal energy increases to a constant value and does not change with further increase of the equivalent friction coefficient for the collision cases with the blunt ice the predicted internal energy shows large differences with the simulation results when only the columbic friction coefficient μ 0 0 15 is used the external dynamic model categorizes the four cases as sliding collisions this does not hold in general for blunt ice collisions due to the motion locking effect with large structural damage and the presence of the strong bulkhead structure even for the case blunt ice 60 where the ice managed to slide away from the platform the discrepancy is still significant from fig 29 b the equivalent force ratio is considerably larger than the initial friction factor 0 15 due to the locking effect if we artificially increase the equivalent friction coefficient to a very large value this will enforce a striking regime according to the formulation of external dynamics the collision energy in a striking collision no longer depends on the frictional coefficient but only on the collision angle the predicted collision energy yields fairly good agreement for cases with collision angles of 70 80 and 90 for the case blunt ice 60 the internal energy becomes better but is still somewhat underestimated the authors have found that the motion locking effect widely exists in collisions not only for ice collisions but also for ship collisions e g ship offshore fish farm collision yu et al 2019b ship jacket platform collision yu and amdahl 2018 ship semi submersible platform collision yu et al 2019c and ship ship collisions in cases where the motion locking effect is present due to large structural deformation and possible rupture the dissipated energy becomes larger than that predicted by external dynamic models this is because external dynamic models assume collisions between rigid bodies and do not consider cases with large structural deformations in cases with significant motion locking effects it is recommended to use a large equivalent friction coefficient as the input of external dynamic models to enforce a striking regime this gives a better approximation of the dissipated internal energy with some conservation it becomes clear that determination of the friction coefficient for external dynamic models requires information of the relative strengths of the striking and struck objects which is often not known a priori use of the columbic friction coefficient as input regardless of their relative strengths will yield unconservative results with respect to demand for strain dissipation 4 3 6dof coupled simulation of ice platform collisions both the column and the ice are often not in upright conditions due to their motions in waves therefore in addition to the collision angle θ a relative pitch angle ϕ is considered accounting for the relative pitch position of the colliding bodies at the instant of collisions and the collision geometry shown in fig 30 the ice configuration case 2 in fig 4 is used with both in plane and out of plane eccentricities the ice models with the two calibrated local ice are given an initial impact surge velocity v 3 m s the nodes on the top bottom and rear sides of the platform column are fixed against translations and rotations as in the 3dof simulations an ice friction coefficient of 0 15 is used the ice collision angle is assumed to be θ 60 and 80 while the relative pitch angles are ϕ 5 10 or 10 4 3 1 ice motions and structural damage ice collisions with sharp local ice for the 6dof coupled ice platform collisions with the sharp local ice fig 31 plots the time histories of the 6dof motions of the ice block during and after collision with different angles of θ and ϕ and fig 32 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the global coordinate figs 33 and 34 show the corresponding ice motion trajectories and structural damage during and after collision the 6dof ice motions are clearly observed the pitch angle is significant for cases with ϕ 5 or 10 because the heave positive and surge negative forces contribute jointly to a large negative pitch moment for the case with ϕ 10 the contributions from forces in surge and heave cancel each other to some extent yielding a small pitch angle ice collisions with blunt local ice for the three cases the ice is capable of sliding away from the platform column the local ice body is significantly crushed while the stiffened panel is dented moderately without shell rupture no decreasing sway motions with time are observed for the three cases this indicates that with more degrees of freedoms activated the motion locking effect becomes less significant for the 6dof coupled ice platform collisions with the blunt local ice fig 35 plots the time histories of the ice block motion during and after collision for different values of the angles θ and ϕ fig 36 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the global coordinate figs 37 and 38 show the corresponding ice motion trajectories and structural damage during and after collision the 6dof ice motions are clearly observed and become quite complicated due to the motion locking effect for the case blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 the pitch motion is moderate because contributions from heave and surge forces tend to counteract with each other the ice manages to slide away from the platform with significant structural damage and rupture as shown in fig 37 the fracture pattern is quite similar to the corresponding 3dof case for the case blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 the ice pitch motion is significant with joint contributions from heave and surge forces the local ice slides upwards along the side panel and this changes the fracture pattern fracture occurs at the panel boundaries as shown fig 37 due to large stretching rather than in the middle of the plate in the 3dof case this demonstrates the importance of considering 6dof ice motions as these may influence the failure pattern of the structure for the case blunt ice θ 80 ϕ 5 the ice penetrates into the column panel with significant tearing of the structure the motion locking effect is significant due to the large pitch motion the cracks tend to propagate upwards and the fracture patterns are not quite the same with that of the corresponding 3dof case in fig 24 4 3 2 energy dissipation figs 39 and 40 compare the dissipated energy calculated from the coupled simulations and that predicted by the external dynamic model by liu and amdahl 2010 for the studied 6dof collisions from the blunt and sharp ice the parameters that are adopted are identical to those in the 3dof cases as concerns the infinite frequency added masses of the ice the restitution factor of 0 0 and the columbic friction coefficient of 0 15 the external dynamic model predicts all the studied 6 cases to be sliding for the sharp ice cases the predicted energy with μ 0 0 15 shows a slight underestimation of the simulation results the underestimation results from ignorance of sliding loads in the calculation of friction coefficient an increased equivalent friction coefficient to 0 3 yields very good match of the simulated internal energy it is noted that even for collisions from the sharp ice with weak strength the structures absorb more energy than the ice itself for the blunt ice cases the motion locking effect is significant the predicted energy with μ 0 0 15 underestimates significantly the energy from simulations by using a large equivalent friction coefficient to enforce sticking conditions we obtain good accuracy for the case blunt ice θ 80 ϕ 5 and better agreement for the other two cases the cases blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 and blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 with consecutive impacts from initially in panel middle panel to later at the bulkhead seem difficult to predict with the external dynamic models 5 discussions the proposed solver has demonstrated good capabilities to simulate glacial ice impacts for ships and offshore structures accounting for the complex hydrodynamic ice structure interactions it should be noted that the hydrodynamic loads are calculated based on the seakeeping linear potential flow theory without considering any viscous forces and hydrodynamic interactions between ice and the structure sayeed et al 2017 reviewed the hydrodynamic interactions in the approaching process of iceberg and bergy bit towards offshore structures and emphasized the importance of near field hydrodynamic interactions ommani et al 2019 used linear potential flow theory to consider the multi body hydrodynamics interactions when a glacial ice feature approached an offshore platform the effect of viscosity was considered with morrison type coefficients of drag forces the current model may be extended to consider the effects of multi body hydrodynamic interactions and the correction terms for viscous forces in future work fig 41 plots the evolution of total energy with time for all the studied 3dof and 6dof collision cases the total energy includes strain energy friction energy and kinetic energy before collision the ice block is in force equilibrium with a velocity of 3 m s and this gives a total energy of 36 45 mj when collision occurs the actions from added mass forces in surge and the loads related to hydrodynamic memory effects increase the total energy in the system continuously it is noticed that the energy increases much faster for blunt ice impacts compared to sharp ice impacts because the magnitudes of accelerations for the blunt ice cases are considerably larger which yields larger loads related to the added masses and the memory effects in general the total energy falls between the values considering infinite frequency and zero frequency added masses this is consistent with observations by petersen and pedersen 1981 and motora et al 1971 who discussed the equivalent added masses for ship collisions both papers dealt with the equivalent sway added mass for right angle collisions it is also noticed from fig 41 that for some cases in 6dof collisions the total energy can be smaller than the energy considering infinite frequency added mass this is because the velocities in surge do not necessarily decreases to zero at the end of oblique impacts the added mass contributions are therefore smaller than 1 2 m a inf v 2 in addition for cases where the periodical motions heave roll or pitch are significant some energy is stored as potential energy related to the restoring forces and this energy is not accounted for in the total energy in fig 41 based on the simulation results it is recommended to use an equivalent added mass for practical estimation of the total energy with conservation which equals an average of infinite frequency and zero frequency added masses i e 8 e t o t a l 1 2 m m a e q v 2 m a e q 1 2 m a z e r o m a inf 6 conclusions this paper proposed a numerical solver for coupled dynamic simulation of glacial ice impacts the solver utilizes the potential flow theory for hydrodynamic loads the bwh criterion for fracture prediction of metals and a constitutive ice material model an example application of the solver is given for ice impacts on a semi submersible platform column the following conclusions are drawn 1 the proposed solver has demonstrated high capabilities to simulate complicated scenarios of glacial ice impacts considering hydrodynamic ice structure interaction the solver enables more realistic simulation of structural damage to ships and offshore structures under combined indentation and sliding ice loads its accuracy needs to be tested by comparing with experimental data in future work 2 the combined indentation and sliding loads can cause significant extension of structural damage at a much smaller force level than for rectilinear indentation this may induce progressive damage of the structure and significant degradation of the residual strengths after collisions in addition the combined indentation and sliding loads can also speed up crack propagation and cause rupture in a wide area this effect is especially significant for collisions from blunt strong ice and should be carefully designed against 3 for collisions from the sharp ice with weak strength the ice manages to slide away from the platform column external dynamic models are capable of predicting dissipated energy with reasonable accuracy for both the 3dof and 6dof cases in case of blunt ice with high strength the ice penetrated into the platform panel with significant structural damage and ice motions were locked to various extents this motion locking effect may decrease significantly the accuracy of the predicted energy dissipation by external dynamic models this can however be remedied by enforcing sticking conditions using a large equivalent friction coefficient the motion locking effect widely exists in various collision problems not only in ice collisions but also ship collisions 4 based on simulation results an equivalent added mass being the average value of infinite frequency and zero frequency added masses is recommended for practical estimation of the total energy in glacial ice collisions supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2021 108827 the following is the

20898,glacial ice features pose great threats on the safety of ships and offshore structures in the arctic house sized bergy bits or growlers are of particular concern because of the detection capability limits of marine radars analysis and design of structures against collisions from such glacial ice bodies has always been challenging due to the complicated hydrodynamic ice structure interaction this paper proposes a numerical solver for coupled simulation of glacial ice impacts accounting for the effects of hydrodynamic ice structure interaction the solver adopts user subroutines provided in ls dyna and combines three different modules i e the bwh bressan williams hill criterion for the prediction of fracture of steels a hydrostatic pressure dependent plasticity based material model for constitutive modelling of ice and the linear potential flow theory for hydrodynamic loads the proposed solver is verified and calibrated to ice resistance data from field tests and is then applied to simulate ice collisions on a semi submersible platform column collision scenarios with both in plane 3dof and full 6dof ice motions are considered the results are discussed with respect to ice motion trajectories ice crushing and structural damage under the combined action of ice indentation and sliding loads the dissipated energy predicted by external dynamic models is compared with simulation results and discussed keywords glacial ice impacts hydrodynamic ice structure interaction coupled simulation moving loads energy dissipation 1 introduction human activities increase continuously in the arctic regions related to exploration and production of natural resources e g oil and gas and maritime shipping this raises great concern on the safe operation of ships and offshore platforms in ice infested waters potential impacts from glacial ice may cause significant structural damage leading to economic loss environmental polution and in the extreme cases fatalities and progressive collapse of structures it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanics of glacial ice impacts and design crashworthy structures to withstand such actions relatively small glacial ice features house sized are of major concern because they are more difficult to be detected by marine radars and handled by ice management operations especially in extreme sea states fig 1 shows an example ice feature with a waterline of 30 m moving in waves analysis and design of ships and offshore structures against glacial ice impacts is challenging with multiple interaction effects including hydrodynamic loads ice mechanics and structural mechanics each of the three requires significant efforts to analyse rationally the mechanical behavior of ice during impact is very complicated and a mature ice material model that describes comprehensively the behavior is still lacking a few material models are available in the literature for the constitutive modelling of ice gagnon 2011 modelled ice as a crushable foam plasticity material with volumetric hardening overlapping mesh layers were adopted to mimic high pressure and low pressure zones during ice crushing ice spalling was simulated by predefined death time of contact between layers the model was used by gagnon and wang 2012 in numerical simulation of a ship ice collision to estimate damage to the vessel an alternative is to model ice using elastic plastic material models with the yield stress dependent on the hydrostatic pressure examples are fish 1991 derradji aouat 2000 and liu et al 2011 in addition ince et al 2017a proposed a constitutive equation for ice materials associating the failure stress with the effects of strain rate salinity and temperature both ductile and brittle behavior are accounted for according to the level of strain rate ice fracture was modelled using a cohesive zone model to define the crack opening displacement the ice model was used by ince et al 2017b to reproduce a drop test of ice on a deformable plate han et al 2017 studied several constitutive ice models and used them to reproduce an ice crushing test as regards structural mechanics with nonlinear finite element analysis nlfea it is essential to describe material behavior up to fracture and correctly calibrate it into theoretical material models the isotropic power law hardening model with a yield plateau is often used to describe steel behavior in the structural design stage often only nominal material properties are provided the statistical variability of material properties needs to be carefully considered to maintain sufficient margins of structural capacity in addition it is still challenging to accurately predict steel fracture initiation and propagation with coarsely meshed shell elements the complexity lies in the fact that fracture is a very localized phenomenon with a length scale in the range of plate thickness and is difficult to capture with large shell elements that are several times larger than the plate thickness in addition ductile fracture of steel depends highly on stress states loading path and is sensitive to the mesh size adopted yu and amdahl 2018 modelling of fracture is however crucial for capturing ice structure interaction during glacial ice impact because rupture of side panels may completely change relative strengths of the interacting ice and structure quite a few models showed good performance for the prediction of steel fracture modelled with large scale shell elements e g the bwh bressan williams hill criterion by alsos et al 2008 the rtcl rice tracey and cockcroft latham criterion by tørnqvist 2003 etc the models were validated with various small and large scale tests in several benchmark studies and showed reasonable and consistent predictions in general calle et al 2017 ehlers et al 2008 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 for hydrodynamic loads during ice impacts traditional collision analysis often decouples the problem into external dynamics and internal mechanics and the hydrodynamic effects during collisions are often considered simply as constant added masses for the calculation of dissipated energy in external dynamics in the assessment of internal mechanics the striking ice typically moves in a prescribed motion path and hits the structure the decoupled approach uses the crude assumption of constant added masses for hydrodynamic loads and neglects ice motion effects the approach was shown to perform with less accuracy for collisions with long durations or significant structural penetration yu et al 2019c the decoupled method generally works for head on collisions which are often considered as the worst condition this however includes only the indentation type of structural damage recent research by alsos 2008 and quinton 2008 showed that the structure may be more vulnerable to sliding induced moving loads which could cause the same structural damage with almost half of the magnitude compared to that by indentation loads alone an example of the sliding damage is shown in fig 2 where the bulk carrier reduta ordona was hit by an iceberg and the hull structure was severely damaged as ice slid along proper hydrodynamic modelling is essential to understand the evolution of hydrodynamic loads during collision the effect of ice motions and the influence of combined ice indentation and sliding on the structural damage computational fluid dynamic cfd packages are useful tools for the simulation of hydrodynamic loads with high accuracy and significant flow details the effects of viscosity and multi body interactions are well included an example of cfd simulations with application to ice can be found in huang et al 2020 using star ccm to calculate ship resistance operating in level ice cfd simulations on the other hand require significant modelling efforts and computational resources especially when very large fluid domains are involved it is also challenging to couple cfd simulations with ice material modelling and structural responses smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is another potential method to simulate ice structure interactions sph employs nodes rather than finite elements and these nodes may interact through kernel functions which smooth the properties a set distance from the center node sph may be used to model both fluids and solids examples of sph applications are pernas sánchez et al 2012 for the simulation of ice behavior under high speed ice impact and das and ehlers 2015 for simulating crushing and bending failure of ice the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is a widely used approach to model hydrodynamics during collisions as it is readily available in nlfea softwares and can be conveniently coupled with structural analysis in an ale simulation the eulerian mesh is used for modelling the fluid while the lagrangian mesh is used for the structure in each timestep loads and boundaries are transferred between the structure and fluid examples of ale simulations for ship ice collisions and water slamming impacts can be found in song et al 2016 gagnon and wang 2012 rudan et al 2019 and yu et al 2019a the ale method however requires significant efforts for modelling and computation and the results are sensitive to adopted mesh sizes and numerical parameters alternatively the hydrodynamic loads can be modelled based on linear potential flow theory using the mcol routine in ls dyna or the user defined load subroutine in ls dyna mcol is a 3d external dynamics program for ship collision embedded in ls dyna and examples of applications can be found in le sourne et al 2012 and kim et al 2021 through a user defined load subroutine in ls dyna yu et al 2016 and yu and amdahl 2016 implemented a traditional maneuvering model and linear potential flow theory respectively into ls dyna allowing coupled simulations of ship collisions the methods are computationally more efficient compared to ale and cfd simulations and is reasonably accurate this paper presents a numerical solver for coupled simulation of glacial ice impacts accounting for hydrodynamic ice structure interactions the solver adopts user subroutines in ls dyna and combines three different modules i e the bwh criterion proposed by alsos et al 2008 for steel fracture prediction the material model proposed by liu et al 2011 for constitutive modelling of ice and linear potential flow theory for hydrodynamic loads implemented by yu et al 2016 for ship collisions the proposed solver is used to simulate ice impacts on a semi submersible platform as an example application and the results are compared with predictions from external dynamic models the effects of combined indentation and sliding loads on structural damage are studied and discussed in detail 2 a numerical solver for glacial ice impact analysis considering hydrodynamic ice structure interaction the coupled numerical solver is developed by adopting user subroutines in the nlfea software ls dyna where hydrodynamic loads based on linear potential flow theory are implemented with the user defined load subroutine in addition the user defined material subroutine is adopted for constitutive modelling of the ice material and implementation of the bwh fracture criterion for the steel material 2 1 linear potential flow theory for hydrodynamics 2 1 1 hydrodynamic loads using linear potential flow theory in analogy with ship collision analysis yu et al 2016 it is assumed that before glacial ice impact the striking ice body is in force equilibrium where the excitation forces such as current and wave loads are balanced by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ice primarily drag forces departure from this state due to a sudden change in the external forces causes a change in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ice petersen 1982 the governing motion equations are 1 k 1 6 m j k a j k η k 0 t k j k t τ η k τ η k t 0 d τ c j k η k f j t j 1 2 6 where m j k a j k and c j k are components of the generalized mass matrix the added mass matrix at infinite frequency and the restoring matrix of the ice the index j 1 6 represents surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motion of the ice respectively η k t 0 is the velocity component of the striking ice feature in the k th degree of freedom just before impact and f j t is the generalized collision force in the j th degree of freedom 0 t k t τ η τ d τ is the convolution integral connected with free surface memory effects and k j k t is the so called impulse response function connected with directions j and k it provides a radiation load in j direction acting on the ice at the actual time t as a consequence of an impulse speed in k direction experienced by the ice at a previous time instant t τ k j k t is given alternatively by 2 k j k t 2 π 0 b j k ω cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 a j k a j k ω ω sin ω t d ω a j k ω and b j k ω are the frequency dependent added mass and linear wave radiation damping respectively 2 1 2 implementation of the hydrodynamic loads the user defined load subroutine is adopted for the application of hydrodynamic loads calculated from the linear potential flow theory the coupling procedure between structural and hydrodynamic solvers is shown in fig 3 during simulation ls dyna first passes information of nodal displacements and velocities at the ice center of gravity cog to the user subroutine the velocity history of cog is then stored in the user common variables the impulse response functions k j k t in the motion equations shall be prepared externally and read and stored in the subroutine in the first timestep the time increment is typically in the order of 10 6 s in ship or ice collision simulation to maintain efficiency without losing accuracy the velocity histories are stored every 10 3 s one challenge is that nodal accelerations at cog are needed in order to apply added mass related forces but are not provided in the subroutine for rigid bodies nodal accelerations are recommended to be approximated by the slope of linearly fitted curves of the velocity history data more details can be found in yu et al 2019c with the above information hydrodynamic loads are calculated in the user load subroutine and are applied to the cog of the ice ls dyna main solver then calculates structural deformation and ice motions and provides information of ice motions for the next timestep 2 2 an elastic plastic ice material model for practical design of structures against abnormal ice loading we implemented an elastic plastic material model proposed by liu et al 2011 for constitutive modelling of ice the tsai wu elliptic yield criterion given in eq 3 is used where the yield surface is a function of both the second invariant of the deviatoric stress j 2 1 2 s i j s i j and the hydrostatic pressure p σ k k 3 pressure positive in compression to mimic ice confinement 3 f p j 2 j 2 a 0 a 1 p a 2 p 2 0 where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are material coefficients to be specified by users and s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor to simulate ice failure an empirical failure criterion is adopted based on the effective plastic strain ε e q p and the hydrostatic pressure p 4 ε f ε 0 p p 2 γ 2 where p 2 is the larger root of the yield function ε 0 and γ are the parameters to be calibrated to ice crushing experiments or target ice properties the ice material properties used in the simulation are given in table 1 the material coefficients a 0 a 1 and a 2 correspond to an ice uniaxial compressive strength of 9 0 mpa and a uniaxial tensile strength of 0 82 mpa 2 3 the bwh fracture criterion for structural damage when ice structure interactions are accounted for proper modelling of the material behavior is essential because the relative strength of the striking ice body and the structure is sensitive to the selected material strength and fracture parameters the power law hardening with a yield plateau is used to model the material the hardening is described by the yield criterion 5 f σ e q σ f ε e q 0 where σ e q is the von mises equivalent stress the current flow stress σ f is a function of the equivalent plastic strain ε e q via the power law hardening rule 6 σ f ε e q σ 0 i f ε e q ε p l a t e a u k ε 0 e f f ε e q n i f ε e q ε p l a t e a u where k and n are the hardening parameters and σ 0 is the initial yield stress the bwh bressan williams hill instability criterion is used to model fracture of steel in the ice collision simulation the criterion which was proposed by alsos et al 2008 combines hill s local necking model hill 1952 and the shear stress criterion by bressan and williams 1983 it assumes that fracture occurs at the onset of local necking instability neglecting the post necking regime which is conservative it has been validated to be of good accuracy by comparison with various collision experiments marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 the bwh criterion can be expressed in the principle stress space as follows 7 σ 1 2 k 3 1 1 2 β β 2 β 1 2 3 ε ˆ 1 1 β β 2 β 1 n i f 1 β 0 2 k 3 2 3 ε ˆ 1 n 1 β 2 β 2 i f 0 β 1 β is the ratio of the minor and major principal strain rates β ε 2 ε 1 the critical strain ε ˆ 1 can be assumed to be equal to the power law coefficient n in accordance with hill s criterion the bwh fracture criterion is implemented with the user defined material subroutine in ls dyna fracture is enabled by eroding elements when the criterion is fulfilled a through thickness integration point is failed by setting the stresses to zero once the failure criterion is satisfied element erosion occurs once the middle integration point fails 3 verification and calibration of the numerical solver 3 1 description of the global and local ice geometries before any verification can be carried out a careful selection of the global ice geometry and local ice sharpness is necessary it is important to distinguish between local and global geometries of an ice feature the global geometry is decisive with respect to the mass and inertia of the ice body and the demand for energy dissipation while the local geometry is essential with respect to resistance of the ice subjected to deformation crushing extrusion etc at the contact point amdahl 2019 the global geometry of the ice is selected to be a cuboid with the same length and width of 30 m and a height of 10 m as shown in fig 4 this yields a total ice displacement of 8100 tons the selection is based on the finding by lu et al 2019 that the lower limit of the detection capability of marine radars under extreme wave conditions is an ice body with a waterline of about 30 m yu et al 2020 studied the effect of local ice sharpness on the collision response of a stiffened panel in a platform column and found that a critical sharpness exists which maximizes the structural damage for a given energy demand ice with blunter local geometries will deform the structure as if the ice is virtually rigid but with less structural indentation compared to that caused by ice with the critical sharpness ice with sharper local geometries will be crushed substantially we select two different ellipsoidal local ice models as used in yu et al 2020 representing a blunt radius of curvature 2 35 m and a sharp radius of curvature 0 68 m geometry respectively as shown in fig 4 the local ice bodies are modelled with detailed solid meshes and the constitutive ice material as collisions and deformations are assumed to occur only in the local ice region different locations of the local ice relative to the global ice cube will yield different eccentricities of the collision loads with respect to the ice cog two load eccentricities are assumed in case 1 the center of the local ice is placed close to the waterline with a direction vector of 15 m 6 m 3 m relative to the global ice cog see fig 4 including both in plane and out of plane eccentricities case 2 contains only in plane eccentricities where the center of the local ice is given by vector 15 m 6 m 0 m see fig 5 for each load case two local ice models with different sharpness are employed rigid beams are used to connect the center of gravity cog of the ice block as a whole to the rear of the crushable local ice model the beam properties are calibrated to represent correctly the total mass and inertia of the entire ice block with respect to the cog the 6dof hydrodynamic forces and moments are applied as user defined loads at the ice cog the contribution of local ice to the total mass and inertia of the global ice is considered small therefore the ice blocks in both case 1 and case 2 with either sharp or blunt local ice share the same global properties as shown in table 2 3 2 verification of the implementation of hydrodynamic loads in order to verify the implementation of hydrodynamic loads in ls dyna numerical simulations were conducted with the ice configuration in fig 4 as an example case 1 the ice cube with a radius of curvature of 2 35 m blunt is given an initial velocity of 3 m s and impacts a rigid plate refer fig 6 the rigid plate is oriented with a normal vector of 0 9254 0 1632 0 342 such that all 6dof ice motions will be excited contact is considered only for the local ice body the material parameters for the ice model and its calibration can be found in section 3 3 fig 7 shows snapshots of the ice cube motions during and after collisions with the initial ice state at t 0 0 s as the reference configuration the transparent part shows the current ice configuration at different time instants the time histories of collision forces and moments are plotted in fig 8 with respect to the ice cog in the early stage the local ellipsoidal ice is crushed substantially by the rigid plate the ice cube moves initially in the negative heave direction under the action of negative vertical collision forces the out of plane loading eccentricity induces significant pitch motions while large yaw motions are observed due to in plane loading eccentricity in order to verify the implementation of hydrodynamic loads in ls dyna a user code was developed to solve numerically the motion equation in eq 1 the code uses the same information of mass moments of inertial and hydrodynamic coefficients as used in ls dyna the collision forces and moments with reference to the ice cog calculated in ls dyna are used as inputs the euler method with midpoint integration is employed which yields second order accuracy for the position the adopted timestep is 10 3 s and is considered sufficiently small the time displacement curves for the 6dof ice motions calculated using ls dyna and the user code are compared in fig 9 good agreement is obtained in general but with small differences in the amplitudes of the roll and pitch motions however the periods of both motions agree well the implementation of the hydrodynamic loads is thus considered successful the model is shown to be very versatile for simulation of complicated collision scenarios with reasonable accuracy 3 3 verification and calibration of the ice material model the code for the ice material model was used consistently by liu et al 2011 and yu et al 2020 the implementation has been verified in a single element test where nodes on one end of the solid element is fixed against all degrees of freedom and nodes on the opposite plane are forced to move in a displacement controlled manner the resulting evolution of the yield stress with the hydrostatic pressure agrees well with the theoretical curve in als ice collisions the behavior of ice and structures are sensitive to their relative strength it is therefore crucial to calibrate correctly the energy absorption capability of ice in order to obtain a realistic structural response a series of medium scale indentation tests that were conducted in 1984 were employed to calibrate the ice material model the tests kennedy 1990 were conducted using a spherical indenter with a radius of 2 3 m driven by 4 hydraulic actuators each hydraulic actuator had a capacity of 4 mn the indented ice face was located in a lateral tunnel excavated into the side of a grounded iceberg near the settlement of pond inlet on the northern coast of baffin island nwt daley 1994 fig 10 shows a sketch of the test arrangement fig 11 a shows plots of the force displacement curves of 4 different cases from the pond inlet tests with a common indenter radius of 2 3 m the ice force indentation curves exhibit significant scatter which demonstrates the inherent uncertainties of ice mechanical properties and responses an analysis of the experimental data is carried out by averaging the ice energy absorption per unit crushed volume which yields an ice crushing energy density of approximately 3 mj m3 lu et al 2018 this energy density correlates with a pressure area relationship of p 3 2 a 0 1 mpa which is the local ice load for pc3 vessels in the iacs polar class code iacs 2011 pc3 represents the vessel capability in the year round operation in second year sea ice which may include multiyear ice inclusions it differs greatly from the design pressure curve for uls actions for uls design the iso 19906 standard iso 19906 2010 recommends an ice pressure area relationship of p 7 4 a 0 7 mpa w h e n a 10 m 2 p 1 48 mpa w h e n a 10 m 2 for designing structures against local ice loading a comparison of the iacs pc3 curve and the iso curve for the ice pressure is given in fig 11 b the iso curve gives a very large pressure for small contact areas but the pressure decreases rapidly when the contact area increases the local pressure is smaller than the iso pressure area curves for a 4 m 2 and larger for a 4 m 2 the iso curve was derived from a series of indentation tests in the beaufort sea including the pond inlet tests and the values were determined by the mean value plus three times the standard deviation this yields an approximate upper envelope of ice strength the corresponding ice energy density is much larger than the average value from the tests especially when the contact area is small refer fig 11 a in als conditions large deformations are expected either in ice or the structure or both and thus require a more realistic representation of ice energy absorption capability the iacs pc3 pressure area relationship of p 3 2 a 0 1 mpa fits well the average ice energy absorption of the pond inlet experimental data and is adopted for further analysis the ice model employs a strain based fracture criterion in eq 4 which renders the model sensitive to the adopted mesh size furthermore as modelling of the target ellipsoidal shapes with the same mesh size is difficult calibration of the ice failure criterion has to be performed on a case by case basis the two ellipsoidal ice models with different sharpnesses are meshed with solid elements with a size ranging from 35 to 75 mm the two models are calibrated to the target ice design curve of f 3 2 a 0 9 mn in fig 12 by crushing with rigid plates as done in yu et al 2020 the calibrated force curves follow the design ice resistance curve well with small oscillations the calibrated ice failure strain tends to decrease as the ice geometry becomes sharper 3 4 validation of the bwh fracture criterion the code for the bwh bressan williams hill instability criterion was initially proposed and implemented by alsos et al 2008 and has been validated of good accuracy by comparison of various collision experiments in alsos et al 2008 and storheim et al 2015 4 application of the proposed solver to glacial ice impacts on a semi submersible platform column the proposed solver can be used to simulate various glacial ice impact problems considering hydrodynamic ice structure interactions an example is given below for ice collision on a semi submersible platform column 4 1 finite element models of the platform column the column leg of the midgard structure was modelled by tavakoli and amdahl 2010 for the assessment of structural strength against supply vessel collisions the drawings of the platform column are shown in fig 13 the column was modelled from el8125 through el39000 in fig 13 only the front part of one leg was modelled the overall dimension of the fe model shown in fig 14 is 17200 mm 30875 mm x 6100 mm w x h x d the outer shell thickness is in the range of 16 18 mm the vertical stiffeners are equally spaced with a distance of 0 625 m the stiffeners are modelled as l bars with dimensions of 320x50x12x40 mm 300x50x11x50 mm and 240x40x10x30 mm depending on the locations the column decks and the vertical bulkheads are equipped with stiffeners every 0 625 m the thickness of the deck shell plating is 12 mm and 14 mm for the bulkhead plating the column model was meshed using approximately 245 000 shell elements the general element size is 120 mm two steel material grades are used for the structure the material properties and power law parameters are listed in table 3 the column plates have a yield stress of 420 mpa while the column stiffeners are fabricated with a yield stress of 355 mpa the bwh fracture criterion and element erosion are described in section 2 3 4 2 in plane 3dof coupled simulation of ice platform collisions first in plane 3dof case 2 ice collisions on the platform column are studied with the ice configuration given in fig 5 the two calibrated local ice models with an initial curvature radius of 0 68 m and 2 35 m were adopted representing sharp and blunt local ice body respectively the collision scenarios are defined in fig 15 where the ice body hits the panel with an initial surge velocity v 3 m s the mass and inertia of the semi submersible platform are considerably larger than the studied ice such that any motion of the platform is neglected the nodes on the top bottom and rear sides of the platform column are fixed against translations and rotations the eroded single surface contact is used to define the internal contact of the ice model and the eroded surface to surface contact for the contact between ice and the structure using the pinball segment based contact with soft 2 an ice friction coefficient of 0 15 is used the collision angle as defined in fig 15 is θ 60 70 80 and 90 respectively 4 2 1 ice motions and structural damage ice collisions with sharp local ice for ice platform collisions with the sharp local ice fig 16 displays time history of the 3dof planar motions of the ice block during and after collision for different collision angles and fig 17 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the local x o y coordinate as shown in fig 15 the collision angles in the studied cases are quite large however due to the small ice friction μ0 0 15 and the load eccentricity ice blocks can still slide to different extents and detach from the platform in the four cases in general a smaller collision angle yields larger yaw and sway motions for cases with collision angles of 60 and 70 the ice sway motions increase continuously with time this is the typical sliding case as defined in external dynamics an example of the sliding trajectory and structural damage is given in fig 18 for case sharp ice θ 60 where the ice slides smoothly away from the platform for the case with a collision angle of 80 the sway motion increases initially but starts to decrease after a while for the case with a collision angle of 90 the sway motion goes directly to a negative value fig 19 illustrates the negative sway motion and ice trajectories for the case sharp ice θ 90 the reason for negative sway motions is that the deformed structure at the contact region tends to prevent the local ice from further sliding and then the rotation center of the ice shifts from the ice cog to the contact region the ice turns out to rotate anti clockwise about the contact region and thus yields a negative sway this is termed as the motion locking effect and a direct result of this effect is the shift of rotation center from cog to the contact region this effect is also observed in ship collisions e g yu et al 2016 in addition due to the rebound effect the ice still manages to detach from the platform from figs 18 and 19 the local sharp ice gets crushed significantly in both cases due to its relatively weak strength the stiffened panel deforms but no rupture of the outer shell occurs the collision resistance is governed by combined ice crushing and structural deformation the deformation of either side increases the contact area and thus the resistance the ice structure interactions in als conditions are explained in detail in yu et al 2020 when hydrodynamic loads are introduced successfully realistic ice motions during collision enable simulations of the combined ice indentation and sliding damage simultaneously fig 20 presents sectional views of ice crushing and structural damage under combined indentation and sliding action at different time instants for the case sharp ice θ 80 in the first 0 5s the ice collides into the structure virtually straight with little lateral motions during this period both the ice and the structure deform and the ice continuously decelerates in surge and accelerates in sway and yaw from 0 6s the sliding motion becomes evident and the ice moves continuously along the panel over time stiffeners along the sliding path deform slightly without tripping the ice slides away from the platform after 2 5s with little damage imposed on the bulkhead in general the combined indentation and sliding loads tend to extend structural damage to a broader region compared to cases with indentation only however because of the relatively low strength of the sharp local ice the damage extension is moderate in this case ice collisions with blunt local ice for the blunt local ice collision with the platform fig 21 displays time histories of the 3dof planar motions of the ice block during and after collision for different collision angles fig 22 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the local x o y coordinate the ice motion trajectories and structural damage before and after collisions are shown in figs 23 and 24 for two representative cases i e blunt ice θ 60 and blunt ice θ 90 from fig 22 the collision resistance is dominated by damage of the structure and the force curves in the x direction virtually overlap with each other in the first quarter second for the case with a collision angle of 60 ice sliding is dominant but the motion locking effect also exists with a negative sway velocity after 2s due to the presence of the bulkhead as shown in fig 21 the bulkhead represents strong points of the structures and is capable of crushing the blunt ice significantly it tends to prevent the ice from further sliding with a strong negative force in sway but the ice manages to detach from the platform with significant kinetic energy as shown in fig 23 sliding of the blunt ice causes severe damage and fracture of the structure fig 25 shows fracture initiation and propagation as well as contour plots of element stress triaxialities during ice sliding triaxialities in the range of 0 66 indicate significant biaxial stretching once an initial crack occurs stress concentration at the crack tip will cause continuous tearing of the panel for cases with collision angles of 70 80 and 90 the motion locking effect becomes significant the strong ice penetrates into the stiffened panel with large structural damage as shown in fig 24 the ice motion is locked by the deformed structure and the strong bulkhead the contact bodies are not able to separate via ice sliding the rotation center of the ice then shifts from cog to the contact region this yields a large negative sway motion and an anti clockwise yaw motion about the contact region however due to the rebound effect and the yaw motion the striking ice can still detach from the platform in the end fig 26 presents sectional views of ice crushing and structural damage at different time instants for the case blunt ice θ 60 in the initial half second the ice collides into the structure in virtually straight line with little lateral motions but the initial inclination introduces loads in the tangential direction the ice remains virtually undamaged during this period while the stiffened panel deforms significantly with large indentation and tripping of stiffeners from 0 6 s the sliding motion becomes evident and the ice slides continuously along the panel causing large deformation and tripping of stiffeners along its path the ice deformation is small until it hits the bulkhead of the column and starts to be crushed significantly the curves in fig 22 show that the collision resistance drops drastically at about 0 3 s due to outer shell rupture and remains small during sliding because of the large kinetic energy the ice slides away from the platform at about 3 8s with a significant part of the local ice body completely removed by the bulkhead it is interesting to find from fig 26 8 that some removed ice pieces are left in the corner close to the bulkhead the results indicate that with strong ice the combined indentation and sliding loads can cause significant extension of structural damage at a much smaller force level than for lateral indentation this may induce progressive damage of the structure and significant degradation of the residual strength in addition the combined indentation and sliding loads may also speed up propagation of cracks and cause rupture in a wide area 4 2 2 energy dissipation external dynamic models based on rigid body dynamics are often used for rapid prediction of the dissipated energy in a collision figs 27 and 28 compare the dissipated energy calculated from the coupled simulations and that predicted by the external dynamics model by liu and amdahl 2010 for collisions from blunt and sharp ice with different collision angles for the external dynamics model the infinite frequency added masses of the ice body calculated by the boundary element method in the hydrod software are used a restitution factor of 0 0 is adopted to be conservative in the external dynamic models the status of the striking and struck objects after collision can be classified into two categories i e sliding and sticking it is governed by the ratio of the impact impulse μ i t i n relative to the friction coefficient μ 0 where i t and i n are the impact impulses in the tangential and normal directions respectively collisions are categorized as sliding when μ μ 0 and are sticking otherwise because of a small ice friction coefficient of μ 0 0 15 and the load eccentricities the external dynamic model predicts all the above eight cases to be sliding in addition given the same collision angle and friction coefficient the external dynamic models do not distinguish whether the striking ice is sharp or blunt and predicts the same dissipated internal and friction energy from the coupled simulations it is not quite straightforward to tell whether collision for a specific scenario belongs to sliding or sticking and the prediction accuracy differs greatly for cases with sharp and blunt ice for the cases with sharp local ice the model by liu and amdahl 2010 predicts the dissipated energy with reasonably good accuracy in general for collision angles of 60 and 70 with the sharp ice the external dynamic model underestimates the internal energy to some extent this may be due to underestimation of the tangential force by considering only friction but not the sliding forces liu and amdahl 2019 proposed to use an equivalent friction coefficient by adding the columbic friction coefficient and the sliding force indentation load ratio fig 29 plots the ratio of forces in the tangential and normal directions in fig 17 for both the sharp and blunt collision cases from fig 29 a for sharp ice the force ratio starts with the columbic coefficient of 0 15 and decreases in the initial 0 25 s because the deformation is governed by indentation with little sliding and friction forces after that the ratio increases continuously with increasing sliding motions up to a value of about 0 6 at 1 5s by averaging the ratios over time we may adopt an equivalent friction coefficient of 0 3 the results are shown in figs 27 and 28 it seems that the predicted internal energy agrees better with the coupled simulation when μ 0 0 30 theoretically an increase of the friction coefficient will lead to two conditions as follows the ratio of the impact impulse μ remains larger than the new equivalent friction coefficient i e μ μ 0 e q and the collision stays in the sliding regime the internal energy increases continuously with increasing equivalent friction coefficients the ratio of the impact impulse μ becomes smaller than the equivalent friction coefficient i e μ μ 0 e q and the collision shifts to the sticking regime the internal energy increases to a constant value and does not change with further increase of the equivalent friction coefficient for the collision cases with the blunt ice the predicted internal energy shows large differences with the simulation results when only the columbic friction coefficient μ 0 0 15 is used the external dynamic model categorizes the four cases as sliding collisions this does not hold in general for blunt ice collisions due to the motion locking effect with large structural damage and the presence of the strong bulkhead structure even for the case blunt ice 60 where the ice managed to slide away from the platform the discrepancy is still significant from fig 29 b the equivalent force ratio is considerably larger than the initial friction factor 0 15 due to the locking effect if we artificially increase the equivalent friction coefficient to a very large value this will enforce a striking regime according to the formulation of external dynamics the collision energy in a striking collision no longer depends on the frictional coefficient but only on the collision angle the predicted collision energy yields fairly good agreement for cases with collision angles of 70 80 and 90 for the case blunt ice 60 the internal energy becomes better but is still somewhat underestimated the authors have found that the motion locking effect widely exists in collisions not only for ice collisions but also for ship collisions e g ship offshore fish farm collision yu et al 2019b ship jacket platform collision yu and amdahl 2018 ship semi submersible platform collision yu et al 2019c and ship ship collisions in cases where the motion locking effect is present due to large structural deformation and possible rupture the dissipated energy becomes larger than that predicted by external dynamic models this is because external dynamic models assume collisions between rigid bodies and do not consider cases with large structural deformations in cases with significant motion locking effects it is recommended to use a large equivalent friction coefficient as the input of external dynamic models to enforce a striking regime this gives a better approximation of the dissipated internal energy with some conservation it becomes clear that determination of the friction coefficient for external dynamic models requires information of the relative strengths of the striking and struck objects which is often not known a priori use of the columbic friction coefficient as input regardless of their relative strengths will yield unconservative results with respect to demand for strain dissipation 4 3 6dof coupled simulation of ice platform collisions both the column and the ice are often not in upright conditions due to their motions in waves therefore in addition to the collision angle θ a relative pitch angle ϕ is considered accounting for the relative pitch position of the colliding bodies at the instant of collisions and the collision geometry shown in fig 30 the ice configuration case 2 in fig 4 is used with both in plane and out of plane eccentricities the ice models with the two calibrated local ice are given an initial impact surge velocity v 3 m s the nodes on the top bottom and rear sides of the platform column are fixed against translations and rotations as in the 3dof simulations an ice friction coefficient of 0 15 is used the ice collision angle is assumed to be θ 60 and 80 while the relative pitch angles are ϕ 5 10 or 10 4 3 1 ice motions and structural damage ice collisions with sharp local ice for the 6dof coupled ice platform collisions with the sharp local ice fig 31 plots the time histories of the 6dof motions of the ice block during and after collision with different angles of θ and ϕ and fig 32 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the global coordinate figs 33 and 34 show the corresponding ice motion trajectories and structural damage during and after collision the 6dof ice motions are clearly observed the pitch angle is significant for cases with ϕ 5 or 10 because the heave positive and surge negative forces contribute jointly to a large negative pitch moment for the case with ϕ 10 the contributions from forces in surge and heave cancel each other to some extent yielding a small pitch angle ice collisions with blunt local ice for the three cases the ice is capable of sliding away from the platform column the local ice body is significantly crushed while the stiffened panel is dented moderately without shell rupture no decreasing sway motions with time are observed for the three cases this indicates that with more degrees of freedoms activated the motion locking effect becomes less significant for the 6dof coupled ice platform collisions with the blunt local ice fig 35 plots the time histories of the ice block motion during and after collision for different values of the angles θ and ϕ fig 36 plots the corresponding collision resistance in the global coordinate figs 37 and 38 show the corresponding ice motion trajectories and structural damage during and after collision the 6dof ice motions are clearly observed and become quite complicated due to the motion locking effect for the case blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 the pitch motion is moderate because contributions from heave and surge forces tend to counteract with each other the ice manages to slide away from the platform with significant structural damage and rupture as shown in fig 37 the fracture pattern is quite similar to the corresponding 3dof case for the case blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 the ice pitch motion is significant with joint contributions from heave and surge forces the local ice slides upwards along the side panel and this changes the fracture pattern fracture occurs at the panel boundaries as shown fig 37 due to large stretching rather than in the middle of the plate in the 3dof case this demonstrates the importance of considering 6dof ice motions as these may influence the failure pattern of the structure for the case blunt ice θ 80 ϕ 5 the ice penetrates into the column panel with significant tearing of the structure the motion locking effect is significant due to the large pitch motion the cracks tend to propagate upwards and the fracture patterns are not quite the same with that of the corresponding 3dof case in fig 24 4 3 2 energy dissipation figs 39 and 40 compare the dissipated energy calculated from the coupled simulations and that predicted by the external dynamic model by liu and amdahl 2010 for the studied 6dof collisions from the blunt and sharp ice the parameters that are adopted are identical to those in the 3dof cases as concerns the infinite frequency added masses of the ice the restitution factor of 0 0 and the columbic friction coefficient of 0 15 the external dynamic model predicts all the studied 6 cases to be sliding for the sharp ice cases the predicted energy with μ 0 0 15 shows a slight underestimation of the simulation results the underestimation results from ignorance of sliding loads in the calculation of friction coefficient an increased equivalent friction coefficient to 0 3 yields very good match of the simulated internal energy it is noted that even for collisions from the sharp ice with weak strength the structures absorb more energy than the ice itself for the blunt ice cases the motion locking effect is significant the predicted energy with μ 0 0 15 underestimates significantly the energy from simulations by using a large equivalent friction coefficient to enforce sticking conditions we obtain good accuracy for the case blunt ice θ 80 ϕ 5 and better agreement for the other two cases the cases blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 and blunt ice θ 60 ϕ 10 with consecutive impacts from initially in panel middle panel to later at the bulkhead seem difficult to predict with the external dynamic models 5 discussions the proposed solver has demonstrated good capabilities to simulate glacial ice impacts for ships and offshore structures accounting for the complex hydrodynamic ice structure interactions it should be noted that the hydrodynamic loads are calculated based on the seakeeping linear potential flow theory without considering any viscous forces and hydrodynamic interactions between ice and the structure sayeed et al 2017 reviewed the hydrodynamic interactions in the approaching process of iceberg and bergy bit towards offshore structures and emphasized the importance of near field hydrodynamic interactions ommani et al 2019 used linear potential flow theory to consider the multi body hydrodynamics interactions when a glacial ice feature approached an offshore platform the effect of viscosity was considered with morrison type coefficients of drag forces the current model may be extended to consider the effects of multi body hydrodynamic interactions and the correction terms for viscous forces in future work fig 41 plots the evolution of total energy with time for all the studied 3dof and 6dof collision cases the total energy includes strain energy friction energy and kinetic energy before collision the ice block is in force equilibrium with a velocity of 3 m s and this gives a total energy of 36 45 mj when collision occurs the actions from added mass forces in surge and the loads related to hydrodynamic memory effects increase the total energy in the system continuously it is noticed that the energy increases much faster for blunt ice impacts compared to sharp ice impacts because the magnitudes of accelerations for the blunt ice cases are considerably larger which yields larger loads related to the added masses and the memory effects in general the total energy falls between the values considering infinite frequency and zero frequency added masses this is consistent with observations by petersen and pedersen 1981 and motora et al 1971 who discussed the equivalent added masses for ship collisions both papers dealt with the equivalent sway added mass for right angle collisions it is also noticed from fig 41 that for some cases in 6dof collisions the total energy can be smaller than the energy considering infinite frequency added mass this is because the velocities in surge do not necessarily decreases to zero at the end of oblique impacts the added mass contributions are therefore smaller than 1 2 m a inf v 2 in addition for cases where the periodical motions heave roll or pitch are significant some energy is stored as potential energy related to the restoring forces and this energy is not accounted for in the total energy in fig 41 based on the simulation results it is recommended to use an equivalent added mass for practical estimation of the total energy with conservation which equals an average of infinite frequency and zero frequency added masses i e 8 e t o t a l 1 2 m m a e q v 2 m a e q 1 2 m a z e r o m a inf 6 conclusions this paper proposed a numerical solver for coupled dynamic simulation of glacial ice impacts the solver utilizes the potential flow theory for hydrodynamic loads the bwh criterion for fracture prediction of metals and a constitutive ice material model an example application of the solver is given for ice impacts on a semi submersible platform column the following conclusions are drawn 1 the proposed solver has demonstrated high capabilities to simulate complicated scenarios of glacial ice impacts considering hydrodynamic ice structure interaction the solver enables more realistic simulation of structural damage to ships and offshore structures under combined indentation and sliding ice loads its accuracy needs to be tested by comparing with experimental data in future work 2 the combined indentation and sliding loads can cause significant extension of structural damage at a much smaller force level than for rectilinear indentation this may induce progressive damage of the structure and significant degradation of the residual strengths after collisions in addition the combined indentation and sliding loads can also speed up crack propagation and cause rupture in a wide area this effect is especially significant for collisions from blunt strong ice and should be carefully designed against 3 for collisions from the sharp ice with weak strength the ice manages to slide away from the platform column external dynamic models are capable of predicting dissipated energy with reasonable accuracy for both the 3dof and 6dof cases in case of blunt ice with high strength the ice penetrated into the platform panel with significant structural damage and ice motions were locked to various extents this motion locking effect may decrease significantly the accuracy of the predicted energy dissipation by external dynamic models this can however be remedied by enforcing sticking conditions using a large equivalent friction coefficient the motion locking effect widely exists in various collision problems not only in ice collisions but also ship collisions 4 based on simulation results an equivalent added mass being the average value of infinite frequency and zero frequency added masses is recommended for practical estimation of the total energy in glacial ice collisions supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2021 108827 the following is the

coupled algorithm is proposed based on the multi body dynamics theory for a monopile offshore wind turbine hereby the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm is applied to optimize parameters and installation location of a tmd in terms of dynamic response and modal analysis the results show that when tmd inherent frequency approximates the first order inherent frequency of the tower front back bending moment vibration reduces to the maximum extent so does the nacelle acceleration in the frequency domain optimal installation location is within 0 1 m away from the center of the tower top nacelle connection toward the front end of the nacelle and the tmd after parameter optimization may function to reduce the tower top displacement by 68 30 under the shutdown condition keywords offshore wind turbine system tmd coupled algorithm tuned mass damper afsa vibration control 1 introduction currently there has been a sharp increase in offshore wind turbine owt projects around the world bigger is definitely better when it comes to offshore wind turbines and major components power ratings and rotor diameters have both grown dramatically over the past few years and while there are some questions over the logistics of much heavier nacelles or longer blades this trend looks set to continue considering the negative impact on structural health from ocean environment investigation of the dynamic characteristics of offshore wind turbines is urgently needed in recent years flexible modeling of owt system in complicated environments have been drawing growing attention compared with onshore wind turbines due to increasing size and flexibility offshore wind turbines are vulnerable to vibration sources resulted from wind wave combined excitations causing greater fatigue loads on the major parts such as blades and tower as well as contributing to increasing maintenance costs to control the dynamic response energy dissipation systems is a potential choice tuned mass damper tmd is a typical representation of energy dissipation systems tmd was first put forward by hermann 1909 and since then it has been investigated widely for the suppressive capacity in a wide range of diversified scenarios tmd is naturally used as a passive vibration suppressing device in wind turbines to suppress system vibration and reduce fatigue loads igusa igusa and k 1991 used calculus of variations to optimize the tmd design with constraints on the total mass den hartog 1985 and das 1992 optimized the tmd parameters with a two degree of freedom model chen chen and kareem 2003 established the structural tmd system equation and derived the optimal tmd parameter expression marian marian et al 2014 and domenico de domenico et al 2018 proposed a new device based on tmd named as tuned mass damper inerter tmdi to suppress the oscillatory motion of systems tsai h c j i j o s tsai and structures 1995 proposed the idea of the accelerated tmd and proved the suppression ability of tmd under seismic load and reggio reggio and angelis 2015 used a two degree of freedom model to optimize parameters of tmd under seismic loads many studies focus on optimization of tmd parameters and suppression of vibration under wind or seismic load in the research of tmd scholars have begun to consider the flexibility of key components of wind turbines most scholars have used the lagrange method or software to model the dynamic performance of whole systems murtagh et al murtagh et al 2004 2005 presented a blade tower coupled finite element model to consider the flexibility of key components investigating the blade tower coupling mechanism analyzing dynamic wind loads on the structure lackner and rotea lackner et al 2010 developed fast sc software to explore how well tmd functioned to control vibration of offshore wind turbines and concluded that tmd could effectively suppress the wind turbine vibration conclusions were drawn that tmd inside the nacelle should be tuned to the natural frequency of the corresponding first support structure mode in fore aft direction ghassempour et al 2019 used gh bladed software to establish an aero hydro servo elastic model and explored various potential tuning frequencies masses and damping ratios under different wind speeds in both operational and parked rotor conditions stewart stewart 2012 stewart and lackner 2014 obtained a simplified model for exploring optimal tmd parameters despite all these studies none has considered the impact of the initial tmd installation location on the dynamic performance of a wind turbine in this paper blades and tower systems are regarded as a series of discrete elements and nacelles are simplified as rigid models by fully considering the flexibility of key components such as blades and tower system tmd coupled algorithm is proposed hereby parameter optimization and installation location are also explored based on the improved fish swarm algorithm this paper is

the mass ratio μ stiffness k and damping ratio δ of tmd can be adjusted to improve capability for absorbing vibration energy so as to reduce the vibration response of owts since vibration in longitudinal direction z 1 direction resulting from external excitations in first order front back bending moment current study only considers installation of tmd inside the nacelles along the longitudinal direction given standard deviation of tower top displacement in the longitudinal direction is largely related to the tower s fatigue load control objective function is defined as the suppression rate for the longitudinal standard deviation of tower top deflection 46 η j j t j 100 where j and j t respectively represent the longitudinal standard displacement deviation with and without vibration control tmd is initially located at the nacelle center with a travel limit of 8 m under emergency shutdown load case the wind speed is 12 m s the turbulence is rated c and the blade feathers by 8 s the mass of tmd used in construction engineering structures usually accounts for 0 5 2 of the mass of the main structure therefore under the same stiffness and damping 7 sets of comparison parameter groups m1 m7 are set as shown in table 4 stewart 2012 the result is shown in fig 8 when the mass ratio μ 0 0125 the amplitude of growth is the greatest when μ 0 0125 the amplitude of η growth obviously reduces as μ increases when μ changes from 0 01 to 0 0125 η increases by 15 4 and when μ changes from 0 0125 to 0 015 η only increases by 3 41 considering the practical engineering application the nacelle space and tmd cost etc this paper chooses μ 0 0125 at a certain frequency of tmd the damping is mainly affected by mass and damping ratio set the mass ratio range of 0 005 0 02 the damping ratio range of 0 02 0 2 and the stiffness of 70 sets of comparison parameters stewart and lackner 2014 as shown in table 5 and the results are shown in fig 9 when the value of μ 0 01 the growth rate of η decreases as δ increases when u 0 0125 and 0 0150 η increases first and then decreases as δ increases when μ 0 0125 δ reached the optimal value 0 08 at this time the suppression rate is 42 84 when μ is 0 0125 keep the damping constant the stiffness is in the range of 20000 62000 n m and set 8 groups of comparison parameters s1 s8 as shown in table 6 according to fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 when the stiffness is 32 000n m the suppression rate reaches the maximum value and the reduction amplitude of the nacelle acceleration in the frequency domain reaches the greatest extent at this time the tmd inherent frequency is close to the natural frequency 0 263 hz of the first fore aft support structure mode and the suppression rate reduces as the stiffness increases 7 tmd parameter optimization 7 1 tmd mass stiffness and damping coefficient optimization as new intelligent bionic optimization algorithm artificial fish swarm algorithm is widely used in system control and artificial intelligence et al however the artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa has its weakness in solving the problem of multi objective knapsack such as blindness search low speed of convergence and low accuracy in solution mehdiet al 2014 therefore an improved afsa has been used for optimization of tmd parameters in this paper afsa realizes optimization by simulating four behaviors of fish i e preying swarming following and moving basic principle of afsa is that fish always follow other fish to find the most nutritious places so it is possible to know that the fish number is the largest in the most nutritious area fig 13 shows the vision of an artificial fish in afsa current state of artificial fish is described as x x 1 x 2 x n x i represents the optimization variable nutrition concentration at the location of the artificial fish is expressed by using an objective function y f x the visual distance is represented by v the maximum moving step is represented by s t e p within the visual range it will randomly select a new position when the state at the visual position is better than the current state the artificial fish will move toward x n e x t by one step or otherwise it will continue searching the optimization process can be represented as 47 x i v x i v r a n d 48 x n e x t x x v x x v x s t e p r a n d when r a n d 0 and 1 are random behaviors of an artificial fish mainly include preying swarming following and moving 1 preying preying refers to continuing movement of an artificial fish toward area y of higher food concentration it is also an iterative behavior of moving toward a better area if the objective function value y j of x j is superior than that of x i then the artificial fish will move by one s t e p or otherwise it will randomly select another x j 49 x j x i v r a n d 50 x i t 1 x i t x j x i t x j x i t s t e p r a n d after multiple attempts the state of improvement required with respect to the objective function value fails to be satisfied the artificial fish will move by one step in a random direction 51 x i t 1 x i t v r a n d 2 swarming swarming refers to moving of an artificial fish to the center of a fish swarm and avoiding of overcrowding d i j x i x j is used to represent the distance between two artificial fish the number of artificial fish within the visual range d i j v and the central position are respectively represented by n f and x c if x c n f δ x i and x i x c δ is the preset degree of congestion 0 δ 1 it means food is sufficient and it is not highly crowded at the center therefore the artificial fish will move toward the center by one step 52 x i t 1 x i t x c x i t x c x i t s t e p r a n d otherwise the artificial fish will continue preying if n f 0 the artificial fish will also act to prey 3 following following refers to moving of an artificial fish swarm to the optimal individual artificial fish within the visual range to avoid overcrowding if x j n f δ x i and x i x j it means that food is sufficient and it is not highly crowded at x j in this case artificial fish at x i will move toward x j by one step 53 x i t 1 x i t x j x i t x j x i t s t e p r a n d otherwise the artificial fish will continue preying if n f 0 the artificial fish will also act to prey 4 moving moving refers to random movement of an artificial fish in water to seek for food and partners in a wider range it is a random movement when preying times of artificial fish reach the maximum and a better position is not found compared with other optimized algorithm differential evolution de performs better in solving complex global optimization problems mohamed 2017 at the late stage of afsa when multiple successive iterations have occurred the algorithm will stop optimization due to local optimums and information on the bulletin board will no longer be updated or fail to be timely updated to solve this problem crossover and mutation of de algorithm can be used namely when the bulletin board remains stagnant for a set time limit some artificial fish will be selected to implement crossover and mutation operations of the de algorithm and produce new individuals if the new state is superior to the previous state the bulletin board will be updated to the new state by this means the optimization algorithm will come out of the local optimum obsession fig 14 shows an embodiment of the afsa improvement process for the improved fish swarm algorithm the individual number is set to 150 the visual distance to 1 the crowd factor to 0 62 the number of attempts to 200 the crossover rate to 0 6 and the mutation rate to 0 01 the maximum iteration number is 200 and the step length is 0 5 the final optimal parameters are shown in table 7 7 2 parameter optimization for initial installation position of tmd in order to obtain accurate simulation results of the starting condition the first 30s are eliminated according to the actual engineering application in actual applications tmd is installed at the right central position of the nacelle tower connection the initial position of tmd will affect to some extent suppression of the turbine vibration if the z 1 direction of the turbine is taken as the positive and δ as the deviation amount of the initial installation location relative to the tower center then when δ 1 m 2 m 0 m 1 m 2 m as shown in fig 16 the dynamic response in three working conditions are respectively shown in fig 15 figs 16 and 17 in the starting condition when the deviation is negative namely the installation position deviates to the nacelle top the tower top displacement due to vibration increases slightly just as when the deviation is 0 when the deviation is positive namely the installation position deviates to the nacelle tail the tower top displacement and the tower root bending moment about y axis due to vibration increase obviously when the deviation is 1 m the displacement due to vibration increases by 1 66 times and the bending moment due to vibration increases by 1 27 times when the deviation is 2 m the displacement due to vibration increases by 2 06 times and the bending moment due to vibration increases by 1 97 times as shown in fig 15 in normal power generation condition the tower top displacement and the tower root bending moment about y axis due to vibration will relatively reduce regardless of whether the deviation is positive or negative as shown in fig 16 in the emergency shutdown condition no obvious reduction is observed as shown in fig 17 the initial installation position of tmd had better be at 0 1 m away from the center of the nacelle tower connection to the front end of the nacelle 7 3 evaluation of vibration suppression for offshore wind turbines optimized tmd is installed in the nacelle at the offset of 1 the simulation results are compared with fast parameter lackner et al 2010 as shown in fig 18 fig 19 according to the results after parameter optimization performance of vibration suppression is obviously better 18 42 under the starting condition 5 66 under the power generation condition and 68 30 under the emergency shutdown condition where tmd may act fast to suppress tower vibration caused by transient excitation 8 conclusions based on the multi body dynamics theory this paper has presented a tmd parameter optimization model based on system tmd coupled algorithm firstly the deformation of blades and tower based on the hypothetical modal representation secondly tmd is introduced through kane s equations to establish a fully coupled multi body dynamic model then it has applied an improved fish swarm algorithm for tmd parameter optimization of offshore wind turbines the analysis suggests that 1 as the tmd mass increases the suppression rate first rises fast and then slowly falls after reaching the maximum value as δ increases η also increases at first and then reduces a maximum value is present when μ 0 0125 δ reaches the optimal value 0 08 at this time the suppression rate is 42 84 when the tmd inherent frequency is close to the natural frequency 0 263 hz of the first fore aft support structure mode the suppression rate reaches its maximum value 2 optimal location for initial installation of tmd is within 0 1 m away from the tower base nacelle connection center to the front end of the nacelle after parameter optimization the tmd can realize a suppression rate of 68 30 with respect to tower top displacement under the shutdown condition credit authorship contribution statement yiming chen

coupled algorithm is proposed based on the multi body dynamics theory for a monopile offshore wind turbine hereby the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm is applied to optimize parameters and installation location of a tmd in terms of dynamic response and modal analysis the results show that when tmd inherent frequency approximates the first order inherent frequency of the tower front back bending moment vibration reduces to the maximum extent so does the nacelle acceleration in the frequency domain optimal installation location is within 0 1 m away from the center of the tower top nacelle connection toward the front end of the nacelle and the tmd after parameter optimization may function to reduce the tower top displacement by 68 30 under the shutdown condition keywords offshore wind turbine system tmd coupled algorithm tuned mass damper afsa vibration control 1 introduction currently there has been a sharp increase in offshore wind turbine owt projects around the world bigger is definitely better when it comes to offshore wind turbines and major components power ratings and rotor diameters have both grown dramatically over the past few years and while there are some questions over the logistics of much heavier nacelles or longer blades this trend looks set to continue considering the negative impact on structural health from ocean environment investigation of the dynamic characteristics of offshore wind turbines is urgently needed in recent years flexible modeling of owt system in complicated environments have been drawing growing attention compared with onshore wind turbines due to increasing size and flexibility offshore wind turbines are vulnerable to vibration sources resulted from wind wave combined excitations causing greater fatigue loads on the major parts such as blades and tower as well as contributing to increasing maintenance costs to control the dynamic response energy dissipation systems is a potential

how well tmd functioned to control vibration of offshore wind turbines and concluded that tmd could effectively suppress the wind turbine vibration conclusions were drawn that tmd inside the nacelle

by the aerodyn module based on blade element momentum theory and applied via fe 241 to the blades while rotor speed and pitch angle obtained by using simpack are fed back via fe 241 to aerodyn module for calculation of aerodynamic loads hydrodynamic load is calculated by hydrodyn module and applied via fe 244 to the plinth the control module acts through an external dynamic link library dll to realize variable pitch control and variable speed control while coupling the control system via the fe 243 controller interface to the structural system and transferring the turbine torque and blade

comparison are approximate which has validated the model 6 tmd parameters analysis there are many design load cases in iec61400 3 and the coverage is wide this paper selects the three most typical working cases during the service period of wind turbines for analysis namely power generation condition dlc 2 1 startup condition dlc 3 1 and emergency shutdown condition dlc 5 1 as shown in table 3 the mass ratio μ stiffness k and damping ratio δ of tmd can be adjusted to improve capability for absorbing vibration energy so as to reduce the vibration response of owts since vibration in longitudinal direction z 1 direction resulting from external excitations in first order front back bending moment current study only considers installation of tmd inside the nacelles along the longitudinal direction given standard deviation of tower top displacement in the longitudinal direction is largely related to the tower s fatigue load control objective function is defined as the suppression rate for the longitudinal standard deviation of tower top deflection 46 η j j t j 100 where j and j t respectively represent the longitudinal standard displacement deviation with and without vibration control tmd is initially located at the nacelle center with a travel limit of 8 m under emergency shutdown load case the wind speed is 12 m s the turbulence is rated c and the blade feathers by 8 s the mass of tmd used in construction engineering structures usually accounts for 0 5 2 of the mass of the main structure therefore under the same stiffness and damping 7 sets of comparison parameter groups m1 m7 are set as shown in table 4 stewart 2012 the result is shown in fig 8 when the mass ratio μ 0 0125 the amplitude of growth is the greatest when μ 0 0125 the amplitude of η growth obviously reduces as μ increases when μ changes from 0 01 to 0 0125 η increases by 15 4 and when μ changes from 0 0125 to 0 015 η only increases by 3 41 considering the practical engineering application the nacelle space and tmd cost etc this paper chooses μ 0 0125 at a certain frequency of tmd the damping is mainly affected by mass and damping ratio set the mass ratio range of 0 005 0 02 the damping ratio range of 0 02 0 2 and the stiffness of 70 sets of comparison parameters stewart and lackner 2014 as shown in table 5 and the results are shown in fig 9 when the value of μ 0 01 the growth rate of η decreases as δ increases when u 0 0125 and 0 0150 η increases first and then decreases as δ increases when μ 0 0125 δ reached the optimal value 0 08 at this time the suppression rate is 42 84 when μ is 0 0125 keep the damping constant the stiffness is in the range of 20000 62000 n m and set 8 groups of comparison parameters s1 s8 as shown in table 6 according to fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 when the stiffness is 32 000n m the suppression rate reaches the maximum value and the reduction amplitude of the nacelle acceleration in the frequency domain reaches the greatest extent at this time the tmd inherent frequency is close to the natural frequency 0 263 hz of the first fore aft support structure mode and the suppression rate reduces as the stiffness increases 7 tmd parameter optimization 7 1 tmd mass stiffness and damping coefficient optimization as new intelligent bionic optimization algorithm artificial fish swarm algorithm is widely used in system control and artificial intelligence et al however the artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa has its weakness in solving the problem of multi objective knapsack such as blindness search low speed of convergence and low accuracy in solution mehdiet al 2014 therefore an improved afsa has been used for optimization of tmd parameters in this paper afsa realizes optimization by simulating four behaviors of fish i e preying swarming following and moving basic principle of afsa is that fish always follow other fish to find the most nutritious places so it is possible to know that the fish number is the largest in the most nutritious area fig 13 shows the vision of an artificial fish in afsa current state of artificial fish is described as x x 1 x 2 x n x i represents the optimization variable nutrition concentration at the location of the artificial fish is expressed by using an objective function y f x the visual distance is represented by v the maximum moving step is represented by s t e p within the visual range it will randomly select a new position when the state at the visual position is better than the current state the artificial fish will move toward x n e x t by one step or otherwise it will continue searching the optimization process can be represented as 47 x i v x i v r a n d 48 x n e x t x x v x x v x s t e p r a n d when r a n d 0 and 1 are random behaviors of an artificial fish mainly include preying swarming following and moving 1 preying preying refers to continuing movement of an artificial fish toward area y of higher food concentration it is also an iterative behavior of moving toward a better area if the objective function value y j of x j is superior than that of x i then the artificial fish will move by one s t e p or otherwise it will randomly select another x j 49 x j x i v r a n d 50 x i t 1 x i t x j x i t x j x i t s t e p r a n d after multiple attempts the state of improvement required with respect to the objective function value fails to be satisfied the artificial fish will move by one step in a random direction 51 x i t 1 x i t v r a n d 2 swarming swarming refers to moving of an artificial fish to the center of a fish swarm and avoiding of overcrowding d i j x i x j is used to represent the distance between two artificial fish the number of artificial fish within the visual range d i j v and the central position are respectively represented by n f and x c if x c n f δ x i and x i x c δ is the preset degree of congestion 0 δ 1 it means food is sufficient and it is not highly crowded at the center therefore the artificial fish will move toward the center by one step 52 x i t 1 x i t x c x i t x c x i t s t e p r a n d otherwise the artificial fish will continue preying if n f 0 the artificial fish will also act to prey 3 following following refers to moving of an artificial fish swarm to the optimal individual artificial fish within the visual range to avoid overcrowding if x j n f δ x i and x i x j it means that food is sufficient and it is not highly crowded at x j in this case artificial fish at x i will move toward x j by one step 53 x i t 1 x i t x j x i t x j x i t s t e p r a n d otherwise the artificial fish will continue preying if n f 0 the artificial fish will also act to prey 4 moving moving refers to random movement of an artificial fish in water to seek for food and partners in a wider range it is a random movement when preying times of artificial fish reach the maximum and a better position is not found compared with other optimized algorithm differential evolution de performs better in solving complex global optimization problems mohamed 2017 at the late stage of afsa when multiple successive iterations have occurred the algorithm will stop optimization due to local optimums and information on the bulletin board will no longer be updated or fail to be timely updated to solve this problem crossover and mutation of de algorithm can be used namely when the bulletin board remains stagnant for a set time limit some artificial fish will be selected to implement crossover and mutation operations of the de algorithm and produce new individuals if the new state is superior to the previous state the bulletin board will be updated to the new state by this means the optimization algorithm will come out of the local optimum obsession fig 14 shows an embodiment of the afsa improvement process for the improved fish swarm algorithm the individual number is set to 150 the visual distance to 1 the crowd factor to 0 62 the number of attempts to 200 the crossover rate to 0 6 and the mutation rate to 0 01 the maximum iteration number is 200 and the step length is 0 5 the final optimal parameters are shown in table 7 7 2 parameter optimization for initial installation position of tmd in order to obtain accurate simulation results of the starting condition the first 30s are eliminated according to the actual engineering application in actual applications tmd is installed at the right central position of the nacelle tower connection the initial position of tmd will affect to some extent suppression of the turbine vibration if the z 1 direction of the turbine is taken as the positive and δ as the deviation amount of the initial installation location relative to the tower center then when δ 1 m 2 m 0 m 1 m 2 m as shown in fig 16 the dynamic response in three working conditions are respectively shown in fig 15 figs 16 and 17 in the starting condition when the deviation is negative namely the installation position deviates to the nacelle top the tower top displacement due to vibration increases slightly just as when the deviation is 0 when the deviation is positive namely the installation position deviates to the nacelle tail the tower top displacement and the tower root bending moment about y axis due to vibration increase obviously when the deviation is 1 m the displacement due to vibration increases by 1 66 times and the bending moment due to vibration increases by 1 27 times when the deviation is 2 m the displacement due to vibration increases by 2 06 times and the bending moment due to vibration increases by 1 97 times as shown in fig 15 in normal power generation condition the tower top displacement and the tower root bending moment about y axis due to vibration will relatively reduce regardless of whether the deviation is positive or negative as shown in fig 16 in the emergency shutdown condition no obvious reduction is observed as shown in fig 17 the initial installation position of tmd had better be at 0 1 m away from the center of the nacelle tower connection to the front end of the nacelle 7 3 evaluation of vibration suppression for offshore wind turbines optimized tmd is installed in the nacelle at the offset of 1 the simulation results are compared with fast parameter lackner et al 2010 as shown in fig 18 fig 19 according to the results after parameter optimization performance of vibration suppression is obviously better 18 42 under the starting condition 5 66 under the power generation condition and 68 30 under the emergency shutdown condition where tmd may act fast to suppress tower vibration caused by transient excitation 8 conclusions based on the multi body dynamics theory this paper has presented a tmd parameter optimization model based on system tmd coupled algorithm firstly the deformation of blades and tower based on the hypothetical modal representation secondly tmd is introduced through kane s equations to establish a fully coupled multi body dynamic model then it has applied an improved fish swarm algorithm for tmd parameter optimization of offshore wind turbines the analysis suggests that 1 as the tmd mass increases the suppression rate first rises fast and then slowly falls after reaching the maximum value as δ increases η also increases at first and then reduces a maximum value is present when μ 0 0125 δ reaches the optimal value 0 08 at this time the suppression rate is 42 84 when the tmd inherent frequency is close to the natural frequency 0 263 hz of the first fore aft support structure mode the suppression rate reaches its maximum value 2 optimal location for initial installation of tmd is within 0 1 m away from the tower base nacelle connection center to the front end of the nacelle after parameter optimization the tmd can realize a suppression rate of 68 30 with respect to tower top displacement under the shutdown condition credit authorship contribution statement yiming chen
