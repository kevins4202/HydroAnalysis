exhibited a tcm and dcan formation potential with the maximum yield of 6 44 and 0 94 respectively zhou et al 2014 it should be noted that the dominant dbps formed from the chlorination of above mentioned pharmaceuticals are cl dbps owing to the lack of bromine iodine source however the bromine in amb bro might serve as bromine source of br dbps which exhibit higher potential risk than their chlorinated analogues the formation characteristics of br dbps from brominated pharmaceuticals during chlorination are still unknown thus this study aimed to investigate the reactivity of chlorine with amb bro under different reaction scenarios reaction time chlorine doses and ph identify the emerging dbps by gas chromatography mass spectrum and evaluate the formation of emerging and regulated dbps during chlorination of amb bro this study is helpful for revealing the fate of amb and bro during the disinfection process and the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals against covid 19 in the perspective of dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials amb and bro standards 98 were purchased from macklin inc shanghai china free chlorine was prepared by diluting sodium hypochlorite solution active chlorine 5 supplied by shanghai aladdin inc shanghai china detailed information on amb and bro was listed in table s1 ultrapure water was produced by a millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mω cm ma usa the source of dbps standards were listed in table s2 all other chemicals were at least analytical grade and stocked from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments for amb bro degradation were conduct in a 250 ml amber bottle containing 200 ml amb or bro solution initial concentration 1 μm equipped with a constant temperature magnetic stirrer the ph of aqueous solution 5 9 was adjusted with 10 0 mm phosphate buffer or carbonate buffer to initiate experiments the pre determined free chlorine was added into the above mentioned bottle after the specific reaction period 1 0 ml of sample was withdrawn with syringe and quenched with equivalent stoichiometric sodium thiosulfate batch experiments for dbp formation were conducted in a 40 ml amber bottle containing 40 ml amb or bro solution initial concentration 20 μm the ph of aqueous solution 5 9 was adjusted with 10 0 mm phosphate buffer or carbonate buffer to initiate experiments the pre determined free chlorine was added into the above mentioned bottle after the specific reaction period 10 0 ml of sample was withdrawn with syringe and quenched with equivalent stoichiometric sodium thiosulfate to analyse the concentration of emerging and regulated dbps error bars of all figures in this study represented the relative standard deviation of two duplicates 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of target pharmaceuticals amb and bro were analysed via high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a uv vis detector shimadzu lc20 kyoto japan the separation of compound was performed on waters c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the detailed chromatographic operating parameters for the determination of amb and bro were listed in table s3 the concentration of free chlorine was determined via a hach pocket colorimeter tmii photometer loveland usa and hach n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate dpd free chlorine reagent thms and hans were analysed by a shimadzu qp2010 plus gc coupled with an electron capture detector kyoto japan emerging dbps generated from the chlorination of amb and bro were identified and analysed by a shimadzu qp2020 gc coupled with a mass spectrometer gc ms kyoto japan the detailed analytical method were shown in table s4 as eq 1 illustrated dbp yield was calculated as the molar ratio of the formed dbps to the initial amb and bro 1 dbp yield individual dbp molar concentration initial amb bro molar concentration 100 bsf refers to the role of bromide in the speciation of a certain class of dbps the bsf of thms and dihaloacetonitrile dhans were calculated as eq 2 in this study where n and m represented the number of the halogen and bromine respectively 2 bs f c x 3 r m 1 n m c h 3 n c l n m b r m r n m 0 n c h 3 n c l n m b r m r n 3 2 for thms and dhans respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of chlorine dose on the degradation of amb and bro the chlorination of amb and bro were conducted with chlorine dosage varying from 10 to 30 μm at ph 7 0 0 2 as shown in fig 1 a a linear relationship was illustrated between ln amb amb 0 and reaction time indicating the degradation of amb fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well similar tendency was found in the degradation of bro fig 1c which was common among the degradation of organic pollutants by chlorine deborde et al 2004 gallard et al 2004 xu et al 2009 as the dosage of chlorine elevated the degradation rate of amb under chlorination was increased 45 4 amb was degraded by 10 μm chlorine in 540 s and when the dosage of chlorine increased to 15 20 and 30 μm the degradation ratio of amb were 59 0 70 7 and 100 respectively this boosting effect of dose on the degradation of bro was more remarkable bro was completely degradated by 10 μm chlorine in less than 800 s which was degraded within 300 s under 30 μm chlorine 3 d amb d t k obs amb 4 ln amb 0 ln amb k obs t taking amb as an example whole chlorination could be depicted as eq 3 amb 0 and amb represent the initial dosage of amb and the concentration of amb in the reaction system at a certain time respectively kobs represents the pseudo first order reaction kinetics constant the relationship of kobs and the dosage of chlorine was shown in fig 1b the kobs linearly increased with the dosage of chlorine a linear formula was calculated as k obs 1 15 1 0 4 chlorine r2 0 99 this phenomenon were similar to previous studies deborde et al 2004 gallard et al 2004 xu et al 2009 thus eq 3 could be depicted as eq 5 kapp represents the second order reaction kinetics constant combining eqs 3 5 eq 6 was deduced thus kapp of amb and bro were calculated as k app amb 1 15 1 0 2 m 1 s 1 and k app bro 2 03 1 0 2 m 1 s 1 respectively 5 d amb d t k app amb hocl total 6 k obs k app hocl total 3 2 effect of ph on the degradation of amb and bro chlorine has three species in aqueous solution including cl2 hocl and ocl distributions of aqueous chlorine species are depended on the temperature and ph under typical water treatment conditions ph 6 9 cl2 can usually be neglected deborde and von gunten 2008 the reactivity of hocl with organic compound is different from that of ocl thus ph has a significant influence on the degradation of target pollutants it was well demonstrated that dissociation of chlorine and the reaction between chlorine and organic materials are highly related to the ph value of the solution dodd and huang 2007 as fig 2 a illustrated the ln amb amb 0 linearly increased with reaction time at different ph and the rate of degradation of amb was decreased as the ph 5 9 elevated 77 8 amb was degraded by 15 μm chlorine at ph 5 in 660 s with a kobs of 2 20 1 0 3 s 1 while the kobs of amb at ph 6 7 8 and 9 were decreased to 2 02 1 0 3 s 1 1 70 1 0 3 s 1 0 92 1 0 3 s 1 and 0 36 1 0 3 s 1 respectively the ph enhanced effect also worked in the reaction between bro and chlorine the degradation of bro were faster than amb for example at ph 5 kobs of bro was 3 44 1 0 3 s 1 almost 1 6 times that of amb the degradation of amb and bro by chlorine at various ph 5 9 were similar to these of ametryn xu et al 2009 3 3 formation of emerging dbps to reveal the pathway for the chlorination of amb and bro the transformation products were scanned via gc ms the detail method were included in table s4 surprisingly suspected 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline peaked in the chromatography column when the retention time was 32 55 min and 33 88 min respectively fig 3 a and 3b this discovery were confirmed by the retention time and mass spectrum of amb and bro standards figs 3c s1 and table s5 moreover the peak area of both 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline decreased gradually as the chlorination proceeded indicating that 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline were intermediate aromatic dbps during the chlorination of amb and bro this phenomenon was similar to the previous studies chuang et al 2015 hua et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 pan and zhang 2013 zhai and zhang 2011 which reported that some aromatic halogenated dbps were intermediate dbps that would further react with chlorine to form regulated aliphatic dbps such as thms and haloacetic acids haas as shown in the fig 4 the effect of chlorine dosage ph and contact time on the formation of 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline during chlorination of amb and bro were investigated like other intermediate dbps 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline have a short lifetime jiang et al 2020 as the chlorination proceeded the yield of these intermediate dbps shown a decrease trend which was similar to previous study jiang et al 2020 the yields of both 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline during chlorination of amb increased first and decreased as elevated chlorine dosage with the highest yield of 7 8 and 10 5 respectively when it comes to bro the yield of 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline peaked at a lower chlorine dosage cl2 bro 1 1 indicating again the higher reactivity with chlorine as shown in the above two section unlike amb trace 2 4 6 tribromoaniline was detected during chlorination of bro under various disinfection scenarios this phenomenon could be attributed to fact that 2 4 6 tribromoaniline was degraded by excessive disinfectant too fast and the lack of bromine under disinfection scenarios with excessive chlorine pan and zhang 2013 high ph had a negative effect on the yields of 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline for both amb and bro which could be explained by the hydrolysis under basic condition more attention should be paid to intermediate aromatic dbps especially during covid 19 pandemic intermediate aromatic dbps could be emerging pollutants in the receiving water environment during the covid 19 pandemic for the intensified disinfection scenarios and massive use of pharmaceuticals the intensified disinfection adopted by water treatment plants to block the spread of covid 19 could lead to the low dosage of residual chlorine in the receiving water environment which provides a rather suitable condition for the formation and persistence of these intermediate dbps chu et al 2021 3 4 formation of regulated thms and hans as shown in fig 5 a and 5d both amb and bro exhibited rather high dbp formation potential with the highest thms tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm yields of 25 7 and 40 7 respectively the yields of thms during the chlorination of amb and bro increased with the chlorine dosage the more chlorine involved in the chlorination of amb and bro the more thms formed until the chlorine dosage was enough this phenomenon was consisted with our previous study investigating the dbps formation from the chlorination of chloramphenicol ding et al 2018 bro exhibited higher thms yield than amb under the same chlorine dosage both amb and bro exhibited high yields of br dbps during the chlorination of both amb and bro in the absence of bromide bromate and bromine dbcm and tbm were major thms species for both amb and bro the highest yields of br thms from the chlorination of amb and bro were 23 8 and 37 8 respectively which were 1 2 order of magnitude higher than that of other pollutants for example the highest yield of br thms during the chlorination of 2 4 diaminobutyric acid in the presence of bromide is 1 3 luo et al 2020 during the chlorination of amb the yields of hans during the chlorination of amb increased from 0 06 to 0 8 with the molar ratio of cl2 amb increased from 1 to 6 and then decreased to 0 07 when the molar ratio of cl2 amb increased further to 15 similar tendency was found in the chlorination of bro which exhibited the highest hans yields of 0 5 the relationship between hans and chlorine dosage found in this study was similar to previous studies chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018 luo et al 2020 ye et al 2021 this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that hans were unstable and could react with excess chlorine glezer et al 1999 yu and reckhow 2015 bcan were main br hans species during the chlorination of amb and bro with the highest yields of 0 06 and 0 04 respectively this phenomenon was coincided with previous study ding et al 2019 overall the yields of hans were 1 2 orders of magnitude less than these of thms during the chlorination of both amb and bro which was similar to the chlorination of other pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps ding et al 2018 it was worrying that amb and bro exhibited the ultra high yields of br thms and br hans in the absence of bromide bromate and bromine the bsf of thms and dhans from the chlorination of amb and bro were shown in fig s2 as the chlorine dosage elevated the bsf of thms for amb increased from 58 8 to 71 5 first and then decreased to 61 0 a similar tendency was found in dhans which exhibited the highest bsf of 38 3 and 36 5 for amb and bro respectively this phenomenon was coincided with the relationship between br dbp formation and the chlorine dosage discussed above fig 5b and 5e presented that ph had a non negligible impact on the yields of dbps during the chlorination of amb and bro the yields of thms during the chlorination of both amb and bro shown a common tendency that increased steadily with the elevated ph the highest yields of thms from the chlorination of amb and bro was 16 4 and 35 7 respectively br thms were the dominant thms for both amb and bro at various ph as the ph elevated the yield of br thms during the chlorination of amb increased from 7 5 to 16 2 when it comes to bro the effect of ph on the yields of br thms was not as considerable as amb with the highest yield of 34 7 this difference could be attributed to the high reactivity of bro with chlorine the facilitation effect of ph on the thm yields during the chlorination of amb and bro were coincided with previous studies chu et al 2017 luo et al 2020 for basic condition facilitates the formation of thms besides the formation of br thms were less affected than tcm by the ph which was consisted with previous study about the reactivity of chlorine with nom in the presence of bromide hua and reckhow 2012 the effect of ph on the yields of hans was found to be opposite to those of thms during the chlorination of amb and bro the yields of hans during the chlorination of amb decreased from 1 8 to 0 3 as the ph increased from 6 to 9 for bro the yields of hans decreased from 1 2 to 0 1 the br hans were dominant han species for both amb and bro with the highest yield of 1 5 and 0 9 respectively at ph 6 similar phenomenon was found in our previous studies ding et al 2018 ding et al 2019 this negative effect of ph on the yields of hans during the chlorination of amb and bro could be attributed to the degradation of hans to form haas under basic condition reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 as solution ph elevated the bsf of thms from the chlorination of amb were increased from 71 9 to 86 3 fig s2 when it comes to bro the ph did not have an obvious effect on the bsf of thms indicating the competition between chlorine and bromide towards thms formation was not seriously affected by ph which was consisted with the previous study hua and reckhow 2012 the exposure of amb and bro to chlorine were closely related to the contact time it was obvious that the yields of thms increased with the contact time during the chlorination of amb and bro fig 5c and 5f moreover both amb and bro produced thms very fast in 6 h the yields of thms for amb and bro were 8 2 and 28 9 respectively regardless of the contact time br thms were dominant thm species bro exhibited higher yields of br thms 20 5 than that of amb 2 3 in 1 h indicating again its higher chlorine reactivity towards thms formation the variation of thms with contact time during the chlorination of amb and bro coinciding with other studies ding et al 2018 ding et al 2019 luo et al 2020 it was stunning that the amb and bro exhibited high yields of thms at the beginning of the chlorination the rapid formation of br thms during the chlorination of amb and bro were similar to the previous studies showing that bromine substitution with nom was faster than chlorine substitution towards thm formation hua and reckhow 2012 westerhoff et al 2004 as chlorination proceeded the yield of hans during the chlorination of amb increased from 0 21 to 1 2 first and then decreased to 0 8 while hans were produced steadily during the chlorination of bro with the highest yield of 0 5 amb and bro exhibited the highest br han yields of 0 9 and 0 4 respectively though the yields of br hans decreased during the chlorination of amb after 12 h br hans were the dominant han species for amb the yield of br hans increased with the contact time which became the main hans species during the chlorination of bro after 24 h this tendency of han formation found in the chlorination of amb could be explained by the higher reactivity towards hans and the degradation of hans which was also found in previous study ding et al 2018 contact time had a promotion effect on the bsf of hans but that of thms as the chlorination proceeded the bsf of thms were stable exceeding 65 during the chlorination of both amb and bro exhibiting that br thms were the dominant thms throughout the chlorination fig s2 bsf of thms were higher than that of dhans and the former did not fluctuate drastically with variation of chlorination scenarios like previous studies hua and reckhow 2012 zhang et al 2019 this phenomenon could be explained by it were easier to form br thms for the chlorination of amb and bro and thms were more stable than hans 4 conclusions the reaction of chlorine with amb bro were well described by a second order kinetics model first order in both amb bro and chlorine the second order rate reaction constant of amb and bro with chlorine at ph 7 0 were 1 15 102 m 1s 1 and 2 03 102 m 1s 1 respectively amb and bro were precursors of a new class of aromatic br dbps haloanilines 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline were detected as the emerging dbps during the chlorination of amb and bro like other intermediate dbps with ph and contact time elevated both 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline exhibited a decrease trend bromine in brominated organic compounds can greatly promote the formation of br dbps amb and bro produced remarkable br dbps during chlorination in the absence of additional bromide bromate and bromine demonstrating 1 2 order of magnitude of yields higher than that of other micropollutants with additional bromide bromate and bromine br thms were major thms species during the chlorination of both amb and bro with the highest yield of 23 8 and 37 8 respectively overall amb and bro would exhibit rather high thms and hans yields in the disinfection process considering the high toxicity of br dbps the use of amb and bro to against covid 19 or other respiratory diseases could pose a potential risk on ecological environment declaration

dbps during chlorination of amb bro this study is helpful for revealing the fate of amb and bro during the disinfection process and the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals against covid 19 in the perspective of dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials amb and bro standards 98 were purchased from macklin inc shanghai china free chlorine was prepared by diluting sodium hypochlorite solution

purification system 18 mω cm ma usa the source of dbps standards were listed in table s2 all other chemicals were at least analytical grade and stocked from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments for amb bro degradation were conduct in a 250 ml amber bottle containing 200 ml amb or bro solution initial concentration 1 μm equipped with a constant temperature magnetic stirrer the ph of aqueous solution 5 9 was adjusted with 10 0 mm phosphate buffer or carbonate buffer to initiate experiments the pre determined free chlorine was added into the above mentioned bottle after the specific reaction period 1 0 ml of sample was withdrawn with syringe and quenched with equivalent stoichiometric sodium thiosulfate batch experiments for dbp formation were conducted in a 40 ml amber bottle containing 40 ml amb or bro solution initial concentration 20 μm the ph of aqueous solution 5 9 was adjusted with 10 0 mm phosphate buffer or carbonate buffer to initiate experiments the pre determined free chlorine was added into the above mentioned bottle after the specific reaction period 10 0 ml of sample was withdrawn with syringe and quenched with equivalent stoichiometric sodium thiosulfate to analyse the concentration of emerging and regulated dbps error bars of all figures in this study represented the relative standard deviation of two duplicates 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of target pharmaceuticals amb and bro were analysed via high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a uv vis detector shimadzu lc20 kyoto japan the separation of compound was performed on waters c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the detailed chromatographic operating parameters for the determination of amb and bro were listed in table s3 the concentration of free chlorine was determined via a hach pocket colorimeter tmii photometer loveland usa and hach n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate dpd free chlorine reagent thms and hans were analysed by a shimadzu qp2010 plus gc coupled with an electron capture detector kyoto japan emerging dbps generated from the chlorination of amb and bro were identified and analysed by a shimadzu qp2020 gc coupled with a mass spectrometer gc ms kyoto japan the detailed analytical method were shown in table s4 as eq 1 illustrated dbp yield was calculated as the molar ratio of the formed dbps to the initial amb and bro 1 dbp yield individual dbp molar concentration initial amb bro molar concentration 100 bsf refers to the role of bromide in the speciation of a certain class of dbps the bsf of thms and dihaloacetonitrile dhans were calculated as eq 2 in this study where n and m represented the number of the halogen and bromine respectively 2 bs f c x 3 r m 1 n m c h 3 n c l n m b r m r n m 0 n c h 3 n c l n m b r m r n 3 2 for thms and dhans respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of chlorine dose on the degradation of amb and bro the chlorination of amb and bro were conducted with chlorine dosage varying from 10 to 30 μm at ph 7 0 0 2 as shown in fig 1 a a linear relationship was illustrated between ln amb amb 0 and reaction time indicating the degradation of amb fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well similar tendency was found in the degradation of bro fig 1c which was common among the degradation of organic pollutants by chlorine deborde et al 2004 gallard et al 2004 xu et al 2009 as the dosage of chlorine elevated the degradation rate of amb under chlorination was increased 45 4 amb was degraded by 10 μm chlorine in 540 s and when the dosage of chlorine increased to 15 20 and 30 μm the degradation ratio of amb were 59 0 70 7 and 100 respectively this boosting effect of dose on the degradation of bro was more remarkable bro was completely degradated by 10 μm chlorine in less than 800 s which was degraded within 300 s under 30 μm chlorine 3 d amb d t k obs amb 4 ln amb 0 ln amb k obs t taking amb as an example whole chlorination could be depicted as eq 3 amb 0 and amb represent the initial dosage of amb and the concentration of amb in the reaction system at a certain time respectively kobs represents the pseudo first order reaction kinetics constant the relationship of kobs and the dosage of chlorine was shown in fig 1b the kobs linearly increased with the dosage of chlorine a linear formula was calculated as k obs 1 15 1 0 4 chlorine r2 0 99 this phenomenon were similar to previous studies deborde et al 2004 gallard et al 2004 xu et al 2009 thus eq 3 could be depicted as eq 5 kapp represents the second order reaction kinetics constant combining eqs 3 5 eq 6 was deduced thus kapp of amb and bro were calculated as k app amb 1 15 1 0 2 m 1 s 1 and k app bro 2 03 1 0 2 m 1 s 1 respectively 5 d amb d t k app amb hocl total 6 k obs k app hocl total 3 2 effect of ph on the degradation of amb and bro chlorine has three species in aqueous solution including cl2 hocl and ocl distributions of aqueous chlorine species are depended on the temperature and ph under typical water treatment conditions ph 6 9 cl2 can usually be neglected deborde and von gunten 2008 the reactivity of hocl with organic compound is different from that of ocl thus ph has a significant influence on the degradation of target pollutants it was well demonstrated that dissociation of chlorine and the reaction between chlorine and organic materials are highly related to the ph value of the solution dodd and huang 2007 as fig 2 a illustrated the ln amb amb 0 linearly increased with reaction time at different ph and the rate of degradation of amb was decreased as the ph 5 9 elevated 77 8 amb was degraded by 15 μm chlorine at ph 5 in 660 s with a kobs of 2 20 1 0 3 s 1 while the kobs of amb at ph 6 7 8 and 9 were decreased to 2 02 1 0 3 s 1 1 70 1 0 3 s 1 0 92 1 0 3 s 1 and 0 36 1 0 3 s 1 respectively the ph enhanced effect also worked in the reaction between bro and chlorine the degradation of bro were faster than amb for example at ph 5 kobs of bro was 3 44 1 0 3 s 1 almost 1 6 times that of amb the degradation of amb and bro by chlorine at various ph 5 9 were similar to these of ametryn xu et al 2009 3 3 formation of emerging dbps to reveal the pathway for the chlorination of amb and bro the transformation products were scanned via gc ms the detail method were included in table s4 surprisingly suspected 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline peaked in the chromatography column when the retention time was 32 55 min and 33 88 min respectively fig 3 a and 3b this discovery were confirmed by the retention time and mass spectrum of amb and bro standards figs 3c s1 and table s5 moreover the peak area of both 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline decreased gradually as the chlorination proceeded indicating that 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline were intermediate aromatic dbps during the chlorination of amb and bro this phenomenon was similar to the previous studies chuang et al 2015 hua et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 pan and zhang 2013 zhai and zhang 2011 which reported that some aromatic halogenated dbps were intermediate dbps that would further react with chlorine to form regulated aliphatic dbps such as thms and haloacetic acids haas as shown in the fig 4 the effect of chlorine dosage ph and contact time on the formation of 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline during chlorination of amb and bro were investigated like other intermediate dbps 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline have a short lifetime jiang et al 2020 as the chlorination proceeded the yield of these intermediate dbps shown a decrease trend which was similar to previous study jiang et al 2020 the yields of both 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline during chlorination of amb increased first and decreased as elevated chlorine dosage with the highest yield of 7 8 and 10 5 respectively when it comes to bro the yield of 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline peaked at a lower chlorine dosage cl2 bro 1 1 indicating again the higher reactivity with chlorine as shown in the above two section unlike amb trace 2 4 6 tribromoaniline was detected during chlorination of bro under various disinfection scenarios this phenomenon could be attributed to fact that 2 4 6 tribromoaniline was degraded by excessive disinfectant too fast and the lack of bromine under disinfection scenarios with excessive chlorine pan and zhang 2013 high ph had a negative effect on the yields of 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline for both amb and bro which could be explained by the hydrolysis under basic condition more attention should be paid to intermediate aromatic dbps especially during covid 19 pandemic intermediate aromatic dbps could be emerging pollutants in the receiving water environment during the covid 19 pandemic for the intensified disinfection scenarios and massive use of pharmaceuticals the intensified disinfection adopted by water treatment plants to block the spread of covid 19 could lead to the low dosage of residual chlorine in the receiving water environment which provides a rather suitable condition for the formation and persistence of these intermediate dbps chu et al 2021 3 4 formation of regulated thms and hans as shown in fig 5 a and 5d both amb and bro exhibited rather high dbp formation potential with the highest thms tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm yields of 25 7 and 40 7 respectively the yields of thms during the chlorination of amb and bro increased with the chlorine dosage the more chlorine involved in the chlorination of amb and bro the more thms formed until the chlorine dosage was enough this phenomenon was consisted with our previous study investigating the dbps formation from the chlorination of chloramphenicol ding et al 2018 bro exhibited higher thms yield than amb under the same chlorine dosage both amb and bro exhibited high yields of br dbps during the chlorination of both amb and bro in the absence of bromide bromate and bromine dbcm and tbm were major thms species for both amb and bro the highest yields of br thms from the chlorination of amb and bro were 23 8 and 37 8 respectively which were 1 2 order of magnitude higher than that of other pollutants for example the highest yield of br thms during the chlorination of 2 4 diaminobutyric acid in the presence of bromide is 1 3 luo et al 2020 during the chlorination of amb the yields of hans during the chlorination of amb increased from 0 06 to 0 8 with the molar ratio of cl2 amb increased from 1 to 6 and then decreased to 0 07 when the molar ratio of cl2 amb increased further to 15 similar tendency was found in the chlorination of bro which exhibited the highest hans yields of 0 5 the relationship between hans and chlorine dosage found in this study was similar to previous studies chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018 luo et al 2020 ye et al 2021 this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that hans were unstable and could react with excess chlorine glezer et al 1999 yu and reckhow 2015 bcan were main br hans species during the chlorination of amb and bro with the highest yields of 0 06 and 0 04 respectively this phenomenon was coincided with previous study ding et al 2019 overall the yields of hans were 1 2 orders of magnitude less than these of thms during the chlorination of both amb and bro which was similar to the chlorination of other pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps ding et al 2018 it was worrying that amb and bro exhibited the ultra high yields of br thms and br hans in the absence of bromide bromate and bromine the bsf of thms and dhans from the chlorination of amb and bro were shown in fig s2 as the chlorine dosage elevated the bsf of thms for amb increased from 58 8 to 71 5 first and then decreased to 61 0 a similar tendency was found in dhans which exhibited the highest bsf of 38 3 and 36 5 for amb and bro respectively this phenomenon was coincided with the relationship between br dbp formation and the chlorine dosage discussed above fig 5b and 5e presented that ph had a non negligible impact on the yields of dbps during the chlorination of amb and bro the yields of thms during the chlorination of both amb and bro shown a common tendency that increased steadily with the elevated ph the highest yields of thms from the chlorination of amb and bro was 16 4 and 35 7 respectively br thms were the dominant thms for both amb and bro at various ph as the ph elevated the yield of br thms during the chlorination of amb increased from 7 5 to 16 2 when it comes to bro the effect of ph on the yields of br thms was not as considerable as amb with the highest yield of 34 7 this difference could be attributed to the high reactivity of bro with chlorine the facilitation effect of ph on the thm yields during the chlorination of amb and bro were coincided with previous studies chu et al 2017 luo et al 2020 for basic condition facilitates the formation of thms besides the formation of br thms were less affected than tcm by the ph which was consisted with previous study about the reactivity of chlorine with nom in the presence of bromide hua and reckhow 2012 the effect of ph on the yields of hans was found to be opposite to those of thms during the chlorination of amb and bro the yields of hans during the chlorination of amb decreased from 1 8 to 0 3 as the ph increased from 6 to 9 for bro the yields of hans decreased from 1 2 to 0 1 the br hans were dominant han species for both amb and bro with the highest yield of 1 5 and 0 9 respectively at ph 6 similar phenomenon was found in our previous studies ding et al 2018 ding et al 2019 this negative effect of ph on the yields of hans during the chlorination of amb and bro could be attributed to the degradation of hans to form haas under basic condition reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 as solution ph elevated the bsf of thms from the chlorination of amb were increased from 71 9 to 86 3 fig s2 when it comes to bro the ph did not have an obvious effect on the bsf of thms indicating the competition between chlorine and bromide towards thms formation was not seriously affected by ph which was consisted with the previous study hua and reckhow 2012 the exposure of amb and bro to chlorine were closely related to the contact time it was obvious that the yields of thms increased with the contact time during the chlorination of amb and bro fig 5c and 5f moreover both amb and bro produced thms very fast in 6 h the yields of thms for amb and bro were 8 2 and 28 9 respectively regardless of the contact time br thms were dominant thm species bro exhibited higher yields of br thms 20 5 than that of amb 2 3 in 1 h indicating again its higher chlorine reactivity towards thms formation the variation of thms with contact time during the chlorination of amb and bro coinciding with other studies ding et al 2018 ding et al 2019 luo et al 2020 it was stunning that the amb and bro exhibited high yields of thms at the beginning of the chlorination the rapid formation of br thms during the chlorination of amb and bro were similar to the previous studies showing that bromine substitution with nom was faster than chlorine substitution towards thm formation hua and reckhow 2012 westerhoff et al 2004 as chlorination proceeded the yield of hans during the chlorination of amb increased from 0 21 to 1 2 first and then decreased to 0 8 while hans were produced steadily during the chlorination of bro with the highest yield of 0 5 amb and bro exhibited the highest br han yields of 0 9 and 0 4 respectively though the yields of br hans decreased during the chlorination of amb after 12 h br hans were the dominant han species for amb the yield of br hans increased with the contact time which became the main hans species during the chlorination of bro after 24 h this tendency of han formation found in the chlorination of amb could be explained by the higher reactivity towards hans and the degradation of hans which was also found in previous study ding et al 2018 contact time had a promotion effect on the bsf of hans but that of thms as the chlorination proceeded the bsf of thms were stable exceeding 65 during the chlorination of both amb and bro exhibiting that br thms were the dominant thms throughout the chlorination fig s2 bsf of thms were higher than that of dhans and the former did not fluctuate drastically with variation of chlorination scenarios like previous studies hua and reckhow 2012 zhang et al 2019 this phenomenon could be explained by it were easier to form br thms for the chlorination of amb and bro and thms were more stable than hans 4 conclusions the reaction of chlorine with amb bro were well described by a second order kinetics model first order in both amb bro and chlorine the second order rate reaction constant of amb and bro with chlorine at ph 7 0 were 1 15 102 m 1s 1 and 2 03 102 m 1s 1 respectively amb and bro were precursors of a new class of aromatic br dbps haloanilines 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline were detected as the emerging dbps during the chlorination of amb and bro like other intermediate dbps with ph and contact time elevated both 2 chloro 4 6 dibromoaniline and 2 4 6 tribromoaniline exhibited a decrease trend bromine in brominated organic compounds can greatly promote the formation of br dbps amb and bro produced remarkable br dbps during chlorination in the absence of additional bromide bromate and bromine demonstrating 1 2 order of magnitude of yields higher than that of other micropollutants with additional bromide bromate and bromine br thms were major thms species during the chlorination of both amb and bro with the highest yield of 23 8 and 37 8 respectively overall amb and bro would exhibit rather high thms and hans yields in the disinfection process considering the high toxicity of br dbps the use of amb and bro to against covid 19 or other respiratory diseases could pose a potential risk on ecological environment declaration

bicarbonates calcium salts etc are more available environment friendly and easily dispersed for membrane construction in the past two decades a variety of salt additives have been increasingly introduced into the fabrication procedure of ip made tfc membranes and proven to be effective for tailoring membrane properties and improving the membrane performance despite several excellent review articles about the additives for fabricating tfc membranes published in recent years their interests mainly focused on nanomaterials lau et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 or macromolecules nasrollahi et al 2022 partial salt additives were introduced briefly in a few reviews gohil and ray 2017 lau et al 2012 li et al 2021 which however did not cover many progresses achieved very recently and the mechanisms of various salt additives and the resultant membrane properties were not discussed in detail moreover there is lack of comparative and critical analysis to connect salt additives types with membrane performance and potential applications hindering the efficient use of salt additives for advanced membrane development based on the above this review aims to for the first time summarize the research progress in various salt additives used to tailor properties and performance of tfc membranes for water treatment salt additives as described herein are compounds consisting of an ionic assembly of cations and anions not including acids alkalis and non ionic additives most of which show great solubility in water or other polar solvents gold 2019 in the following sections we first provide a brief overview of the development of salt additives for tfc membrane preparation with a summary of their effects and underlying mechanisms by classifying salt additives into organic and inorganic salts the roles of added salt additives in the ip process and the induced changes in membrane structure properties and performance are then discussed in detail efforts are also made to analyze the commonalities and differences of these salt based strategies and to critically understand some seemingly contradictory findings in similar studies using salt additives of the same kind moreover the potential applications and future research directions on salt additives for membrane preparation are discussed this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of salt additives in tailoring tfc membranes and offers novel insights on the development of advanced membranes for water treatment 2 development of salt additives for tfc membrane fabrication as early as 1959 morgan and kwolek experimented with the addition of inorganic salts into the aqueous phase during the ip process and found that salts particularly neutral salts promoted the partition of diamine towards the organic phase morgan and kwolek 1959 it was inferred that inorganic salts could generate a change in the amount of reactant diamine as well as salting out effects however this discovery went unnoticed by the water treatment field for a long time afterwards as the 21st century has seen a boom in the development of membranes for water treatment more and more researchers have become interested in salt additives for tfc membrane preparation fig 1 from 2000 to 2010 research on tailoring membranes by salt additives focused on phase transfer catalysts ptcs and surfactants since 2010 research of inorganic salt additives has been on the rise with the regulatory mechanisms of inorganic salts such as bicarbonate gradually being understood in recent years advanced characterization and simulation techniques have allowed more mechanisms underlying the roles of salt additives in membrane formation to be explored in depth during the ip process for tfc membrane preparation salt additives are commonly pre loaded on substrates blended in aqueous or organic monomer solutions and to a lesser degree introduced into the post treatment process in brief organic salt additives usually have a large influence on the cross linking degree surface morphology and pore size of the selective layer through their interactions with the substrate amine monomers and pa networks inorganic salts can regulate all aspects of the properties of the membrane through ionic effects with monomers or polyamides and non ionic effects including generation of nanobubbles and crystals fig 2 the use of salt additives has been demonstrated to not only improve the water solute selectivity of membranes but also contribute to more precise solute solute separation other membrane performance e g antifouling properties can be enhanced as well through the proper utilization of salt additives table 1 the utilization way regulation effects and mechanisms and of each type of salt additives are discussed in detail in the following section 3 regulation mechanisms and effects of salt additives 3 1 organic salts organic salts are a class of salts composed of organic cations or organic anions as additives organic salts act mainly through specific functions of the organic component based on the primary function two types of organic salt additives i e ionic surfactants and ptcs should be discussed 3 1 1 ionic surfactants surfactants are commonly water soluble surface active agents consisting of a hydrophobic part usually a long alkyl chain and a hydrophilic ionic polar group surfactants can be divided into ionic surfactants and non ionic surfactants and both of them have been utilized as additives to regulate the ip process adding surfactants in the aqueous phase affects the retention of aqueous solution in the substrate and consequently the amine monomer concentration in the reaction zone during the ip process moreover the addition of surfactants in either the aqueous or organic phase can directly change the interactions between monomers in this paper focus was mainly put on ionic surfactants considering the review scope of salt additives 3 1 1 1 inter strand repulsion among ionic surfactants the most frequently used anionic and cationic surfactants are sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab respectively mansourpanah et al investigated the effect of sds and ctab on the morphology and performance of tfc nanofiltration membranes mansourpanah et al 2011 2009 with the addition of sds and ctab in organic phase the hydrophobic groups of the surfactant tended to integrate with the pa matrix to form surfactant polymer complexes and the hydrophilic groups were mutually repulsive increasing the free volume of the membrane and resulting in a high water permeance azarteimour et al 2016 mansourpanah et al 2009 rahimpour et al 2007 the effect of ionic surfactants added in the aqueous monomer solution could be different it was found that the pure water permeance of the membrane increased with the addition of sds to the aqueous phase while ctab showed no significant influence on membrane performance mansourpanah et al 2011 this could be due to the poor solubility of ctab in aqueous solution resulting in less ctab molecules involved in the ip reaction to produce free volume in pa matrix yung et al 2010 since the surfactant polymer complexes can be formed in the organic phase where the ip reaction zone is located adding ionic surfactants to the organic phase is considered more conducive to generating more free volume and achieving higher membrane water permeance 3 1 1 2 substrate wetting addition of surfactants can also regulate the retention of aqueous monomers by the substrate and thus affect the subsequent ip reaction some researchers have explored the addition of surfactants in the aqueous phase and concluded that surfactants could enhance the wetting of substrate surface fig 3 a ang et al 2020 azizi and sharif 2019 hermans et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 liang et al 2020 jiang et al elucidated the mechanisms underlying the effect of surfactants on the behavior of aqueous phase through dissipative particle dynamics simulation with the addition of surfactants in the aqueous phase a thicker aqueous layer was retained on the substrate surface when contacting with the organic solution the aqueous layer shrank driven by the imbalance of the interfacial tension at this stage water molecules converged above the substrate pores forming a discrete aqueous microphase and meanwhile the ip reaction occurred to generate a rough polyamide film on top of the aqueous microphase fig 3d jiang et al 2019 the rougher membrane surface induced by the surfactant can enlarge the effective filtration area and thus increase the water permeance fig 3b jiang et al 2019 on the other hand enhanced wetting of substrates by surfactants can also make the aqueous phase penetrate deeper into the surface pores of the commonly hydrophobic supports and slow down the diffusion of aqueous monomers during the subsequent ip reaction this could create a bottleneck effect i e intrusion of the formed pa film into substrate pores which decreases the water permeance of membranes ghosh and hoek 2009 yang et al 2018 therefore during membrane manufacturing the addition of surfactants should be combined with the selection of a substrate with suitable pore size and hydrophilicity to achieve the optimal performance of resultant tfc membranes 3 1 1 3 cross interface diffusion regulation in addition to the role of wetting substrate surface sds was also added into the aqueous solution in order to regulate the cross interface diffusion of amine monomers fang et al 2013 hermans et al 2014 khorshidi et al 2017 lau et al 2012 morgan and kwolek 1959 sarkar et al 2020 as a surfactant sds can lower the interfacial tension of the water hexane interface which largely affects the concentration of aqueous monomers diffusing to the organic phase for the polymerization reaction ghosh et al 2008 specifically the lowered interfacial tension by the addition of sds can lead to more rapid cross interface diffusion of amine monomers into the organic phase and thus high concentrations of amine in the reaction zone accelerating the polymerization rate the more violent reaction increases the surface roughness of the resultant selective layer contributing to the increase of water permeance cui et al 2014 studies conducted by park et al suggested that with the addition of sds in the m phenylenediamine mpd solution the ridge and valley morphology of the selective layer became more pronounced fig 3c and both surface roughness and apparent thickness of the pa film increased simultaneously hermans et al 2014 park et al 2018a 2018b sarkar et al 2020 it has been known that a larger thickness of the selective layer impairs membrane water permeate due to the larger transport resistance while the increased surface roughness can provide more effective filtration area contributing to higher permeance therefore the authors attributed the improved water permeance by the addition of sds to the increased membrane surface roughness that overwhelmed the adverse effect of the increased thickness park et al 2018b nevertheless the variation in thickness of the selective layer may need to be more critically analyzed since the effective thickness rather than the apparent thickness is critical to the water flux fridman bishop and freger 2017 you et al 2021 the fully aromatic pa selective layer of tfc membranes generally consists of a dense region and abundant voids and only the former determines the effective thickness of the selective layer the enhanced water permeance of the sds modified membranes could be jointly enabled by the enlarged surface filtration area and reduced effective thickness of pa films despite an increased apparent thickness of the selective layer recent research by liang et al provides a different perspective regarding the effect of ionic surfactants on the interfacial diffusion of amine monomers referred to as surfactant assembly regulated interfacial polymerization sarip fig 4 a liang et al 2020 during the sarip process a self assembled network of amphiphiles was created at the water hexane interface via the addition of sds in the aqueous phase eastoe and dalton 2000 han et al 2022 liang et al 2020 yang et al 2022 the highly regular interfacial network controlled the transport of aqueous monomers across the interface forming a pa active layer with a highly uniform pore size distribution liang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021b the results of molecular dynamics md simulation further demonstrated the regulation mechanism that an appropriate addition of surfactants led to the formation of a dynamic interfacial network fig 4d the surfactant network not only promoted the accumulation of aqueous monomers near the interface via electrostatic attraction but also enabled the rapid diffusion and even distribution of monomers due to the reduced energy barrier compared to the control membrane obtained by conventional ip the surfactant modulated membrane had a smaller pore size and a more uniform pore size distribution as well as a rougher membrane surface thus achieving a highly precise separation without sacrificing water permeance the increased surface roughness of the pa membrane based on sarip resulted from the enhanced wetting of the porous substrate by sds as introduced above which was further confirmed by the smoother surface of the free standing pa film synthesized by sarip compared to conventional ip fig 4b c it can be found that various studies may yield different results and even opposite explanations with regard to the regulation of interfacial polymerization by adding ionic surfactants the partial reason for this contradiction could be that the conditions e g monomers substrates types of surfactants and addition positions for membrane preparation used in independent studies investigating the role of surfactants were different more importantly previous focuses have commonly put on only one of the several influence mechanisms of ionic surfactants for the ip process for example some ionic surfactants are expected to reduce the interfacial tension and promote the diffusion of aqueous monomers thus increasing the crosslinking degree of selective layers while the same kind of surfactants can also form surfactant polymer complexes to decrease the crosslinking degree of pa matrix moreover the enhanced wetting of substrates by surfactants tends to result in a selective layer with rougher surface but the self assembled network of surfactants at the aqueous organic interface has the effect of reducing the membrane surface roughness as well therefore distinct results of membrane performance variation are possible to occur due to the competition of different mechanisms more efforts should be made in future research to distinguish and better exploit the combined effects of ionic surfactant additives for enhancing membrane performance in addition reasonable selection of surfactants should be taken seriously by considering the hydrophile lipophile balance hlb and the critical micelle concentration cmc of surfactants a surfactant with larger hlb value is more hydrophilic and more soluble in the aqueous phase davis 1994 at aqueous solution surfactant concentrations greater than the cmc surfactant molecules tend to aggregate to form micelles conversely surfactants can be fully dispersed in the aqueous phase some of the phase parameters including temperature solvent type and monomer concentration will also affect the cmc of the surfactant demissie et al 2021 park and bielefeldt 2003 therefore in order to achieve the optimal regulation effects it is of significance to choose surfactants with appropriate hlb values large hlb value for substrate wetting and cross interface diffusion regulation while small hlb value for inter strand repulsion it is also necessary to choose surfactants with high cmc and determine the actual cmc of the used surfactant in aqueous or organic phase so as to ensure the added surfactant concentration lower than the cmc level 3 1 2 phase transfer catalysts ptcs phase transfer catalysts are widely used in organic synthesis reactions between immiscible phases e g transferring reactive monomers from the aqueous into the organic phase where the reaction occurs naik and doraiswamy 1998 schnell et al used ptcs for polycarbonate preparation by the ip reaction in the early 1950 s morgan 1981 schnell 1956 in 1970s starks proposed the famous catalytic cycle principle for the sn2 nucleophilic substitution reaction in the liquid liquid system laying the theoretical foundation of phase transfer catalysis starks 1971 the ip reaction for membrane pa layer synthesis is a typical sn2 nucleophilic substitution reaction where the nucleophile i e amine monomers transfers from the aqueous phase to the organic phase and attacks the carbonyl carbon of acyl chloride monomers fig 5 morgan and kwolek 1959 during the ip process ptcs can react with aqueous monomers to form a new ion pair with higher organic affinity and reactivity consequently accelerating the rate of polymerization according to the two basic requirements proposed by starks and liotta starks and liotta 1978 ptcs must have sufficient organic cationic structure to partition the nucleophile into the organic phase and the cation anion bonding should be loose enough to ensure high anionic reactivity as such onium salts i e ammonium and phosphonium salts have been discovered as ptcs and become most widely used in industry naik and doraiswamy 1998 jegal et al explored the addition of three kinds of ammonium salts including triethyl benzyl ammonium bromide tebab trimethyl benzyl ammonium bromide tmbab and triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride tebac as ptcs to prepare ip based membranes jegal et al 2002 the results showed that by increasing membrane surface roughness tebab provided a significant increase in the water permeance without sacrificing the rejection of organics by the tfc membrane however tmbab and tebac turned out to have no obvious effect on the performance of the resultant pa membranes indicating that the effective and beneficial regulation of ip required appropriate ptcs this difference in effects among the three ptcs might be due to the fact that tebab had more organic structures than tmbab and weaker cation anion bonding than tebac which was more favorable for the amine monomers to be paired with the cations of ptcs and transferred into the organic phase for participating in the reaction starks and liotta 1978 qiu et al investigated the effects of mass fraction of the catalysts to mpd monomers on the water permeance and rejection performance of prepared membranes when the mpd concentration was 1 2 and 2 w v respectively qiu et al 2009 at the high mpd concentration the added ptc increased membrane water permeance by up to nearly 50 when the concentration of mpd was lower the ptc led to a significant enhancement in both water permeance and nacl rejection of membranes this was because the efficacy of ptc was more prominent in accelerating the relatively slow interfacial diffusion of monomers at the lower mpd concentration which distinctly promoted the ip reaction and improved the permselectivity of the membrane moreover xiang et al fabricated a series of tfc membranes using ammonium salts with different molecular structures and molecular weights as ptcs xiang et al 2013 the results indicated that the surface roughness and the crosslinking degree of the prepared membranes was increased with the molecular weight of cationic amine groups of ptcs further research by the same team discovered that the ammonium salt containing a larger cationic size could more efficiently facilitate the transport of piperazine pip monomers resulting in a thicker and rougher pa layer and increasing the nacl rejection by the membrane xiang et al 2014 it is also suggested that the water absorbing water ability of catalysts should be considered for the selection of ptcs which could affect the membrane structural stability by influencing the adhesion between the substrate and the selective layer ptcs have undergone rapid development over the decades as a practical methodology for organic synthesis and proved to be a useful tool for transcending phase barriers in heterogeneous systems naik and doraiswamy 1998 ooi and maruoka 2007 however there were few studies on the use of ptcs to modulate the ip process for membrane fabrication recent efforts in this regard have made some progress but there is still a lack of systematic studies to distinguish the catalytic effect of ptcs on the ip reaction from other interfering effects for example some ammonium salts used as ptcs can simultaneously play a role of surfactants to lower the interfacial tension xiang et al 2014 therefore further investigation is needed to verify the catalytic role of ptcs and elaborate the influence factors of catalytic efficiency based on which more rational selection and efficient application of ptcs for tfc membrane preparation can be achieved 3 2 inorganic salts the pioneer work of morgan and kwolek morgan and kwolek 1959 first found the inorganic salts added in the aqueous phase during the ip process could generate a change in the amount of reactant diamine as well as salting out effects further research has revealed that some ions also have features that can be used to improve the water permeance solute selectivity and antifouling performance of ip made membranes for example some metal cations e g ca2 mg2 etc are able to regulate the interfacial diffusion of the aqueous monomers by interacting with their amine or hydroxyl groups during the ip process thus affecting the properties of the resultant membrane in addition some inorganic salts e g bicarbonate have efficacy in regulating the structure of membrane selective layers by creating co2 nanobubbles or salt crystals herein the effects of inorganic salt additives are divided into two main categories i e ionic and nonionic effects 3 2 1 ionic effects salts containing cations and anions of equal charges can influence the ip process via ionic interactions in the monomer solution these influences include regulation of aqueous monomer diffusion metal ion carboxyl group interactions and metal ion amide group interactions early studies by morgan and kwolek presented the effects of nacl on the ip reaction while there was no detailed explanation for the influence mechanisms morgan and kwolek 1959 in the field of tfc membrane preparation tang et al demonstrated that the addition of libr into the aqueous phase increased the reactivity of the hydroxyl groups of triethanolamine or n methyl diethanolamine monomers with the acyl chloride groups of trimesoyl chloride tmc during the ip process tang et al 2010 more specifically li could break the hydrogen bonds between aqueous monomers and thus increase the free monomers as well as their reactivity which led to the formation of a denser selective layer however confirmed by the ftir characterization li could also form a complex with tmc through the ion dipole interaction lai et al 1992 to activate the carbonyl groups thus accelerating the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride groups of tmc and resulting in a hydrophilic and looser selective layer therefore the water permeance and salt rejections of the prepared polyester membrane could be flexibly adjusted by varying the addition content of libr focusing on regulation of aqueous monomer diffusion jiang s team studied the ionic effects of inorganic salt addition on the ip process and membrane structure by using phytic acid dodecasodium salt pads zhang et al 2022 nuclear magnetic resonance proved that pads could inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers by electrostatic interactions thus significantly reducing the thickness of pa layers the optimal membrane showed a simultaneously high water permeance and na2so4 rejection fan et al used cacl2 in the aqueous phase to regulate the ip process and investigate the metal ion carboxyl group interactions fan et al 2014 the complexation of ca2 with the carbonyl in the tmc molecule could accelerate the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride groups of tmc and finally enhance membrane water permeance the chorine resistant performance of the membrane was also found to be improved which was claimed to result from the strong electron withdrawing effect of ca2 on carbonyl but needed more investigation and validation moreover hao et al found that the addition of ca2 into the mpd solution formed stable intrabridges of carboxyl groups in the selective layer hao et al 2019a this intrabridging effect could shield carboxyl groups and minimize their exposure to divalent metal ions in the feed water and thus reducing the formation of foulant metal membrane interbridges besides ca2 was also expected to weaken the degassing behavior of co2 from the aqueous solution during pa film formation and affect the hydrogen bonding of the resultant polymer with water molecules which consequently gave rise to a smooth and hydrophilic membrane surface membrane fouling and cleaning experiments confirmed these ca2 modified membranes had better antifouling performance han et al 2020 hao et al 2019a 2019b zhu et al 2020 the metal ion carboxyl group interactions could be also employed by the addition of ca2 into the post treatment process of membrane preparation han et al immersed the nascent tfc membrane into a water bath of 50 c containing different concentrations of cacl2 for heat treatment which enhanced both water permeance and antifouling properties of membranes han et al 2020 it should be noted that the addition of ca2 into the post treatment process improved the surface roughness of the selective layer contrary to the findings of previous studies where ca2 was added into the aqueous phase this suggests the resultant membrane properties are highly associated with the addition position of the same kind of inorganic salt additives which needs to be taken into consideration during the salt based modification of membranes in addition to ca2 hu et al also investigated the regulation mechanism of adding fe3 during the ip process fe no3 3 solution was used in the post treatment and similar to ca2 fe3 could complex with carboxyl groups of the pa layer resulting in a smooth hydrophilic and positively charged membrane surface the pa fe membrane showed an enhanced water permeance and improved antifouling performance hu et al 2021 furthermore zhang et al systematically studied how different types of divalent cations including main group and transition metal cations and corresponding salts affected the structure and properties of tfc membranes via metal ion amide group interactions fig 6 zhang et al 2021 soluble divalent metal cations were preloaded on the substrate to focus on their interactions with the aqueous monomers it was shown that the added main group i e ca2 and mg2 and transition metal i e zn2 cu2 and co2 cations played different roles in regulating the ip reaction by coordinating with the amine groups both main group and transition metal cations inhibited the diffusion of pip and generated the uneven reaction interface leading to the increase of membrane surface roughness under the moderate coordination effect the addition of main group metal cations could boost membrane water permeance without altering the membrane pore sizes and selectivity in comparison due to the stronger coordination with the amine groups transition metal cations finally remained in the polymer network more significantly than main group metal cations for this reason the modified membranes by transition metal cations had a thinner selective layer with rougher surface and larger pore size which endowed the membranes with a higher water permeance than main group metal cations modified membranes but decreased rejections to inorganic salts and small molecule dyes the differences between main group and transition metal cations in regulating membrane formation make it possible to flexibly tailor the membrane properties and performance for targeted applications in recent years with the development of computational techniques such as md simulation the ionic effects of inorganic salts during membrane formation have been further investigated shen et al utilized the addition of various inorganic salts to mediate the ip process and applied the characterization by md simulation as well as other techniques to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism in detail fig 7 a shen et al 2022 specifically salt ions tended to accumulate gradually and surround the aqueous monomers near the water hexane interface to confine their cross interface diffusion as a result the salt regulated membranes showed a structurally homogeneous selective layer with reduction in both thickness and surface roughness compared to the control membrane fig 7b c depending on the type and concentration of salt additives different levels of water permeance increase and or solute rejection enhancement could be achieved therefore by selecting suitable salts the free volume and nanoscale homogeneity of membrane selective layers can be finely tuned to tailor the water permeance and solute rejections 3 2 2 nonionic effects unlike the ionic effects of inorganic salts the nonionic effects do not depend on the interaction of salt ions with monomers or polyamides but rather regulate the structure and morphology of the membrane selective layer by physical actions during the ip process nonionic effects of inorganic salts can be divided mainly into the regulation of ip process by bicarbonate and the dissolution crystallization effect of salts 3 2 2 1 regulation of ip process by bicarbonate sun et al introduced bicarbonate into the aqueous monomer solution to prepare tfc nanofiltration membranes via the ip reaction sun et al 2018 the results showed that the addition of nahco3 generated more tiny cracks on membrane surface and increased the surface negative charge density of the membrane which improved the water permeance of the membrane without significantly decreasing the salt rejections the altered membrane surface properties could be due to the enhanced release of co2 gas when nahco3 reacted with hcl which was the by product of the ip reaction a series of more in depth studies has been carried out by ma et al to investigate the detailed mechanisms of bicarbonate affecting the ip process ma et al 2019 2018 the discrete voids in the selective layer of polyamide membranes were proven to be generated by dissolved gasses in the aqueous phase especially co2 nanobubbles by increasing or decreasing the nanobubbles the structure of polyamide membranes could be regulated effectively for example degassing the amine solution could produce a smooth membrane surface while incorporating more nanobubbles by adding bicarbonate could enhance membrane surface roughness fig 8 a the nanobubble foamed strategy increased the crosslinking degree and effective filtration area of the selective layers through promoting consumption of hcl and release of co2 and thus simultaneously improved water permeance and salt rejections of membranes fig 8b membranes with enhanced surface roughness were also obtained in the work of shang et al with the addition of bicarbonate w shang et al 2020b the effect on membrane fouling was analyzed via a 3d optical coherence tomography monitor it was found that the organic foulants mainly deposited on the valley regions of membrane surface and meanwhile the large area of ridge structures enhanced by the bicarbonate addition continued to allow water to pass through as a result the bicarbonate modified membrane with enhanced nanostructures exhibited lower fouling coverage on the surface and thus a higher fouling resistance compared to the relatively smooth control membrane as well as the membrane with small stripe structures it is generally accepted that rougher membranes are more susceptible to fouling lu et al 2013 vrijenhoek et al 2001 however the enhanced antifouling performance achieved by the rough surface of the bicarbonate regulated membranes suggests that the fouling behavior of a membrane is largely affected by its surface nanostructure features not merely the overall roughness moreover it should be noted that the degassing of co2 from the bicarbonate solution and the ip reaction rate are both associated with the ph of aqueous phase liu et al 2008 stumm and morgan 2012 a study conducted by peng et al demonstrated that when the ph of the mpd solution between the two pka values of the carbonate system the membrane achieved the maximum surface roughness due to the significantly enhanced co2 degassing peng et al 2019 it is understood that at appropriate ph between 6 3 to 10 3 dissolved co2 mainly existed in the form of bicarbonate ions in which case the acceptance of a h could lead to a direct degassing of co2 and thus a rough membrane surface in addition a ph of 10 3 could increase the cross linking degree of selective layers to the highest extent and improve the selectivity of membranes this was because at higher ph more h produced in the ip reaction was neutralized further promoting the forward reaction and thus increasing the cross linking degree of formed selective layers nevertheless excess oh might compete with mpd monomers to react with tmc as well as hydrolyze the formed polyamide network reducing the membrane cross linking degree therefore the preparation of ip made membranes with the addition of bicarbonate requires a proper ph adjustment 3 2 2 2 dissolution crystallization effect of salts via the dissolution crystallization equilibrium inorganic salts can have physical effects on the membrane structure during the growth of selective layers under thermal post treatment liu et al introduced various inorganic salts into the aqueous monomer solution and made their crystals grow in the heat treatment process finally acquiring membranes with higher water permeance liu et al 2021 lu et al 2021 the force of crystal growth could weaken the binding between the selective layer and the substrate to some extent and subsequent dissolution of salt crystals by immersing the membrane in water left some in situ tiny voids lonsdale et al suggested that the adhesion of the pa film to the substrate with limited surface porosity lengthened the transport path for water molecules increasing the transport resistance of the tfc membrane i e funnel effect li et al 2019 lonsdale et al 1971 wijmans and hao 2015 yang et al 2020 therefore the generated voids by the dissolved salt crystals at the bottom of selective layers can act like a porous interlayer with high porosity thereby alleviating the funnel effect besides the crystal growth of salts could crumple the nascent polyamide layer to change the morphology of membrane surface the cross section scanning electron microscopy image showed that the membrane modified by the dissolution crystallization effect of salts had a thinner pa layer and a larger surface area liu et al 2021 the improved selective layer structure and the moderate voids between layers together contributed to the enhanced water permeance of membranes finer scale characterization indicated a fractal structure of nacl crystals formed during the ip process fig 9 a lu et al 2021 branches of fractal nanocrystals created numerous tiny interconnected water channels referred to as branching fractal structures bfs significantly increasing the effective filtration area of the tfc membrane fig 9d therefore the fractal nanocrystal templated polyamide nanofiltration membranes exhibited a three to four times increase in water permeance while maintaining salt rejections fig 9b c compared with other methods of creating interlayer voids such as the introduction of hollow nanotubes utilizing inorganic salt crystallization is more industrially practical due to its advantages of low cost and easy implementation nevertheless the density and size of salt crystals i e the formed interface voids between the substrate and the pa layer need to be carefully controlled to ensure the structural stability of the membrane and its long term filtration performance 4 performance and potential applications of salt modified membranes 4 1 enhanced water permeance and salt rejection water permeance and salt rejections are two core elements of membranes for water treatment the effects of the two types of salt additives i e organic and inorganic salts on membrane water permeance and salt rejections are presented in table 2 it can be seen that organic salt additives are capable of significantly improving salt rejections of membranes while inorganic salts are superior in enhancing water permeance as discussed in section 3 the organic salts added to the aqueous phase especially ionic surfactants can enhance wetting of the substrate and regulate the cross interface diffusion of the aqueous monomers which contributed to forming a dense and homogeneous membrane structure with large surface area and thus enhancing salt selectivity without sacrificing the water permeance in comparison the added inorganic salts usually produce ions co2 nanobubbles or crystals during the membrane synthesis the ions in the aqueous phase can inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers to the organic phase reducing membrane thickness while co2 nanobubbles or crystals can create additional voids in under the selective layer and also increase the surface roughness which are all conductive to improving the water permeance of membranes therefore with the appropriate salt additives the performance of membranes can be tailored to meet different application goals to be more specific the inorganic salt modified membranes could have a five times higher water permeance than the control membrane which would make membrane filtration more cost effective by reducing the demand for membrane area and allowing a lower operation pressure zhang et al 2021 in contrast the organic salt modified membranes with doubled salt rejection could significantly improve the quality of product water in desalination applications liang et al 2020 for tfc membranes an obvious tradeoff effect ubiquitously exists between permeability and selectivity which means that enhancing water permeance generally sacrifices salt rejection and vice versa a comparison of water permeance a and water salt selectivity a b among salt modified membranes control membranes and commercial membranes fig 10 shows that most salt modified ro and nf membranes exhibited superior higher permselectivity than the respective control membranes moreover a few salt modified nf membranes achieved better separation performance than commercial membranes potentially overcoming the trade off between water permeance and water salt selectivity these salt modified nf membranes can be applied in drinking water and wastewater treatment to achieve more cost efficient removal of inorganic salts in addition to ro nf salt modified tfc membranes can also be applied for osmotically driven membrane processes including forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro salt additives were proven to improve the water permeance of fo membranes without sacrificing salt rejections shen et al 2022 high performance salt modified pro membranes almost doubled the power density from 8 65 to 15 79 w m2 effectively increasing the commercial values of pro processes in energy generation cui et al 2014 shi et al 2021 in the field of industrial wastewater treatment fe3 modified membranes could greatly reinforce the micellar enhanced fo separation with a higher chromium cro4 2 rejection and a larger water flux hu et al 2021 therefore salt modified fo pro membranes have become a promising candidate for solving environmental problems and safeguarding global energy security 4 2 enhanced solute solute selectivity salt additives have been successfully applied for fabrication of membranes with improved solute solute selectivity with the addition of proper inorganic salts the modified pa layers of tfc membranes can have a narrowed distribution of pore sizes favoring precise solute solute separation shen et al 2022 tfc membranes with highly uniform sub nanometer pores were successfully prepared by incorporating surfactant sds and achieved sub 1 å level precision of solute solute separation especially between monovalent and divalent ions liang et al 2020 for example the rejections of li hydrated radius 3 8 å and mg2 hydrated radius 4 2 å by the sds modified membrane were 30 and 95 respectively whereas the difference in their rejections by the control membrane was much smaller 19 and 45 the sds modified membranes could also separate monovalent and divalent anions with remarkable precision and the nacl na2so4 selectivity was also 20 40 times higher than that of the commercial membranes sarkar et al 2020 by using polyethyleneimine pei as an additional monomer besides pip and sds for the ip process zhao et al precisely tuned the pore size distribution and surface charges of the membrane and the modified membrane achieved a desirable selectivity between nutrient ions and organic micropollutants zhao et al 2021b thanks to the improved solute solute selectivity these salt modified membranes can be highly promising for some specific applications including extraction of lithium in salt lake brine i e li mg2 separation salt recovery from the chlor alkali industry i e cl so4 2 separation as well as fit for purpose wastewater treatment e g salt organic contaminant separation 4 3 enhanced antifouling performance there are two main strategies of applying salt additives to enhance membrane antifouling performance a key factor affecting the antifouling performance of tfc membranes is the amount of carboxyl groups on membrane surface in the presence of divalent ions carboxyl ions organics bridges are easy to be generated promoting foulant accumulation on the membrane surface jin et al 2009 li and elimelech 2004 therefore one strategy of enhancing membrane antifouling properties is to add inorganic salts e g calcium or ferric salts and utilize metal ion carboxyl group interactions to shield the susceptible carboxyl groups fig 11 a it has been reported that metal ion modified membranes displayed a slower flux decline and a higher proportion of reversible fouling during the fouling tests indicating the considerably improved antifouling performance han et al 2020 hao et al 2019a hu et al 2021 regulating the 3d structure of membrane surface is another strategy to gain excellent antifouling performance it is assumed that a rough pa layer with a large membrane surface area helps to increase water permeance but meanwhile makes the membrane vulnerable to fouling lu et al 2013 vrijenhoek et al 2001 however recent studies have suggested that the valley structure with much larger size than foulants helped to enhance the antifouling property of pa membranes despite the large surface roughness fig 11b jang et al 2015 c shang et al 2020a w shang et al 2020b the utilization of bicarbonate as additives could be effective in constructing this kind of rough membrane surface with large size valley structures resulting in a lower foulant coverage on the surface and thus a higher fouling resistance compared to the relatively smooth control membrane which was proven to slow down the membrane fouling process and mitigate the flux decline from 51 to 33 during a test cycle w shang et al 2020b compared to other strategies of constructing rough antifouling membranes e g nanomaterial introduction choi et al 2016 lithographic methods won et al 2012 etc bicarbonate salt regulation is more advantageous for large scale membrane fabrication the enhanced antifouling performance can be universally beneficial for practical applications of membranes by effectively reducing the cleaning frequency and prolonging membrane service life 5 conclusions and future perspectives salt additives have already been applied for tfc membrane fabrication by various methods including pre loading on substrates addition to the aqueous or organic phase and introduction in the post treatment process salt additives can play important roles at each stage of membrane formation through the functions of modifying the wettability of the substrate regulating the in phase or cross interface diffusion of the aqueous monomers reducing the interfacial tension catalyzing the ip reaction by ptcs or acid receptors integrating with the polymers generating co2 nanobubbles or crystals etc the salt based strategies have shown favorable effects in overcoming the trade off relationship between permeability and selectivity as well as enhancing antifouling performance of membranes the customizable and uniform pore size distribution of membranes can also be achieved by the addition of salt additives which will remarkably improve the competitiveness and potentials of tfc membranes in the field of precise separation of monovalent divalent ions or salt organics therefore the exploitation of salt additives can provide green and facile avenues towards more efficient membrane based water and wastewater treatment despite the abundant achievements regulation of tfc membranes by salt additives still has some challenges to be addressed and also potential for more advancements firstly attention should be paid on the membrane long term stability especially the leaching risk of salt additives that are preserved in the final resultant membrane on the one hand it is necessary to evaluate the environmental and health hazards of the adopted salt additives and select the nontoxic and greener types on the other hand the salt additives added in the membrane fabrication process should be traced or quantified to clarify if and to what extent these salt additives are embedded in the prepared membrane which also contributes to the deeper understanding of salt regulation mechanisms meanwhile long term stability assessments are still needed to confirm the practicability of salt modified membranes in commercial scale applications in previous studies only one kind of salt additives was utilized for membrane preparation while the combined use of different salt additives can also be attempted to achieve comprehensive enhancement of membrane performance and the interactions between different salts and their synergistic effects need to be explored as revealed in above sections addition of organic salts especially ionic surfactants is particularly beneficial to optimize the solute selectivity while inorganic salts can contribute more to membrane water permeance and antifouling performance this implies that the simultaneous utilization of organic and inorganic salts may be able to fabricate antifouling membranes with both high water permeance and excellent selectivity the combined use of salt additives requires that the advantageous mechanisms of each salt are fully utilized and the competitive effects can be avoided as much as possible salt additives can also optimize the fit for purpose fabrication of ip made tfc membranes by compensating for the weaknesses of other materials for example in construction of positively charged tfc membranes the storage in substates and reaction rate problems of macromonomers e g pei could be alleviated by surfactant additives through the substrate wetting and regulation of monomer diffusion ang et al 2020 fang et al 2013 when preparing tfc membranes with the unique advantages of zwitterions adding inorganic salts could break the electrostatic interaction between zwitterions which promoted the cross linking of zwitterionic polyamide networks and thus the formation of a defect free and ultrathin separation layer wu et al 2023 in addition to the separation and antifouling performance other crucial properties e g chlorine resistance of conventional tfc membranes are also yet to be further enhanced therefore more investigation is suggested on the combination of salt regulation and other membrane design or modification strategies

14931,during the fabrication of thin film composite tfc membranes by interfacial polymerization ip the utilization of salt additives is one of the effective methods to regulate membrane properties and

et al 2013 graphene oxide liu et al 2015 metal organic frameworks cheng et al 2021 liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2023a 2021a covalent organic frameworks wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 and metal oxide sulfur carbide nitride heiranian et al 2015 jhaveri and murthy 2016 ng et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2023b zhou et al 2020 have been widely incorporated for membrane construction and greatly improved the upper bound of membrane performance however most nanomaterials have disadvantages of complex synthesis high costs toxicity risks and the common problems of nanomaterial agglomeration and possible leaching could also challenge the stability and safety of these nanocomposite membranes razmjou et al 2011 rong et al 2013 compared with nanomaterials salt additives e g ionic surfactants bicarbonates calcium salts etc are more available environment friendly and easily dispersed for membrane construction in the past two decades a variety of salt additives have been increasingly introduced into the fabrication procedure of ip made tfc membranes and proven to be effective for tailoring membrane properties and improving the membrane performance despite several excellent review articles about the additives for fabricating tfc membranes published in recent years their interests mainly focused on nanomaterials lau et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 or macromolecules nasrollahi et al 2022 partial salt additives were introduced briefly in a few reviews gohil and ray 2017 lau et al 2012 li et al 2021 which however did not cover many progresses achieved very recently and the mechanisms of various salt additives and the resultant membrane properties were not discussed in detail moreover there is lack of comparative and critical analysis to connect salt additives types with membrane performance and potential applications hindering the efficient use of salt additives for advanced membrane development based on the above this review aims to for the first time summarize the research progress in various salt additives used to tailor properties and performance of tfc membranes for water treatment salt additives as described herein are compounds consisting of an ionic assembly of cations and anions not including acids alkalis and non ionic additives most of which show great solubility in water or other polar solvents gold 2019 in the following sections we first provide a brief overview of the development of salt additives for tfc membrane preparation with a summary of their effects and underlying mechanisms by classifying salt additives into organic and inorganic salts the roles of added salt additives in the ip process and the induced changes in membrane structure properties and performance are then discussed in detail efforts are also made to analyze the commonalities and differences of these salt based strategies and to critically understand some seemingly contradictory findings in similar studies using salt additives of the same kind moreover the potential applications and future research directions on salt additives for membrane preparation are discussed this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of salt additives in tailoring tfc membranes and offers novel insights on the development of advanced membranes for water treatment 2 development of salt additives for tfc membrane fabrication as early as 1959 morgan and kwolek experimented with the addition of inorganic salts into the aqueous phase during the ip process and found that salts particularly neutral salts promoted the partition of diamine towards the organic phase morgan and kwolek 1959 it was inferred that inorganic salts could generate a change in the amount of reactant diamine as well as salting out effects however this discovery went unnoticed by the water treatment field for a long time afterwards as the 21st century has seen a boom in the development of membranes for water treatment more and more researchers have become interested in salt additives for tfc membrane preparation fig 1 from 2000 to 2010 research on tailoring membranes by salt additives focused on phase transfer catalysts ptcs and surfactants since 2010 research of inorganic salt additives has been on the rise with the regulatory mechanisms of inorganic salts such as bicarbonate gradually being understood in recent years advanced characterization and simulation techniques have allowed more mechanisms underlying the roles of salt additives in membrane formation to be explored in depth during the ip process for tfc membrane preparation salt additives are commonly pre loaded on substrates blended in aqueous or organic monomer solutions and to a lesser degree introduced into the post treatment process in brief organic salt additives usually have a large influence on the cross linking degree surface morphology and pore size of the selective layer through their interactions with the substrate amine monomers and pa networks inorganic salts can regulate all aspects of the properties of the membrane through ionic effects with monomers or polyamides and non ionic effects including generation of nanobubbles and crystals fig 2 the use of salt additives has been demonstrated to not only improve the water solute selectivity of membranes but also contribute to more precise solute solute separation other membrane performance e g antifouling properties can be enhanced as well through the proper utilization of salt additives table 1 the utilization way regulation effects and mechanisms and of each type of salt additives are discussed in detail in the following section 3 regulation mechanisms and effects of salt additives 3 1 organic salts organic salts are a class of salts composed of organic cations or organic anions as additives organic salts act mainly through specific functions of the organic component based on the primary function two types of organic salt additives i e ionic surfactants and ptcs should be discussed 3 1 1 ionic surfactants surfactants are commonly water soluble surface active agents consisting of a hydrophobic part usually a long alkyl chain and a hydrophilic ionic polar group surfactants can be divided into ionic surfactants and non ionic surfactants and both of them have been utilized as additives to regulate the ip process adding surfactants in the aqueous phase affects the retention of aqueous solution in the substrate and consequently the amine monomer concentration in the reaction zone during the ip process moreover the addition of surfactants in either the aqueous or organic phase can directly change the interactions between monomers in this paper focus was mainly put on ionic surfactants considering the review scope of salt additives 3 1 1 1 inter strand repulsion among ionic surfactants the most frequently used anionic and cationic surfactants are sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab respectively mansourpanah et al investigated the effect of sds and ctab on the morphology and performance of tfc nanofiltration membranes mansourpanah et al 2011 2009 with the addition of sds and ctab in organic phase the hydrophobic groups of the surfactant tended to integrate with the pa matrix to form surfactant polymer complexes and the hydrophilic groups were mutually repulsive increasing the free volume of the membrane and resulting in a high water permeance azarteimour et al 2016 mansourpanah et al 2009 rahimpour et al 2007 the effect of ionic surfactants added in the aqueous monomer solution could be different it was found that the pure water permeance of the membrane increased with the addition of sds to the aqueous phase while ctab showed no significant influence on membrane performance mansourpanah et al 2011 this could be due to the poor solubility of ctab in aqueous solution resulting in less ctab molecules involved in the ip reaction to produce free volume in pa matrix yung et al 2010 since the surfactant polymer complexes can be formed in the organic phase where the ip reaction zone is located adding ionic surfactants to the organic phase is considered more conducive to generating more free volume and achieving higher membrane water permeance 3 1 1 2 substrate wetting addition of surfactants can also regulate the retention of aqueous monomers by the substrate and thus affect the subsequent ip reaction some researchers have explored the addition of surfactants in the aqueous phase and concluded that surfactants could enhance the wetting of substrate surface fig 3 a ang et al 2020 azizi and sharif 2019 hermans et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 liang et al 2020 jiang et al elucidated the mechanisms underlying the effect of surfactants on the behavior of aqueous phase through dissipative particle dynamics simulation with the addition of surfactants in the aqueous phase a thicker aqueous layer was retained on the substrate surface when contacting with the organic solution the aqueous layer shrank driven by the imbalance of the interfacial tension at this stage water molecules converged above the substrate pores forming a discrete aqueous microphase and meanwhile the ip reaction occurred to generate a rough polyamide film on top of the aqueous microphase fig 3d jiang et al 2019 the rougher membrane surface induced by the surfactant can enlarge the effective filtration area and thus increase the water permeance fig 3b jiang et al 2019 on the other hand enhanced wetting of substrates by surfactants can also make the aqueous phase penetrate deeper into the surface pores of the commonly hydrophobic supports and slow down the diffusion of aqueous monomers during the subsequent ip reaction this could create a bottleneck effect i e intrusion of the formed pa film into substrate pores which decreases the water permeance of membranes ghosh and hoek 2009 yang et al 2018 therefore during membrane manufacturing the addition of surfactants should be combined with the selection of a substrate with suitable pore size and hydrophilicity to achieve the optimal performance of resultant tfc membranes 3 1 1 3 cross interface diffusion regulation in addition to the role of wetting substrate surface sds was also added into the aqueous solution in order to regulate the cross interface diffusion of amine monomers fang et al 2013 hermans et al 2014 khorshidi et al 2017 lau et al 2012 morgan and kwolek 1959 sarkar et al 2020 as a surfactant sds can lower the interfacial tension of the water hexane interface which largely affects the concentration of aqueous monomers diffusing to the organic phase for the polymerization reaction ghosh et al 2008 specifically the lowered interfacial tension by the addition of sds can lead to more rapid cross interface diffusion of amine monomers into the organic phase and thus high concentrations of amine in the reaction zone accelerating the polymerization rate the more violent reaction increases the surface roughness of the resultant selective layer contributing to the increase of water permeance cui et al 2014 studies conducted by park et al suggested that with the addition of sds in the m phenylenediamine mpd solution the ridge and valley morphology of the selective layer became more pronounced fig 3c and both surface roughness and apparent thickness of the pa film increased simultaneously hermans et al 2014 park et al 2018a 2018b sarkar et al 2020 it has been known that a larger thickness of the selective layer impairs membrane water permeate due to the larger transport resistance while the increased surface roughness can provide more effective filtration area contributing to higher permeance therefore the authors attributed the improved water permeance by the addition of sds to the increased membrane surface roughness that overwhelmed the adverse effect of the increased thickness park et al 2018b nevertheless the variation in thickness of the selective layer may need to be more critically analyzed since the effective thickness rather than the apparent thickness is critical to the water flux fridman bishop and freger 2017 you et al 2021 the fully aromatic pa selective layer of tfc membranes generally consists of a dense region and abundant voids and only the former determines the effective thickness of the selective layer the enhanced water permeance of the sds modified membranes could be jointly enabled by the enlarged surface filtration area and reduced effective thickness of pa films despite an increased apparent thickness of the selective layer recent research by liang et al provides a different perspective regarding the effect of ionic surfactants on the interfacial diffusion of amine monomers referred to as surfactant assembly regulated interfacial polymerization sarip fig 4 a liang et al 2020 during the sarip process a self assembled network of amphiphiles was created at the water hexane interface via the addition of sds in the aqueous phase eastoe and dalton 2000 han et al 2022 liang et al 2020 yang et al 2022 the highly regular interfacial network controlled the transport of aqueous monomers across the interface forming a pa active layer with a highly uniform pore size distribution liang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021b the results of molecular dynamics md simulation further demonstrated the regulation mechanism that an appropriate addition of surfactants led to the formation of a dynamic interfacial network fig 4d the surfactant network not only promoted the accumulation of aqueous monomers near the interface via electrostatic attraction but also enabled the rapid diffusion and even distribution of monomers due to the reduced energy barrier compared to the control membrane obtained by conventional ip the surfactant modulated membrane had a smaller pore size and a more uniform pore size distribution as well as a rougher membrane surface thus achieving a highly precise separation without sacrificing water permeance the increased surface roughness of the pa membrane based on sarip resulted from the enhanced wetting of the porous substrate by sds as introduced above which was further confirmed by the smoother surface of the free standing pa film synthesized by sarip compared to conventional ip fig 4b c it can be found that various studies may yield different results and even opposite explanations with regard to the regulation of interfacial polymerization by adding ionic surfactants the partial reason for this contradiction could be that the conditions e g monomers substrates types of surfactants and addition positions for membrane preparation used in independent studies investigating the role of surfactants were different more importantly previous focuses have commonly put on only one of the several influence mechanisms of ionic surfactants for the ip process for example some ionic surfactants are expected to reduce the interfacial tension and promote the diffusion of aqueous monomers thus increasing the crosslinking degree of selective layers while the same kind of surfactants can also form surfactant polymer complexes to decrease the crosslinking degree of pa matrix moreover the enhanced wetting of substrates by surfactants tends to result in a selective layer with rougher surface but the self assembled network of surfactants at the aqueous organic interface has the effect of reducing the membrane surface roughness as well therefore distinct results of membrane performance variation are possible to occur due to the competition of different mechanisms more efforts should be made in future research to distinguish and better exploit the combined effects of ionic surfactant additives for enhancing membrane performance in addition reasonable selection of surfactants should be taken seriously by considering the hydrophile lipophile balance hlb and the critical micelle concentration cmc of surfactants a surfactant with larger hlb value is more hydrophilic and more soluble in the aqueous phase davis 1994 at aqueous solution surfactant concentrations greater than the cmc surfactant molecules tend to aggregate to form micelles conversely surfactants can be fully dispersed in the aqueous phase some of the phase parameters including temperature solvent type and monomer concentration will also affect the cmc of the surfactant demissie et al 2021 park and bielefeldt 2003 therefore in order to achieve the optimal regulation effects it is of significance to choose surfactants with appropriate hlb values large hlb value for substrate wetting and cross interface diffusion regulation while small hlb value for inter strand repulsion it is also necessary to choose surfactants with high cmc and determine the actual cmc of the used surfactant in aqueous or organic phase so as to ensure the added surfactant concentration lower than the cmc level 3 1 2 phase transfer catalysts ptcs phase transfer catalysts are widely used in organic synthesis reactions between immiscible phases e g transferring reactive monomers from the aqueous into the organic phase where the reaction occurs naik and doraiswamy 1998 schnell et al used ptcs for polycarbonate preparation by the ip reaction in the early 1950 s morgan 1981 schnell 1956 in 1970s starks proposed the famous catalytic cycle principle for the sn2 nucleophilic substitution reaction in the liquid liquid system laying the theoretical foundation of phase transfer catalysis starks 1971 the ip reaction for membrane pa layer synthesis is a typical sn2 nucleophilic substitution reaction where the nucleophile i e amine monomers transfers from the aqueous phase to the organic phase and attacks the carbonyl carbon of acyl chloride monomers fig 5 morgan and kwolek 1959 during the ip process ptcs can react with aqueous monomers to form a new ion pair with higher organic affinity and reactivity consequently accelerating the rate of polymerization according to the two basic requirements proposed by starks and liotta starks and liotta 1978 ptcs must have sufficient organic cationic structure to partition the nucleophile into the organic phase and the cation anion bonding should be loose enough to ensure high anionic reactivity as such onium salts i e ammonium and phosphonium salts have been discovered as ptcs and become most widely used in industry naik and doraiswamy 1998 jegal et al explored the addition of three kinds of ammonium salts including triethyl benzyl ammonium bromide tebab trimethyl benzyl ammonium bromide tmbab and triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride tebac as ptcs to prepare ip based membranes jegal et al 2002 the results showed that by increasing membrane surface roughness tebab provided a significant increase in the water permeance without sacrificing the rejection of organics by the tfc membrane however tmbab and tebac turned out to have no obvious effect on the performance of the resultant pa membranes indicating that the effective and beneficial regulation of ip required appropriate ptcs this difference in effects among the three ptcs might be due to the fact that tebab had more organic structures than tmbab and weaker cation anion bonding than tebac which was more favorable for the amine monomers to be paired with the cations of ptcs and transferred into the organic phase for participating in the reaction starks and liotta 1978 qiu et al investigated the effects of mass fraction of the catalysts to mpd monomers on the water permeance and rejection performance of prepared membranes when the mpd concentration was 1 2 and 2 w v respectively qiu et al 2009 at the high mpd concentration the added ptc increased membrane water permeance by up to nearly 50 when the concentration of mpd was lower the ptc led to a significant enhancement in both water permeance and nacl rejection of membranes this was because the efficacy of ptc was more prominent in accelerating the relatively slow interfacial diffusion of monomers at the lower mpd concentration which distinctly promoted the ip reaction and improved the permselectivity of the membrane moreover xiang et al fabricated a series of tfc membranes using ammonium salts with different molecular structures and molecular weights as ptcs xiang et al 2013 the results indicated that the surface roughness and the crosslinking degree of the prepared membranes was increased with the molecular weight of cationic amine groups of ptcs further research by the same team discovered that the ammonium salt containing a larger cationic size could more efficiently facilitate the transport of piperazine pip monomers resulting in a thicker and rougher pa layer and increasing the nacl rejection by the membrane xiang et al 2014 it is also suggested that the water absorbing water ability of catalysts should be considered for the selection of ptcs which could affect the membrane structural stability by influencing the adhesion between the substrate and the selective layer ptcs have undergone rapid development over the decades as a practical methodology for organic synthesis and proved to be a useful tool for transcending phase barriers in heterogeneous systems naik and doraiswamy 1998 ooi and maruoka 2007 however there were few studies on the use of ptcs to modulate the ip process for membrane fabrication recent efforts in this regard have made some progress but there is still a lack of systematic studies to distinguish the catalytic effect of ptcs on the ip reaction from other interfering effects for example some ammonium salts used as ptcs can simultaneously play a role of surfactants to lower the interfacial tension xiang et al 2014 therefore further investigation is needed to verify the catalytic role of ptcs and elaborate the influence factors of catalytic efficiency based on which more rational selection and efficient application of ptcs for tfc membrane preparation can be achieved 3 2 inorganic salts the pioneer work of morgan and kwolek morgan and kwolek 1959 first found the inorganic salts added in the aqueous phase during the ip process could generate a change in the amount of reactant diamine as well as salting out effects further research has revealed that some ions also have features that can be used to improve the water permeance solute selectivity and antifouling performance of ip made membranes for example some metal cations e g ca2 mg2 etc are able to regulate the interfacial diffusion of the aqueous monomers by interacting with their amine or hydroxyl groups during the ip process thus affecting the properties of the resultant membrane in addition some inorganic salts e g bicarbonate have efficacy in regulating the structure of membrane selective layers by creating co2 nanobubbles or salt crystals herein the effects of inorganic salt additives are divided into two main categories i e ionic and nonionic effects 3 2 1 ionic effects salts containing cations and anions of equal charges can influence the ip process via ionic interactions in the monomer solution these influences include regulation of aqueous monomer diffusion metal ion carboxyl group interactions and metal ion amide group interactions early studies by morgan and kwolek presented the effects of nacl on the ip reaction while there was no detailed explanation for the influence mechanisms morgan and kwolek 1959 in the field of tfc membrane preparation tang et al demonstrated that the addition of libr into the aqueous phase increased the reactivity of the hydroxyl groups of triethanolamine or n methyl diethanolamine monomers with the acyl chloride groups of trimesoyl chloride tmc during the ip process tang et al 2010 more specifically li could break the hydrogen bonds between aqueous monomers and thus increase the free monomers as well as their reactivity which led to the formation of a denser selective layer however confirmed by the ftir characterization li could also form a complex with tmc through the ion dipole interaction lai et al 1992 to activate the carbonyl groups thus accelerating the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride groups of tmc and resulting in a hydrophilic and looser selective layer therefore the water permeance and salt rejections of the prepared polyester membrane could be flexibly adjusted by varying the addition content of libr focusing on regulation of aqueous monomer diffusion jiang s team studied the ionic effects of inorganic salt addition on the ip process and membrane structure by using phytic acid dodecasodium salt pads zhang et al 2022 nuclear magnetic resonance proved that pads could inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers by electrostatic interactions thus significantly reducing the thickness of pa layers the optimal membrane showed a simultaneously high water permeance and na2so4 rejection fan et al used cacl2 in the aqueous phase to regulate the ip process and investigate the metal ion carboxyl group interactions fan et al 2014 the complexation of ca2 with the carbonyl in the tmc molecule could accelerate the hydrolysis of the acyl chloride groups of tmc and finally enhance membrane water permeance the chorine resistant performance of the membrane was also found to be improved which was claimed to result from the strong electron withdrawing effect of ca2 on carbonyl but needed more investigation and validation moreover hao et al found that the addition of ca2 into the mpd solution formed stable intrabridges of carboxyl groups in the selective layer hao et al 2019a this intrabridging effect could shield carboxyl groups and minimize their exposure to divalent metal ions in the feed water and thus reducing the formation of foulant metal membrane interbridges besides ca2 was also expected to weaken the degassing behavior of co2 from the aqueous solution during pa film formation and affect the hydrogen bonding of the resultant polymer with water molecules which consequently gave rise to a smooth and hydrophilic membrane surface membrane fouling and cleaning experiments confirmed these ca2 modified membranes had better antifouling performance han et al 2020 hao et al 2019a 2019b zhu et al 2020 the metal ion carboxyl group interactions could be also employed by the addition of ca2 into the post treatment process of membrane preparation han et al immersed the nascent tfc membrane into a water bath of 50 c containing different concentrations of cacl2 for heat treatment which enhanced both water permeance and antifouling properties of membranes han et al 2020 it should be noted that the addition of ca2 into the post treatment process improved the surface roughness of the selective layer contrary to the findings of previous studies where ca2 was added into the aqueous phase this suggests the resultant membrane properties are highly associated with the addition position of the same kind of inorganic salt additives which needs to be taken into consideration during the salt based modification of membranes in addition to ca2 hu et al also investigated the regulation mechanism of adding fe3 during the ip process fe no3 3 solution was used in the post treatment and similar to ca2 fe3 could complex with carboxyl groups of the pa layer resulting in a smooth hydrophilic and positively charged membrane surface the pa fe membrane showed an enhanced water permeance and improved antifouling performance hu et al 2021 furthermore zhang et al systematically studied how different types of divalent cations including main group and transition metal cations and corresponding salts affected the structure and properties of tfc membranes via metal ion amide group interactions fig 6 zhang et al 2021 soluble divalent metal cations were preloaded on the substrate to focus on their interactions with the aqueous monomers it was shown that the added main group i e ca2 and mg2 and transition metal i e zn2 cu2 and co2 cations played different roles in regulating the ip reaction by coordinating with the amine groups both main group and transition metal cations inhibited the diffusion of pip and generated the uneven reaction interface leading to the increase of membrane surface roughness under the moderate coordination effect the addition of main group metal cations could boost membrane water permeance without altering the membrane pore sizes and selectivity in comparison due to the stronger coordination with the amine groups transition metal cations finally remained in the polymer network more significantly than main group metal cations for this reason the modified membranes by transition metal cations had a thinner selective layer with rougher surface and larger pore size which endowed the membranes with a higher water permeance than main group metal cations modified membranes but decreased rejections to inorganic salts and small molecule dyes the differences between main group and transition metal cations in regulating membrane formation make it possible to flexibly tailor the membrane properties and performance for targeted applications in recent years with the development of computational techniques such as md simulation the ionic effects of inorganic salts during membrane formation have been further investigated shen et al utilized the addition of various inorganic salts to mediate the ip process and applied the characterization by md simulation as well as other techniques to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism in detail fig 7 a shen et al 2022 specifically salt ions tended to accumulate gradually and surround the aqueous monomers near the water hexane interface to confine their cross interface diffusion as a result the salt regulated membranes showed a structurally homogeneous selective layer with reduction in both thickness and surface roughness compared to the control membrane fig 7b c depending on the type and concentration of salt additives different levels of water permeance increase and or solute rejection enhancement could be achieved therefore by selecting suitable salts the free volume and nanoscale homogeneity of membrane selective layers can be finely tuned to tailor the water permeance and solute rejections 3 2 2 nonionic effects unlike the ionic effects of inorganic salts the nonionic effects do not depend on the interaction of salt ions with monomers or polyamides but rather regulate the structure and morphology of the membrane selective layer by physical actions during the ip process nonionic effects of inorganic salts can be divided mainly into the regulation of ip process by bicarbonate and the dissolution crystallization effect of salts 3 2 2 1 regulation of ip process by bicarbonate sun et al introduced bicarbonate into the aqueous monomer solution to prepare tfc nanofiltration membranes via the ip reaction sun et al 2018 the results showed that the addition of nahco3 generated more tiny cracks on membrane surface and increased the surface negative charge density of the membrane which improved the water permeance of the membrane without significantly decreasing the salt rejections the altered membrane surface properties could be due to the enhanced release of co2 gas when nahco3 reacted with hcl which was the by product of the ip reaction a series of more in depth studies has been carried out by ma et al to investigate the detailed mechanisms of bicarbonate affecting the ip process ma et al 2019 2018 the discrete voids in the selective layer of polyamide membranes were proven to be generated by dissolved gasses in the aqueous phase especially co2 nanobubbles by increasing or decreasing the nanobubbles the structure of polyamide membranes could be regulated effectively for example degassing the amine solution could produce a smooth membrane surface while incorporating more nanobubbles by adding bicarbonate could enhance membrane surface roughness fig 8 a the nanobubble foamed strategy increased the crosslinking degree and effective filtration area of the selective layers through promoting consumption of hcl and release of co2 and thus simultaneously improved water permeance and salt rejections of membranes fig 8b membranes with enhanced surface roughness were also obtained in the work of shang et al with the addition of bicarbonate w shang et al 2020b the effect on membrane fouling was analyzed via a 3d optical coherence tomography monitor it was found that the organic foulants mainly deposited on the valley regions of membrane surface and meanwhile the large area of ridge structures enhanced by the bicarbonate addition continued to allow water to pass through as a result the bicarbonate modified membrane with enhanced nanostructures exhibited lower fouling coverage on the surface and thus a higher fouling resistance compared to the relatively smooth control membrane as well as the membrane with small stripe structures it is generally accepted that rougher membranes are more susceptible to fouling lu et al 2013 vrijenhoek et al 2001 however the enhanced antifouling performance achieved by the rough surface of the bicarbonate regulated membranes suggests that the fouling behavior of a membrane is largely affected by its surface nanostructure features not merely the overall roughness moreover it should be noted that the degassing of co2 from the bicarbonate solution and the ip reaction rate are both associated with the ph of aqueous phase liu et al 2008 stumm and morgan 2012 a study conducted by peng et al demonstrated that when the ph of the mpd solution between the two pka values of the carbonate system the membrane achieved the maximum surface roughness due to the significantly enhanced co2 degassing peng et al 2019 it is understood that at appropriate ph between 6 3 to 10 3 dissolved co2 mainly existed in the form of bicarbonate ions in which case the acceptance of a h could lead to a direct degassing of co2 and thus a rough membrane surface in addition a ph of 10 3 could increase the cross linking degree of selective layers to the highest extent and improve the selectivity of membranes this was because at higher ph more h produced in the ip reaction was neutralized further promoting the forward reaction and thus increasing the cross linking degree of formed selective layers nevertheless excess oh might compete with mpd monomers to react with tmc as well as hydrolyze the formed polyamide network reducing the membrane cross linking degree therefore the preparation of ip made membranes with the addition of bicarbonate requires a proper ph adjustment 3 2 2 2 dissolution crystallization effect of salts via the dissolution crystallization equilibrium inorganic salts can have physical effects on the membrane structure during the growth of selective layers under thermal post treatment liu et al introduced various inorganic salts into the aqueous monomer solution and made their crystals grow in the heat treatment process finally acquiring membranes with higher water permeance liu et al 2021 lu et al 2021 the force of crystal growth could weaken the binding between the selective layer and the substrate to some extent and subsequent dissolution of salt crystals by immersing the membrane in water left some in situ tiny voids lonsdale et al suggested that the adhesion of the pa film to the substrate with limited surface porosity lengthened the transport path for water molecules increasing the transport resistance of the tfc membrane i e funnel effect li et al 2019 lonsdale et al 1971 wijmans and hao 2015 yang et al 2020 therefore the generated voids by the dissolved salt crystals at the bottom of selective layers can act like a porous interlayer with high porosity thereby alleviating the funnel effect besides the crystal growth of salts could crumple the nascent polyamide layer to change the morphology of membrane surface the cross section scanning electron microscopy image showed that the membrane modified by the dissolution crystallization effect of salts had a thinner pa layer and a larger surface area liu et al 2021 the improved selective layer structure and the moderate voids between layers together contributed to the enhanced water permeance of membranes finer scale characterization indicated a fractal structure of nacl crystals formed during the ip process fig 9 a lu et al 2021 branches of fractal nanocrystals created numerous tiny interconnected water channels referred to as branching fractal structures bfs significantly increasing the effective filtration area of the tfc membrane fig 9d therefore the fractal nanocrystal templated polyamide nanofiltration membranes exhibited a three to four times increase in water permeance while maintaining salt rejections fig 9b c compared with other methods of creating interlayer voids such as the introduction of hollow nanotubes utilizing inorganic salt crystallization is more industrially practical due to its advantages of low cost and easy implementation nevertheless the density and size of salt crystals i e the formed interface voids between the substrate and the pa layer need to be carefully controlled to ensure the structural stability of the membrane and its long term filtration performance 4 performance and potential applications of salt modified membranes 4 1 enhanced water permeance and salt rejection water permeance and salt rejections are two core elements of membranes for water treatment the effects of the two types of salt additives i e organic and inorganic salts on membrane water permeance and salt rejections are presented in table 2 it can be seen that organic salt additives are capable of significantly improving salt rejections of membranes while inorganic salts are superior in enhancing water permeance as discussed in section 3 the organic salts added to the aqueous phase especially ionic surfactants can enhance wetting of the substrate and regulate the cross interface diffusion of the aqueous monomers which contributed to forming a dense and homogeneous membrane structure with large surface area and thus enhancing salt selectivity without sacrificing the water permeance in comparison the added inorganic salts usually produce ions co2 nanobubbles or crystals during the membrane synthesis the ions in the aqueous phase can inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers to the organic phase reducing membrane thickness while co2 nanobubbles or crystals can create additional voids in under the selective layer and also increase the surface roughness which are all conductive to improving the water permeance of membranes therefore with the appropriate salt additives the performance of membranes can be tailored to meet different application goals to be more specific the inorganic salt modified membranes could have a five times higher water permeance than the control membrane which would make membrane filtration more cost effective by reducing the demand for membrane area and allowing a lower operation pressure zhang et al 2021 in contrast the organic salt modified membranes with doubled salt rejection could significantly improve the quality of product water in desalination applications liang et al 2020 for tfc membranes an obvious tradeoff effect ubiquitously exists between permeability and selectivity which means that enhancing water permeance generally sacrifices salt rejection and vice versa a comparison of water permeance a and water salt selectivity a b among salt modified membranes control membranes and commercial membranes fig 10 shows that most salt modified ro and nf membranes exhibited superior higher permselectivity than the respective control membranes moreover a few salt modified nf membranes achieved better separation performance than commercial membranes potentially overcoming the trade off between water permeance and water salt selectivity these salt modified nf membranes can be applied in drinking water and wastewater treatment to achieve more cost efficient removal of inorganic salts in addition to ro nf salt modified tfc membranes can also be applied for osmotically driven membrane processes including forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro salt additives were proven to improve the water permeance of fo membranes without sacrificing salt rejections shen et al 2022 high performance salt modified pro membranes almost doubled the power density from 8 65 to 15 79 w m2 effectively increasing the commercial values of pro processes in energy generation cui et al 2014 shi et al 2021 in the field of industrial wastewater treatment fe3 modified membranes could greatly reinforce the micellar enhanced fo separation with a higher chromium cro4 2 rejection and a larger water flux hu et al 2021 therefore salt modified fo pro membranes have become a promising candidate for solving environmental problems and safeguarding global energy security 4 2 enhanced solute solute selectivity salt additives have been successfully applied for fabrication of membranes with improved solute solute selectivity with the addition of proper inorganic salts the modified pa layers of tfc membranes can have a narrowed distribution of pore sizes favoring precise solute solute separation shen et al 2022 tfc membranes with highly uniform sub nanometer pores were successfully prepared by incorporating surfactant sds and achieved sub 1 å level precision of solute solute separation especially between monovalent and divalent ions liang et al 2020 for example the rejections of li hydrated radius 3 8 å and mg2 hydrated radius 4 2 å by the sds modified membrane were 30 and 95 respectively whereas the difference in their rejections by the control membrane was much smaller 19 and 45 the sds modified membranes could also separate monovalent and divalent anions with remarkable precision and the nacl na2so4 selectivity was also 20 40 times higher than that of the commercial membranes sarkar et al 2020 by using polyethyleneimine pei as an additional monomer besides pip and sds for the ip process zhao et al precisely tuned the pore size distribution and surface charges of the membrane and the modified membrane achieved a desirable selectivity between nutrient ions and organic micropollutants zhao et al 2021b thanks to the improved solute solute selectivity these salt modified membranes can be highly promising for some specific applications including extraction of lithium in salt lake brine i e li mg2 separation salt recovery from the chlor alkali industry i e cl so4 2 separation as well as fit for purpose wastewater treatment e g salt organic contaminant separation 4 3 enhanced antifouling performance there are two main strategies of applying salt additives to enhance membrane antifouling performance a key factor affecting the antifouling performance of tfc membranes is the amount of carboxyl groups on membrane surface in the presence of divalent ions carboxyl ions organics bridges are easy to be generated promoting foulant accumulation on the membrane surface jin et al 2009 li and elimelech 2004 therefore one strategy of enhancing membrane antifouling properties is to add inorganic salts e g calcium or ferric salts and utilize metal ion carboxyl group interactions to shield the susceptible carboxyl groups fig 11 a it has been reported that metal ion modified membranes displayed a slower flux decline and a higher proportion of reversible fouling during the fouling tests indicating the considerably improved antifouling performance han et al 2020 hao et al 2019a hu et al 2021 regulating the 3d structure of membrane surface is another strategy to gain excellent antifouling performance it is assumed that a rough pa layer with a large membrane surface area helps to increase water permeance but meanwhile makes the membrane vulnerable to fouling lu et al 2013 vrijenhoek et al 2001 however recent studies have suggested that the valley structure with much larger size than foulants helped to enhance the antifouling property of pa membranes despite the large surface roughness fig 11b jang et al 2015 c shang et al 2020a w shang et al 2020b the utilization of bicarbonate as additives could be effective in constructing this kind of rough membrane surface with large size valley structures resulting in a lower foulant coverage on the surface and thus a higher fouling resistance compared to the relatively smooth control membrane which was proven to slow down the membrane fouling process and mitigate the flux decline from 51 to 33 during a test cycle w shang et al 2020b compared to other strategies of constructing rough antifouling membranes e g nanomaterial introduction choi et al 2016 lithographic methods won et al 2012 etc bicarbonate salt regulation is more advantageous for large scale membrane fabrication the enhanced antifouling performance can be universally beneficial for practical applications of membranes by effectively reducing the cleaning frequency and prolonging membrane service life 5 conclusions and future perspectives salt additives have already been applied for tfc membrane fabrication by various methods including pre loading on substrates addition to the aqueous or organic phase and introduction in the post treatment process salt additives can play important roles at each stage of membrane formation through the functions of modifying the wettability of the substrate regulating the in phase or cross interface diffusion of the aqueous monomers reducing the interfacial tension catalyzing the ip reaction by ptcs or acid receptors integrating with the polymers generating co2 nanobubbles or crystals etc the salt based strategies have shown favorable effects in overcoming the trade off relationship between permeability and selectivity as well as enhancing antifouling performance of membranes the customizable and uniform pore size distribution of membranes can also be achieved by the addition of salt additives which will remarkably improve the competitiveness and potentials of tfc membranes in the field of precise separation of monovalent divalent ions or salt organics therefore the exploitation of salt additives can provide green and facile avenues towards more efficient membrane based water and wastewater treatment despite the abundant achievements regulation of tfc membranes by salt additives still has some challenges to be addressed and also potential for more advancements firstly attention should be paid on the membrane long term stability especially the leaching risk of salt additives that are preserved in the final resultant membrane on the one hand it is necessary to evaluate the environmental and health hazards of the adopted salt additives and select the nontoxic and greener types on the other hand the salt additives added in the membrane fabrication process should be traced or quantified to clarify if and to what extent these salt additives are embedded in the prepared membrane which also contributes to the deeper understanding of salt regulation mechanisms meanwhile long term stability assessments are still needed to confirm the practicability of salt modified membranes in commercial scale applications in previous studies only one kind of salt additives was utilized for membrane preparation while the combined use of different salt additives can also be attempted to achieve comprehensive enhancement of membrane performance and the interactions between different salts and their synergistic effects need to be explored as revealed in above sections addition of organic salts especially ionic surfactants is particularly beneficial to optimize the solute selectivity while inorganic salts can contribute more to membrane water permeance and antifouling performance this implies that the simultaneous utilization of organic and inorganic salts may be able to fabricate antifouling membranes with both high water permeance and excellent selectivity the combined use of salt additives requires that the advantageous mechanisms of each salt are fully utilized and the competitive effects can be avoided as much as possible salt additives can also optimize the fit for purpose fabrication of ip made tfc membranes by compensating for the weaknesses of other materials for example in construction of positively charged tfc membranes the storage in substates and reaction rate problems of macromonomers e g pei could be alleviated by surfactant additives through the substrate wetting and regulation of monomer diffusion ang et al 2020 fang et al 2013 when preparing tfc membranes with the unique advantages of zwitterions adding inorganic salts could break the electrostatic interaction between zwitterions which promoted the cross linking of zwitterionic polyamide networks and thus the formation of a defect free and ultrathin separation layer wu et al 2023 in addition to the separation and antifouling performance other crucial properties e g chlorine resistance of conventional tfc membranes are also yet to be further enhanced therefore more investigation is suggested on the combination of salt regulation and other membrane design or modification strategies to fully exploit the advantages of salt additives and to pursue more breakthrough of membrane performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14932,proper wastewater treatment has always been the focus of human society and many researchers have been working to find efficient and stable wastewater treatment technologies persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops mainly rely on persulfate activation to form reactive species for pollutants degradation and are considered to be one of the most effective wastewater treatment technologies recently metal carbon hybrid materials have been diffusely used for ps activation because of their high stability abundant active sites and easy applicability metal carbon hybrid materials can successfully overcome the shortcomings of onefold metal catalysts and carbon catalysts by combing the complementary advantages of the two components this article reviews recent studies about metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops for wastewater decontamination the interactions of metal and carbon materials as well as the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials are introduced first then the application and mechanism of metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps activation are presented in detail lastly the modulation methods of metal carbon hybrid materials and their tunable reaction pathways were discussed the prospect of future development directions and challenges is proposed to facilitate metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops to take a step further for practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persulfate activation metal carbon hybrid materials activation mechanism wastewater treatment tunable reaction pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction emerging pollutants are a serious concern on account of their persistence recalcitrance and toxicity in the aquatic environment lai et al 2022 various emerging pollutants have been frequently identified in water environment including fire retardants medicaments and skin care products fu et al 2022 xu et al 2021 without further treatment it may cause acute damage to ecology environment and human health traditional treatment technologies such as adsorption inspissation and membrane separation are insufficient to effectively remove refractory pollutants thus exploring innovative technologies for emerging pollutants removal is critically required advanced oxidation processes aops as popular emerging technologies which can utilize light irradiation electricity or catalysts to activate oxidants to form highly active species and then degrade or even mineralize pollutants li et al 2020a liu et al 2014 ma et al 2021a to date the commonly used aops include persulfate ps activation fenton oxidation photocatalysis lai et al 2021 li et al 2021b zhang et al 2021b etc it is also worth noting that under certain circumstances photocatalysis participates in ps activation or fenton processes among them ps based aops have received comprehensive attention by reason of the satisfactory merits such as relatively high redox potential ease of transport and storage of solid ps and wide environmental applicability under ph range from 2 to 10 despite their potential to introduce sulfate ions liu et al 2020d generally ps includes peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms both of which need to be activated to generate active species via homogeneous or heterogeneous methods yan et al 2021 homogeneous catalytic activators are often difficult to recover and cause the leaching of metal ions in contrast heterogeneous catalysis can effectively mitigate or avoid these problems carbon based materials and metal metal oxide based materials have both been employed extensively as heterogeneous catalysts and both have advantages and disadvantages metal based catalysts have strong catalytic performance but are easy to aggregate and produce a large amount of metal ions leaching li et al 2021c carbon based materials as metal free catalysts are environmentally friendly but exhibit limited catalytic activity liu et al 2022c thus researchers have been working on looking for relatively friendly to the environment low cost and efficient catalysts for ps activation metal carbon hybrid materials as the name suggests are obtained by hybridizing metal and carbon materials which have emerged as promising catalysts in persulfate based aops ps aops compared to carbon based catalysts metal carbon hybrid materials tend to have higher catalytic activity due to the introduction of metal species chu et al 2022 liu et al 2022a if the introduced metal materials are paramagnetic metal carbon hybrid materials can be easily recycled what s more compared to metal based catalysts the metal carbon hybrid materials can reduce metal aggregation and leaching because of the fact of carbon materials large specific surface area ssa and pore structure can stabilize and highly disperse metals shi et al 2022 yang et al 2019 benefiting from the above excellent properties metal carbon hybrid materials are expected to overcome the shortcomings of onefold carbon based and metal based catalysts recently metal carbon hybrid materials have been diffusely used in ps aops for wastewater purifying li et al 2020c xue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c the ps aops mainly possess two reaction pathways namely radical and non radical pathways which can exist concurrently or individually furthermore what is interesting is that radical and non radical pathways can interconvert via modulating the types and intrinsic properties of carbon materials or metal materials or the hybrid forms between carbon materials and metal materials metal loading metal encapsulating and metal doping therefore a comprehensive and in depth understanding of metal carbon hybrid materials is very necessary however as far as we know there is currently an absence of timely review on this topic to provide basic understanding and guidance for further research based on the above the recent research progress about metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops is detailedly reviewed in this article the metal carbon interactions and the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials are first summarized subsequently the different types of metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps activation for wastewater treatment are highlighted ultimately some modulation strategies for the mutual conversion of radicals and non radicals and future research needs for metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops are presented this review article aims to provide readers with basic information and references on metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops for further promoting its research and practice 2 the hybridization of metal materials and carbon materials 2 1 interactions between carbon and metal materials on the one hand because of the interfacial interaction and electron movement between the two components adding metal species to carbon materials typically improves their catalytic performance oyekunle et al 2021 the introduced metal species can be mainly divided into metal nanoparticles nps and single atom metals for metal nps their excess charges will amass at the contact interface with carbon materials due to the charge screening effect forming subnm short range charge transfer on the contrary long range direct charging on the outer surface of metal nps can bypass the serve charge screening metal carbon hybrid materials fermi level and work function can be adjusted through the synergistic effect thereby improving the catalytic performance binninger et al 2017 gerber and serp 2020 for single atom metals when implanting them into the carbon matrix the conductivity of the single electron transfer reactions can be improved and the number of redox sites increased shang et al 2021 at the same time the coordinated metal atoms can also enhance the charge spin redistribution of the carbon framework thus improving the catalytic activity for instance miao et al 2021 prepared a battery of catalysts by anchoring different single atom metals on carbon nanotubes m n cnts they found that the spin state of m n cnts determined their intrinsic catalytic activity to a certain extent and m n cnts with a high spin state had a higher catalytic performance furthermore it is worth noting that if the introduced metal species are magnetic it also facilitates the recovery of the hybrid materials by magnetic separation from water on the other hand carbon substances can be applied as supports for metal species their high graphitic level guarantees high stability because of the low density of edge and defect sites meanwhile metal species can be stably and uniformly dispersed in carbon materials due to the large ssa and pore structures of carbon materials nguyen et al 2019 similarly carbon materials defective sites and groups that contain oxygen can anchor metal components and prevent their undesirable migration terrones et al 2012 recently numerous studies have introduced non metallic heteroatoms to carbon based materials which can locally alter electronic properties and further provide efficient localized grounds for metal species anchoring furthermore the introduced heteroatoms may form synergistic effects with metal substances thereby enhancing the catalytic ability of metal carbon hybrid materials yao et al 2016 2 2 the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials metal carbon hybrid materials are procured by hybridizing metal and carbon materials both of which may activate ps on the one hand as far as metal materials are concerned it includes zero valent metals metal oxides metal sulfides etc generally speaking the active sites of metal catalysts include surface hydroxyl groups oxygen vacancies surface metal sites etc all of which can be used to activate ps on the other hand there are many different kinds of carbon based substances including biochar bc graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts etc the defective sites oxygen containing groups nonmetallic heteroatom dopants etc on the basic plane of carbon based materials can act as prospective active sites for activating ps oyekunle et al 2021 additionally persistent free radicals pfrs which can also potentially act as the active site may be present in some carbon catalysts meanwhile pfrs can provide electrons to promote the redox cycle of metal valence liu et al 2020a compared to the above the complexing structures metal o c metal n c etc at the metal carbon boundaries with catalytic activity are more attractive as a rule these complex structures facilitate charge transport from the metal constituents to the attached π system prompting the interacting regions of the carbon material surface to display denser localized electronic states the oo bond of ps can then be broken by the activated domain to form active species duan et al 2018 for instance liu et al 2022 utilized expanded graphite eg as support to immobilize cufe2o4 to form a composite catalyst eg cufe2o4 u the composite exhibited excellent catalytic performance because of the presence of cu o c and fe o c structure which made for the electron transfer from cufe2o4 to eg surface and then encouraged the electron transfer to pds to form reactive species so4 ˉ ho and 1o2 similarly dung et al 2022 prepared fe3o4 coco3 rgo hybrid via a solvothermal method and found that fe3o4 and coco3 could combine with rgo to form the fe o c and co o c bond these coordination structures could increase the stability of the composite catalyst and reduce metal ions leaching in another work wu s team successfully synthesized novel f n c composites fe2mn1 fe ncs which could efficiently activate pms huang et al 2021 the pyrrolic n and fe pyridinic nc served as main active sites and fe pyridinic nc was mainly responsible for the generation of so4 ˉ and ho 3 metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps activation 3 1 zero valent metal carbon hybrid materials for ps activation as we all know zero valent metals zvms including zero valent iron zero valent copper zero valent manganese etc have been used for ps activation li et al 2020b wang et al 2019b wei et al 2016 during ps activation by zvms low valent metal ions can be usually generated in situ by h corrosion and ps oxidation which induce the generation of active species for pollutants degradation zheng et al 2022 despite zvms have excellent ps activation ability there are still some major drawbacks in the zvms based ps systems ⅰ easy to be oxidized ⅱ easy to agglomerate especially zero valent iron zvi because of strong magnetic attraction and high surface energy ⅲ serious metal ions leaching and poor stability and ⅳ narrow applicable ph range to overcome the above problems zvms carbon hybrid materials are favored by researchers and have been developed among them zero valent iron carbon hybrid materials are a major research hotspot and have been studied the most qian s group synthesized nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi particles with surface iron oxide fe2o3 feo which were embedded in graphitic mesoporous carbon mcfe wu et al 2019 mcfe catalyst possessed outstanding adsorption capacity of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp and could activate pds effectively in contrast to nzvi fe2o3 feo and feso4 mcfe showed the most catalytic ability the produced reactive species so4 ˉ ho o2 ˉ and 1o2 in the mcfe tcp pds system acted as a significant function for tcp removal and 94 8 of tcp could be removed within 180 min even if mcfe was stored for 20 days under air conditions its ability to degrade tcp did not decrease jiang et al 2020 prepared zvi loaded bc zvi bc composites which also exhibited excellent catalytic performance 83 77 removal efficiency of atrazine could be achieved in zvi bc pds system within 30 min under optimal conditions the so4 ˉ and ho were major active species in degrading atrazine which were generated in the pds activation process by zvi and bc co activation in another work nano fe0 was successfully immobilized on mesoporous carbon fe0 mc by using mnco3 as a template jiang et al 2018 fourier translation infrared spectrum ftir was adopted to determine the surface functional groups of fe0 mc and mc the result indicated that the fe0 mc have a fresh peak at 625 cm 1 which may belong to the stretching vibration of fe o fig 1 a fe0 mc exhibited excellent catalytic performance than nano fe0 and mc which ascribed to the synergy between nano fe0 and mc fig 1b the mineralization rate of tetracycline tc could reach 93 2 within 30 in the fe0 mc pds system quenching experiment showed that so4 ˉ produced by the reaction of fe0 and fe2 with pds was the major reactive species for tc degradation fig 1c except for zvi carbon hybrid materials a few other zvm carbon material hybrids have also been reported zero valent co nps co0 n doped carbon co nc 850 catalyst was synthesized and the synthesized procedure is exhibited in fig 1d chen et al 2022b compared with other catalysts co nc 850 showed a higher catalytic activity which could realize 96 5 rhodamine b rhb removal within 15 min a chemical quenching study indicated that 1o2 produced through co0 nps and n doped carbon to co activate pms acted as a major function for rhb degradation fig 1f likewise liu et al 2019 reported that co0 was embedded in n doped porous carbon co nc by pyrolyzing zeolitic imidazolate framework co nc exhibited outstanding catalytic performance in pds activation and achieved effective degradation of p chloroaniline pca the mechanistic survey revealed that pca firstly was absorbed on the co nc then it was rapidly oxidized via radical and non radical processes furthermore sun s group successfully encapsulated ni nanoparticles into n doped porous graphene ni npg via direct pyrolysis and ni0 was the main chemical state for ni nanoparticles kang et al 2019 the unique structure of the carbon wall could protect ni0 to reduce ni ions leaching the n doped porous graphene and ni nanoparticles synergistically acted on pds activation for pollutants degradation and 100 sulfachloropyridazine scp could be removed in 30 min 3 2 metal oxide carbon hybrid materials for ps activation metal oxides especially transition metal oxides have been proved to have the ability to activate ps due to the charge transfer between different valence states of the metal cation men men 1 originating from their multivalence nature cobalt oxides catalysts such as co3o4 have demonstrated outstanding performance in pms activation which have been widely used to activate pms nevertheless health issues have also raised concerns due to the potential threat of cobalt ions leached in water therefore cobalt oxide carbon hybrid materials are vigorously developed hu et al 2021 successfully prepared carbon spheres embedded with oxygen vacant co3o4 co3o4 carbon composites the co o c bonds formed at the cobalt carbon interfaces of co3o4 carbon composites accelerated electron transfer in the co3o4 carbon pms process besides co o c bonds could cooperate with the oxygen vacancies of co3o4 to form reactive radicals the co3o4 carbon composites showed excellent bisphenol a bpa removal rate pms utilization rate and cycle performance another work an original catalyst co3o4 cnts was prepared by liu and coworkers liu et al 2020c firstly co cnts were synthesized by using h2so4 0 8 m to wash the pyrolysis products of zn co metal organic frameworks zn co mofs then co3o4 cnts catalyst was obtained via further pyrolyzing the co cnts in the air fig 2 a the derived co3o4 cnts possessed mesoporous structures which was in favors of the reaction substances to diffuse and transfer mass thus the composite catalyst showed an excellent catalytic performance for oxytetracycline otc degradation than co3o4 and cnts fig 2b in contrast to cobalt oxides manganese oxides iron oxides copper oxides etc are more environmentally friendly and have a high abundance on earth zheng et al 2022 nevertheless they also exist some drawbacks including poor chemical stability dispersibility and cycle performance which limit their practical applications guo et al 2021 utilized ordered mesoporous carbon omc to support mnox and the obtained mnox omc composites could active pms to achieve phenol removal it was revealed that mnox omc composites possessed the strongest catalytic performance than the mixture of mnox and omc owing to the synergy between mnox and omc moreover mnox omc catalysts presented excellent structure stability and reusability liu et al 2021 reported a magnetic nanocomposite fe3o4 cnts formed by confining fe3o4 nps in the multi walled cnts the fe3o4 cnts could effectively activate pds to degrade tetracycline tc it s interesting to note that in contrast to the nanocomposite that supported fe3o4 on the cnts outer surface fe3o4 cnts the fe3o4 cnts possessed a higher degradation rate of tc fig 2c in five cycles of experiments more than 80 of tc could still be degraded and the number of iron ions leaching was extremely low due to the protection of the stable carbon layer structure to fe3o4 nps fig 2d the mechanism was studied via density functional theory dft and the electrostatic potential of different cnts fragments was calculated fig 2e the result indicated that fe3o4 nps served as the promary active sites of fe3o4 cnts which were beneficial to combine with pds to form reactive complexes the above are hybrid materials formed by the hybrid of monometallic oxides and carbon materials for ps activation however in contrast to the combination of monometallic oxides and carbon materials carbon materials supported bimetallic oxides or multi metallic oxides may have a better effect in activating ps to remove pollutants because of the interaction between components thus the bimetallic multi metallic oxide carbon material hybrids have also been widely studied for instance tian and xiao 2020 fabricated a novel catalyst cnts fe mn via hybridizing feox mnoy and oxidized cnts which could effectively activate pms for rhb removal the study found that when cnts were oxidized by 30 wt hno3 and the molar ratio of fe mn was 0 5 the 30 cnts fe mn 0 5 exhibited the best catalytic performance and 95 of rhb was removed within 60 min however the single metal modified 30 cnts materials 30 cnts fe and 30 cnts mn pms system had a lower removal rate of rhb in another work chen et al 2018 synthesized cofe2o4 nps decorated go cofe2o4 go catalyst via a hydrothermal method which could activate pms so that norfloxacin nor was nearly completely removed within 20 min quenching experiments indicated that nonradical pathway acted as a major function for nor degradation the cofe2o4 go presented lower metal ions leaching than pure cofe2o4 owing to the presence of co oh groups in cofe2o4 go composite 3 3 traditional metal sulfide carbon hybrid materials for ps activation traditional metal sulfides tmss are composed of sulfur anion and a metal semi metal cation or cations chandrasekaran et al 2019 until now a variety of tmss including monometallic sulfides bimetallic sulfides etc have been applied to active ps he et al 2021b zhou et al 2018 when tmss act as ps activators their metal species are the main active sites while sulfur species are mainly involved in the redox cycle of metal valence states as a rule tmss possess stronger electrical conductivity catalytic properties redox properties etc than other frequently used metal based catalysts however although tmss catalysts have many advantages there are several shortages including poor dispersion minimized surface active sites and substantial metal ions and sulfur species leaching need to be resolved therefore more and more researchers have been devoted to the development of tmss carbon material hybrids he et al 2021a reported a ball milled magnetic fes bc catalyst and used it for pds activation the introduction of bc could reduce the aggregation of fes furthermore bc could also be used as electronic mediator and adsorption material to facilitate electron conduction between pds and tc so fes bc exhibited high catalytic activity in activating pds and 87 4 tc could be degraded similarly li et al 2022 fabricated fe3s4 bc catalyst via anchoring fe3s4 on the surface of bc for pms activation they also found that the addition of bc could reduce fe3s4 nanoparticles agglomeration as well as accelerate the electron transfer in addition co fe bridges were constructed which was beneficial to the fe3 fe2 cycle fig 3 a b in the fe3s4 bc pms system the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol degradation rate could achieve 100 which was much greater than that of fe3s4 pms bc pms and pms alone systems due to the strong synergy between bc and fe3s4 fig 3c furthermore mos2 nanosheets vertically aligned on bc materials bc300 mos2 were synthesized and used for pms activation su et al 2022 all of the composites with various ratios of mos2 to bc had outstanding catalytic performance and as the mass ratio was 1 the composite material bc300 mos2 1 had the strongest catalytic performance it s worth noting that all composites showed higher catalytic ability than pristine bc and mos2 which ascribed to the increased adsorption ability and production rate of reactive species furthermore the multicomponent tmss catalysts usually exhibit higher catalytic activities than monometallic sulfides on account of the synergy among multiple metal components and the abundant redox reactions for instance nie et al 2019 prepared cufes2 catalyst with abundant surface bonded ferrous which possessed higher activity than cu2s and fes2 therefore the study of multicomponent tmss carbon material hybrids may have more important significance than monometallic tmss carbon material hybrids more recently li and co workers synthesized feco2s4 composite by a modified hydrothermal method which could effectively activate pms for sulfamethoxazole smx removal li et al 2020d in feco2s4 cn pms system the smx degradation rate was 91 9 which was superior to feco2s4 pms g c3n4 pms and co3s4 cn pms systems reflecting that there existed synergy between feco2s4 and g c3n4 this speculation was further confirmed by electrochemical analysis as shown in fig 3d the tafel plots of feco2s4 cn showed the strongest corrosion current 5 45 10 6 meanwhile compared to pure feco2s4 and g c3n4 feco2s4 cn had a lower charge transfer resistance fig 3e moreover researchers also found that the metal ions leaching in the feco2s4 cn pms system was lower than in feco2s4 pms and co3s4 cn pms systems fig 3f in another work du et al 2022 fabricated a hollow multi dimension coces c catalyst which possessed outstanding catalytic performance and stability the composite could activate pms to effectively destroy ofloxacin ofx even in a wide ph range 3 4 layered double hydroxide carbon hybrid material for ps activation layered double hydroxides ldhs often referred to as anionic clays or hydrotalcite are two dimensional 2d positively charged lamellar materials which are composed of metal hydroxides interlayer regions of compensating anions and interlayer water gong et al 2017 the general crystal structure of ldh compounds is shown in fig 4 a scarpellini et al 2014 recently ldhs have been widely used for ps activation due to the layered structure containing abundant reactive sites high interlayer ion exchange capacity and large surface area however the poor chemical stability electrical conductivity and easy agglomeration of ldhs may decrease the catalytic performance carbon materials usually possess remarkable properties such as catalytic ability conductivity high surface etc thus the hybridization of ldhs and carbon materials was considered to be a good way to address the above mentioned issues ldhs can be mainly classified into two categories binary ldh and ternary ldh binary ldh carbon material hybrids are most broadly studied in ps activation a novel ac coated with cofe ldh catalyst ac cofe ldh was prepared by a simple co participation way which showed the strongest catalytic activity for lomefloxacin degradation than bare ac modified ac and cofe ldh as result of the combined action of adsorptive removal and pds activation fig 4b ma et al 2020 huang et al 2020 utilized the ion exchange between no3 and s2o8 2 to intercalate pds into a mixture of reduced graphene oxide rgo and mg al ldhno3 rgo ldh pds compared with pds intercalated ldh without rgo rgo ldh pds could activate more intercalated pds which indicated that it could degrade and mineralize organic pollutants more efficiently in this study radical and non radical paths worked together to attack organic pollutants fig 4c 92 4 phenol could be degraded and its final toc removal was 37 5 7 08 in rgo ldh pds system within 60 min in another work the hybrid material of mg fe ldh bc was first prepared and used for pms activation by ma and coworkers ma et al 2021b in mg fe ldh bc pms system doxycycline dox could be degraded via so4 ˉ ho and 1o2 and the degradation rate was 88 76 within 120 min under the optimal conditions even in the ph range of 3 9 mg fe ldh bc still maintained efficient degradation of dox besides mg fe ldh bc possessed satisfactory reusability the dox degradation rate barely changed after five cycles in contrast to binary ldhs ternary ldhs may possess a better pollutant removal ability and catalyst stability lu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 thus in addition to the widely used binary ldh carbon material hybrids ternary ldhs have also been combined with carbon materials and exhibited outstanding catalytic activity deng et al 2021 successfully inserted go into the interlayer of cofeni ldh cofeni ldh go and the oxygen functional groups of go could combine with metals of ldh the cofeni ldh go catalyst was applied for pms activation to achieve 100 degradation of gatifloxacin gat within 45 min in contrast with the cofeni ldh the cofeni ldh go had a lower concentration of dissolved metal at ph 3 9 owing to the immobilization effect of functional groups on the go surface thus cofeni ldh go possessed outstanding stability and reusability and it could activate pms to completely remove gat within 45 min after four cycles furthermore it is worth noting that ldh carbon hybrid materials not only can solve problems of low stability serious metal leaching and low reusability of ldhs but also can address the aggregation issue of part carbon materials such as rgo for instance chen s group utilized the inner space of femgal ldh to maintain the monolayer structure of rgo and avoid its aggregation fe rgo ldh shahzad et al 2019 for comparison rgo supported femgal ldh composites fe ldh rgo were also successfully synthesized the fe rgo ldh showed superior catalytic performance over fe ldh rgo 100 of phenol was degraded within 30 min in fe rgo ldh pms system this was because rgo in fe ldh rgo composite existed in the form of multiple layers or aggregates which hindered most of active sites a chemical quenching study indicated that so4 ˉ and ho just played a tiny role while 1o2 acted as a leading role for phenol degradation likewise in another work they confined rgo monolayers in ldh interlayer to prepare cu rgo ldh catalyst shahzad et al 2020 cu rgo ldh also showed outstanding catalytic activity owing to its high ssa high electrical conductivity and rich active sites fig 4d besides the nanohybrid possessed broad ph applicability and superior cycle performance fig 4e f 3 5 single atom metals carbon hybrid material for ps activation over recent years a growing number of researchers have looked at single atom catalysts sacs which have applications in various fields it was first used for pms activation to remove pollutants in 2018 by li et al 2018 thus far metal atoms have been anchored using a variety of supports among them using carbon materials as support has the advantage of simple preparation and sustainable development gawande et al 2020 recently carbon based sacs have got extensively developed in ps activation to achieve pollutants removal in contrast with metal nps carbon based sacs always exhibit exceedingly outstanding catalytic activity for ps activation since they may use the metal that serves as the active center to its fullest li et al 2021d prepared fe nps anchored on bc nano fe bc and fe single atom deposited on bc fe sacs bc catalyst and compared their catalytic performance the nano fe bc only could remove 32 67 phenol in 120 min however fe sacs bc could active pms to achieve 100 of phenol degradation within 6 min which was substantially superior over nano fe bc in another work for comparison gao et al 2020 synthesized co nps and co sacs both of which could effectively activate pms but co sacs exhibited higher mass activity for the degradation of bpa fig 5 a meanwhile compared with other recently reported catalysts co sacs still show a prominent degradation rate fig 5b c furthermore the catalytic activity of carbon based sacs in ps activation can be regulated by replacing metal atoms and adjusting the coordination number x metal nx and associated carbon system wei et al 2020 generally co sacs and fe sacs are the mainly carbon based sacs for ps activation liang et al 2022 utilized n doped porous carbon as support to anchor single atom co and then the co single atom could coordinate with three and four n atoms to form cosa n3 and cosa n4 sites among them cosa n3 exhibited optimum catalytic ability to activate pds for bpa removal 100 of bpa was removed within 4 min fig 5d besides cosa n3 possessed demonstrably higher specific activity than conventional catalysts fig 5e zhang and coworkers reported that highly uniform fe n4 sites were supported on carbon nitride fe1 cn via the supermolecule method zhang et al 2021a fe1 cn could effectively activate pms and achieved high efficiency removal rate of p chlorophenol 4 cp fig 5f it s worth noting that there were no so4 ˉ ho o2 ˉ and high valent iron feⅳ in the reaction progress fig 5g however 1o2 was detected and the electron paramagnetic resonance epr results further verified it fig 5h compared with fenp cn the amount of 1o2 produced rose from 43 to 100 as fe sizes shrunk from 200 nm to single atom fig 5i recently the active species that high valent iron oxo have also entered the researcher s field of vision in the sa fe ps system peng et al 2022b utilized g c3n4 as carrier for single atom fe to successfully synthesized a novel catalyst sa fe g c3n4 which could achieve pms activation to form so4 ˉ ho o2 ˉ 1o2 furthermore they also found high valent iron oxy species feⅳ o which was produced by the coordination of the fe ⅲ at the fe n4 center with the o atom in pms to form unstable intermediate fe ⅲ ooso3 and then heterolytic cleavage of the oo bond in unstable intermediate compared with co sacs and fe sacs other carbon based sacs including cu sacs and mn sacs were less applied to activate ps wu s group used rgo as support for single atom cu to successfully prepare sa cu rgo catalysts which showed excellent catalytic performance because both rgo and abundant cu single atom could work together to activate pms chen et al 2020 thus about 90 of smx was removed in 60 min at a wide ph range while toc removal rate could achieve over 99 within 120 min at ph 6 yang et al 2020 utilized mn doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursor to prepare mn sacs the mnn4 site of mn sacs was the active site which could activate pms to form so4 ˉ and ho moreover the pyrrolic n site could adsorb bpa thus the migration distance between radicals and adsorbed bpa was shortened which notably improved bpa removal rate recently to further enhance the catalytic ability of sacs diatomic metal sacs have been prepared chen et al 2022a anchored fe bi dual single atom on carbon based material febi nc via pyrolyzing the mixture of fe and bi co doped metal organic framework and dicyandiamide the febi cn showed outstanding catalytic performance for pms activation and outstanding stability owing to the presence of fe n4 site and bi n4 site so4 ˉ ho and 1o2 coexisted in the febi cn pms system dft calculation further provided theoretical insight for the activation of pms both fe n4 site and bi n4 site possessed strong e ads and long l oo of absorbed pms indicating its high pms activation ability furthermore it was discovered by the charge density study that the electron transfer from the metal n4 site to pms promoted pms activation based on the above there are various types of hybrid materials which all have excellent catalytic performance and can effectively activate ps to degrade pollutants the mechanism of ps activation by metal carbon hybrid materials is determined by a combination of the metal species the carbon materials and the complexation structures at the metal carbon boundary therefore all types of hybrid materials pms systems may generate radical and or nonradical pathways in addition these metal carbon hybrid materials generally show relatively strong stability in ps activation due to the immobilization and dispersion of metal species by carbon materials meanwhile it s worth noting that the different types of hybrid materials also have some differences in ps activation for instance zero valent metal carbon hybrid materials have lower reusability than other metal carbon hybrid materials because of the easy oxidation of zero valent metal by contrast the reusability of single atom carbon hybrid materials is generally superior as a result of the strong coordination structure between metal species and the carbon matrix however if a more precise comparison of the superiority of different types of hybrid materials is required this still needs to be specific to the individual target metal carbon hybrid catalyst 4 tuning metal carbon hybrid materials to activate ps 4 1 modulation of carbon materials it is commonly known that various carbon materials have varied intrinsic structural properties selecting different types of carbon materials and the same metal species hybridization will lead to different effects for example li s team chose g c3n4 as the carrier of cryptomelane type manganese oxide oms 2 to prepare an oms 2 g c3n4 catalyst which activated pms to form high active manganese species and caged radicals for degrading acid orange 7 ao7 li et al 2017 in other studies they respectively utilized carbon graphite gt and nanofibers cnfs as oms 2 support to synthesize oms 2 gt and oms 2 cnfs composites that could both activate pms for ao7 removal fang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a however the major active species in the oms 2 gt pms and oms 2 cnfs pms systems in contrast to the oms 2 g c3n4 pms system were instead ho and so4 ˉ respectively rather than high active manganese species and caged radicals the phenomenon might be due to various manganese species in these catalysts which are connected to the inherent characteristics of carbon materials for example the reduction properties of the above three carbon materials to manganese oxide are different besides due to cnfs possessed abundant o species which could combine with a portion of mno6 units to generate complexes thus the ps activation mechanism can be changed via tuning the inherent characteristics of carbon materials non metallic heteroatom doping is another popular method for changing the intrinsic properties of carbon materials take n doping as an example n atoms can modulate the binding of metal particles to form a comparable atom size which ultimately affects the catalytic ability and activation mechanism of the catalyst yu et al 2022 prepared fe doped carbon fe c and fe n codoped carbon fe n c catalysts and compared their catalytic performance and the mechanism of activating pms the findings of the study demonstrated that the fe n c catalyst had a stronger ability to activate pms at the same time an interesting phenomenon was discovered that the iron particle size in fe c catalyst was reduced due to the introduction of n atoms besides the active sites of fe n c catalyst were fe n coordination and graphitic n bonded cn sites which were different form fe c catalyst quenching experiments indicated that only feⅳ o species existed in fe c pms system however both radical and nonradical 1o2 coexisted in the fe n c pms system 4 2 modulation of metal materials similar to carbon materials the types of metal materials are also diverse and choosing different metal materials to hybridize with the same carbon materials will also lead to different results wu et al 2020 showed that radicals so4 ˉ ho and nonradicals coexisted in the mno2 go pms system for removing nor deng et al 2021 also chose go as a carrier for the preparation of cofeni ldh go composites however cofeni ldh go exhibited different pms activation mechanisms producing only so4 ˉ to degrade gat this is because the selection of different types of metal species will change the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials which are important for the realizing of the transformation of the pms activation mechanism in addition to changing metal types modulating metal species size is also an effective strategy especially when metal species size is reduced to single atom which will further boost the catalytic performance and result in a novel ps activation mechanism zhang and coworkers compared carbon nitride supported fe sac fe1 cn and cn supported fe nanoparticles fenp cn catalyst zhang et al 2021a the study found that fenp cn could activate pms to form radicals and nonradical 1o2 however with fe size shrunk to single atom the above radicals were not existing in the fe1 cn pms system and the 1o2 production increased from 43 to 100 in another study li et al 2021d utilized hierarchical porous biochar as support for fe single atom and fe nanoparticles to prepare isa fe mc and nano fe mc composites respectively quenching experiment verified that the fe ⅱ mediated radical pathway so4 ˉ and ho was dominant pathway for phenol removal in the nano fe mc pms system compared with nano fe mc isa fe mc composites had many more active sites thereby the so4 ˉ and ho were no longer the main reason for the phenol removal but electron transfer pathway 4 3 modulation of hybrid forms between carbon materials and metal materials the hybrid forms between carbon materials and metal materials include metal loading metal encapsulating metal doping etc metal loading can observably relieve the leaching issue of meta ions because of the tight surface confinement and decreased dosage moreover metal species can be highly dispersed on carbon supports which helps to ensure that active sites are adequately exposed as with metal loading metal encapsulating and metal doping also have the same advantages described above it is important to note that they also have extremely strong antioxidant capacity when metal species are enclosed by carbon materials or confined within the carbon network by covalent bonds metal species and carbon materials take different hybrid forms and the properties of the obtained metal carbon hybrid materials are different in all aspects su et al 2021 prepared two catalysts including fe3o4 embedded in cnts fe3o4 in cnts and fe3o4 loaded on the surface fe3o4 out cnts compared with fe3o4 out cnts fe3o4 in cnts catalyst showed stronger catalytic performance while its total iron leaching was lower the masking experiment and epr data showed that with the transition from fe3o4 out cnts to fe3o4 in cnts catalyst the function of 1o2 for smt degradation was reduced by half and the function of ho increased from 39 13 to 54 71 furthermore liu et al 2020b synthesized co3o4 cnt composites in which co3o4 was wrapped by cnt materials and the composites could activate pms to degrade nor this study proposed a possible mechanism that 1o2 served as a main function in nor elimination in the co3o4 cnt pms system in another work peng and coworkers synthesized co3o4 cnt catalysts in which co3o4 was supported in cnt materials peng et al 2022a they verified that radicals so4 ˉ ho were the major reason for amlodipine degradation in the reaction process which was distinct from the co3o4 cnt pms reaction system studied above these occurrences might result from the electron density of the graphene layers shifting from the inner to the outer surface of the cnt walls creating a potential difference as a result the metal species anchored on the outer surface of cnt often exhibit different catalytic performance and activation mechanisms than those within to sum up modulating the types and inherent characteristics of carbon or metal materials are crucial to improve the catalytic ability of metal caron hybrid catalysts and to change ps activation mechanism meanwhile the interaction between metal species and carbon based materials is likewise of utmost significance charge transfer and electron redistribution are induced by the different fermi levels of metal species and carbon based materials which even modify the oxidation state of the active sites qian et al 2020 besides when carbon materials provide confinement space for metal species the resulting metal carbon hybrid materials have more elusive properties for ps activation 5 guiding significance as efficient catalysts the metal content of metal carbon hybrid materials is one of the key factors determining their catalytic activity table 1 summarizes the metal content and catalytic effectiveness of several metal carbon hybrid catalysts the single atom carbon hybrid materials tend to have significantly lower metal content than metal nps carbon hybrid materials but they exhibit higher catalytic performance which is because of the excellent utilization efficiency of single atom metals in the catalytic reaction generally increasing the metal content to a certain extent can enhance the catalytic performance of metal carbon hybrid materials however excessive metal content will inevitably induce metal agglomeration which in turn leads to a decrease in catalytic performance therefore it is required to investigate effective ways to enhance the metal content of metal carbon hybrid materials especially single atom metals carbon hybrid materials without causing severe agglomeration of metal species to balance the high metal content and metal agglomeration the design of metal carbon hybrid materials may be theoretically modeled and predicted using quantum chemistry to maximize catalytic performance in addition to the issue of metal content further improving the cycling stability of metal carbon materials remains a challenge although they are already better than most other catalysts the metal leaching is the main reason for the decreased cycling stability of metal carbon hybrid materials and may also cause secondary pollution to the environment therefore forming a strong coordination structure at the metal carbon boundaries possesses significant meaning to enhance the stability of metal species at the same time the coordination environment can be modulated by some methods such as heteroatoms doping creating defects etc besides carbon materials can encapsulate metal species by forming a core shell structure providing a confined environment the carbon shell inhibits the massive leaching of metals which makes metal carbon hybrid materials maintain outstanding catalytic performance after multiple reuses compared to the above problems it is critical to identify the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials and to delineate their respective roles and synergistic effects metal carbon hybrid materials possess multiple potential active sites including metal sites non metal sites etc which may induce ps activation to form radicals and or non radicals radicals so4 ˉ and ho can degrade most contaminants and achieve mineralization because of their strong oxidizing ability however in the face of complex real water bodies they are susceptible to inorganic anions and difficult to selectively degrade pollutants in contrast non radicals 1o2 electron transfer high valent metals are less affected by inorganic anions and can selectively degrade electron rich pollutants unfortunately non radical pathways generally have a lower ability to mineralize pollutants therefore it is very meaningful to select the corresponding degradation pathway according to the specific water conditions and actual needs up to now predictable and precise regulation of the activation mechanism of ps by hybrid materials remains a great challenge dft calculations and data analysis based on machine learning should be increasingly applied to this technology 6 conclusion and perspectives metal carbon hybrid materials are attractive catalysts for ps aops as they have many advantages compared with other catalyst materials fig 6 summarizes the main advantages of metal carbon hybrid materials metal species carbon materials characteristics defective sites oxygen containing groups and nonmetallic heteroatom dopants etc and the complexing structures metal o c metal n c etc are the major active sites of meal carbon hybrid materials many different metal carbon hybrid materials have been used to activate ps for pollutants removal in wastewater via radical and or nonradical pathways more importantly the activation mechanism changes can be achieved by modulating carbon materials metal materials and the hybrid form between them thus metal carbon hybrid materials are considered promising catalysts for ps aops however despite the research on metal carbon hybrid materials has made great progress there are still major challenges in their preparation and application on a large scale to be specific the synthesis methods of metal carbon hybrid materials are limited and complex meanwhile the high cost of some precursor materials makes it difficult to meet the needs of practical applications therefore metal carbon hybrid materials still need further optimization before reaching industrial applications some points about future studies are as follows 1 most studies of complex structures at the metal carbon boundaries have focused on metal o c and metal n c bond while metal species coordinated with other heteroatoms like s p and b have been studied less thus exploring fresh complex structures may be beneficial to adjust the catalytic performance of metal carbon hybrid materials 2 the actual water environment usually contains complex background components which may affect the catalytic performance of metal carbon hybrid materials by consuming active species forming surface contamination deactivating active sites etc therefore it is necessary to construct metal carbon hybrid catalysts with high stability and reactivity additionally this technology can also be utilized in conjunction with other technologies to enhance catalytic performance 3 up to now most experiments are still confined to the laboratory and to achieve the large scale application of this technology metal carbon hybrid materials should be integrated into designated equipment or continuous reactors for further research 4 to fully recycle waste as precursors of carbon materials or and metal species and explore facile synthetic methods of metal carbon hybrid materials are beneficial to reducing material costs and manufacturing costs for practical applications declaration of

14932,proper wastewater treatment has always been the focus of human society and many researchers have been working to find efficient and stable wastewater treatment technologies persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops mainly rely on persulfate activation to form reactive species for pollutants degradation and are considered to be one of the most effective wastewater treatment technologies recently metal carbon hybrid materials have been diffusely used for ps activation because of their high stability abundant active sites and easy applicability metal carbon hybrid materials can successfully overcome the shortcomings of onefold metal catalysts and carbon catalysts by combing the complementary advantages of the two components this article reviews recent studies about metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops for wastewater decontamination the interactions of metal and carbon materials as well as the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials are introduced first then the application and mechanism of metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps activation are presented in detail lastly the modulation methods of metal carbon hybrid materials and their tunable reaction pathways were discussed the prospect of future development directions and challenges is proposed to facilitate metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops to take a step further for practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persulfate activation metal carbon hybrid materials activation mechanism wastewater treatment tunable reaction pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction emerging pollutants are a serious concern on account of their persistence recalcitrance and toxicity in the aquatic environment lai et al 2022 various emerging pollutants have been frequently identified in water environment including fire retardants medicaments and skin care products fu et al 2022 xu et al 2021 without further treatment it may cause acute damage to ecology environment and human health traditional treatment technologies such as adsorption inspissation and membrane separation are insufficient to effectively remove refractory pollutants thus exploring innovative technologies for emerging pollutants removal is critically required advanced oxidation processes aops as popular emerging technologies which can utilize light irradiation electricity or catalysts to activate oxidants to form highly active species and then degrade or even mineralize pollutants li et al 2020a liu et al 2014 ma et al 2021a to date the commonly used aops include persulfate ps activation fenton oxidation photocatalysis lai et al 2021 li et al 2021b zhang et al 2021b etc it is also worth noting that under certain circumstances photocatalysis participates in ps activation or fenton processes among them ps based aops have received comprehensive attention by reason of the satisfactory merits such as relatively high redox potential ease of transport and storage of solid ps and wide environmental applicability under ph range from 2 to 10 despite their potential to introduce sulfate ions liu et al 2020d generally ps includes peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms both of which need to be activated to generate active species via homogeneous or heterogeneous methods yan et al 2021 homogeneous catalytic activators are often difficult to recover and cause the leaching of metal ions in contrast heterogeneous catalysis can effectively mitigate or avoid these problems carbon based materials and metal metal oxide based materials have both been employed extensively as heterogeneous catalysts and both have advantages and disadvantages metal based catalysts have strong catalytic performance but are easy to aggregate and produce a large amount of metal ions leaching li et al 2021c carbon based materials as metal free catalysts are environmentally friendly but exhibit limited catalytic activity liu et al 2022c thus researchers have been working on looking for relatively friendly to the environment low cost and efficient catalysts for ps activation metal carbon hybrid materials as the name suggests are obtained by hybridizing metal and carbon materials which have emerged as promising catalysts in persulfate based aops ps aops compared to carbon based catalysts metal carbon hybrid materials tend to have higher catalytic activity due to the introduction of metal species chu et al 2022 liu et al 2022a if the introduced metal materials are paramagnetic metal carbon hybrid materials can be easily recycled what s more compared to metal based catalysts the metal carbon hybrid materials can reduce metal aggregation and leaching because of the fact of carbon materials large specific surface area ssa and pore structure can stabilize and highly disperse metals shi et al 2022 yang et al 2019 benefiting from the above excellent properties metal carbon hybrid materials are expected to overcome the shortcomings of onefold carbon based and metal based catalysts recently metal carbon hybrid materials have been diffusely used in ps aops for wastewater purifying li et al 2020c xue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c the ps aops mainly possess two reaction pathways namely radical and non radical pathways which can exist concurrently or individually furthermore what is interesting is that radical and non radical pathways can interconvert via modulating the types and intrinsic properties of carbon materials or metal materials or the hybrid forms between carbon materials and metal materials metal loading metal encapsulating and metal doping therefore a comprehensive and in depth understanding of metal carbon hybrid materials is very necessary however as far as we know there is currently an absence of timely review on this topic to provide basic understanding and guidance for further research based on the above the recent research progress about metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops is detailedly reviewed in this article the metal carbon interactions and the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials are first summarized subsequently the different types of metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps activation for wastewater treatment are highlighted ultimately some modulation strategies for the mutual conversion of radicals and non radicals and future research needs for metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops are presented this review article aims to provide readers with basic information and references on metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps aops for further promoting its research and practice 2 the hybridization of metal materials and carbon materials 2 1 interactions between carbon and metal materials on the one hand because of the interfacial interaction and electron movement between the two components adding metal species to carbon materials typically improves their catalytic performance oyekunle et al 2021 the introduced metal species can be mainly divided into metal nanoparticles nps and single atom metals for metal nps their excess charges will amass at the contact interface with carbon materials due to the charge screening effect forming subnm short range charge transfer on the contrary long range direct charging on the outer surface of metal nps can bypass the serve charge screening metal carbon hybrid materials fermi level and work function can be adjusted through the synergistic effect thereby improving the catalytic performance binninger et al 2017 gerber and serp 2020 for single atom metals when implanting them into the carbon matrix the conductivity of the single electron transfer reactions can be improved and the number of redox sites increased shang et al 2021 at the same time the coordinated metal atoms can also enhance the charge spin redistribution of the carbon framework thus improving the catalytic activity for instance miao et al 2021 prepared a battery of catalysts by anchoring different single atom metals on carbon nanotubes m n cnts they found that the spin state of m n cnts determined their intrinsic catalytic activity to a certain extent and m n cnts with a high spin state had a higher catalytic performance furthermore it is worth noting that if the introduced metal species are magnetic it also facilitates the recovery of the hybrid materials by magnetic separation from water on the other hand carbon substances can be applied as supports for metal species their high graphitic level guarantees high stability because of the low density of edge and defect sites meanwhile metal species can be stably and uniformly dispersed in carbon materials due to the large ssa and pore structures of carbon materials nguyen et al 2019 similarly carbon materials defective sites and groups that contain oxygen can anchor metal components and prevent their undesirable migration terrones et al 2012 recently numerous studies have introduced non metallic heteroatoms to carbon based materials which can locally alter electronic properties and further provide efficient localized grounds for metal species anchoring furthermore the introduced heteroatoms may form synergistic effects with metal substances thereby enhancing the catalytic ability of metal carbon hybrid materials yao et al 2016 2 2 the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials metal carbon hybrid materials are procured by hybridizing metal and carbon materials both of which may activate ps on the one hand as far as metal materials are concerned it includes zero valent metals metal oxides metal sulfides etc generally speaking the active sites of metal catalysts include surface hydroxyl groups oxygen vacancies surface metal sites etc all of which can be used to activate ps on the other hand there are many different kinds of carbon based substances including biochar bc graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts etc the defective sites oxygen containing groups nonmetallic heteroatom dopants etc on the basic plane of carbon based materials can act as prospective active sites for activating ps oyekunle et al 2021 additionally persistent free radicals pfrs which can also potentially act as the active site may be present in some carbon catalysts meanwhile pfrs can provide electrons to promote the redox cycle of metal valence liu et al 2020a compared to the above the complexing structures metal o c metal n c etc at the metal carbon boundaries with catalytic activity are more attractive as a rule these complex structures facilitate charge transport from the metal constituents to the attached π system prompting the interacting regions of the carbon material surface to display denser localized electronic states the oo bond of ps can then be broken by the activated domain to form active species duan et al 2018 for instance liu et al 2022 utilized expanded graphite eg as support to immobilize cufe2o4 to form a composite catalyst eg cufe2o4 u the composite exhibited excellent catalytic performance because of the presence of cu o c and fe o c structure which made for the electron transfer from cufe2o4 to eg surface and then encouraged the electron transfer to pds to form reactive species so4 ˉ ho and 1o2 similarly dung et al 2022 prepared fe3o4 coco3 rgo hybrid via a solvothermal method and found that fe3o4 and coco3 could combine with rgo to form the fe o c and co o c bond these coordination structures could increase the stability of the composite catalyst and reduce metal ions leaching in another work wu s team successfully synthesized novel f n c composites fe2mn1 fe ncs which could efficiently activate pms huang et al 2021 the pyrrolic n and fe pyridinic nc served as main active sites and fe pyridinic nc was mainly responsible for the generation of so4 ˉ and ho 3 metal carbon hybrid materials mediated ps activation 3 1 zero valent metal carbon hybrid materials for ps activation as we all know zero valent metals zvms including zero valent iron zero valent copper zero valent manganese etc have been used for ps activation li et al 2020b wang et al 2019b wei et al 2016 during ps activation by zvms low valent metal ions can be usually generated in situ by h corrosion and ps oxidation which induce the generation of active species for pollutants degradation zheng et al 2022 despite zvms have excellent ps activation ability there are still some major drawbacks in the zvms based ps systems ⅰ easy to be oxidized ⅱ easy to agglomerate especially zero valent iron zvi because of strong magnetic attraction and high surface energy ⅲ serious metal ions leaching and poor stability and ⅳ narrow applicable ph range to overcome the above problems zvms carbon hybrid materials are favored by researchers and have been developed among them zero valent iron carbon hybrid materials are a major research hotspot and have been studied the most qian s group synthesized nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi particles with surface iron oxide fe2o3 feo which were embedded in graphitic mesoporous carbon mcfe wu et al 2019 mcfe catalyst possessed outstanding adsorption capacity of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp and could activate pds effectively in contrast to nzvi fe2o3 feo and feso4 mcfe showed the most catalytic ability the produced reactive species so4 ˉ ho o2 ˉ and 1o2 in the mcfe tcp pds system acted as a significant function for tcp removal and 94 8 of tcp could be removed within 180 min even if mcfe was stored for 20 days under air conditions its ability to degrade tcp did not decrease jiang et al 2020 prepared zvi loaded bc zvi bc composites which also exhibited excellent catalytic performance 83 77 removal efficiency of atrazine could be achieved in zvi bc pds system within 30 min under optimal conditions the so4 ˉ and ho were major active species in degrading atrazine which were generated in the pds activation process by zvi and bc co activation in another work nano fe0 was successfully immobilized on mesoporous carbon fe0 mc by using mnco3 as a template jiang et al 2018 fourier translation infrared spectrum ftir was adopted to determine the surface functional groups of fe0 mc and mc the result indicated that the fe0 mc have a fresh peak at 625 cm 1 which may belong to the stretching vibration of fe o fig 1 a fe0 mc exhibited excellent catalytic performance than nano fe0 and mc which ascribed to the synergy between nano fe0 and mc fig 1b the mineralization rate of tetracycline tc could reach 93 2 within 30 in the fe0 mc pds system quenching experiment showed that so4 ˉ produced by the reaction of fe0 and fe2 with pds was the major reactive species for tc degradation fig 1c except for zvi carbon hybrid materials a few other zvm carbon material hybrids have also been reported zero valent co nps co0 n doped carbon co nc 850 catalyst was synthesized and the synthesized procedure is exhibited in fig 1d chen et al 2022b compared with other catalysts co nc 850 showed a higher catalytic activity which could realize 96 5 rhodamine b rhb removal within 15 min a chemical quenching study indicated that 1o2 produced through co0 nps and n doped carbon to co activate pms acted as a major function for rhb degradation fig 1f likewise liu et al 2019 reported that co0 was embedded in n doped porous carbon co nc by pyrolyzing zeolitic imidazolate framework co nc exhibited outstanding catalytic performance in pds activation and achieved effective degradation of p chloroaniline pca the mechanistic survey revealed that pca firstly was absorbed on the co nc then it was rapidly oxidized via radical and non radical processes furthermore sun s group successfully encapsulated ni nanoparticles into n doped porous graphene ni npg via direct pyrolysis and ni0 was the main chemical state for ni nanoparticles kang et al 2019 the unique structure of the carbon wall could protect ni0 to reduce ni ions leaching the n doped porous graphene and ni nanoparticles synergistically acted on pds activation for pollutants degradation and 100 sulfachloropyridazine scp could be removed in 30 min 3 2 metal oxide carbon hybrid materials for ps activation metal oxides especially transition metal oxides have been proved to have the ability to activate ps due to the charge transfer between different valence states of the metal cation men men 1 originating from their multivalence nature cobalt oxides catalysts such as co3o4 have demonstrated outstanding performance in pms activation which have been widely used to activate pms nevertheless health issues have also raised concerns due to the potential threat of cobalt ions leached in water therefore cobalt oxide carbon hybrid materials are vigorously developed hu et al 2021 successfully prepared carbon spheres embedded with oxygen vacant co3o4 co3o4 carbon composites the co o c bonds formed at the cobalt carbon interfaces of co3o4 carbon composites accelerated electron transfer in the co3o4 carbon pms process besides co o c bonds could cooperate with the oxygen vacancies of co3o4 to form reactive radicals the co3o4 carbon composites showed excellent bisphenol a bpa removal rate pms utilization rate and cycle performance another work an original catalyst co3o4 cnts was prepared by liu and coworkers liu et al 2020c firstly co cnts were synthesized by using h2so4 0 8 m to wash the pyrolysis products of zn co metal organic frameworks zn co mofs then co3o4 cnts catalyst was obtained via further pyrolyzing the co cnts in the air fig 2 a the derived co3o4 cnts possessed mesoporous structures which was in favors of the reaction substances to diffuse and transfer mass thus the composite catalyst showed an excellent catalytic performance for oxytetracycline otc degradation than co3o4 and cnts fig 2b in contrast to cobalt oxides manganese oxides iron oxides copper oxides etc are more environmentally friendly and have a high abundance on earth zheng et al 2022 nevertheless they also exist some drawbacks including poor chemical stability dispersibility and cycle performance which limit their practical applications guo et al 2021 utilized ordered mesoporous carbon omc to support mnox and the obtained mnox omc composites could active pms to achieve phenol removal it was revealed that mnox omc composites possessed the strongest catalytic performance than the mixture of mnox and omc owing to the synergy between mnox and omc moreover mnox omc catalysts presented excellent structure stability and reusability liu et al 2021 reported a magnetic nanocomposite fe3o4 cnts formed by confining fe3o4 nps in the multi walled cnts the fe3o4 cnts could effectively activate pds to degrade tetracycline tc it s interesting to note that in contrast to the nanocomposite that supported fe3o4 on the cnts outer surface fe3o4 cnts the fe3o4 cnts possessed a higher degradation rate of tc fig 2c in five cycles of experiments more than 80 of tc could still be degraded and the number of iron ions leaching was extremely low due to the protection of the stable carbon layer structure to fe3o4 nps fig 2d the mechanism was studied via density functional theory dft and the electrostatic potential of different cnts fragments was calculated fig 2e the result indicated that fe3o4 nps served as the promary active sites of fe3o4 cnts which were beneficial to combine with pds to form reactive complexes the above are hybrid materials formed by the hybrid of monometallic oxides and carbon materials for ps activation however in contrast to the combination of monometallic oxides and carbon materials carbon materials supported bimetallic oxides or multi metallic oxides may have a better effect in activating ps to remove pollutants because of the interaction between components thus the bimetallic multi metallic oxide carbon material hybrids have also been widely studied for instance tian and xiao 2020 fabricated a novel catalyst cnts fe mn via hybridizing feox mnoy and oxidized cnts which could effectively activate pms for rhb removal the study found that when cnts were oxidized by 30 wt hno3 and the molar ratio of fe mn was 0 5 the 30 cnts fe mn 0 5 exhibited the best catalytic performance and 95 of rhb was removed within 60 min however the single metal modified 30 cnts materials 30 cnts fe and 30 cnts mn pms system had a lower removal rate of rhb in another work chen et al 2018 synthesized cofe2o4 nps decorated go cofe2o4 go catalyst via a hydrothermal method which could activate pms so that norfloxacin nor was nearly completely removed within 20 min quenching experiments indicated that nonradical pathway acted as a major function for nor degradation the cofe2o4 go presented lower metal ions leaching than pure cofe2o4 owing to the presence of co oh groups in cofe2o4 go composite 3 3 traditional metal sulfide carbon hybrid materials for ps activation traditional metal sulfides tmss are composed of sulfur anion and a metal semi metal cation or cations chandrasekaran et al 2019 until now a variety of tmss including monometallic sulfides bimetallic sulfides etc have been applied to active ps he et al 2021b zhou et al 2018 when tmss act as ps activators their metal species are the main active sites while sulfur species are mainly involved in the redox cycle of metal valence states as a rule tmss possess stronger electrical conductivity catalytic properties redox properties etc than other frequently used metal based catalysts however although tmss catalysts have many advantages there are several shortages including poor dispersion minimized surface active sites and substantial metal ions and sulfur species leaching need to be resolved therefore more and more researchers have been devoted to the development of tmss carbon material hybrids he et al 2021a reported a ball milled magnetic fes bc catalyst and used it for pds activation the introduction of bc could reduce the aggregation of fes furthermore bc could also be used as electronic mediator and adsorption material to facilitate electron conduction between pds and tc so fes bc exhibited high catalytic activity in activating pds and 87 4 tc could be degraded similarly li et al 2022 fabricated fe3s4 bc catalyst via anchoring fe3s4 on the surface of bc for pms activation they also found that the addition of bc could reduce fe3s4 nanoparticles agglomeration as well as accelerate the electron transfer in addition co fe bridges were constructed which was beneficial to the fe3 fe2 cycle fig 3 a b in the fe3s4 bc pms system the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol degradation rate could achieve 100 which was much greater than that of fe3s4 pms bc pms and pms alone systems due to the strong synergy between bc and fe3s4 fig 3c furthermore mos2 nanosheets vertically aligned on bc materials bc300 mos2 were synthesized and used for pms activation su et al 2022 all of the composites with various ratios of mos2 to bc had outstanding catalytic performance and as the mass ratio was 1 the composite material bc300 mos2 1 had the strongest catalytic performance it s worth noting that all composites showed higher catalytic ability than pristine bc and mos2 which ascribed to the increased adsorption ability and production rate of reactive species furthermore the multicomponent tmss catalysts usually exhibit higher catalytic activities than monometallic sulfides on account of the synergy among multiple metal components and the abundant redox reactions for instance nie et al 2019 prepared cufes2 catalyst with abundant surface bonded ferrous which possessed higher activity than cu2s and fes2 therefore the study of multicomponent tmss carbon material hybrids may have more important significance than monometallic tmss carbon material hybrids more recently li and co workers synthesized feco2s4 composite by a modified hydrothermal method which could effectively activate pms for sulfamethoxazole smx removal li et al 2020d in feco2s4 cn pms system the smx degradation rate was 91 9 which was superior to feco2s4 pms g c3n4 pms and co3s4 cn pms systems reflecting that there existed synergy between feco2s4 and g c3n4 this speculation was further confirmed by electrochemical analysis as shown in fig 3d the tafel plots of feco2s4 cn showed the strongest corrosion current 5 45 10 6 meanwhile compared to pure feco2s4 and g c3n4 feco2s4 cn had a lower charge transfer resistance fig 3e moreover researchers also found that the metal ions leaching in the feco2s4 cn pms system was lower than in feco2s4 pms and co3s4 cn pms systems fig 3f in another work du et al 2022 fabricated a hollow multi dimension coces c catalyst which possessed outstanding catalytic performance and stability the composite could activate pms to effectively destroy ofloxacin ofx even in a wide ph range 3 4 layered double hydroxide carbon hybrid material for ps activation layered double hydroxides ldhs often referred to as anionic clays or hydrotalcite are two dimensional 2d positively charged lamellar materials which are composed of metal hydroxides interlayer regions of compensating anions and interlayer water gong et al 2017 the general crystal structure of ldh compounds is shown in fig 4 a scarpellini et al 2014 recently ldhs have been widely used for ps activation due to the layered structure containing abundant reactive sites high interlayer ion exchange capacity and large surface area however the poor chemical stability electrical conductivity and easy agglomeration of ldhs may decrease the catalytic performance carbon materials usually possess remarkable properties such as catalytic ability conductivity high surface etc thus the hybridization of ldhs and carbon materials was considered to be a good way to address the above mentioned issues ldhs can be mainly classified into two categories binary ldh and ternary ldh binary ldh carbon material hybrids are most broadly studied in ps activation a novel ac coated with cofe ldh catalyst ac cofe ldh was prepared by a simple co participation way which showed the strongest catalytic activity for lomefloxacin degradation than bare ac modified ac and cofe ldh as result of the combined action of adsorptive removal and pds activation fig 4b ma et al 2020 huang et al 2020 utilized the ion exchange between no3 and s2o8 2 to intercalate pds into a mixture of reduced graphene oxide rgo and mg al ldhno3 rgo ldh pds compared with pds intercalated ldh without rgo rgo ldh pds could activate more intercalated pds which indicated that it could degrade and mineralize organic pollutants more efficiently in this study radical and non radical paths worked together to attack organic pollutants fig 4c 92 4 phenol could be degraded and its final toc removal was 37 5 7 08 in rgo ldh pds system within 60 min in another work the hybrid material of mg fe ldh bc was first prepared and used for pms activation by ma and coworkers ma et al 2021b in mg fe ldh bc pms system doxycycline dox could be degraded via so4 ˉ ho and 1o2 and the degradation rate was 88 76 within 120 min under the optimal conditions even in the ph range of 3 9 mg fe ldh bc still maintained efficient degradation of dox besides mg fe ldh bc possessed satisfactory reusability the dox degradation rate barely changed after five cycles in contrast to binary ldhs ternary ldhs may possess a better pollutant removal ability and catalyst stability lu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 thus in addition to the widely used binary ldh carbon material hybrids ternary ldhs have also been combined with carbon materials and exhibited outstanding catalytic activity deng et al 2021 successfully inserted go into the interlayer of cofeni ldh cofeni ldh go and the oxygen functional groups of go could combine with metals of ldh the cofeni ldh go catalyst was applied for pms activation to achieve 100 degradation of gatifloxacin gat within 45 min in contrast with the cofeni ldh the cofeni ldh go had a lower concentration of dissolved metal at ph 3 9 owing to the immobilization effect of functional groups on the go surface thus cofeni ldh go possessed outstanding stability and reusability and it could activate pms to completely remove gat within 45 min after four cycles furthermore it is worth noting that ldh carbon hybrid materials not only can solve problems of low stability serious metal leaching and low reusability of ldhs but also can address the aggregation issue of part carbon materials such as rgo for instance chen s group utilized the inner space of femgal ldh to maintain the monolayer structure of rgo and avoid its aggregation fe rgo ldh shahzad et al 2019 for comparison rgo supported femgal ldh composites fe ldh rgo were also successfully synthesized the fe rgo ldh showed superior catalytic performance over fe ldh rgo 100 of phenol was degraded within 30 min in fe rgo ldh pms system this was because rgo in fe ldh rgo composite existed in the form of multiple layers or aggregates which hindered most of active sites a chemical quenching study indicated that so4 ˉ and ho just played a tiny role while 1o2 acted as a leading role for phenol degradation likewise in another work they confined rgo monolayers in ldh interlayer to prepare cu rgo ldh catalyst shahzad et al 2020 cu rgo ldh also showed outstanding catalytic activity owing to its high ssa high electrical conductivity and rich active sites fig 4d besides the nanohybrid possessed broad ph applicability and superior cycle performance fig 4e f 3 5 single atom metals carbon hybrid material for ps activation over recent years a growing number of researchers have looked at single atom catalysts sacs which have applications in various fields it was first used for pms activation to remove pollutants in 2018 by li et al 2018 thus far metal atoms have been anchored using a variety of supports among them using carbon materials as support has the advantage of simple preparation and sustainable development gawande et al 2020 recently carbon based sacs have got extensively developed in ps activation to achieve pollutants removal in contrast with metal nps carbon based sacs always exhibit exceedingly outstanding catalytic activity for ps activation since they may use the metal that serves as the active center to its fullest li et al 2021d prepared fe nps anchored on bc nano fe bc and fe single atom deposited on bc fe sacs bc catalyst and compared their catalytic performance the nano fe bc only could remove 32 67 phenol in 120 min however fe sacs bc could active pms to achieve 100 of phenol degradation within 6 min which was substantially superior over nano fe bc in another work for comparison gao et al 2020 synthesized co nps and co sacs both of which could effectively activate pms but co sacs exhibited higher mass activity for the degradation of bpa fig 5 a meanwhile compared with other recently reported catalysts co sacs still show a prominent degradation rate fig 5b c furthermore the catalytic activity of carbon based sacs in ps activation can be regulated by replacing metal atoms and adjusting the coordination number x metal nx and associated carbon system wei et al 2020 generally co sacs and fe sacs are the mainly carbon based sacs for ps activation liang et al 2022 utilized n doped porous carbon as support to anchor single atom co and then the co single atom could coordinate with three and four n atoms to form cosa n3 and cosa n4 sites among them cosa n3 exhibited optimum catalytic ability to activate pds for bpa removal 100 of bpa was removed within 4 min fig 5d besides cosa n3 possessed demonstrably higher specific activity than conventional catalysts fig 5e zhang and coworkers reported that highly uniform fe n4 sites were supported on carbon nitride fe1 cn via the supermolecule method zhang et al 2021a fe1 cn could effectively activate pms and achieved high efficiency removal rate of p chlorophenol 4 cp fig 5f it s worth noting that there were no so4 ˉ ho o2 ˉ and high valent iron feⅳ in the reaction progress fig 5g however 1o2 was detected and the electron paramagnetic resonance epr results further verified it fig 5h compared with fenp cn the amount of 1o2 produced rose from 43 to 100 as fe sizes shrunk from 200 nm to single atom fig 5i recently the active species that high valent iron oxo have also entered the researcher s field of vision in the sa fe ps system peng et al 2022b utilized g c3n4 as carrier for single atom fe to successfully synthesized a novel catalyst sa fe g c3n4 which could achieve pms activation to form so4 ˉ ho o2 ˉ 1o2 furthermore they also found high valent iron oxy species feⅳ o which was produced by the coordination of the fe ⅲ at the fe n4 center with the o atom in pms to form unstable intermediate fe ⅲ ooso3 and then heterolytic cleavage of the oo bond in unstable intermediate compared with co sacs and fe sacs other carbon based sacs including cu sacs and mn sacs were less applied to activate ps wu s group used rgo as support for single atom cu to successfully prepare sa cu rgo catalysts which showed excellent catalytic performance because both rgo and abundant cu single atom could work together to activate pms chen et al 2020 thus about 90 of smx was removed in 60 min at a wide ph range while toc removal rate could achieve over 99 within 120 min at ph 6 yang et al 2020 utilized mn doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursor to prepare mn sacs the mnn4 site of mn sacs was the active site which could activate pms to form so4 ˉ and ho moreover the pyrrolic n site could adsorb bpa thus the migration distance between radicals and adsorbed bpa was shortened which notably improved bpa removal rate recently to further enhance the catalytic ability of sacs diatomic metal sacs have been prepared chen et al 2022a anchored fe bi dual single atom on carbon based material febi nc via pyrolyzing the mixture of fe and bi co doped metal organic framework and dicyandiamide the febi cn showed outstanding catalytic performance for pms activation and outstanding stability owing to the presence of fe n4 site and bi n4 site so4 ˉ ho and 1o2 coexisted in the febi cn pms system dft calculation further provided theoretical insight for the activation of pms both fe n4 site and bi n4 site possessed strong e ads and long l oo of absorbed pms indicating its high pms activation ability furthermore it was discovered by the charge density study that the electron transfer from the metal n4 site to pms promoted pms activation based on the above there are various types of hybrid materials which all have excellent catalytic performance and can effectively activate ps to degrade pollutants the mechanism of ps activation by metal carbon hybrid materials is determined by a combination of the metal species the carbon materials and the complexation structures at the metal carbon boundary therefore all types of hybrid materials pms systems may generate radical and or nonradical pathways in addition these metal carbon hybrid materials generally show relatively strong stability in ps activation due to the immobilization and dispersion of metal species by carbon materials meanwhile it s worth noting that the different types of hybrid materials also have some differences in ps activation for instance zero valent metal carbon hybrid materials have lower reusability than other metal carbon hybrid materials because of the easy oxidation of zero valent metal by contrast the reusability of single atom carbon hybrid materials is generally superior as a result of the strong coordination structure between metal species and the carbon matrix however if a more precise comparison of the superiority of different types of hybrid materials is required this still needs to be specific to the individual target metal carbon hybrid catalyst 4 tuning metal carbon hybrid materials to activate ps 4 1 modulation of carbon materials it is commonly known that various carbon materials have varied intrinsic structural properties selecting different types of carbon materials and the same metal species hybridization will lead to different effects for example li s team chose g c3n4 as the carrier of cryptomelane type manganese oxide oms 2 to prepare an oms 2 g c3n4 catalyst which activated pms to form high active manganese species and caged radicals for degrading acid orange 7 ao7 li et al 2017 in other studies they respectively utilized carbon graphite gt and nanofibers cnfs as oms 2 support to synthesize oms 2 gt and oms 2 cnfs composites that could both activate pms for ao7 removal fang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a however the major active species in the oms 2 gt pms and oms 2 cnfs pms systems in contrast to the oms 2 g c3n4 pms system were instead ho and so4 ˉ respectively rather than high active manganese species and caged radicals the phenomenon might be due to various manganese species in these catalysts which are connected to the inherent characteristics of carbon materials for example the reduction properties of the above three carbon materials to manganese oxide are different besides due to cnfs possessed abundant o species which could combine with a portion of mno6 units to generate complexes thus the ps activation mechanism can be changed via tuning the inherent characteristics of carbon materials non metallic heteroatom doping is another popular method for changing the intrinsic properties of carbon materials take n doping as an example n atoms can modulate the binding of metal particles to form a comparable atom size which ultimately affects the catalytic ability and activation mechanism of the catalyst yu et al 2022 prepared fe doped carbon fe c and fe n codoped carbon fe n c catalysts and compared their catalytic performance and the mechanism of activating pms the findings of the study demonstrated that the fe n c catalyst had a stronger ability to activate pms at the same time an interesting phenomenon was discovered that the iron particle size in fe c catalyst was reduced due to the introduction of n atoms besides the active sites of fe n c catalyst were fe n coordination and graphitic n bonded cn sites which were different form fe c catalyst quenching experiments indicated that only feⅳ o species existed in fe c pms system however both radical and nonradical 1o2 coexisted in the fe n c pms system 4 2 modulation of metal materials similar to carbon materials the types of metal materials are also diverse and choosing different metal materials to hybridize with the same carbon materials will also lead to different results wu et al 2020 showed that radicals so4 ˉ ho and nonradicals coexisted in the mno2 go pms system for removing nor deng et al 2021 also chose go as a carrier for the preparation of cofeni ldh go composites however cofeni ldh go exhibited different pms activation mechanisms producing only so4 ˉ to degrade gat this is because the selection of different types of metal species will change the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials which are important for the realizing of the transformation of the pms activation mechanism in addition to changing metal types modulating metal species size is also an effective strategy especially when metal species size is reduced to single atom which will further boost the catalytic performance and result in a novel ps activation mechanism zhang and coworkers compared carbon nitride supported fe sac fe1 cn and cn supported fe nanoparticles fenp cn catalyst zhang et al 2021a the study found that fenp cn could activate pms to form radicals and nonradical 1o2 however with fe size shrunk to single atom the above radicals were not existing in the fe1 cn pms system and the 1o2 production increased from 43 to 100 in another study li et al 2021d utilized hierarchical porous biochar as support for fe single atom and fe nanoparticles to prepare isa fe mc and nano fe mc composites respectively quenching experiment verified that the fe ⅱ mediated radical pathway so4 ˉ and ho was dominant pathway for phenol removal in the nano fe mc pms system compared with nano fe mc isa fe mc composites had many more active sites thereby the so4 ˉ and ho were no longer the main reason for the phenol removal but electron transfer pathway 4 3 modulation of hybrid forms between carbon materials and metal materials the hybrid forms between carbon materials and metal materials include metal loading metal encapsulating metal doping etc metal loading can observably relieve the leaching issue of meta ions because of the tight surface confinement and decreased dosage moreover metal species can be highly dispersed on carbon supports which helps to ensure that active sites are adequately exposed as with metal loading metal encapsulating and metal doping also have the same advantages described above it is important to note that they also have extremely strong antioxidant capacity when metal species are enclosed by carbon materials or confined within the carbon network by covalent bonds metal species and carbon materials take different hybrid forms and the properties of the obtained metal carbon hybrid materials are different in all aspects su et al 2021 prepared two catalysts including fe3o4 embedded in cnts fe3o4 in cnts and fe3o4 loaded on the surface fe3o4 out cnts compared with fe3o4 out cnts fe3o4 in cnts catalyst showed stronger catalytic performance while its total iron leaching was lower the masking experiment and epr data showed that with the transition from fe3o4 out cnts to fe3o4 in cnts catalyst the function of 1o2 for smt degradation was reduced by half and the function of ho increased from 39 13 to 54 71 furthermore liu et al 2020b synthesized co3o4 cnt composites in which co3o4 was wrapped by cnt materials and the composites could activate pms to degrade nor this study proposed a possible mechanism that 1o2 served as a main function in nor elimination in the co3o4 cnt pms system in another work peng and coworkers synthesized co3o4 cnt catalysts in which co3o4 was supported in cnt materials peng et al 2022a they verified that radicals so4 ˉ ho were the major reason for amlodipine degradation in the reaction process which was distinct from the co3o4 cnt pms reaction system studied above these occurrences might result from the electron density of the graphene layers shifting from the inner to the outer surface of the cnt walls creating a potential difference as a result the metal species anchored on the outer surface of cnt often exhibit different catalytic performance and activation mechanisms than those within to sum up modulating the types and inherent characteristics of carbon or metal materials are crucial to improve the catalytic ability of metal caron hybrid catalysts and to change ps activation mechanism meanwhile the interaction between metal species and carbon based materials is likewise of utmost significance charge transfer and electron redistribution are induced by the different fermi levels of metal species and carbon based materials which even modify the oxidation state of the active sites qian et al 2020 besides when carbon materials provide confinement space for metal species the resulting metal carbon hybrid materials have more elusive properties for ps activation 5 guiding significance as efficient catalysts the metal content of metal carbon hybrid materials is one of the key factors determining their catalytic activity table 1 summarizes the metal content and catalytic effectiveness of several metal carbon hybrid catalysts the single atom carbon hybrid materials tend to have significantly lower metal content than metal nps carbon hybrid materials but they exhibit higher catalytic performance which is because of the excellent utilization efficiency of single atom metals in the catalytic reaction generally increasing the metal content to a certain extent can enhance the catalytic performance of metal carbon hybrid materials however excessive metal content will inevitably induce metal agglomeration which in turn leads to a decrease in catalytic performance therefore it is required to investigate effective ways to enhance the metal content of metal carbon hybrid materials especially single atom metals carbon hybrid materials without causing severe agglomeration of metal species to balance the high metal content and metal agglomeration the design of metal carbon hybrid materials may be theoretically modeled and predicted using quantum chemistry to maximize catalytic performance in addition to the issue of metal content further improving the cycling stability of metal carbon materials remains a challenge although they are already better than most other catalysts the metal leaching is the main reason for the decreased cycling stability of metal carbon hybrid materials and may also cause secondary pollution to the environment therefore forming a strong coordination structure at the metal carbon boundaries possesses significant meaning to enhance the stability of metal species at the same time the coordination environment can be modulated by some methods such as heteroatoms doping creating defects etc besides carbon materials can encapsulate metal species by forming a core shell structure providing a confined environment the carbon shell inhibits the massive leaching of metals which makes metal carbon hybrid materials maintain outstanding catalytic performance after multiple reuses compared to the above problems it is critical to identify the active sites of metal carbon hybrid materials and to delineate their respective roles and synergistic effects metal carbon hybrid materials possess multiple potential active sites including metal sites non metal sites etc which may induce ps activation to form radicals and or non radicals radicals so4 ˉ and ho can degrade most contaminants and achieve mineralization because of their strong oxidizing ability however in the face of complex real water bodies they are susceptible to inorganic anions and difficult to selectively degrade pollutants in contrast non radicals 1o2 electron transfer high valent metals are less affected by inorganic anions and can selectively degrade electron rich pollutants unfortunately non radical pathways generally have a lower ability to mineralize pollutants therefore it is very meaningful to select the corresponding degradation pathway according to the specific water conditions and actual needs up to now predictable and precise regulation of the activation mechanism of ps by hybrid materials remains a great challenge dft calculations and data analysis based on machine learning should be increasingly applied to this technology 6 conclusion and perspectives metal carbon hybrid materials are attractive catalysts for ps aops as they have many advantages compared with other catalyst materials fig 6 summarizes the main advantages of metal carbon hybrid materials metal species carbon materials characteristics defective sites oxygen containing groups and nonmetallic heteroatom dopants etc and the complexing structures metal o c metal n c etc are the major active sites of meal carbon hybrid materials many different metal carbon hybrid materials have been used to activate ps for pollutants removal in wastewater via radical and or nonradical pathways more importantly the activation mechanism changes can be achieved by modulating carbon materials metal materials and the hybrid form between them thus metal carbon hybrid materials are considered promising catalysts for ps aops however despite the research on metal carbon hybrid materials has made great progress there are still major challenges in their preparation and application on a large scale to be specific the synthesis methods of metal carbon hybrid materials are limited and complex meanwhile the high cost of some precursor materials makes it difficult to meet the needs of practical applications therefore metal carbon hybrid materials still need further optimization before reaching industrial applications some points about future studies are as follows 1 most studies of complex structures at the metal carbon boundaries have focused on metal o c and metal n c bond while metal species coordinated with other heteroatoms like s p and b have been studied less thus exploring fresh complex structures may be beneficial to adjust the catalytic performance of metal carbon hybrid materials 2 the actual water environment usually contains complex background components which may affect the catalytic performance of metal carbon hybrid materials by consuming active species forming surface contamination deactivating active sites etc therefore it is necessary to construct metal carbon hybrid catalysts with high stability and reactivity additionally this technology can also be utilized in conjunction with other technologies to enhance catalytic performance 3 up to now most experiments are still confined to the laboratory and to achieve the large scale application of this technology metal carbon hybrid materials should be integrated into designated equipment or continuous reactors for further research 4 to fully recycle waste as precursors of carbon materials or and metal species and explore facile synthetic methods of metal carbon hybrid materials are beneficial to reducing material costs and manufacturing costs for practical applications declaration of

14933,halogenated organic pollutants are often found in wastewater effluent although it has been usually treated by advanced oxidation processes atomic hydrogen h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation with an outperformed performance for breaking the strong carbon halogen bonds is of increasing significance for the efficient removal of halogenated organic compounds from water and

be used to predict the chemical reactivity of halogenated organic compounds suresh et al 2022 it is well known that a more negative positive electrostatic potential is more likely to lead to electrophilic nucleophilic reactions li et al 2022c murray and politzer 2011 the reaction sites of various halogenated organic pollutants were evaluated via molecular electrostatic potential esp fig 2 and local electron affinity lea fig 3 details in section s1 the esp and lea of cl compounds for predicting the feasibility of hydrodehalogenation are summarized in table s1 the average esp of cl in haloacetic acids e g tcaa 15 22 kcal mol is theoretically higher than the halogenated olefins e g tce 14 13 kcal mol halogenated aromatics e g 2 4 dichloronitrbenzene 2 4 dcnb 14 185 kcal mol and other halogenated compounds e g flo 12 60 kcal mol indicating that the nucleophilic substitution activity of halogenated organic pollutants follows the order haloacetic acids halogenated olefins halogenated aromatic compounds other halogenated compounds this may be related to the saturated and unsaturated structures i e double bond and π orbital in the molecular structure murray and politzer 2017 results demonstrate that the nucleophilic reaction process is also related to the number and type of halogens for the tcaa the esp is high for the 1 cl and 3 cl positions 16 63 kcal mol followed by the 2 cl position 12 40 kcal mol which indicates that the 1 cl and 3 cl positions are more likely to attract nucleophilic species the above calculation only considers the electronic structure of the reactants whereas other factors such as nucleophilic reagent characteristics steric hinderance effect solvent and reaction temperature need to be taken into account to achieve an accurate prediction of the activity order at each site furthermore the esp and lea of br position in dibromoacetic acid dbaa i e 1 br 17 38 and 488 68 kcal mol respectively are obviously higher than the same position with chlorine substitution in tcaa i e 1 cl 16 63 and 554 10 kcal mol respectively fig 2 3 therefore bromine substituted compounds may be more susceptible to nucleophilic substitution reactions compared to chlorine substituted compounds with the same structure escobedo et al 2021 jiang et al 2022a the presence of electron donating or electron withdrawing groups in the benzene ring also affects the nucleophilic reaction in the ehdh process for example the average esp and lea decrease in the order of 2 4 dcnb 14 19 and 477 09 kcal mol 2 4 dcba 6 20 and 480 40 kcal mol 2 4 dcp 2 35 and 496 16 kcal mol table s1 the electron withdrawing groups such as no2 and och2cooh have a higher activity for nucleophilic reactions compared to the electron donating groups e g oh the electron withdrawing groups can reduce electron density in a molecule guo et al 2017 resulting in the c cl bond being readily attacked by nucleophilic reagents notably the average esp of h o in no2 and cl in 2 4 dcnb are 39 82 20 98 and 14 19 table s1 respectively in addition to the h of a benzene ring the no2 may readily adsorb h for the conversion into nh2 at the current density of 10 ma cm2 the efficiency of aniline formation in the electrocatalytic dechlorination of p chloronitrobenzene p cnb could reach 88 2 within 30 min wu et al 2017 furthermore the para cl position is more likely to be attacked by nucleophilic reagent e g h than that of ortho cl position due to its higher attractive capacity and lower steric hinderance fu et al 2018 peng et al 2019 shen et al 2020 specifically the esp of para cl in 2 4 dcp is 3 83 kcal mol while the ortho cl position is 0 87 kcal mol table s1 compared to the benzene ring compounds the nucleophilic reaction process is more favorable for the nitrogen containing heterocycles the average esp and lea of the cl position in 3 6 dichloropicolinic acid 3 6 d are 7 92 kcal mol and 481 13 kcal mol respectively which are higher than those of 2 4 dcba for the complex compounds the cl position in flo shows the lowest average lea 558 85 kcal mol while the average esp value is 12 60 kcal mol fig 3 in addition to the predictions of esp and lea other molecular simulations such as frontier orbital theory highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo brown and cockroft 2013 fukui functions parr and yang 1984 double descriptors martínez araya 2022 and atomic charge cao et al 2015 can also be used to identify the nucleophilic active sites in the halogenated organic molecules 2 2 prediction of molecular toxicity based on the molecular structure of organic halogenated pollutants and their products during the electrochemical dehalogenation we summarize the molecular toxicity in fig 4 based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar predication the fathead minnow is tolerant of harsh conditions which facilitates the development of toxicity analyses for the wastewater under variable conditions ankley and villeneuve 2006 it has been commonly used as a toxicological research model for acute toxicity assessment jiang et al 2022b ling et al 2022 the toxicity of organohalogens to organisms is mainly related to the spatial arrangement within the molecule nature of substituents polarity symmetry and asymmetry of the molecules and the solubility and sorption values kaushik and kaushik 2007 fig 4a shows that the halogenated olefins aromatics and complex halogenated compounds are more harmful to fathead minnow compared to haloacetic acids and halogenated alkanes toxicity may increase with an increase in the unsaturation of the molecule e g double bond and π orbital or the increase in the length of the carbon chain eldred et al 1999 evich et al 2022 han et al 2021 furthermore the acute toxicity lc50 and bioaccumulation factor of dbaa are 36 11 mg l and 2 1 while the acute toxicity lc50 and bioaccumulation factor of aa are 1359 46 mg l and 0 73 fig 4a b respectively a similar trend of toxicity reduction can be also observed in other halogenated pollutants which confirms that the substitution of halogen elements with hydrogen leads to a decrease in the toxicity of the compounds yang et al 2022c 2019 to further clarify the chronic toxicity of halogenated organic pollutants the daphnid and green algae were used as the toxicology research models to obtain the chronic value chv fig s1 the chv is defined as the geometric mean of the no observed effect concentration noec and the lowest observed effect concentration loec watanabe et al 2016 the chv of daphnid and green algae indicates that the hydrodehalogenation products have a lower aquatic ecological risk than that of halogenated organic pollutants these findings are consistent with the acute toxicity and bioaccumulation factor analysis of the degradation of organic halogenated pollutants supporting the significance of the ehdh process in water remediation 3 mechanistic insight into the electrochemical dehalogenation 3 1 direct electrochemical reduction the cathodic dehalogenation is mainly associated with direct electron transfer det and indirect electron transfer iet in a det process the breakage of the r x x f cl br i bond may proceed through concerted or stepwise det processes fig 5 a chen et al 2019 eldred et al 1999 isse et al 2008 lou et al 2021 mousset and doudrick 2020 yin et al 2020 in the concerted det process the adsorbed halogenated contaminants at the electrode interface are directly cleaved into a free radical r and a group of halide ions x eq 1 for the stepwise det process the halogenated contaminants firstly convert to an intermediate i e radical anion r x through electron transfer and then undergo the bond breakage to generate the r and x eq 2 due to the higher reduction potential compared to the halogenated substances the r is easier to accept electrons to form the stable carbon anion r eq 3 which could further produce the hydrogenation product 1 r x e r x 2 r x e rx r x 3 r e r the cyclic voltammetry cv can provide valuable information to distinguish the concerted and stepwise det mechanisms the electron transfer efficiency α is the slope of the linear variation for peak potential e p vs log v plot v is the scan rate eq 4 moreover it can be calculated from the value of half peak width e p 2 e p eq 5 in general the reaction is considered as a concerted det pathway when α 0 5 otherwise the reaction is related to a stepwise det pathway daasbjerg et al 1999 lei et al 2019 xu et al 2020a according to previous literature the aliphatic halides will accept electrons following the concerted det mechanism especially for saturated alkyl halides isse et al 2012 van hoomissen and vyas 2019 zhang et al 2021a in contrast the unsaturated aromatic halides including the halogenated benzene ring and olefin compounds possess a delocalized π bond on molecular structure tang et al 2022 endowing the ability of carbon to store foreign electrons therefore the stepwise det process will predominate the cleavage of the c x bond in unsaturated aromatic halides 4 α 1 151 rt f e p log v 5 α 1 857 rt f e p 2 e p where α is the electron transfer efficiency e p is the peak potential v e p 2 is the half peak potential v f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and v is the scan rate v s 3 2 indirect electrochemical reduction indirect electrochemical reduction is mainly governed by h lou et al 2019b mao et al 2019 2022b yao et al 2019 in the adsorbed hydrogen mediated pathway the electron first reduces the adsorbed h2o or h in acidic conditions in an aqueous solution through the volmer reaction eq 6 then the surface adsorbed h ads on the metal catalyst are used as intermediates for the electrochemical hydro dehalogenation of organic halides eq 7 however the active h ads may be not effectively used in ehdh due to the side her since h ads is easily converted to dihydrogen h2 via the heyrovsky or tafel routes eqs 8 and 9 liu et al 2018b zhou et al 2019c meanwhile the h2 bubbling process will deteriorate the mass transfer of contaminants to the active sites and consequently decrease the reaction rate zhou et al 2019c 6 h 2 o e m h ads m oh volmer 7 r x 2 h ads m 2 m r h hx hydrodehalogenation 8 h 2 o e h ads m m h 2 g oh heyr ovsky 9 2 h ads m 2 m h 2 tafel intensive efforts have been dedicated to exploring the mechanism of the ehdh process through experimental and theoretical approaches fig 5b for the cv measurement the peaks located at the potential ranges of 0 80 v to 0 60 v 0 30 v to 0 10 v and 0 10 v to 0 10 v vs ag agcl are associated with the oxidation of molecular h2 absorbed h abs and adsorbed h ads respectively liu et al 2018c tang et al 2022 zeng et al 2020 moreover the contribution of h in the electro reduction dehalogenation can be verified by electron spin resonance esr analysis e g nine characteristic peaks and the radical quenching experiments after the introduction of scavengers liu et al 2017 mao et al 2016 the t butanol t buoh could capture h to generate the inert 2 methyl 2 propanol radicals eq 10 huang et al 2021 lymar and schwarz 2012 which is mostly used as a quenching agent to scavenge active h in ehdh liu et al 2019 it is worth noting that the presence of o2 competes with halogenated organic pollutants for h liu et al 2018c therefore the inert gasses nitrogen or argon are usually used to eliminate such interferences before electrolysis when the dissolved oxygen concentration was 10 mg l there was no significant change in contaminant concentrations liu et al 2017 shu et al 2019 meanwhile some anions such as no3 co3 and hco3 can competitively consume h to form other products such as n2 li et al 2022b hco3 shen et al 2020 and hco2 sun et al 2015 which are also considered as h quenchers 10 c h 3 3 coh h c h 2 c h 3 2 h 2 k 7 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 in situ electrochemical characterizations are also important for identifying reactive intermediates in electrocatalytic reactions in situ vibrational spectroelectrochemical techniques e g in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in situ ftir and in situ raman spectroscopy can provide real time information of chemical structures at the interface of the electrode which reveals the reaction mechanism at the electrode liquid interface gan et al 2019 heck et al 2008 lou et al 2022a ma et al 2010 yang et al 2022b however in situ raman suffers from strong signal interference by water and co2 in ambient air which is a major obstacle in using in situ raman to study the electrochemical dehalogenation processes wang et al 2019 in situ electrochemical shell isolated nanoparticle enhanced raman spectroscopy shiners is a special core shell heterostructure that prevents the contact of the core with the external chemical environment which has been used to study and analyze the electroreductive dehalogenation processes jiang et al 2022a wang et al 2019 furthermore density functional theory dft such as free energy and adsorption sites can simulate the interaction between reactive intermediates and active species during the chemical reaction it has been widely used in various catalytic systems to understand the catalytic mechanism or predict the dehalogenation performance mao et al 2022b qin et al 2022 yang et al 2022a it is worth noting that the electro reduction dehalogenation may be contributed by both det and iet a quantitative relationship between direct and indirect electrocatalytic dehalogenation has been explored by the cv curves with 4 cp as the model organohalide fig 5c qin et al 2022 for example the h consumption c h of 4 cp can be evaluated by the variation of h oxidation charges for o t and o 1 eq 11 where o t and o 1 are the h oxidation charges in the absence of 4 cp and the presence of 4 cp respectively the corresponding proton reduction charges r t are equal to the proton reduction r h plus the direct reduction of 4 cp r 4 cp the r h is a sum of o 1 and the c h eq 12 thus the r 4 cp can be calculated from r t and o t eq 13 a linear relationship k between the c h and r 4 cp is used to identify the contributions of iet and det to electrocatalytic dehalogenation i e when k 1 the iet process is dominant when k 1 the det process plays a predominant role and when k 1 the two dehalogenation processes might have approximately equivalent contribution to the ehdh 11 c h o t o 1 12 r t r h r 4 cp o 1 c h r 4 cp 13 r 4 cp r t o t 4 electrode designs and performance 4 1 preparation of electrode materials metals such as pd fe co ni ag and cu show high activity in the cleavage of carbon halogen bonds because of their decent selectivity to absorb and store h via the formation of m h bonds escobedo et al 2021 liu et al 2018a xu et al 2013 zhu et al 2022 therefore these metals have been extensively used in the preparation of electrocatalysts we systematically summarized the dehalogenation performance of cathode materials in the literature table s2 notably approximately 80 of the cathodes reported are prepared using pd based materials fig 6 a owing to their outperformed capability in h generation and storage at a relatively low overpotential liu et al 2018c to improve pd activity and efficiency efforts have been devoted to ⅰ the optimization of the geometric electronic structure of pd catalysts e g nanosized or porous structure jiang et al 2020b surface defects liu et al 2018c qin et al 2022 exposed surface facets jiang et al 2020a lou et al 2022a and single atom catalysts huang et al 2021 li et al 2020b xu et al 2020b ⅱ construction of ultrathin catalytic layer in pd support electrode pd carbon chen et al 2010 shu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2019b tio2 lu et al 2019 xie et al 2013 pd tic lou et al 2020 pd tin fu et al 2018 sun et al 2014 2015 pd mno2 lou et al 2019b zhang et al 2021c pd nico2o4 yu et al 2021 pd co mof lou et al 2022b pd ligands chen et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 and pd conductive polymers li et al 2020a sun et al 2017 yang et al 2021b for reducing the cost of the electrode while maintaining the high dechlorination activity ⅲ the bimetallic pd m by alloying with metals m au chen et al 2022 fe li et al 2012a co yu et al 2021 ni mao et al 2022a sun et al 2012 cu he et al 2013b ag wei et al 2019 and in liu et al 2017 since the high cost of pd based catalysts restricts large scale commercialization noble metal free electrocatalysts such as ni2p yao et al 2019 cop liu et al 2019 mos2 yang et al 2022c and ti4o7 almassi et al 2020 have attracted increasing attention in recent years a good substrate for electrocatalysts should have superior conductivity high specific surface area low cost and favorable mechanical strength wang et al 2021a carbon supports such as graphite glassy carbon and carbon paper have been explored for cathodic dehalogenation because of their low cost and favorable stability lou et al 2021 the presence of oxygen functional groups in carbon materials enables the support to bind with metal catalysts such as pd wang et al 2021b and ag minguzzi et al 2012 besides approximately 70 of the support materials are fabricated by metallic supports fig 6a such as ni foam cu foam and ti mesh these metals have high electrical conductivity and low hydrogen evolution overpotential as well as high specific surface area surface density between 200 and 400 g m2 which can enhance the charge transfer and mass transfer rates lou et al 2019a 2019b however corrosion of the metal substrates caused by the electric fields and the electrolyte salinity will accelerate the deterioration of electrochemical performance mao et al 2018 thus it is of importance to explore a rational design of the metal interface for expanding the durability of ehdh in complex water matrices the loading mass of the electrocatalyst is a crucial factor affecting the activity and cost of the prepared electrode especially for the loading of noble metal for instance the pd loading plays a significant role in forming atomic h for the dehalogenation process he et al 2013a the preparation of electrodes with pd is usually synthesized via chemical deposition or electrodeposition mao et al 2016 song et al 2019 based on the available literature fig 6b c the palladium loading is usually about 0 5 4 mg cm2 and an excessive load leads to agglomeration of the catalyst and thereby increases the local currents of hydrogen evolution preventing the contaminants transfer to electrode surface sites he et al 2013b mao et al 2019 zhao et al 2022b a pd loading of 1 2 mg cm2 is widely used in electrochemical dehalogenation 4 2 module configurations and operation modes the electrochemical dehalogenation process is generally conducted in a cell comprised of two compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane a cathode an anode typically pt wire foil plate and a reference electrode fig 6d two operation modes include flow by mode in which the feed flow is parallel to two charged electrode surfaces and flow through mode in which the feed water flows through the electrodes according to the literature table s2 most studies on the electrochemical dehalogenation process have focused on batch experiments in the h typed reactor under nitrogen argon gas the h reactor can avoid the interference of the anode reaction on the cathode reduction whereas it increases the internal resistance and thus energy consumption zhou et al 2021 compared to the flow by mode the flow through mode decreases the thickness of h diffusion boundary layers thus enhancing the mass transfer of the system lv et al 2022 martin et al 2016 sun et al 2021 for example pd coated fiber felt electrodes in the flow through mode reached 3 42 ma cm2 at 0 4 v vs rhe which was much higher than that of in the flow by mode 1 71 ma cm2 at 0 4 v vs rhe guo et al 2022 4 3 removal performance of halogenated pollutants the cathodic reductive process has achieved high dehalogenation selectivity and kinetics through direct electron transfer and h mediated indirect electron transfer the removal efficiency apparent rate constant k app current efficiency and energy consumption of reductive dehalogenation for contaminants are shown in fig 7 the molecular structure such as the unsaturated structure the number position and type of halogens as well as the presence of electron donating or electron withdrawing groups determines the electroconductive dehalogenation reactivity of organic contaminants the haloacetic acids e g the average k app of tcaa is 0 200 min 1 show better dehalogenation performance than the unsaturated halogenated compounds e g the average k app of tce and 2 4 dcp are 0 019 and 0 045 min 1 respectively fig 7a which is attributed to the different c x bond dissociation energy dr x of various molecular structures in previous publications the dr x of 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 2 tca and tce are 291 319 and 356 kj mol respectively liu et al 2017 one of the reasons is that the halo olefins or benzene rings have high stability due to π orbital compared to the halo alkanes with σ orbital furthermore the current efficiencies of tcaa and 1 2 dca are 65 90 and 41 55 which are both higher than those of 2 4 d 5 52 2 4 dcba 3 14 3 6 d 5 17 and alachlor 2 37 fig 7b the number of halogens could affect the dehalogenation performance of the contaminants the average removal efficiencies of tetrachloride ccl4 four substituted chlorine atoms and 1 2 d two substituted chlorine atoms are 97 and 80 fig 7a respectively indicating that molecules with more chlorine substituents lead to rapid electrochemical hydrogenation furthermore the apparent rate constant for the removal of tbaa 1 4 h 1 dbaa 1 3 h 1 and mbaa 0 47 h 1 decreased sequentially in the system that is driven by the nickel dual atom catalysts yang et al 2022a the calculated adsorption energy of tbaa on ni ni was 0 45 ev which was significantly lower than that of dbaa and mbaa the energy barrier for hydrogenation of a halogenated substitute follows an increasing order of i br cl f when the molecule has an equal number of halogens the dissociation energy of the c f bond 456 kj mol is higher than that of c cl 339 kj mol c br 280 kj mol and c i 222 kj mol alonso et al 2002 giedyk et al 2019 ma et al 2016 for instance the reaction times of 4 iodophenol 4 ip 4 bromophenol 4 bp 4 cp and 4 fluorophenol 4 fp were 13 20 25 and 180 min respectively for achieving 100 removal ma et al 2016 these results indicate that the hydrogenolytic reactivity of the c x bonds decreases in the order of c i c br c cl c f which is consistent with the dissociation energy of the c x bonds furthermore an in situ shell isolated nanoparticle enhanced raman has probed the electroconductive dehalogenation processes of 4 bromothiophenol btp and 4 chlorothiophenol ctp on smooth au electrodes jiang et al 2022a the result of raman intensity variations of ν c cl and ν c br showed that the c x bond conversion ratio for btp 55 was about 1 5 times larger than that of ctp 37 which was due to the lower dissociation energy of c br bond than that of c cl bond the position of the halogens also poses a significant impact on the dehalogenation reactivity for instance the dechlorination efficiency of 2 4 dcp was the highest 91 1 within 120 min compared to other dcp isomers which may be attributed to the higher pka of 2 4 dcp 7 90 escobedo et al 2021 li et al 2012b however the 3 5 dcp with the high pka value of 8 25 exhibits relatively lower reductive activity in hydro dechlorination due to its symmetrical molecular structure that is difficult to attack by h moreover a similar trend could be observed in the dechlorination process of 2 4 dcp 2 4 d 2 4 dbca and 2 4 dcnb that the substitution of para chlorine in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons appears to be more beneficial for dechlorination reactions than ortho chlorine peng et al 2019 shen et al 2020 xu 2020 zhou et al 2021 this is due to the steric hinderance and stronger electron withdrawing of the functional groups such as och2cooh in 2 4 d which restricts the access of h to the chlorine atom located in the ortho position compared to the para position shen et al 2020 the presence of electron donating or electron withdrawing groups also affects electrocatalytic dehalogenation the electron donating groups e g nh2 and oh will increase the electron density on the benzene ring in comparison the electron withdrawing groups such as no2 x cooh and och2cooh could decrease the relative density of the electron cloud on the benzene ring yin et al 2020 the current efficiency for removing 2 4 d 52 is around 3 7 times that of 2 4 dcab 14 when it reaches a comparable removal efficiency fig 7 which is related to the different adsorption intensities of the substrate molecules on the catalyst surface due to the different induction and resonance effects of various substituents on the benzene ring lei et al 2019 as such the electron withdrawing groups will enhance the h mediated electrochemical reduction on the benzene ring which is in accordance with esp and lea predictions for the emerging complex contaminants the electrochemical hydro dehalogenation also exhibits excellent catalytic performance i e the removal efficiencies of tcs diclofenac dcf flo and tecp are almost 100 without toxic by products fig 7a in addition the contaminants with simple structures such as tcaa and 4 fp show the lowest energy consumption of 0 027 and 0 010 kwh g respectively mao et al 2018 yang et al 2021b the stability of electrodes is a critical factor for electrocatalytic dehalogenation in this section we summarize the stability over operation time and corresponding dehalogenation efficiency of the existing electrodes in fig s2 and table s4 the stability of the existing electrodes was tested for 2 45 h most of the existing electrodes show a desirable durability during the ehdh process i e the dehalogenation efficiency exhibits a decrease less than 10 during the operation fig s2 the pd ac cathode possesses the superior durability that the decrease of dehalogenation efficiency is only 3 during the operation of 45 h zhou et al 2019a long term performance of electrodes in days and months still needs further investigation the correlations between current efficiency ce or energy consumption ec and removal efficiency r were further analyzed to provide more information for the application of electrochemical dehalogenation the quantitative relationship between ce or ec and r eqs 16 and 17 can be calculated from the equations of removal eq 14 and first order kinetics eq 15 li et al 2023 obviously an intrinsic relationship exists between energy consumption and dehalogenation rate as it consumes more energy to drive faster dehalogenation fig 7c d it is worth noting that the relationship between ec and r shows a similar curve at various electrodes inset of fig 7b furthermore the performance of the modified pd electrodes e g pd sac ni pd tio2 could be significantly higher than that of the pure pd electrode due to the improvement of the intrinsic pd activity in h ads generation lu et al 2019 mao et al 2022a wei et al 2022 zhao et al 2022a the electrocatalysts of ni2p with high her performance for dechlorination may need higher electrical energy compared to the other electrodes yao et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to design novel electrodes with high electrocatalytic activity to achieve energy efficient dehalogenation it is worth noting that the comparison of electrode performance from the different literature is made under certain conditions i e assuming that the cell potential current and k app are constant during the reaction process as well as in batch operation based on eqs 16 and 17 the obtained ce curves could provide a kinetic based interpretation of the energy efficiency for the existing electrode and while possibly not entirely rigorous are essential for a fair comparison with the results of current studies li et al 2023 14 r c

electrons transferred per mole of the pollutant 5 effect of important factors on the dehalogenation 5 1 applied potential and current density the optimized cathode potential or current density will not only provide sufficient electrons and active h for dehalogenation but also avoid extensive energy consumption split violin plot statistical analysis fig 8 a shows that the applied potential and current density in electrochemical dehalogenation are mainly in the range of 0 2 to 1 0 v vs rhe and 0 5 to 5 ma cm2 respectively the removal efficiency of halogenated organic pollutants displays an apparent increase with the increase of cathode potential from 0 to 0 6 v vs rhe or the increase of current density from 0 to 3 ma cm2 fig 8b c and a further increase of cathode potential or current density results in a decrease of pollutant removal efficiency this phenomenon might be attributed to the competing her reaction the heyrovsky or tafel route he et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 xue and feng 2021 yang et al 2022a zhang et al 2021c according to the existing literature the 0 2 0 6 v vs rhe and 1 3 ma cm2 could be selected as the optimal applied potential and current density for effective dehalogenation 5 2 ph fig 8a demonstrates the ph of electrolytes used in electrochemical dehalogenation which mostly converges at a value of 6 8 the removal efficiency and k app of organic contaminants in electrochemical reduction show a similar downward trend with the increase of ph fig 8d e which can be attributed to the affected proton transfer at a high ph jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2018c mao et al 2021 the effect of ph on the electrochemical barrier is shown in fig 9 the proton transfer reaction depends on the proton dissolved in the bulk electrolyte and the adsorbed h on the electrode surface rossmeisl et al 2016 if the thermodynamically driven proton transfer process is assumed to be equilibrium at the electrode electrolyte interface the free energy change g of the reaction is zero which means that the difference between g bulk and g surface is zero eqs 18 19 the outer helmholtz layer ohl an intermediate state between liquid water and a solid surface can be used to clarify the enthalpy h and entropy s changes of the conversion of h to h eqs 20 21 rossmeisl et al 2016 at high ph protons will lose more entropy as they approach the ohl then obtaining a larger enthalpy from the ohl to the surface fig 9a b thus the alkaline conditions will hinder the conversion of h to h the free energy determined by the sum of the entropy and enthalpy shows the volcano like curve during the conversion of h aq to h fig 9c low ph possesses a lower energy barrier that can facilitate the generation of the h through the enhanced proton transfer when the ph of the electrolyte is 1 33 the h yield could reach 3 198 mmol which is 29 61 and 53 30 times higher than those in the initial ph values of 3 04 and 5 89 respectively jiang et al 2018 therefore adjusting the ph during the reductive reaction is an effective strategy to accelerate the electrocatalytic hydrodehalogenation rate 18 g h ts 19 h bulk ts bulk h surface ts surface 20 δ h h bulk h surface ts bulk ts surface

electrochemical reactions by reducing the resistance of the reaction medium avoiding unnecessary energy losses and increasing the conductivity of the solution ren et al 2022 box chart statistical analysis fig 10 a summarizes the applied electrolytes in the electrochemical dehalogenation reaction which mainly include naoh nacl pbs acetic acid buffer c4h9 4nbf4 especially for 1 2 dca and na2so4 ranging from 1 to 100 mm the most commonly used electrolyte is na2so4 with a concentration of 50 mm the removal performance shows a volcano like dependence on na2so4 the removal efficiency of halogenated organic pollutants increases with the increase of na2so4 concentration and further increase of na2so4 concentration has a weak influence on the removal efficiency fig 10b a higher electrolyte concentration can increase the electrical conductivity of the solution however the working potential at the same constant current can reduce and result in a lower driving force for the dehalogenation reaction wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019a therefore a suitable electrolyte concentration should be selected for the electrocatalytic dehalogenation for the practical application of electrochemical reduction in the remediation of halogenated organic pollutants the effects of coexisting anions e g s2 so3 2 no3 co3 2 hco3 cl and humic acid ha in the real water environment should be taken into account due to their possible competing or poisoning effects lv et al 2022 sun et al 2015 the presence of these components may consume some of the h in solution and suppress the dehalogenation reaction by adsorption on the active sites of the catalyst chen et al 2020 yang et al 2021a furthermore the real wastewater containing the divalent ions e g ca2 mg2 might lead to the mineral scaling e g ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 on the cathode which shields the active sites and then deteriorates electrode performance for the ehdh process hu et al 2022 rolf et al 2022 5 4 initial pollutant concentration the initial pollutant concentration strongly influences the removal efficiency in the ehdh process with an increase in pollutant concentration from 50 to 1200 μm the degradation efficiency and rate constant show a continuous decline fig 10c d the kinetics constant of the det and the iet process is highly determined by the activity of the electrode rather than the concentration of halogenated organic pollutants at a low concentration the ratio of active sites to substrate is higher compared to that at a high initial pollutant concentration resulting in a high removal efficiency and a short reaction time li et al 2020a yang et al 2021a a high concentration could enhance the diffusion of substrates to the electrode surface while the dehalogenation efficiency may decrease owing to the limited amount of active sites jiang et al 2021 li et al 2022a mao et al 2016 wei et al 2015 for example at the potential of 0 8 v the 2 4 dcp removal efficiency decreased from 94 to 65 with the concentration increasing from 25 to 200 mg l jiang et al 2021 these results provide a guideline to obtain a desired removal efficiency of target pollutants in real wastewater treatment 5 5 relationship of influencing factors and halogenated organic pollutants removal based on the available literature the heatmap showed the potential relationship between halogenated organic pollutant removal and the influencing factors fig 10e which is calculated by the pearson correlation coefficient the larger absolute values of the pearson correlation coefficient 1 r 1 indicate stronger correlations according to the r value the current density applied potential absolute value catalyst loading and electrolyte concentration show significant positive correlations with removal efficiency among these influencing factors current density applied potential and catalyst loading of halogenated organic pollutants are the governing factors due to their correlation with the generation and utilization of atomic h and the side reaction e g her process lou et al 2019b mao et al 2019 shu et al 2019 the removal efficiency has negative relations to the ph and initial pollutant concentration a low initial pollutant concentration is conducive to a high removal efficiency of halogenated organic pollutants compared to a high initial pollutant concentration which might be attributed to a high ratio of active sites to substrate yang et al 2021a the decrease of ph can lead to improvement in removal efficiency due to the enhanced h transfer lou et al 2019a rossmeisl et al 2016 6 conclusions and outlook ehdh is a promising method for selectively breaking the carbon halogen bonds owing to its intrinsic advantages including mild reaction conditions and the nontoxic or low toxic by products in this work we provide a comprehensive overview of current advances in this interesting technology with particular attention given to ehdh mechanisms electrode designs and operating conditions haloacetic acids might exhibit higher electrocatalytic dehalogenation performance than halogenated olefins and halogenated aromatics in the benzene ring with two substituted chlorine amounts the para cl is more likely to be removed by the nucleophilic reactions h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation than the ortho cl additionally the cl in chlorinated benzene ring with electron withdrawing groups might be more easily attacked by h compared to the electron donating groups these results are consistent with the computational calculations moreover the entropy enthalpy relationship of h conversion under acidic conditions was more favorable for enhancing the dehalogenation efficiency than that under alkaline environments especially for h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation when the dehalogenation efficiency is above 90 the energy consumption current efficiency would increase decrease rapidly the relationship suggests that increasing the dehalogenation rate in electrocatalytic dehalogenation usually increases the energy consumption nevertheless there are still some challenges and opportunities for practical applications to facilitate the translation of this innovative technology to real applications future efforts should be devoted to the following aspects i a fundamental understanding of phase transitions and charge transport at the electrode electrolyte interface during the ehdh process is highly needed the application of in situ characterization techniques e g operando tof sims liu et al 2014 would be beneficial for direct observation of electrochemical reactivity to reveal the dynamic structural transformation of halogenated organic pollutants at the electrolyte electrode interface ii the dehalogenation efficiency and possible mechanisms should be evaluated in real matrices due to the complex water quality conditions the competing ingredients e g s2 and hco3 2 contained in real waters are likely to decrease efficiencies and induce poisoning of the electrodes chen et al 2020 furthermore the complex water matrix containing ca2 and mg2 might induce irreversible fouling on the cathode and therefore deteriorate the performance of ehdh iii there is a critical need to further optimize electrode design to further enhance the energy efficiency of dehalogenation the high cost and agglomeration during the pd loading process have limited its large scale application huang et al 2021 therefore the development of new materials strategies to reduce costs and efficiently remove halogenated organic pollutants is highly desirable rational design of the interface e g nanoarray porous structure for electrocatalyst and optimization of the flow field e g strengthening diffusion convection of the reactor would significantly improve the utilization of h for the ehdh moreover future efforts are needed to focus on the modularity and scalability of the reactors for practical applications iv the strategy of turning waste into treasure provides another promising prospect for the remediation of halogenated environmental pollutants h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation shows great potential for efficient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater to achieve sustainable development further efforts should focus on the precise identification of hydrogenation products and optimization of electrodes to attain selectively transform halogenated organic pollutants into value added products v combining the electrocatalytic hydrogenation with fenton ozone uv or microorganisms might achieve complete mineralization of complex halogenated contaminants for large molecules of halogenated pollutants the intermediate may be still toxic after ehdh treatment the synergistic effect of h and oh can convert large molecule compounds into small and nontoxic molecules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddts have been listed as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency epa european commission and china yin et al 2020 it should be noted that the toxicity of organohalides is mainly due to the structure of halogen atoms x f cl br i in the molecular structure however the conventional physical or biological methods may fail to break the c x bonds in organic halides owing to the high dissociation energy 222 456 kj mol cybularczyk cecotka et al 2020 ma et al 2016 the

wang et al 2018 although h2 based catalytic hydrodehalogenation has shown high reaction kinetics for removing the halogenated pollutants compared to the ehdh process zhang et al 2021b the

chen et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 rapid development in the ehdh field has been achieved over the past several years fig 1 a the halogenated aromatics e g 4 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4

2019 pfoa zhu et al 2022 and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tecp yang et al 2021a have aroused much attention for achieving a desirable removal by the ehdh process the co occurrence of keywords in the electrocatalytic hydro dehalogenation fig 1b indicates that the publications converge at dechlorination efficiency dependent on the module configuration and operating conditions and the detoxification by electrocatalyst related to the cleavage of the c cl bond via direct and indirect electron transfer processes this critical review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the use of electrocatalytic hydro dehalogenation for halogenated organic pollutants removal we first investigate the effects of molecular structure on the potential dehalogenation reactivity in the ehdh process a detailed discussion on the direct and indirect electron transfer process is then presented furthermore we introduce the ehdh electrode design strategies i e the electrode materials and the operation mode and compare the dehalogenation performance of different molecular structures the key factors i e applied potential or current density ph value electrolyte and initial pollutant concentration are also systematically analyzed based on the literature database finally the challenges and opportunities of ehdh for real applications are highlighted 2 molecular property prediction of halogenated organic pollutants 2 1 prediction of molecular charge structure the charge structure i e the distribution of the electrostatic potential on the van der waals surface of the molecule can be used to predict the chemical reactivity of halogenated organic compounds suresh et al 2022 it is well known that a more negative positive electrostatic potential is more likely to lead to electrophilic nucleophilic reactions li et al 2022c murray and politzer 2011 the reaction sites of various halogenated organic pollutants were evaluated via molecular electrostatic potential esp fig 2 and local electron affinity lea fig 3 details in section s1 the esp and lea of cl compounds for predicting the feasibility of hydrodehalogenation are summarized in table s1 the average esp of cl in haloacetic acids e g tcaa 15 22 kcal mol is theoretically higher than the halogenated olefins e g tce 14 13 kcal mol halogenated aromatics e g 2 4 dichloronitrbenzene 2 4 dcnb 14 185 kcal mol and other halogenated compounds e g flo 12 60 kcal mol indicating that the nucleophilic substitution activity of halogenated organic pollutants follows the order haloacetic acids halogenated olefins halogenated aromatic compounds other halogenated compounds this may be related to the saturated and unsaturated structures i e double bond and π orbital in the molecular structure murray and politzer 2017 results demonstrate that the nucleophilic reaction process is also related to the number and type of halogens for the tcaa the esp is high for the 1 cl and 3 cl positions 16 63 kcal mol followed by the 2 cl position 12 40 kcal mol which indicates that the 1 cl and 3 cl positions are more likely to attract nucleophilic species the above calculation only considers the electronic structure of the reactants whereas other factors such as nucleophilic reagent characteristics steric hinderance effect solvent and reaction temperature need to be taken into account to achieve an accurate prediction of the activity order at each site furthermore the esp and lea of br position in dibromoacetic acid dbaa i e 1 br 17 38 and 488 68 kcal mol respectively are obviously higher than the same position with chlorine substitution in tcaa i e 1 cl 16 63 and 554 10 kcal mol respectively fig 2 3 therefore bromine substituted compounds may be more susceptible to nucleophilic substitution reactions compared to chlorine substituted compounds with the same structure escobedo et al 2021 jiang et al 2022a the presence of electron donating or electron withdrawing groups in the benzene ring also affects the nucleophilic reaction in the ehdh process for example the average esp and lea decrease in the order of 2 4 dcnb 14 19 and 477 09 kcal mol 2 4 dcba 6 20 and 480 40 kcal mol 2 4 dcp 2 35 and 496 16 kcal mol table s1 the electron withdrawing groups such as no2 and och2cooh have a higher activity for nucleophilic reactions compared to the electron donating groups e g oh the electron withdrawing groups can reduce electron density in a molecule guo et al 2017 resulting in the c cl bond being readily attacked by nucleophilic reagents notably the average esp of h o in no2 and cl in 2 4 dcnb are 39 82 20 98 and 14 19 table s1 respectively in addition to the h of a benzene ring the no2 may readily adsorb h for the conversion into nh2 at the current density of 10 ma cm2 the efficiency of aniline formation in the electrocatalytic dechlorination of p chloronitrobenzene p cnb could reach 88 2 within 30 min wu et al 2017 furthermore the para cl position is more likely to be attacked by nucleophilic reagent e g h than that of ortho cl position due to its higher attractive capacity and lower steric hinderance fu et al 2018 peng et al 2019 shen et al 2020 specifically the esp of para cl in 2 4 dcp is 3 83 kcal mol while the ortho cl position is 0 87 kcal mol table s1 compared to the benzene ring compounds the nucleophilic reaction process is more favorable for the nitrogen containing heterocycles the average esp and lea of the cl position in 3 6 dichloropicolinic acid 3 6 d are 7 92 kcal mol and 481 13 kcal mol respectively which are higher than those of 2 4 dcba for the complex compounds the cl position in flo shows the lowest average lea 558 85 kcal mol while the average esp value is 12 60 kcal mol fig 3 in addition to the predictions of esp and lea other molecular simulations such as frontier orbital theory highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo brown and cockroft 2013 fukui functions parr and yang 1984 double descriptors martínez araya 2022 and atomic charge cao et al 2015 can also be used to identify the nucleophilic active sites in the halogenated organic molecules 2 2 prediction of molecular toxicity based on the molecular structure of organic halogenated pollutants and their products during the electrochemical dehalogenation we summarize the molecular toxicity in fig 4 based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar predication the fathead minnow is tolerant of harsh conditions which facilitates the development of toxicity analyses for the wastewater under variable conditions ankley and villeneuve 2006 it has been commonly used as a toxicological research model for acute toxicity assessment jiang et al 2022b ling et al 2022 the toxicity of organohalogens to organisms is mainly related to the spatial arrangement within the molecule nature of substituents polarity symmetry and asymmetry of the molecules and the solubility and sorption values kaushik and kaushik 2007 fig 4a shows that the halogenated olefins aromatics and complex halogenated compounds are more harmful to fathead minnow compared to haloacetic acids and halogenated alkanes toxicity may increase with an increase in the unsaturation of the molecule e g double bond and π orbital or the increase in the length of the carbon chain eldred et al 1999 evich et al 2022 han et al 2021 furthermore the acute toxicity lc50 and bioaccumulation factor of dbaa are 36 11 mg l and 2 1 while the acute toxicity lc50 and bioaccumulation factor of aa are 1359 46 mg l and 0 73 fig 4a b respectively a similar trend of toxicity reduction can be also observed in other halogenated pollutants which confirms that the substitution of halogen elements with hydrogen leads to a decrease in the toxicity of the compounds yang et al 2022c 2019 to further clarify the chronic toxicity of halogenated organic pollutants the daphnid and green algae were used as the toxicology research models to obtain the chronic value chv fig s1 the chv is defined as the geometric mean of the no observed effect concentration noec and the lowest observed effect concentration loec watanabe et al 2016 the chv of daphnid and green algae indicates that the hydrodehalogenation products have a lower aquatic ecological risk than that of halogenated organic pollutants these findings are consistent with the acute toxicity and bioaccumulation factor analysis of the degradation of organic halogenated pollutants supporting the significance of the ehdh process in water remediation 3 mechanistic insight into the electrochemical dehalogenation 3 1 direct electrochemical reduction the cathodic dehalogenation is mainly associated with direct electron transfer det and indirect electron transfer iet in a det process the breakage of the r x x f cl br i bond may proceed through concerted or stepwise det processes fig 5 a chen et al 2019 eldred et al 1999 isse et al 2008 lou et al 2021 mousset and doudrick 2020 yin et al 2020 in the concerted det process the adsorbed halogenated contaminants at the electrode interface are directly cleaved into a free radical r and a group of halide ions x eq 1 for the stepwise det process the halogenated contaminants firstly convert to an intermediate i e radical anion r x through electron transfer and then undergo the bond breakage to generate the r and x eq 2 due to the higher reduction potential compared to the halogenated substances the r is easier to accept electrons to form the stable carbon anion r eq 3 which could further produce the hydrogenation product 1 r x e r x 2 r x e rx r x 3 r e r the cyclic voltammetry cv can provide valuable information to distinguish the concerted and stepwise det mechanisms the electron transfer efficiency α is the slope of the linear variation for peak potential e p vs log v plot v is the scan rate eq 4 moreover it can be calculated from the value of half peak width e p 2 e p eq 5 in general the reaction is considered as a concerted det pathway when α 0 5 otherwise the reaction is related to a stepwise det pathway daasbjerg et al 1999 lei et al 2019 xu et al 2020a according to previous literature the aliphatic halides will accept electrons following the concerted det mechanism especially for saturated alkyl halides isse et al 2012 van hoomissen and vyas 2019 zhang et al 2021a in contrast the unsaturated aromatic halides including the halogenated benzene ring and olefin compounds possess a delocalized π bond on molecular structure tang et al 2022 endowing the ability of carbon to store foreign electrons therefore the stepwise det process will predominate the cleavage of the c x bond in unsaturated aromatic halides 4 α 1 151 rt f e p log v 5 α 1 857 rt f e p 2 e p where α is the electron transfer efficiency e p is the peak potential v e p 2 is the half peak potential v f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and v is the scan rate v s 3 2 indirect electrochemical reduction indirect electrochemical reduction is mainly governed by h lou et al 2019b mao et al 2019 2022b yao et al 2019 in the adsorbed hydrogen mediated pathway the electron first reduces the adsorbed h2o or h in acidic conditions in an aqueous solution through the volmer reaction eq 6 then the surface adsorbed h ads on the metal catalyst are used as intermediates for the electrochemical hydro dehalogenation of organic halides eq 7 however the active h ads may be not effectively used in ehdh due to the side her since h ads is easily converted to dihydrogen h2 via the heyrovsky or tafel routes eqs 8 and 9 liu et al 2018b zhou et al 2019c meanwhile the h2 bubbling process will deteriorate the mass transfer of contaminants to the active sites and consequently decrease the reaction rate zhou et al 2019c 6 h 2 o e m h ads m oh volmer 7 r x 2 h ads m 2 m r h hx hydrodehalogenation 8 h 2 o e h ads m m h 2 g oh heyr ovsky 9 2 h ads m 2 m h 2 tafel intensive efforts have been dedicated to exploring the mechanism of the ehdh process through experimental and theoretical approaches fig 5b for the cv measurement the peaks located at the potential ranges of 0 80 v to 0 60 v 0 30 v to 0 10 v and 0 10 v to 0 10 v vs ag agcl are associated with the oxidation of molecular h2 absorbed h abs and adsorbed h ads respectively liu et al 2018c tang et al 2022 zeng et al 2020 moreover the contribution of h in the electro reduction dehalogenation can be verified by electron spin resonance esr analysis e g nine characteristic peaks and the radical quenching experiments after the introduction of scavengers liu et al 2017 mao et al 2016 the t butanol t buoh could capture h to generate the inert 2 methyl 2 propanol radicals eq 10 huang et al 2021 lymar and schwarz 2012 which is mostly used as a quenching agent to scavenge active h in ehdh liu et al 2019 it is worth noting that the presence of o2 competes with halogenated organic pollutants for h liu et al 2018c therefore the inert gasses nitrogen or argon are usually used to eliminate such interferences before electrolysis when the dissolved oxygen concentration was 10 mg l there was no significant change in contaminant concentrations liu et al 2017 shu et al 2019 meanwhile some anions such as no3 co3 and hco3 can competitively consume h to form other products such as n2 li et al 2022b hco3 shen et al 2020 and hco2 sun et al 2015 which are also considered as h quenchers 10 c h 3 3 coh h c h 2 c h 3 2 h 2 k 7 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 in situ electrochemical characterizations are also important for identifying reactive intermediates in electrocatalytic reactions in situ vibrational spectroelectrochemical techniques e g in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in situ ftir and in situ raman spectroscopy can provide real time information of chemical structures at the interface of the electrode which reveals the reaction mechanism at the electrode liquid interface gan et al 2019 heck et al 2008 lou et al 2022a ma et al 2010 yang et al 2022b however in situ raman suffers from strong signal interference by water and co2 in ambient air which is a major obstacle in using in situ raman to study the electrochemical dehalogenation processes wang et al 2019 in situ electrochemical shell isolated nanoparticle enhanced raman spectroscopy shiners is a special core shell heterostructure that prevents the contact of the core with the external chemical environment which has been used to study and analyze the electroreductive dehalogenation processes jiang et al 2022a wang et al 2019 furthermore density functional theory dft such as free energy and adsorption sites can simulate the interaction between reactive intermediates and active species during the chemical reaction it has been widely used in various catalytic systems to understand the catalytic mechanism or predict the dehalogenation performance mao et al 2022b qin et al 2022 yang et al 2022a it is worth noting that the electro reduction dehalogenation may be contributed by both det and iet a quantitative relationship between direct and indirect electrocatalytic dehalogenation has been explored by the cv curves with 4 cp as the model organohalide fig 5c qin et al 2022 for example the h consumption c h of 4 cp can be evaluated by the variation of h oxidation charges for o t and o 1 eq 11 where o t and o 1 are the h oxidation charges in the absence of 4 cp and the presence of 4 cp respectively the corresponding proton reduction charges r t are equal to the proton reduction r h plus the direct reduction of 4 cp r 4 cp the r h is a sum of o 1 and the c h eq 12 thus the r 4 cp can be calculated from r t and o t eq 13 a linear relationship k between the c h and r 4 cp is used to identify the contributions of iet and det to electrocatalytic dehalogenation i e when k 1 the iet process is dominant when k 1 the det process plays a predominant role and when k 1 the two dehalogenation processes might have approximately equivalent contribution to the ehdh 11 c h o t o 1 12 r t r h r 4 cp o 1 c h r 4 cp 13 r 4 cp r t o t 4 electrode designs and performance 4 1 preparation of electrode materials metals such as pd fe co ni ag and cu show high activity in the cleavage of carbon halogen bonds because of their decent selectivity to absorb and store h via the formation of m h bonds escobedo et al 2021 liu et al 2018a xu et al 2013 zhu et al 2022 therefore these metals have been extensively used in the preparation of electrocatalysts we systematically summarized the dehalogenation performance of cathode materials in the literature table s2 notably approximately 80 of the cathodes reported are prepared using pd based materials fig 6 a owing to their outperformed capability in h generation and storage at a relatively low overpotential liu et al 2018c to improve pd activity and efficiency efforts have been devoted to ⅰ the optimization of the geometric electronic structure of pd catalysts e g nanosized or porous structure jiang et al 2020b surface defects liu et al 2018c qin et al 2022 exposed surface

cop liu et al 2019 mos2 yang et al 2022c and ti4o7 almassi et al 2020 have attracted increasing attention in recent years a good substrate for electrocatalysts should have superior conductivity high specific surface area low cost and favorable mechanical strength wang et al 2021a carbon supports such as graphite glassy carbon and carbon paper have been explored for cathodic dehalogenation because of their low cost and favorable stability lou et al 2021 the presence of oxygen functional groups in carbon materials enables the support to bind with metal catalysts such as pd wang et al 2021b and ag minguzzi et al 2012 besides approximately 70 of the support materials are fabricated by metallic supports fig 6a such as ni foam cu foam and ti mesh these metals have high electrical conductivity and low hydrogen evolution overpotential as well as high specific surface area surface density between 200 and 400 g m2 which can enhance the charge transfer and mass transfer rates lou et al 2019a 2019b however corrosion of the metal substrates caused by the electric fields and the electrolyte salinity will accelerate the deterioration of electrochemical performance mao et al 2018 thus it is of importance to explore a rational design of the metal interface for expanding the durability of ehdh in complex water matrices the loading mass of the electrocatalyst is a crucial factor affecting the activity and cost of the prepared electrode especially for the loading of noble metal for instance the pd loading plays a significant role in forming atomic h for the dehalogenation process he et al 2013a the preparation of electrodes with pd is usually synthesized via chemical deposition or electrodeposition mao et al 2016 song et al 2019 based on the available literature fig 6b c the palladium loading is usually about 0 5 4 mg cm2 and an excessive load leads to agglomeration of the catalyst and thereby increases the local currents of hydrogen evolution preventing the contaminants transfer to electrode surface sites he et al 2013b mao et al 2019 zhao et al 2022b a pd loading of 1 2 mg cm2 is widely used in electrochemical dehalogenation 4 2 module configurations and operation modes the electrochemical dehalogenation process is generally conducted in a cell comprised of two compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane a cathode an anode typically pt wire foil plate and a reference electrode fig 6d two operation modes include flow by mode in which the feed flow is parallel to two charged electrode surfaces and flow through mode in which the feed water flows through the electrodes according to the literature table s2 most studies on the electrochemical dehalogenation process have focused on batch experiments in the h typed reactor under nitrogen argon gas the h reactor can avoid the interference of the anode reaction on the cathode reduction whereas it increases the internal resistance and thus energy consumption zhou et al 2021 compared to the flow by mode the flow through mode decreases the thickness of h diffusion boundary layers thus enhancing the mass transfer of the system lv et al 2022 martin et al 2016 sun et al 2021 for example pd coated fiber felt electrodes in the flow through mode reached 3 42 ma cm2 at 0 4 v vs rhe which was much higher than that of in the flow by mode 1 71 ma cm2 at 0 4 v vs rhe guo et al 2022 4 3 removal performance of halogenated pollutants the cathodic reductive process has achieved high dehalogenation selectivity and kinetics through direct electron transfer and h mediated indirect electron transfer the removal efficiency apparent rate constant k app current efficiency and energy consumption of reductive dehalogenation for contaminants are shown in fig 7 the molecular structure such as the unsaturated structure the number position and type of halogens as well as the presence of electron donating or electron withdrawing groups determines the electroconductive dehalogenation reactivity of organic contaminants the haloacetic acids e g the average k app of tcaa is 0 200 min 1 show better dehalogenation performance than the unsaturated halogenated compounds e g the average k app of tce and 2 4 dcp are 0 019 and 0 045 min 1 respectively fig 7a which is attributed to the different c x bond dissociation energy dr x of various molecular structures in previous publications the dr x of 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 2 tca and tce are 291 319 and 356 kj mol respectively liu et al 2017 one of the reasons is that the halo olefins or benzene rings have high stability due to π orbital compared to the halo alkanes with σ orbital furthermore the current efficiencies of tcaa and 1 2 dca are 65 90 and 41 55 which are both higher than those of 2 4 d 5 52 2 4 dcba 3 14 3 6 d 5 17 and alachlor 2 37 fig 7b the number of halogens could affect the dehalogenation performance of the contaminants the average removal efficiencies of tetrachloride ccl4 four substituted chlorine atoms and 1 2 d two substituted chlorine atoms are 97 and 80 fig 7a respectively indicating that molecules with more chlorine substituents lead to rapid electrochemical hydrogenation furthermore the apparent rate constant for the removal of tbaa 1 4 h 1 dbaa 1 3 h 1 and mbaa 0 47 h 1 decreased sequentially in the system that is driven by the nickel dual atom catalysts yang et al 2022a the calculated adsorption energy of tbaa on ni ni was 0 45 ev which was significantly lower than that of dbaa and mbaa the energy barrier for hydrogenation of a halogenated substitute follows an increasing order of i br cl f when the molecule has an equal number of halogens the dissociation energy of the c f bond 456 kj mol is higher than that of c cl 339 kj mol c br 280 kj mol and c i 222 kj mol alonso et al 2002 giedyk et al 2019 ma et al 2016 for instance the reaction times of 4 iodophenol 4 ip 4 bromophenol 4 bp 4 cp and 4 fluorophenol 4 fp were 13 20 25 and 180 min respectively for achieving 100 removal ma et al 2016 these results indicate that the hydrogenolytic reactivity of the c x bonds decreases in the order of c i c br c cl c f which is consistent with the dissociation energy of the c x bonds furthermore an in situ shell isolated nanoparticle enhanced raman has probed the electroconductive dehalogenation processes of 4 bromothiophenol btp and 4 chlorothiophenol ctp on smooth au electrodes jiang et al 2022a the result of raman intensity variations of ν c cl and ν c br showed that the c x bond conversion ratio for btp 55 was about 1 5 times larger than that of ctp 37 which was due to the lower dissociation energy of c br bond than that of c cl bond the position of the halogens also poses a significant impact on the dehalogenation reactivity for instance the dechlorination efficiency of 2 4 dcp was the highest 91 1 within 120 min compared to other dcp isomers which may be attributed to the higher pka of 2 4 dcp 7 90 escobedo et al 2021 li et al 2012b however the 3 5 dcp with the high pka value of 8 25 exhibits relatively lower reductive activity in hydro dechlorination due to its symmetrical molecular structure that is difficult to attack by h moreover a similar trend could be observed in the dechlorination process of 2 4 dcp 2 4 d 2 4 dbca and 2 4 dcnb that the substitution of para chlorine in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons appears to be more beneficial for dechlorination reactions than ortho chlorine peng et al 2019 shen et al 2020 xu 2020 zhou et al 2021 this is due to the steric hinderance and stronger electron withdrawing of the functional groups such as och2cooh in 2 4 d which restricts the access of h to the chlorine atom located in the ortho position compared to the para position shen et al 2020 the presence of electron donating or electron withdrawing groups also affects electrocatalytic dehalogenation the electron donating groups e g nh2 and oh will increase the electron density on the benzene ring in comparison the electron withdrawing groups such as no2 x cooh and och2cooh could decrease the relative density of the electron cloud on the benzene ring yin et al 2020 the current efficiency for removing 2 4 d 52 is around 3 7 times that of 2 4 dcab 14 when it reaches a comparable removal efficiency fig 7 which is related to the different adsorption intensities of the substrate molecules on the catalyst surface due to the different induction and resonance effects of various substituents on the benzene ring lei et al 2019 as such the electron withdrawing groups will enhance the h mediated electrochemical reduction on the benzene ring which is in accordance with esp and lea predictions for the emerging complex contaminants the electrochemical hydro dehalogenation also exhibits excellent catalytic performance i e the removal efficiencies of tcs diclofenac dcf flo and tecp are almost 100 without toxic by products fig 7a in addition the contaminants with simple structures such as tcaa and 4 fp show the lowest energy consumption of 0 027 and 0 010 kwh g respectively mao et al 2018 yang et al 2021b the stability of electrodes is a critical factor for electrocatalytic dehalogenation in this section we summarize the stability over operation time and corresponding dehalogenation efficiency of the existing electrodes in fig s2 and table s4 the stability of the existing electrodes was tested for 2 45 h most of the existing electrodes show a desirable durability during the ehdh process i e the dehalogenation efficiency exhibits a decrease less than 10 during the operation fig s2 the pd ac cathode possesses the superior durability that the decrease of dehalogenation efficiency is only 3 during the operation of 45 h zhou et al 2019a long term performance of electrodes in days and months still needs further investigation the correlations between current efficiency ce or energy consumption ec and removal efficiency r were further analyzed to provide more information for the application of electrochemical dehalogenation the quantitative relationship between ce or ec and r eqs 16 and 17 can be calculated from the equations of removal eq 14 and first order kinetics eq 15 li et al 2023 obviously an intrinsic relationship exists between energy consumption and dehalogenation rate as it consumes more energy to drive faster dehalogenation fig 7c d it is worth noting that the relationship between ec and r shows a similar curve at various electrodes inset of fig 7b furthermore the performance of the modified pd electrodes e g pd sac ni pd tio2 could be significantly higher than that of the pure pd electrode due to the improvement of the intrinsic pd activity in h ads generation lu et al 2019 mao et al 2022a wei et al 2022 zhao et al 2022a the electrocatalysts of ni2p with high her performance for dechlorination may need higher electrical energy compared to the other electrodes yao et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to design novel electrodes with high electrocatalytic activity to achieve energy efficient dehalogenation it is worth noting that the comparison of electrode performance from the different literature is made under certain conditions i e assuming that the cell potential current and k app are constant during the reaction process as well as in batch operation based on eqs 16 and 17 the obtained ce curves could provide a kinetic based interpretation of the energy efficiency for the existing electrode and while possibly not entirely rigorous are essential for a fair comparison with the results of current studies li et al 2023 14 r c

electrons transferred per mole of the pollutant 5 effect of important factors on the dehalogenation 5 1 applied potential and current density the optimized cathode potential or current density will not only provide sufficient electrons and active h for dehalogenation but also avoid extensive energy consumption split violin plot statistical analysis fig 8 a shows that the applied potential and current density in electrochemical dehalogenation are mainly in the range of 0 2 to 1 0 v vs rhe and 0 5 to 5 ma cm2 respectively the removal efficiency of halogenated organic pollutants displays an apparent increase with the increase of cathode potential from 0 to 0 6 v vs rhe or the increase of current density from 0 to 3 ma cm2 fig 8b c and a further increase of cathode potential or current density results in a decrease of pollutant removal efficiency this phenomenon might be attributed to the competing her reaction the heyrovsky or tafel route he et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 xue and feng 2021 yang et al 2022a zhang et al 2021c according to the existing literature the 0 2 0 6 v vs rhe and 1 3 ma cm2 could be selected as the optimal applied potential and current density for effective dehalogenation 5 2 ph fig 8a demonstrates the ph of electrolytes used in electrochemical dehalogenation which mostly converges at a value of 6 8 the removal efficiency and k app of organic contaminants in electrochemical reduction show a similar downward trend with the increase of ph fig 8d e which can be attributed to the affected proton transfer at a high ph jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2018c mao et al 2021 the effect of ph on the electrochemical barrier is shown in fig 9 the proton transfer reaction depends on the proton dissolved in the bulk electrolyte and the adsorbed h on the electrode surface rossmeisl et al 2016 if the thermodynamically driven proton transfer process is assumed to be equilibrium at the electrode electrolyte interface the free energy change g of the reaction is zero which means that the difference between g bulk and g surface is zero eqs 18 19 the outer helmholtz layer ohl an intermediate state between liquid water and a solid surface can be used to clarify the enthalpy h and entropy s changes of the conversion of h to h eqs 20 21 rossmeisl et al 2016 at high ph protons will lose more entropy as they approach the ohl then obtaining a larger enthalpy from the ohl to the surface fig 9a b thus the alkaline conditions will hinder the conversion of h to h the free energy determined by the sum of the entropy and enthalpy shows the volcano like curve during the conversion of h aq to h fig 9c low ph possesses a lower energy barrier that can facilitate the generation of the h through the enhanced proton transfer when the ph of the electrolyte is 1 33 the h yield could reach 3 198 mmol which is 29 61 and 53 30 times higher than those in the initial ph values of 3 04 and 5 89 respectively jiang et al 2018 therefore adjusting the ph during the reductive reaction is an effective strategy to accelerate the electrocatalytic hydrodehalogenation rate 18 g h ts 19 h bulk ts bulk h surface ts surface 20 δ h h bulk h surface ts bulk ts surface t δ s 21 h aq e h ohl e h where h is the enthalpy s is the entropy t is the temperature and g is the free energy 5 3 electrolyte in general the supporting electrolyte plays an indispensable role in electrochemical reactions by reducing the resistance of the reaction medium avoiding unnecessary energy losses and increasing the conductivity of the solution ren et al 2022 box chart statistical analysis fig 10 a summarizes the applied electrolytes in the electrochemical dehalogenation reaction which mainly include naoh nacl pbs acetic acid buffer c4h9 4nbf4 especially for 1 2 dca and na2so4 ranging from 1 to 100 mm the most commonly used electrolyte is na2so4 with a concentration of 50 mm the removal performance shows a volcano like dependence on na2so4 the removal efficiency of halogenated organic pollutants increases with the increase of na2so4 concentration and further increase of na2so4 concentration has a weak influence on the removal efficiency fig 10b a higher electrolyte concentration can increase the electrical conductivity of the solution however the working potential at the same constant current can reduce and result in a lower driving force for the dehalogenation reaction wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019a therefore a suitable electrolyte concentration should be selected for the electrocatalytic dehalogenation for the practical application of electrochemical reduction in the remediation of halogenated organic pollutants the effects of coexisting anions e g s2 so3 2 no3 co3 2 hco3 cl and humic acid ha in the real water environment should be taken into account due to their possible competing or poisoning effects lv et al 2022 sun et al 2015 the presence of these components may consume some of the h in solution and suppress the dehalogenation reaction by adsorption on the active sites of the catalyst chen et al 2020 yang et al 2021a furthermore the real wastewater containing the divalent ions e g ca2 mg2 might lead to the mineral scaling e g ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 on the cathode which shields the active sites and then deteriorates electrode performance for the ehdh process hu et al 2022 rolf et al 2022 5 4 initial pollutant concentration the initial pollutant concentration strongly influences the removal efficiency in the ehdh process with an increase in pollutant concentration from 50 to 1200 μm the degradation efficiency and rate constant show a continuous decline fig 10c d the kinetics constant of the det and the iet process is highly determined by the activity of the electrode rather than the concentration of halogenated organic pollutants at a low concentration the ratio of active sites to substrate is higher compared to that at a high initial pollutant concentration resulting in a high removal efficiency and a short reaction time li et al 2020a yang et al 2021a a high concentration could enhance the diffusion of substrates to the electrode surface while the dehalogenation efficiency may decrease owing to the limited amount of active sites jiang et al 2021 li et al 2022a mao et al 2016 wei et al 2015 for example at the potential of 0 8 v the 2 4 dcp removal efficiency decreased from 94 to 65 with the concentration increasing from 25 to 200 mg l jiang et al 2021 these results provide a guideline to obtain a desired removal efficiency of target pollutants in real wastewater treatment 5 5 relationship of influencing factors and halogenated organic pollutants removal based on the available literature the heatmap showed the potential relationship between halogenated organic pollutant removal and the influencing factors fig 10e which is calculated by the pearson correlation coefficient the larger absolute values of the pearson correlation coefficient 1 r 1 indicate stronger correlations according to the r value the current density applied potential absolute value catalyst loading and electrolyte concentration show significant positive correlations with removal efficiency among these influencing factors current density applied potential and catalyst loading of halogenated organic pollutants are the governing factors due to their correlation with the generation and utilization of atomic h and the side reaction e g her process lou et al 2019b mao et al 2019 shu et al 2019 the removal efficiency has negative relations to the ph and initial pollutant concentration a low initial pollutant concentration is conducive to a high removal efficiency of halogenated organic pollutants compared to a high initial pollutant concentration which might be attributed to a high ratio of active sites to substrate yang et al 2021a the decrease of ph can lead to improvement in removal efficiency due to the enhanced h transfer lou et al 2019a rossmeisl et al 2016 6 conclusions and outlook ehdh is a promising method for selectively breaking the carbon halogen bonds owing to its intrinsic advantages including mild reaction conditions and the nontoxic or low toxic by products in this work we provide a comprehensive overview of current advances in this interesting technology with particular attention given to ehdh mechanisms electrode designs and operating conditions haloacetic acids might exhibit higher electrocatalytic dehalogenation performance than halogenated olefins and halogenated aromatics in the benzene ring with two substituted chlorine amounts the para cl is more likely to be removed by the nucleophilic reactions h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation than the ortho cl additionally the cl in chlorinated benzene ring with electron withdrawing groups might be more easily attacked by h compared to the electron donating groups these results are consistent with the computational calculations moreover the entropy enthalpy relationship of h conversion under acidic conditions was more favorable for enhancing the dehalogenation efficiency than that under alkaline environments especially for h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation when the dehalogenation efficiency is above 90 the energy consumption current efficiency would increase decrease rapidly the relationship suggests that increasing the dehalogenation rate in electrocatalytic dehalogenation usually increases the energy consumption nevertheless there are still some challenges and opportunities for practical applications to facilitate the translation of this innovative technology to real applications future efforts should be devoted to the following aspects i a fundamental understanding of phase transitions and charge transport at the electrode electrolyte interface during the ehdh process is highly needed the application of in situ characterization techniques e g operando tof sims liu et al 2014 would be beneficial for direct observation of electrochemical reactivity to reveal the dynamic structural transformation of halogenated organic pollutants at the electrolyte electrode interface ii the dehalogenation efficiency and possible mechanisms should be evaluated in real matrices due to the complex water quality conditions the competing ingredients e g s2 and hco3 2 contained in real waters are likely to decrease efficiencies and induce poisoning of the electrodes chen et al 2020 furthermore the complex water matrix containing ca2 and mg2 might induce irreversible fouling on the cathode and therefore deteriorate the performance of ehdh iii there is a critical need to further optimize electrode design to further enhance the energy efficiency of dehalogenation the high cost and agglomeration during the pd loading process have limited its large scale application huang et al 2021 therefore the development of new materials strategies to reduce costs and efficiently remove halogenated organic pollutants is highly desirable rational design of the interface e g nanoarray porous structure for electrocatalyst and optimization of the flow field e g strengthening diffusion convection of the reactor would significantly improve the utilization of h for the ehdh moreover future efforts are needed to focus on the modularity and scalability of the reactors for practical applications iv the strategy of turning waste into treasure provides another promising prospect for the remediation of halogenated environmental pollutants h mediated electrocatalytic dehalogenation shows great potential for efficient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater to achieve sustainable development further efforts should focus on the precise identification of hydrogenation products and optimization of electrodes to attain selectively transform halogenated organic pollutants into value added products v combining the electrocatalytic hydrogenation with fenton ozone uv or microorganisms might achieve complete mineralization of complex halogenated contaminants for large molecules of halogenated pollutants the intermediate may be still toxic after ehdh treatment the synergistic effect of h and oh can convert large molecule compounds into small and nontoxic molecules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14934,the massive use of zinc pyrithione zpt as broad spectrum bactericides resulted in its high levels in waste activated sludge was and affected subsequent was treatment this work revealed the effects of zpt on the volatile fatty acids vfas during was anaerobic digestion in which vfas yield was enhanced by approximately 6 9 folds from 353 mg cod l in control to 2526 3318 mg cod l with low level of zpt 20 50 mg g tss the zpt occurred in was enabled the acceleration of solubilization hydrolysis and acidification processes while inhibited the methanogenesis also the low zpt contributed to the enrichment of functional hydrolytic acidifying microorganisms e g ottowia and acinetobacter but caused the reduction of methanogens e g methanomassiliicoccus and methanothrix meta transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the critical genes relevant to extracellular hydrolysis i e clpp and zapa membrane transport i e glti and gltl substrates metabolisms i e fadj and acd and vfas biosynthesis i e porb and pord were all upregulated by 25 1 701 3 with low level of zpt specifically the zpt stimulus on amino acids metabolism for vfas transformation was prominent over carbohydrates moreover the functional species enabled to regulate the genes in qs and tcs systems to maintain favorable cell chemotaxis to adapt the zpt stress the cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathway was upregulated to blunt zpt with the secretion of more lipopolysaccharide and activate proton pumps to maintain ions homeostasis to antagonize the zpt toxicity for high microbial activities the abundance of related genes was up regulated by 60 5 to 524 5 this work enlightened environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants on was anaerobic digestion process with interrelations of microbial metabolic regulation and adaptive responses graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zinc pyrithione zpt waste activated sludge was volatile fatty acids vfas metabolic functions microbial adaptation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction zinc pyrithione zpt is a typical bactericidal and antifungal chemical that plays essential roles in the prevention and treatment of infectious skin diseases and mitigation of microbial contamination mangion et al 2021 which exhibits promising applications in communicable disease control and antiviral in daily routines kumari et al 2021 the market size of zpt could reach 1 6 billion usd in 2021 globally li et al 2021 correspondingly the extensive utilization of zpt resulted in its high detection frequency and large concentrations in the various environmental matric such as municipal wastewater and waste activated sludge was carbajo et al 2015 the was which contained huge contents of organic matters with various exogenous pollutants would bring serious secondary environmental risks and economic burdens if disposed ineffectively fang et al 2022 anaerobic digestion is regarded as an attractive strategy to treat was with substantial resource recovery i e volatile fatty acids vfas and pretty contribution to the carbon neutrality aims du et al 2022 hydrogen and methane are also important products in anaerobic digestion however vfas have wider applications than them such as the raw materials for the synthesis of bioplastics korkakaki et al 2016 and the carbon source for nutrients removal during biological wastewater treatment liu et al 2016 meanwhile vfas are easier to transport and storage than them atasoy et al 2020 in addition the market price of vfas are 600 2000 ton which are higher than hydrogen 0 28 m3 and methane 0 72 m3 maggio et al 2022 rocha et al 2018 veluswamy et al 2021 however the anaerobic digestion efficiency is associated with diverse factors including the widespread exogenous pollutants in was e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps zhou et al 2022 for instance the sulfonamide antibiotics occurred in was were found to improve the vfas generation while benzalkonium chloride inhibited the acidification process by interfering with the microbial populations which are the key players in anaerobic systems for the vfas generation wang et al 2022b as a well known antimicrobial agent the zpt could also exhibit adverse effects on the cellular metabolic function of microorganisms such as membrane disruption and oxidative stress induction güner and i̇lhan 2020 mo et al 2018 this evoked the public concerns on the potential environmental behaviors of zpt on the biotechnological processes such as the was anaerobic digestion nevertheless the influence of zpt on the was anaerobic digestion had been rarely reported which required further explorations in addition the organic substrates in was were commonly firstly dissolved in the liquid phase through the solubilization process then these soluble substances would further bioconvert into targeted product i e vfas and the efficient vfas production was correlated with four main processes e g hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis during was anaerobic digestion it is quite essential to distinguish the particular impacts of zpt on each step to better understand the related mechanisms associated with vfas production meanwhile the anaerobic species and the corresponding metabolic activities in was anaerobic digestion systems are considered as the essential contributors to the efficient vfas biosynthesis the systematic illustrations on the variations of microbial functional traits at genetic levels could reveal the zpt impacts on the biological conversion process in depth nevertheless the related information is limited besides some researches have implied the neutral or even positive effects of exogeneous pollutants on the was anaerobic digestion process wang et al 2022b how the anaerobic microorganisms in was adapted and antagonized the pollutants zpt toxicity to maintain high metabolic activity is quite curious but it is still an open question the major objective of this work was to unveil the potential impacts of zpt on vfas accumulation in the was anaerobic digestion process and disclose the underlying mechanisms the effect of zpt on vfas generation was firstly investigated and their impacts on main anaerobic digestion process were subsequently determined meanwhile the variation of microbial populations and the associated genetic expressions involved in the vfas biosynthesis were systematically distinguished via 16s rrna and meta transcriptomic analysis besides the analysis of microbial adaptation in response to zpt stress was also conducted this work would offer a comprehensive understanding of emerging containments effects on was anaerobic digestion and provide practical guidance on was treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 was and main chemicals the was was got from a local municipal wwtp in nanjing china the was was pre treated to concentrate by settling for 24 h naturally and then filtrated to eliminate the large particles the major characteristics of pre treated was were shown in table 1 the zinc pyrithione 1 hydroxypyridine 2 thlone zinc salt 96 cas number 13463 41 7 was got from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china 2 2 influences of zpt on the vfas production derived from was anaerobic digestion the experiments were applied in five identical serum reactors total volume 600 ml each reactor was added with 300 ml pre treated was previous studies have indicated that the content of residual zpt in was was about 15 35 mg g tss rout et al 2021 peng et al 2017 hence five different concentrations of zpt i e control r0 20 r1 fall into its environmental level 50 r2 100 r3 and 200 r4 mg g tss were set in the was digestion reactors after being purged with n2 gas 99 for 5 min to remove the residual oxygen all the reactors were sealed and operated in an air bath shaker for anaerobic digestion experiments at 200 rpm and 35 every 2 d the sludge samples were extracted from the different reactors to determine the vfas concentration meanwhile to unveil the zpt impacts on was solubilization the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates and three dimensional fluorescence spectrum of supernatant in the anaerobic digestion system were detected at 2 d in addition the levels of nh4 n and po4 3 p and the relative activities of hydrolytic enzymes i e protease and α glucosidase were also determined at 4 d to reflect the was hydrolysis efficiency moreover the methane production from each reactor was measured every 2 d to characterize the methanogenic performance furthermore the level of lactate dehydrogenase ldh release was detected to reflect both the membrane damage and cytotoxicity and adenosine triphosphate atp was determined to reflect the general microbial activity according to the analysis of vfas production the low zpt dosage r1 and r2 exhibited the evident promoting influence however the high zpt dosage r3 and r4 significantly decreased the promoting impacts on vfas production which might be due to the high microbial toxicity with high dosage according to the analysis of vfas production the low zpt dosage r1 and r2 exhibited the evident promoting influences on the vfas production but the zpt content in r1 is more close to its environmental level and the high zpt dosage r3 and r4 both significantly decreased the promoting impacts on vfas production which might be due to the high microbial toxicity with high dosage hence in order to characterize the underlying mechanisms of zpt at different dosage level on vfas yields during was anaerobic digestion process with more environmental implications the r0 control r1 remarkably stimulated system and r4 with reduced promoting impacts were therefore selected as the representative reactors for in depth analysis of the microbial community at the end of tests the sludge samples from r0 r1 and r4 were extracted and stored at 80 c immediately for further microbial analysis 2 3 analytical methods the withdrawn was samples were firstly centrifuged at 6 000 rpm for 15 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane for further analysis the determinations of proteins carbohydrates nh4 and po4 3 were based on standard methods eaton et al 2005 meanwhile the enzymatic activities of protease and α glucosidase were measured referring to the previous publications wang et al 2022b moreover the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and then adjusted the ph to 4 0 by adding 3 h3po4 after that 1 μl pretreated sample was injected into gas chromatography agilent 7820a usa for vfas production the carrier gas used was nitrogen with a flow rate of 50 ml min the detector and injection port were kept at 200 and 220 c respectively the total vfa concentration was calculated as the sum of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids with a stoichiometric cod conversion which was 1 07 1 51 1 82 and 2 04 respectively and was finally expressed as mg cod l the level of atp and ldh release was detected by the atp assay kit beyotime china and the lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay kit beyotime china respectively referring to the manufacturer s instructions the detection of zn2 concentration was applied by atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent aa 240 duo usa besides the detailed information for 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and the meta transcriptomic analysis were the same as previous study luo et al 2022 2 4 data analysis since the range of raw gene data varies widely the genes with low relative abundance will be difficult to observe without normalization hence this work used a row scale normalization from 0 to 1 approach in data processing which has also been used in previous work duan et al 2021 the general formula for the min max of 0 1 normalization is given as follow by normalizing the relative gene abundance in r0 r1 and r4 individually the difference between each gene expression can be presented more visually in parallel the raw data of relative gene abundance had been provided in the table s1 x x min x max x min x 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of zpt on vfas generation during was anaerobic digestion as exhibited in fig 1 a the vfas generation efficiency was evidently improved with the addition zpt for instance the vfas generation in r0 reactor was merely 353 mg cod l at 12 d but it elevated to 2526 and 3318 mg cod l in the presence of 20 and 50 mg g tss zpt which was approximately 6 9 and 9 0 folds of r0 reactor respectively nevertheless the highest vfas accumulation was reduced to 1866 and 1061 mg cod l along with the further increase of zpt increase in r3 and r4 reactors clearly the promoting effect of zpt on vfas production was more significant at the low levels in terms of vfas distributions fig 1 b the fraction of acetate propionate butyrate and valerate in control reactor was 47 1 17 6 16 3 and 19 0 nevertheless the proportions of acetate and propionate were evidently enhanced in the presence of zpt for instance the total percentage of acetic and propionic acids was 66 7 in r1 and further improved to 82 2 in r4 the acetate and propionate acids are expected to exhibit wider application e g superior carbon sources for biological nutrient removal enzmann et al 2018 and higher market sizes the world market size is respectively 18 000 000 and 470 000 tons for acetic and propionic acid and the market prices of them are 600 and 2000 per ton respectively vassilev et al 2018 veluswamy et al 2021 therefore the presence of zpt in the was not only promoted the overall vfas production but also affected their compositions with improved application values 3 2 distinguish the particular impact on specific processes for vfas production generally the initial was solubilization plus the subequent hydrolysis involved in anaeorbic digestion were considered as the main rate limiting steps for efficient vfas production wu et al 2020 hence the influence of zpt on was solubilization was firstly investigated the presence of zpt evidently improved the concentration of soluble organic matters especially the proteins fig 2 a for example the content of soluble carbohydrates and proteins was 13 0 and 14 7 mg l in r0 but they were enhanced to 13 7 and 31 9 mg l in r1 and further improved to 14 8 and 192 6 mg l in r4 meanwhile eem characterization of soluble microbial products whose fluorescence intensity is associated with the level of organics with fluorescent properties chen et al 2003 exhibited the similar trends figs 2 b f further analysis indicated that the fluorescence region integration fri indices of regions i and ii which mainly consisted of simple aromatic proteins with biodegradable properties wen et al 2003 were also found to be significantly enhanced in the presence of zpt table 2 for example the proportions of region i and ii were 50 6 in r0 reactor while increased to 53 4 in r1 and further improved to 55 2 in r4 obviously the zpt not only promoted the solubilization of organics in was but also improved the biodegradability of organic substrates which facilitated the subsequent microbial metabolism for vfas production the zpt was reported to possess the depolarization ability of organics dinning et al 1998 güner and i̇lhan 2020 meanwhile the released zn2 from zpt was also able to interact with proteins inside extracellular polymeric substance eps to induce the loose structure of eps wei et al 2017 in this study the content of zn2 was found to be respectively 0 011 0 027 and 0 54 mg l in r0 r1 and r4 reactors these maybe responsible for the enhanced was solubilization efficiency with effective eps disintegration and release especially the proteins triggered by zpt moreover the contents of nh4 n and po4 3 p which could directly reveal the hydrolysis efficiency luo et al 2022 were also increased in the reactors with zpt stress figs 3 a and b for instance the concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p was 38 6 and 14 7 mg l in r0 but they rose to 44 7 and 31 9 mg l in r1 and further improved to 95 7 and 192 6 mg l in r4 hence was hydrolysis efficiency was effectively improved further analysis indicated that the enzymatic activities related with was hydrolysis were also affected by the zpt for instance in comparison with r0 the relative activities of protease were enhanced by 81 4 208 9 in the reactors with zpt dose fig 3 c however the variation of α glucosidase activity was not quite significant in all the investigated reactors these results implied that the presence of zpt in was was prone to contribute to the proteins hydrolysis more prominently than that of carbohydrates this might be partly associated with more pronounced bioavailable proteins released into the digestion solutions during the was solubilization which stimulated and regulated the corresponding microbial activities wang et al 2022a wei et al 2017 in addition methanogenesis is one of the main vfas consumption process during was anaerobic digestion luo et al 2022 the presence of zpt was observed to suppress methane production for example the methane accumulation in r0 was 12 3 ml g vss while it decreased to 3 8 ml g vss in the r1 and further decreased to 0 005 ml g vss in the r4 fig 3 d thus the evident inhibition of methanogenesis trigged by zpt would also be advantageous to the final vfas accumulation overall the presence of zpt in was contributed greatly to the solubilization and hydrolysis of was especially proteins while inhibited the methanogenesis which benefitted the ultimate vfas promotion jointly 3 3 variation of microbial population in response to zpt stress during was anaerobic digestion the vfas generation required the participation of microorganisms and hence the functional microflora exhibit critical roles during was anaerobic digestion in this work the variation of microbial populations induced by zpt was also analyzed the α diversity analysis indicated that the microbial diversity and richness in was anaerobic digestion reactors were evidently altered by the zpt table 3 for instance the chao which indicate the microbial richness was decreased from 1400 in the r0 to 1293 and 1235 in r1 and r4 respectively also the simpson index which could reflect the microbial diversity was 0 0142 in the r0 reactor but it increased respectively to 0 0149 and 0 0152 in r1 and r4 reactors indicating the low species diversity the overall reduction of microbial diversity and richness might be partly ascribed to the toxicity of zpt toward microorganisms meanwhile the dominant anaerobe at phylum level in r0 were bacteroidota 23 7 proteobacteria 17 4 actinobacteria 15 9 firmicutes 6 4 and chloroflexi 8 4 fig 4 a among them the bacteroidota actinobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were frequently considered as vfas producers for example chloroflexi could efficiently enhance the hydrolysis efficiency whereas bacteroidota and actinobacteria were positively correlated with vfas generation chen et al 2017 the relative abundances of these vfas producers were improved from 54 4 in r0 reactor to 72 9 in r1 reactor but they were decreased to 55 6 in r4 reactor obviously the low level of zpt benefitted the enrichment of these hydrolytic acidifying bacteria resulting in satisfactory vfas generation however the stimulating effects were greatly weakened due to the excessive presence of zpt the ternary plot among three reactors also revealed that the majority of hydrolytic acidifying microorganisms was dominant in the r1 reactor fig 4 b moreover in terms of genus level the microorganisms with diverse functions also exhibited distinct abundances in different reactors fig 4 c as for hydrolysis process the microorganisms responsible for the hydrolysis e g petrimonas ottowia and acinetobacter were significantly accumulated in the reactors under zpt exposure compared with r0 for example petrimonas is the typical fermentative bacteria and it was responsible for the protein hydrolysis yang et al 2020 the relative abundance of petrimonas in r0 r1 and r4 were 0 01 0 96 and 0 00 respectively meanwhile ottowia was able to hydrolyze proteins based substrates mahdy et al 2020 and its abundance was increased from 0 61 in r0 to 0 81 in r1 and further improved to 1 23 in r4 similarly acinetobacter which could secrete various hydrolytic enzymes especially for protease waack et al 2018 also increased evidently in the zpt dosed reactors the enrichment of these functional hydrolyzers exhibited great agreement with the enhancement of substrates hydrolysis meanwhile the acid forming anaerobes were observed to be enriched in the low concentration of zpt while they were inhibited with the excessive dosage of zpt as for acidogenesis process the abundance of acidogenic microorganisms including bacteroides and lutispora was 2 12 and 1 20 in the r1 reactor while they were negligible in r0 and r4 reactors as for acetogenesis process the abundance of acetogenic microorganisms including dysgonomonas fonticella acetoanaerobium and macellibacteroides was 3 98 3 48 3 06 and 2 58 in the r1 reactor while they were negligible in r0 and r4 reactors these anaerobes had been reported to metabolize protein based substrates for acetate production luo et al 2022 besides as for methanogenesis the abundances of typical methanogens were remarkably reduced in the presence of zpt fig 4 c for example the abundance of methanomassiliicoccus and methanothrix which were typical methanogens kröninger et al 2017 liu et al 2019 was 0 61 and 0 40 in r0 and they were reduced by 96 5 and 23 4 in the presence of high zpt exposure overall the low level of zpt efficiently enriched the hydrolytic acidifying anaerobes but reduced the methanogens which favored the ultimate vfas production although the high dosage of zpt also promoted the proliferation of hydrolytic microbes due to the sufficient digestion substrates the relative abundances of acid forming bacteria involved in vfas biosynthesis were remarkably reduced which accounted for its relatively low contribution to the vfas promotion 3 4 regulations of microbial metabolic functions involved in vfas biosynthesis stressed by zpt in order to deeply enlighten the mechanisms of zpt impacts on the biological process for vfas production the meta transcriptomic analysis was conducted to unveil the variation of microbial metabolic functions at genetic traits as exhibited in figs 5 and s1 the genetic expressions involved in extracellular hydrolysis were obviously improved in the presence of zpt for instance the relative abundance of malz which was relevant to the hydrolysis of carbohydrates wu et al 2022 was 0 28 in r0 while they were slightly improved to 0 37 and 0 35 in r1 and r4 meanwhile compared with r0 the relative abundance of clpp which was involved in proteins hydrolysis via acting on peptide bonds maurizi et al 1990 was improved to 125 1 and 170 6 in the r1 and r4 the genetic expression of zapa which was also related to the protein hydrolysis exhibited the similar trend and it was respectively improved by 253 2 and 95 2 in the r1 and r4 reactors it has been reported that zn2 constituted its key active site nageswara et al 2019 hence the mild increment of soluble zn2 content in the zpt exposed reactors might be one of the reasons for the upregulations of zapa obviously the presence of zpt evidently enhanced the genetic expressions involved in extracellular hydrolysis which was consistent with the aforementioned analysis of hydrolysis efficiency the hydrolyzed organic products derived from was were required to transport from the extracellular into intracellular sides to metabolize for vfas biosynthesis jiang et al 2021 in this study the zpt exposure in the was anaerobic digestion reactors seemed to inhibit the transmembrane transport of monosaccharides but enhance the delivery of amino acids at low levels for instance the total genetic abundances of glucose mannose transport system e g gtsa gtsb and gtsc were observed to be 0 53 in r0 while they were merely 0 15 and 0 08 in r1 and r4 respectively as to the delivery of the amino acids the genetic expressions encoding for the glutamate aspartate transport systems e g glti gltj gltk and gltl was 0 90 in r0 they were enhanced to 1 43 in r1 but then reduced to 0 76 in the r4 reactor also the relative abundance of encoding genes responsible for the atp binding proteins of branched chain amino acid transport system e g livg livf livh livm and livk was increased to 128 4 in r1 compared with r0 while they were decreased by 56 6 in r4 the significant promotion of amino acids transporter in r1 might be ascribed to the sufficient proteinaceous substrates produced by was solubilization hydrolysis under low zpt stress wang et al 2022b however the excessive dosage of zpt would aggravate its toxicity to the anaerobic species and greatly reduced the microbial activities which was observed in the r4 reactor moreover the metabolic pathway for intracellular vfas biosynthesis was also determined as shown in fig 5 the influences of zpt exposure on the glycolysis remained insignificant for example the relative abundance of pgk and eno which participated in the glycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate formation was 1 72 and 2 23 in r0 while they were 1 82 and 2 29 in the r1 and 1 69 and 2 43 in r4 respectively interestingly the low concentration of zpt accelerated the intracellular metabolism of amino acids while exhibiting inhibitory effects at high levels as depicted in fig 6 a the genetic hits of amino acid metabolism was increased from the 7 53 in r0 to 7 63 in r1 but decreased to 7 10 in r4 in comparison with r0 the critical genetic expressions involved in amino acids metabolism e g ilve fadj acd serb ppsa and hmgl were improved by 1 2 701 3 in r1 reactor while they were reduced by 2 1 58 9 in r4 reactor among them the ilve fadj and acd are key genes in regulating the production of propanoyl coa from l valine and l isoleucine which are associated with the propionate generation li et al 2022 their increment accounted for a large proportion of propionate in zpt conditioned reactors furthermore the pyruvate metabolism which exhibited significant impacts on ultimate vfas generation and was located in the central metabolic pathway also exhibited the similar trend for example the abundance of acee encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase was 1 61 in r0 reactor it was increased to 2 07 in the r1 reactor but decreased to 1 16 in the r4 reactor meanwhile in comparsion with r0 the genetic expressions responsible for pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase e g porb and pord was improved to 185 2 and 298 6 in r1 while they were neglectable in r4 these results proved that the substrates metabolism especially amino acids for vfas biosynthesis was significantly enhanced at low level of zpt while inhibited under high zpt stress besides the key genetic expressions involved in methane production were also inhibited in the presence of zpt which was consistent with the inhibitory effect of zpt on methanogenesis the critical genetic expressions e g cdhe and cdhd of acetyl coa decarbonase synthetase acds which could mediate the acetic acid type methane synthesis pathway lieber et al 2014 were significantly reduced by zpt 0 068 and 0 073 in r0 reactor 0 035 and 0 028 in r1 and 0 001 and 0 004 in r4 reactor meanwhile the abundance of genes mer and mtra which regulate the generation of 5 10 methyl thm s pt from 5 10 methyl thm s pt welander and metcalf 2005 was decreased by 88 8 and 77 6 in r1 reactor and further reduced by 91 0 and 89 5 in r4 reactor when comparing with that of the control obviously the upregulations of funcional genes induced by the low level of zpt were advantageous in catalyzing the synthesis and secretion of corresponding enzymes related to vfas biosynthesis however the excessive dosage of zpt exhibited inhibitory effects on the microbial metabolic traits which might account for the weakened impacts on the vfas promotion despite of the high level of bioavailable substrates 3 5 microbial adaptive mechanisms in response to the zpt stress as an antimicrobial chemical zpt might exhibit certain toxicity to the microorganisms especially in high level which is supposed to be the main reason for the weakened vfas promotion during was anaerobic digestion in this work the toxicity of zpt on the anaerobic species was actually verified for instance the genetic hits of cell growth and death was increased from the 1 56 in r0 to 1 60 in r1 and further improved to 1 97 in r4 fig 6 a implying the toxicity to microorganisms also compared with r0 the ldh release which indicated the cell membrane damage cheng et al 2023 was increased by 32 8 in r1 and further increased by 158 4 in r4 respectively fig 6 b on the contrary the atp concentrations that reflect the general microbial activities were respectively reduced by 40 0 and 57 8 in r1 and r4 reactor the zpt was reported to be capable to depolarize cell membrane and cause structural disruption of cell membranes dinning et al 1998 güner and i̇lhan 2020 besides the presence of zpt was found to weaken the genetic expressions e g rpfg and crp involved in eps synthesis figs 7 and s2 jiang et al 2021 in comparsion with r0 the genetic expression of rpfg and crp was reduced by 85 6 and 19 1 in r1 and by 97 4 and 61 7 in r4 respectively this was apparently not conducive to microbial repair of membrane damage and resulted in the reduced microbial activities noteworthily the microorganisms have the ability of sensing extracellular information and subsequently regulate the microbial functions to resist adverse environments via self adaptation mechanisms e g quorum sensing qs and two component systems tcss wang et al 2020 for instance the genetic hits of signal transduction was increased from the 4 34 in r0 to 4 41 in r1 but decreased to 3 86 in r4 fig 6 a implying the microbal adaptation to zpt qs could regulate bacteria to coordinate their behavior with environment majumdar and pal 2016 while tcss could enable bacteria to sense respond and adapt to changes in their environment or in their intracellular state papon and stock 2019 hence the variation of qs and tcss could be used to reflect the microbial adaptive regulation to environmental stimuli for example the expression level of zur which was considered as one of the most prevalent genes in regulating the zinc uptake in bacteria was 710 0 higher in r4 reactor than that in r0 fig 7 obviously this is one of typical evidences to indicate the microbial response to the increased zn2 concentrations in r4 with high zpt exposure moreover the synthesis of diacylglyceryl n n n trimethylhomoserine dgts which is one of the important membrane components was enhanced by the regulation of qs geiger et al 1999 the expression of sec and oppc as the genes for fusion and sensing protein in qs were enhanced 61 6 and 95 1 in r1 respectively the gene plca was also increased by 11 4 in r1 which facilitated the synthesis of 1 2 diacylglycerol moreover the upregulation of btaa and btab facilitated the conversion of 1 2 diacylglycerol to dgts 4 0 and 69 7 in r1 respectively the upregulation of dgts synthesis was beneficial to the membrane repair as substitutes in response to the cell membrane damage stressed by zpt moreover the microbial adaptive regulation to the zpt toxicity was further consolidated in tcss the cationic antimicrobial peptide camp resistance pathway affiliated to the tcss was highly active in the reactors with zpt the camp resistance pathway could reduce the toxicity of pollutants by mainly secreting lipopolysaccharide lps to blunt pollutants and or enhancing the extracellular pump of membrane drainage yang et al 2012 as depicted in fig 7 the genetic expressions of phop and epta which could promote lps secretion kato et al 1999 lee et al 2004 were improved by 169 6 and 352 2 in r1 and 60 5 and 489 8 in r4 it indicated that the anaerobic species in r1 and r4 deactivated the zpt by secreting more lps to reduce their toxicity moreover the critical genes associated with efflux pumps in the camp resistance pathway were also found to be enhanced in the low presence of zpt which could reduce the membrane charge disturbance and regulate the ion homeostasis to antagonize the depolarizing effects of zpt on the cell membranes weatherspoon griffin et al 2014 for instance in comparsion with r0 the abundance of cpxr encoding for regulating dna expression was increased by 524 5 in r1 reactor while they were decreased by 88 1 in r4 reactor similarly the genetic expressions of acrb and tolc which were directly related to the synthesis and secretion of outer membrane protein were respectively increased by 141 7 and 178 2 in r1 reactor but they were both decreased by 86 3 and 63 5 in r4 reactor in addition the expressions of genes affiliated to qs and tcss that encode cell chemotaxis e g qseb of qs and chea chey of tcss which could induce bacterial movement toward favorable conditions gómez moutón et al 2004 was also synergistically increased in the r1 reactor while decreasing in the r4 for example the relative abundances of genes qseb chea and chey were respectively increased from 0 176 0 433 and 0 692 to 0 331 0 617 and 0 810 in r1 however their relative abundances were decreased to 0 118 0 046 and 0 595 in r4 respectively similar results were also observed in the genetic expressions of envz and ompr which could effectively stimulate microbial growth zhang et al 2017 their relative abundances were 0 16 and 0 19 0 21 and 0 24 and 0 19 and 0 17 in the r0 r1 and r4 generally the anaerobic species in the was anaerobic digestion systems could regulate their adaptive systems to resist the zpt toxicity at low levels and maintain their metabolic activities for vfas biosynthesis however when the zpt dosage exceeded the tolerance threshold the adaptive regulation systems i e tcss would deactivate or be weakened and thus restrained the related microbial activities which might be one of the main reasons for the poor metabolic functions for vfas promotion in r4 3 6 environmental implications the widespread utilization of the broad spectrum bactericide zpt had led to its accumulation in was at high concentrations which might bring potential risks to was treatment this work demonstrated that the effects of zpt on the was anaerobic digestion process and revealed the particular impacts on specific processes for vfas production meanwhile the microbial evolution and genetic expressions involved in vfas generation induced by zpt were comprehensively revealed also the microbial adaptive mechanisms to zpt toxicity were preliminarily unveiled this work enlightened the environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants on was anaerobic digestion process with the interrelations of microbial metabolic regulation and adaptive responses however the toxicity of zpt to the biological process especially at high levels still evoked the ecological risks the severe inhibitory effects of zpt on the methanogenesis also a promising alternative to treat was for resource recovery observed in this study alerted the options of adopting the anaerobic approach for sludge treatment moreover the accumulating effects and the transformation of more toxic intermediate products derived from parent pollutants in the lasting environments chen et al 2020 chen et al 2022 might further aggravate the toxicity of zpt towards microorganisms wang et al 2022c hence the fates of zpt during the biological process especially in the continuous operating systems required in depth exploration besides the possible approaches to alleviate the zpt stress should be also conducted in the future including the acclimated microorganisms with high resistance and the introduction of certain pretreatment strategies i e advanced oxidation process to eliminate the zpt in wastewater and was 4 conclusion this work demonstrated that the effects of zpt on the was anaerobic digestion process and revealed the particular impacts on specific processes for vfas production the highest vfas production was enhanced from 353 mg cod l in control to 3318 mg cod l with low level of zpt while it was reduced to 1060 mg cod l under high level of zpt exposure the presence of zpt facilitated the was solubilization and hydrolysis but restrained the methanogenesis also the zpt enabled to alter the microbial community and benefitted the enrichment of functional hydrolytic acidifying microorganisms at low levels but inhibited the proliferation of methanogens moreover the genetic expressions involved in vfas biosynthesis were also enhanced under the low level of zpt since the anaerobic species could regulate the adaptive mechanism systems i e qs and tcss to resist and alleviate the zpt toxicity however the adaptive systems deactivated or weakened with high zpt stress which resulted in the reduced microbial metabolic activities and the poor performance for vfas promotion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14934,the massive use of zinc pyrithione zpt as broad spectrum bactericides resulted in its high levels in waste activated sludge was and affected subsequent was treatment this work revealed the effects of zpt on the volatile fatty acids vfas during was anaerobic digestion in which vfas yield was enhanced by approximately 6 9 folds from 353 mg cod l in control to 2526 3318 mg cod l with low level of zpt 20 50 mg g tss the zpt occurred in was enabled the acceleration of solubilization hydrolysis and acidification processes while inhibited the methanogenesis also the low zpt contributed to the enrichment of functional hydrolytic acidifying microorganisms e g ottowia and acinetobacter but caused the reduction of methanogens e g methanomassiliicoccus and methanothrix meta transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the critical genes relevant to extracellular hydrolysis i e clpp and zapa membrane transport i e glti and gltl substrates metabolisms i e fadj and acd and vfas biosynthesis i e porb and pord were all upregulated by 25 1 701 3 with low level of zpt specifically the zpt stimulus on amino acids metabolism for vfas transformation was prominent over carbohydrates moreover the functional species enabled to regulate the genes in qs and tcs systems to maintain favorable cell chemotaxis to adapt the zpt stress the cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathway was upregulated to blunt zpt with the secretion of more lipopolysaccharide and activate proton pumps to maintain ions homeostasis to antagonize the zpt toxicity for high microbial activities the abundance of related genes was up regulated by 60 5 to 524 5 this work enlightened environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants on was anaerobic digestion process with interrelations of microbial metabolic regulation and adaptive responses graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zinc pyrithione zpt waste activated sludge was volatile fatty acids vfas metabolic functions microbial adaptation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction zinc pyrithione zpt is a typical bactericidal and antifungal chemical that plays essential roles in the prevention and treatment of infectious skin diseases and mitigation of microbial contamination mangion et al 2021 which exhibits promising applications in communicable disease control and antiviral in daily routines kumari et al 2021 the market size of zpt could reach 1 6 billion usd in 2021 globally li et al 2021 correspondingly the extensive utilization of zpt resulted in its high detection frequency and large concentrations in the various environmental matric such as municipal wastewater and waste activated sludge was carbajo et al 2015 the was which contained huge contents of organic matters with various exogenous pollutants would bring serious secondary environmental risks and economic burdens if disposed ineffectively fang et al 2022 anaerobic digestion is regarded as an attractive strategy to treat was with substantial resource recovery i e volatile fatty acids vfas and pretty contribution to the carbon neutrality aims du et al 2022 hydrogen and methane are also important products in anaerobic digestion however vfas have wider applications than them such as the raw materials for the synthesis of bioplastics korkakaki et al 2016 and the carbon source for nutrients removal during biological wastewater treatment liu et al 2016 meanwhile vfas are easier to transport and storage than them atasoy et al 2020 in addition the market price of vfas are 600 2000 ton which are higher than hydrogen 0 28 m3 and methane 0 72 m3 maggio et al 2022 rocha et al 2018 veluswamy et al 2021 however the anaerobic digestion efficiency is associated with diverse factors including the widespread exogenous pollutants in was e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps zhou et al 2022 for instance the sulfonamide antibiotics occurred in was were found to improve the vfas generation while benzalkonium chloride inhibited the acidification process by interfering with the microbial populations which are the key players in anaerobic systems for the vfas generation wang et al 2022b as a well known antimicrobial agent the zpt could also exhibit adverse effects on the cellular metabolic function of microorganisms such as membrane disruption and oxidative stress induction güner and i̇lhan 2020 mo et al 2018 this evoked the public concerns on the potential environmental behaviors of zpt on the biotechnological processes such as the was anaerobic digestion nevertheless the influence of zpt on the was anaerobic digestion had been rarely reported which required further explorations in addition the organic substrates in was were commonly firstly dissolved in the liquid phase through the solubilization process then these soluble substances would further bioconvert into targeted product i e vfas and the efficient vfas production was correlated with four main processes e g hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis during was anaerobic digestion it is quite essential to distinguish the particular impacts of zpt on each step to better understand the related mechanisms associated with vfas production meanwhile the anaerobic species and the corresponding metabolic activities in was anaerobic digestion systems are considered as the essential contributors to the efficient vfas biosynthesis the systematic illustrations on the variations of microbial functional traits at genetic levels could reveal the zpt impacts on the biological conversion process in depth nevertheless the related information is limited besides some researches have implied the neutral or even positive effects of exogeneous pollutants on the was anaerobic digestion process wang et al 2022b how the anaerobic microorganisms in was adapted and antagonized the pollutants zpt toxicity to maintain high metabolic activity is quite curious but it is still an open question the major objective of this work was to unveil the potential impacts of zpt on vfas accumulation in the was anaerobic digestion process and disclose the underlying mechanisms the effect of zpt on vfas generation was firstly investigated and their impacts on main anaerobic digestion process were subsequently determined meanwhile the variation of microbial populations and the associated genetic expressions involved in the vfas biosynthesis were systematically distinguished via 16s rrna and meta transcriptomic analysis besides the analysis of microbial adaptation in response to zpt stress was also conducted this work would offer a comprehensive understanding of emerging containments effects on was anaerobic digestion and provide practical guidance on was treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 was and main chemicals the was was got from a local municipal wwtp in nanjing china the was was pre treated to concentrate by settling for 24 h naturally and then filtrated to eliminate the large particles the major characteristics of pre treated was were shown in table 1 the zinc pyrithione 1 hydroxypyridine 2 thlone zinc salt 96 cas number 13463 41 7 was got from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china 2 2 influences of zpt on the vfas production derived from was anaerobic digestion the experiments were applied in five identical serum reactors total volume 600 ml each reactor was added with 300 ml pre treated was previous studies have indicated that the content of residual zpt in was was about 15 35 mg g tss rout et al 2021 peng et al 2017 hence five different concentrations of zpt i e control r0 20 r1 fall into its environmental level 50 r2 100 r3 and 200 r4 mg g tss were set in the was digestion reactors after being purged with n2 gas 99 for 5 min to remove the residual oxygen all the reactors were sealed and operated in an air bath shaker for anaerobic digestion experiments at 200 rpm and 35 every 2 d the sludge samples were extracted from the different reactors to determine the vfas concentration meanwhile to unveil the zpt impacts on was solubilization the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates and three dimensional fluorescence spectrum of supernatant in the anaerobic digestion system were detected at 2 d in addition the levels of nh4 n and po4 3 p and the relative activities of hydrolytic enzymes i e protease and α glucosidase were also determined at 4 d to reflect the was hydrolysis efficiency moreover the methane production from each reactor was measured every 2 d to characterize the methanogenic performance furthermore the level of lactate dehydrogenase ldh release was detected to reflect both the membrane damage and cytotoxicity and adenosine triphosphate atp was determined to reflect the general microbial activity according to the analysis of vfas production the low zpt dosage r1 and r2 exhibited the evident promoting influence however the high zpt dosage r3 and r4 significantly decreased the promoting impacts on vfas production which might be due to the high microbial toxicity with high dosage according to the analysis of vfas production the low zpt dosage r1 and r2 exhibited the evident promoting influences on the vfas production but the zpt content in r1 is more close to its environmental level and the high zpt dosage r3 and r4 both significantly decreased the promoting impacts on vfas production which might be due to the high microbial toxicity with high dosage hence in order to characterize the underlying mechanisms of zpt at different dosage level on vfas yields during was anaerobic digestion process with more environmental implications the r0 control r1 remarkably stimulated system and r4 with reduced promoting impacts were therefore selected as the representative reactors for in depth analysis of the microbial community at the end of tests the sludge samples from r0 r1 and r4 were extracted and stored at 80 c immediately for further microbial analysis 2 3 analytical methods the withdrawn was samples were firstly centrifuged at 6 000 rpm for 15 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane for further analysis the determinations of proteins carbohydrates nh4 and po4 3 were based on standard methods eaton et al 2005 meanwhile the enzymatic activities of protease and α glucosidase were measured referring to the previous publications wang et al 2022b moreover the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and then adjusted the ph to 4 0 by adding 3 h3po4 after that 1 μl pretreated sample was injected into gas chromatography agilent 7820a usa for vfas production the carrier gas used was nitrogen with a flow rate of 50 ml min the detector and injection port were kept at 200 and 220 c respectively the total vfa concentration was calculated as the sum of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids with a stoichiometric cod conversion which was 1 07 1 51 1 82 and 2 04 respectively and was finally expressed as mg cod l the level of atp and ldh release was detected by the atp assay kit beyotime china and the lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay kit beyotime china respectively referring to the manufacturer s instructions the detection of zn2 concentration was applied by atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent aa 240 duo usa besides the detailed information for 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and the meta transcriptomic analysis were the same as previous study luo et al 2022 2 4 data analysis since the range of raw gene data varies widely the genes with low relative abundance will be difficult to observe without normalization hence this work used a row scale normalization from 0 to 1 approach in data processing which has also been used in previous work duan et al 2021 the general formula for the min max of 0 1 normalization is given as follow by normalizing the relative gene abundance in r0 r1 and r4 individually the difference between each gene expression can be presented more visually in parallel the raw data of relative gene abundance had been provided in the table s1 x x min x max x min x 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of zpt on vfas generation during was anaerobic digestion as exhibited in fig 1 a the vfas generation efficiency was evidently improved with the addition zpt for instance the vfas generation in r0 reactor was merely 353 mg cod l at 12 d but it elevated to 2526 and 3318 mg cod l in the presence of 20 and 50 mg g tss zpt which was approximately 6 9 and 9 0 folds of r0 reactor respectively nevertheless the highest vfas accumulation was reduced to 1866 and 1061 mg cod l along with the further increase of zpt increase in r3 and r4 reactors clearly the promoting effect of zpt on vfas production was more significant at the low levels in terms of vfas distributions fig 1 b the fraction of acetate propionate butyrate and valerate in control reactor was 47 1 17 6 16 3 and 19 0 nevertheless the proportions of acetate and propionate were evidently enhanced in the presence of zpt for instance the total percentage of acetic and propionic acids was 66 7 in r1 and further improved to 82 2 in r4 the acetate and propionate acids are expected to exhibit wider application e g superior carbon sources for biological nutrient removal enzmann et al 2018 and higher market sizes the world market size is respectively 18 000 000 and 470 000 tons for acetic and propionic acid and the market prices of them are 600 and 2000 per ton respectively vassilev et al 2018 veluswamy et al 2021 therefore the presence of zpt in the was not only promoted the overall vfas production but also affected their compositions with improved application values 3 2 distinguish the particular impact on specific processes for vfas production generally the initial was solubilization plus the subequent hydrolysis involved in anaeorbic digestion were considered as the main rate limiting steps for efficient vfas production wu et al 2020 hence the influence of zpt on was solubilization was firstly investigated the presence of zpt evidently improved the concentration of soluble organic matters especially the proteins fig 2 a for example the content of soluble carbohydrates and proteins was 13 0 and 14 7 mg l in r0 but they were enhanced to 13 7 and 31 9 mg l in r1 and further improved to 14 8 and 192 6 mg l in r4 meanwhile eem characterization of soluble microbial products whose fluorescence intensity is associated with the level of organics with fluorescent properties chen et al 2003 exhibited the similar trends figs 2 b f further analysis indicated that the fluorescence region integration fri indices of regions i and ii which mainly consisted of simple aromatic proteins with biodegradable properties wen et al 2003 were also found to be significantly enhanced in the presence of zpt table 2 for example the proportions of region i and ii were 50 6 in r0 reactor while increased to 53 4 in r1 and further improved to 55 2 in r4 obviously the zpt not only promoted the solubilization of organics in was but also improved the biodegradability of organic substrates which facilitated the subsequent microbial metabolism for vfas production the zpt was reported to possess the depolarization ability of organics dinning et al 1998 güner and i̇lhan 2020 meanwhile the released zn2 from zpt was also able to interact with proteins inside extracellular polymeric substance eps to induce the loose structure of eps wei et al 2017 in this study the content of zn2 was found to be respectively 0 011 0 027 and 0 54 mg l in r0 r1 and r4 reactors these maybe responsible for the enhanced was solubilization efficiency with effective eps disintegration and release especially the proteins triggered by zpt moreover the contents of nh4 n and po4 3 p which could directly reveal the hydrolysis efficiency luo et al 2022 were also increased in the reactors with zpt stress figs 3 a and b for instance the concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p was 38 6 and 14 7 mg l in r0 but they rose to 44 7 and 31 9 mg l in r1 and further improved to 95 7 and 192 6 mg l in r4 hence was hydrolysis efficiency was effectively improved further analysis indicated that the enzymatic activities related with was hydrolysis were also affected by the zpt for instance in comparison with r0 the relative activities of protease were enhanced by 81 4 208 9 in the reactors with zpt dose fig 3 c however the variation of α glucosidase activity was not quite significant in all the investigated reactors these results implied that the presence of zpt in was was prone to contribute to the proteins hydrolysis more prominently than that of carbohydrates this might be partly associated with more pronounced bioavailable proteins released into the digestion solutions during the was solubilization which stimulated and regulated the corresponding microbial activities wang et al 2022a wei et al 2017 in addition methanogenesis is one of the main vfas consumption process during was anaerobic digestion luo et al 2022 the presence of zpt was observed to suppress methane production for example the methane accumulation in r0 was 12 3 ml g vss while it decreased to 3 8 ml g vss in the r1 and further decreased to 0 005 ml g vss in the r4 fig 3 d thus the evident inhibition of methanogenesis trigged by zpt would also be advantageous to the final vfas accumulation overall the presence of zpt in was contributed greatly to the solubilization and hydrolysis of was especially proteins while inhibited the methanogenesis which benefitted the ultimate vfas promotion jointly 3 3 variation of microbial population in response to zpt stress during was anaerobic digestion the vfas generation required the participation of microorganisms and hence the functional microflora exhibit critical roles during was anaerobic digestion in this work the variation of microbial populations induced by zpt was also analyzed the α diversity analysis indicated that the microbial diversity and richness in was anaerobic digestion reactors were evidently altered by the zpt table 3 for instance the chao which indicate the microbial richness was decreased from 1400 in the r0 to 1293 and 1235 in r1 and r4 respectively also the simpson index which could reflect the microbial diversity was 0 0142 in the r0 reactor but it increased respectively to 0 0149 and 0 0152 in r1 and r4 reactors indicating the low species diversity the overall reduction of microbial diversity and richness might be partly ascribed to the toxicity of zpt toward microorganisms meanwhile the dominant anaerobe at phylum level in r0 were bacteroidota 23 7 proteobacteria 17 4 actinobacteria 15 9 firmicutes 6 4 and chloroflexi 8 4 fig 4 a among them the bacteroidota actinobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were frequently considered as vfas producers for example chloroflexi could efficiently enhance the hydrolysis efficiency whereas bacteroidota and actinobacteria were positively correlated with vfas generation chen et al 2017 the relative abundances of these vfas producers were improved from 54 4 in r0 reactor to 72 9 in r1 reactor but they were decreased to 55 6 in r4 reactor obviously the low level of zpt benefitted the enrichment of these hydrolytic acidifying bacteria resulting in satisfactory vfas generation however the stimulating effects were greatly weakened due to the excessive presence of zpt the ternary plot among three reactors also revealed that the majority of hydrolytic acidifying microorganisms was dominant in the r1 reactor fig 4 b moreover in terms of genus level the microorganisms with diverse functions also exhibited distinct abundances in different reactors fig 4 c as for hydrolysis process the microorganisms responsible for the hydrolysis e g petrimonas ottowia and acinetobacter were significantly accumulated in the reactors under zpt exposure compared with r0 for example petrimonas is the typical fermentative bacteria and it was responsible for the protein hydrolysis yang et al 2020 the relative abundance of petrimonas in r0 r1 and r4 were 0 01 0 96 and 0 00 respectively meanwhile ottowia was able to hydrolyze proteins based substrates mahdy et al 2020 and its abundance was increased from 0 61 in r0 to 0 81 in r1 and further improved to 1 23 in r4 similarly acinetobacter which could secrete various hydrolytic enzymes especially for protease waack et al 2018 also increased evidently in the zpt dosed reactors the enrichment of these functional hydrolyzers exhibited great agreement with the enhancement of substrates hydrolysis meanwhile the acid forming anaerobes were observed to be enriched in the low concentration of zpt while they were inhibited with the excessive dosage of zpt as for acidogenesis process the abundance of acidogenic microorganisms including bacteroides and lutispora was 2 12 and 1 20 in the r1 reactor while they were negligible in r0 and r4 reactors as for acetogenesis process the abundance of acetogenic microorganisms including dysgonomonas fonticella acetoanaerobium and macellibacteroides was 3 98 3 48 3 06 and 2 58 in the r1 reactor while they were negligible in r0 and r4 reactors these anaerobes had been reported to metabolize protein based substrates for acetate production luo et al 2022 besides as for methanogenesis the abundances of typical methanogens were remarkably reduced in the presence of zpt fig 4 c for example the abundance of methanomassiliicoccus and methanothrix which were typical methanogens kröninger et al 2017 liu et al 2019 was 0 61 and 0 40 in r0 and they were reduced by 96 5 and 23 4 in the presence of high zpt exposure overall the low level of zpt efficiently enriched the hydrolytic acidifying anaerobes but reduced the methanogens which favored the ultimate vfas production although the high dosage of zpt also promoted the proliferation of hydrolytic microbes due to the sufficient digestion substrates the relative abundances of acid forming bacteria involved in vfas biosynthesis were remarkably reduced which accounted for its relatively low contribution to the vfas promotion 3 4 regulations of microbial metabolic functions involved in vfas biosynthesis stressed by zpt in order to deeply enlighten the mechanisms of zpt impacts on the biological process for vfas production the meta transcriptomic analysis was conducted to unveil the variation of microbial metabolic functions at genetic traits as exhibited in figs 5 and s1 the genetic expressions involved in extracellular hydrolysis were obviously improved in the presence of zpt for instance the relative abundance of malz which was relevant to the hydrolysis of carbohydrates wu et al 2022 was 0 28 in r0 while they were slightly improved to 0 37 and 0 35 in r1 and r4 meanwhile compared with r0 the relative abundance of clpp which was involved in proteins hydrolysis via acting on peptide bonds maurizi et al 1990 was improved to 125 1 and 170 6 in the r1 and r4 the genetic expression of zapa which was also related to the protein hydrolysis exhibited the similar trend and it was respectively improved by 253 2 and 95 2 in the r1 and r4 reactors it has been reported that zn2 constituted its key active site nageswara et al 2019 hence the mild increment of soluble zn2 content in the zpt exposed reactors might be one of the reasons for the upregulations of zapa obviously the presence of zpt evidently enhanced the genetic expressions involved in extracellular hydrolysis which was consistent with the aforementioned analysis of hydrolysis efficiency the hydrolyzed organic products derived from was were required to transport from the extracellular into intracellular sides to metabolize for vfas biosynthesis jiang et al 2021 in this study the zpt exposure in the was anaerobic digestion reactors seemed to inhibit the transmembrane transport of monosaccharides but enhance the delivery of amino acids at low levels for instance the total genetic abundances of glucose mannose transport system e g gtsa gtsb and gtsc were observed to be 0 53 in r0 while they were merely 0 15 and 0 08 in r1 and r4 respectively as to the delivery of the amino acids the genetic expressions encoding for the glutamate aspartate transport systems e g glti gltj gltk and gltl was 0 90 in r0 they were enhanced to 1 43 in r1 but then reduced to 0 76 in the r4 reactor also the relative abundance of encoding genes responsible for the atp binding proteins of branched chain amino acid transport system e g livg livf livh livm and livk was increased to 128 4 in r1 compared with r0 while they were decreased by 56 6 in r4 the significant promotion of amino acids transporter in r1 might be ascribed to the sufficient proteinaceous substrates produced by was solubilization hydrolysis under low zpt stress wang et al 2022b however the excessive dosage of zpt would aggravate its toxicity to the anaerobic species and greatly reduced the microbial activities which was observed in the r4 reactor moreover the metabolic pathway for intracellular vfas biosynthesis was also determined as shown in fig 5 the influences of zpt exposure on the glycolysis remained insignificant for example the relative abundance of pgk and eno which participated in the glycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate formation was 1 72 and 2 23 in r0 while they were 1 82 and 2 29 in the r1 and 1 69 and 2 43 in r4 respectively interestingly the low concentration of zpt accelerated the intracellular metabolism of amino acids while exhibiting inhibitory effects at high levels as depicted in fig 6 a the genetic hits of amino acid metabolism was increased from the 7 53 in r0 to 7 63 in r1 but decreased to 7 10 in r4 in comparison with r0 the critical genetic expressions involved in amino acids metabolism e g ilve fadj acd serb ppsa and hmgl were improved by 1 2 701 3 in r1 reactor while they were reduced by 2 1 58 9 in r4 reactor among them the ilve fadj and acd are key genes in regulating the production of propanoyl coa from l valine and l isoleucine which are associated with the propionate generation li et al 2022 their increment accounted for a large proportion of propionate in zpt conditioned reactors furthermore the pyruvate metabolism which exhibited significant impacts on ultimate vfas generation and was located in the central metabolic pathway also exhibited the similar trend for example the abundance of acee encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase was 1 61 in r0 reactor it was increased to 2 07 in the r1 reactor but decreased to 1 16 in the r4 reactor meanwhile in comparsion with r0 the genetic expressions responsible for pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase e g porb and pord was improved to 185 2 and 298 6 in r1 while they were neglectable in r4 these results proved that the substrates metabolism especially amino acids for vfas biosynthesis was significantly enhanced at low level of zpt while inhibited under high zpt stress besides the key genetic expressions involved in methane production were also inhibited in the presence of zpt which was consistent with the inhibitory effect of zpt on methanogenesis the critical genetic expressions e g cdhe and cdhd of acetyl coa decarbonase synthetase acds which could mediate the acetic acid type methane synthesis pathway lieber et al 2014 were significantly reduced by zpt 0 068 and 0 073 in r0 reactor 0 035 and 0 028 in r1 and 0 001 and 0 004 in r4 reactor meanwhile the abundance of genes mer and mtra which regulate the generation of 5 10 methyl thm s pt from 5 10 methyl thm s pt welander and metcalf 2005 was decreased by 88 8 and 77 6 in r1 reactor and further reduced by 91 0 and 89 5 in r4 reactor when comparing with that of the control obviously the upregulations of funcional genes induced by the low level of zpt were advantageous in catalyzing the synthesis and secretion of corresponding enzymes related to vfas biosynthesis however the excessive dosage of zpt exhibited inhibitory effects on the microbial metabolic traits which might account for the weakened impacts on the vfas promotion despite of the high level of bioavailable substrates 3 5 microbial adaptive mechanisms in response to the zpt stress as an antimicrobial chemical zpt might exhibit certain toxicity to the microorganisms especially in high level which is supposed to be the main reason for the weakened vfas promotion during was anaerobic digestion in this work the toxicity of zpt on the anaerobic species was actually verified for instance the genetic hits of cell growth and death was increased from the 1 56 in r0 to 1 60 in r1 and further improved to 1 97 in r4 fig 6 a implying the toxicity to microorganisms also compared with r0 the ldh release which indicated the cell membrane damage cheng et al 2023 was increased by 32 8 in r1 and further increased by 158 4 in r4 respectively fig 6 b on the contrary the atp concentrations that reflect the general microbial activities were respectively reduced by 40 0 and 57 8 in r1 and r4 reactor the zpt was reported to be capable to depolarize cell membrane and cause structural disruption of cell membranes dinning et al 1998 güner and i̇lhan 2020 besides the presence of zpt was found to weaken the genetic expressions e g rpfg and crp involved in eps synthesis figs 7 and s2 jiang et al 2021 in comparsion with r0 the genetic expression of rpfg and crp was reduced by 85 6 and 19 1 in r1 and by 97 4 and 61 7 in r4 respectively this was apparently not conducive to microbial repair of membrane damage and resulted in the reduced microbial activities noteworthily the microorganisms have the ability of sensing extracellular information and subsequently regulate the microbial functions to resist adverse environments via self adaptation mechanisms e g quorum sensing qs and two component systems tcss wang et al 2020 for instance the genetic hits of signal transduction was increased from the 4 34 in r0 to 4 41 in r1 but decreased to 3 86 in r4 fig 6 a implying the microbal adaptation to zpt qs could regulate bacteria to coordinate their behavior with environment majumdar and pal 2016 while tcss could enable bacteria to sense respond and adapt to changes in their environment or in their intracellular state papon and stock 2019 hence the variation of qs and tcss could be used to reflect the microbial adaptive regulation to environmental stimuli for example the expression level of zur which was considered as one of the most prevalent genes in regulating the zinc uptake in bacteria was 710 0 higher in r4 reactor than that in r0 fig 7 obviously this is one of typical evidences to indicate the microbial response to the increased zn2 concentrations in r4 with high zpt exposure moreover the synthesis of diacylglyceryl n n n trimethylhomoserine dgts which is one of the important membrane components was enhanced by the regulation of qs geiger et al 1999 the expression of sec and oppc as the genes for fusion and sensing protein in qs were enhanced 61 6 and 95 1 in r1 respectively the gene plca was also increased by 11 4 in r1 which facilitated the synthesis of 1 2 diacylglycerol moreover the upregulation of btaa and btab facilitated the conversion of 1 2 diacylglycerol to dgts 4 0 and 69 7 in r1 respectively the upregulation of dgts synthesis was beneficial to the membrane repair as substitutes in response to the cell membrane damage stressed by zpt moreover the microbial adaptive regulation to the zpt toxicity was further consolidated in tcss the cationic antimicrobial peptide camp resistance pathway affiliated to the tcss was highly active in the reactors with zpt the camp resistance pathway could reduce the toxicity of pollutants by mainly secreting lipopolysaccharide lps to blunt pollutants and or enhancing the extracellular pump of membrane drainage yang et al 2012 as depicted in fig 7 the genetic expressions of phop and epta which could promote lps secretion kato et al 1999 lee et al 2004 were improved by 169 6 and 352 2 in r1 and 60 5 and 489 8 in r4 it indicated that the anaerobic species in r1 and r4 deactivated the zpt by secreting more lps to reduce their toxicity moreover the critical genes associated with efflux pumps in the camp resistance pathway were also found to be enhanced in the low presence of zpt which could reduce the membrane charge disturbance and regulate the ion homeostasis to antagonize the depolarizing effects of zpt on the cell membranes weatherspoon griffin et al 2014 for instance in comparsion with r0 the abundance of cpxr encoding for regulating dna expression was increased by 524 5 in r1 reactor while they were decreased by 88 1 in r4 reactor similarly the genetic expressions of acrb and tolc which were directly related to the synthesis and secretion of outer membrane protein were respectively increased by 141 7 and 178 2 in r1 reactor but they were both decreased by 86 3 and 63 5 in r4 reactor in addition the expressions of genes affiliated to qs and tcss that encode cell chemotaxis e g qseb of qs and chea chey of tcss which could induce bacterial movement toward favorable conditions gómez moutón et al 2004 was also synergistically increased in the r1 reactor while decreasing in the r4 for example the relative abundances of genes qseb chea and chey were respectively increased from 0 176 0 433 and 0 692 to 0 331 0 617 and 0 810 in r1 however their relative abundances were decreased to 0 118 0 046 and 0 595 in r4 respectively similar results were also observed in the genetic expressions of envz and ompr which could effectively stimulate microbial growth zhang et al 2017 their relative abundances were 0 16 and 0 19 0 21 and 0 24 and 0 19 and 0 17 in the r0 r1 and r4 generally the anaerobic species in the was anaerobic digestion systems could regulate their adaptive systems to resist the zpt toxicity at low levels and maintain their metabolic activities for vfas biosynthesis however when the zpt dosage exceeded the tolerance threshold the adaptive regulation systems i e tcss would deactivate or be weakened and thus restrained the related microbial activities which might be one of the main reasons for the poor metabolic functions for vfas promotion in r4 3 6 environmental implications the widespread utilization of the broad spectrum bactericide zpt had led to its accumulation in was at high concentrations which might bring potential risks to was treatment this work demonstrated that the effects of zpt on the was anaerobic digestion process and revealed the particular impacts on specific processes for vfas production meanwhile the microbial evolution and genetic expressions involved in vfas generation induced by zpt were comprehensively revealed also the microbial adaptive mechanisms to zpt toxicity were preliminarily unveiled this work enlightened the environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants on was anaerobic digestion process with the interrelations of microbial metabolic regulation and adaptive responses however the toxicity of zpt to the biological process especially at high levels still evoked the ecological risks the severe inhibitory effects of zpt on the methanogenesis also a promising alternative to treat was for resource recovery observed in this study alerted the options of adopting the anaerobic approach for sludge treatment moreover the accumulating effects and the transformation of more toxic intermediate products derived from parent pollutants in the lasting environments chen et al 2020 chen et al 2022 might further aggravate the toxicity of zpt towards microorganisms wang et al 2022c hence the fates of zpt during the biological process especially in the continuous operating systems required in depth exploration besides the possible approaches to alleviate the zpt stress should be also conducted in the future including the acclimated microorganisms with high resistance and the introduction of certain pretreatment strategies i e advanced oxidation process to eliminate the zpt in wastewater and was 4 conclusion this work demonstrated that the effects of zpt on the was anaerobic digestion process and revealed the particular impacts on specific processes for vfas production the highest vfas production was enhanced from 353 mg cod l in control to 3318 mg cod l with low level of zpt while it was reduced to 1060 mg cod l under high level of zpt exposure the presence of zpt facilitated the was solubilization and hydrolysis but restrained the methanogenesis also the zpt enabled to alter the microbial community and benefitted the enrichment of functional hydrolytic acidifying microorganisms at low levels but inhibited the proliferation of methanogens moreover the genetic expressions involved in vfas biosynthesis were also enhanced under the low level of zpt since the anaerobic species could regulate the adaptive mechanism systems i e qs and tcss to resist and alleviate the zpt toxicity however the adaptive systems deactivated or weakened with high zpt stress which resulted in the reduced microbial metabolic activities and the poor performance for vfas promotion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
