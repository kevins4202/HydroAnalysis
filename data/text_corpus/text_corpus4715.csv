23575,during the past decades various empirical formulas have been proposed for computing shoaling wave heights there are no papers describing the applicability and accuracy of various empirical formulas based on a wide range of wave conditions the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of 10 empirical formulas together with the often used formulas shuto s and linear wave formulas for computing regular wave shoaling seventy one cases of measured shoaling wave heights from six sources of published experimental data were used to examine the formulas it was found that the shuto s formula gives the best predictions while the linear wave formula gives reasonable overall predictions of shoaling wave heights the best empirical formula has better accuracy than that of the linear wave formula but has slightly less accuracy than that of shuto s formula however the best empirical formula contains an implicit equation which has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice to simplify the calculation the best empirical formula was modified to an explicit form the new formula has slightly better accuracy than that of shuto s formula keywords empirical formula wave shoaling linear wave nonlinear wave cnoidal wave 1 introduction wave height is one of the most essential required factors for many coastal and ocean engineering applications such as the design of structures and the study of coastal and ocean processes when waves propagate to the nearshore zone wave profiles steepen and become more and more nonlinear and eventually waves break the transformation of wave heights in a shoaling zone can be determined from a wave shoaling model or formula common approaches to model the shoaling wave heights may be classified into 3 main approaches i e numerical approach analytical approach and empirical approach the numerical approach is used for solving numerically complex governing equations describing fluid or wave motions various governing equations have been used for computing wave propagation e g navier stokes equations e g the models of li and fleming 2001 li 2008 and bradford 2014 time dependent mild slope equation e g the models of copeland 1985 watanabe and maruyama 1986 and isobe 1994 and boussinesq equations e g the models of nwogu and demirbilek 2001 bingham et al 2009 and do carmo 2013 these detailed models are able to compute various wave properties however they require an extensive computational effort in addition a detailed description of wave properties e g time series of surface elevation and velocities is not needed for most practical work in the design of coastal and ocean structures the analytical approach is the use of analysis to solve simplified equations of wave motions which yield closed form solutions the common analytical wave theories are the analytical solution based on linear or 1st order stokes wave theory airy 1845 and the others are based on finite amplitude or nonlinear wave theories e g stokes higher order wave theory stokes 1847 and cnoidal wave theory korteweg and de vries 1895 the choice of a suitable wave theory is an essential task in the computation of wave shoaling no single wave theory can accurately account for wave shoaling from deep to shallow water lemehaute and wang 1980 several shoaling wave models have been proposed based on a combination of stokes and cnoidal wave theories e g the models of svendsen and brink kjaer 1972 shuto 1974 and isobe 1985 the ursell parameter is a common parameter that is used to indicate the nonlinearity of waves and is often used for defining a range of applications for stokes and cnoidal wave theories comparing the nonlinear shoaling wave models the model of shuto 1974 seems to be the most often used for practical applications isobe 1988 however because of its simplicity the linear wave theory is widely used in coastal engineering applications masselink et al 2014 the empirical approach is introduced to facilitate design works and preliminary studies of coastal processes various empirical formulas have been proposed for computing shoaling wave heights e g the formulas of iwagaki et al 1982 nielsen 1984 and yang et al 2015 most of the formulas were derived by fitting dimensionless parameters to data determined from analytical or numerical wave models the great benefit of this approach is simplicity and minimal computational effort which is easy to implement however as the formulas are crude they may not be expected to have good accuracy this makes some engineers hesitate in using the empirical formulas most of the recent research on wave shoaling concentrates on the numerical approach e g the work of beji 2016 liu and fang 2016 klonaris et al 2016 gouin et al 2016 and xiao et al 2016 however these models require an extensive computational effort in addition the analytical solutions of finite amplitude or nonlinear wave theories stokes higher order or cnoidal wave theories require considerable manipulations of long mathematical formulas for convenience some engineers prefer the simplest method which has reasonable accuracy for practical work there are 2 simple methods which may be suitable for computing wave shoaling in practical work i e the linear wave method and the empirical method applicability of the linear wave formula has been investigated by many researchers e g svendsen and brink kjaer 1972 shuto 1974 sakai and battjes 1980 and isobe 1985 it is well known that the linear wave theory underestimates on wave heights at the location of large ursell parameter near the breaking point however there are no papers describing the applicability and accuracy of various existing empirical formulas based on a wide range of wave conditions it is not clear whether the accuracies of the empirical formulas are acceptable moreover as there exist several simple empirical formulas it is not clear which formula is the most suitable hence the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of some selected empirical formulas for computing regular wave shoaling and find a suitable one the accuracy of the empirical formulas was also compared with the often used formulas for computing wave shoaling i e shuto s 1974 and linear wave formulas this paper is divided into three main parts the first part is a review of the often used formulas linear wave and shuto s 1974 formulas and the selected existing empirical formulas for computing wave shoaling the second part is the verification of the existing formulas for identifying a suitable one the third part describes the formula modification 2 existing formulas brief reviews of the often used formulas linear wave and shuto s 1974 formulas and the selected 10 empirical formulas for computing shoaling wave heights are described below a airy 1845 hereafter referred to as a45 introduced the linear wave theory 1st order stokes wave theory to describe the propagation of small amplitude wave on a horizontal bed because of the simplicity of the theory and the quite good accuracy the theory is widely used for practical work the wave height transformation is computed from the energy flux conservation law the energy flux conservation for computing wave shoaling in the shoaling zone between any stations 1 and 2 can be written as 1 f x 1 f x 2 where f x is the energy flux the energy flux based on linear wave theory can be expressed as 2 f x 1 8 ρ g h 2 c g 1 8 ρ g h 2 c 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the wave height c g is the group velocity c is the phase velocity k is the wave number which is computed from dispersion equation by an iteration method and h is the mean water depth the wave shoaling can be computed from the energy flux conservation equation eq 1 with the formula of the energy flux f x at deepwater and any position in the shoaling zone as 3 1 8 ρ g h o 2 c g o 1 8 ρ g h 2 c g or 4 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where h o is the deepwater wave height and c g o is the deepwater group velocity b shuto 1974 hereafter referred to as s74 derived approximate formulas of wave shoaling from the kakutani 1971 equation which is an extended form of korteweg and de vries 1895 equation for a mildly sloping bottom results are shown in table 1 the shoaling law depends on the shallow water ursell parameter u s as u s becomes very small less than 2 the shoaling law becomes the shoaling law of the linear wave theory in shallow water a comparison with 16 cases of measured wave shoaling over uniform slope beaches collected from 3 sources shows that the shoaling law shown in table 1 has to be adjusted and used for u s 30 while the linear wave theory has good accuracy for u s 30 for practical purposes the shoaling law shown in table 1 was simplified to be 5a h c g constant for u s 30 5b h h 2 7 constant for 30 u s 50 5c h h 5 2 u s 2 3 constant for u s 50 where u s g t 2 h h 2 is the shallow water ursell parameter the ursell parameters u s 30 and 50 are used as the boundaries for changing the shoaling formulas it should be noted that eq 5 is not exactly derived from the wave theory but is derived from both theory and experimental data therefore eq 5 may be considered as a semi empirical formula in addition eq 5 is an implicit equation because u s is a function of h therefore eq 5 has to be solved by an iteration method the shuto 1974 s formula is a piecewise function there are 3 equations for 3 regions of u s e g eq 5a is used when a wave is in the region u s 30 each equation represents the relationship between wave heights at 2 stations the equation is used to compute wave height at a particular station from the known wave height at another station but the wave heights at the 2 stations must be in the same region of u s hence the wave heights at u s 30 and u s 50 are used to determine wave heights in the region 30 u s 50 and u s 50 respectively therefore it is necessary to determine the wave heights at u s 30 and 50 before using the corresponding equations since the s74 s formula has been found to agree reasonably well with experimental data for a wide range of wave steepness it is often used in practical work isobe 1988 in addition the formula of s74 together with the formula of goda 1975 is listed in several standards e g bsi 2000 and ocdi 2002 some researchers e g iwagaki et al 1982 walker and headland 1982 hattori 1986 hardy and kraus 1987 and goda 2000 considered the formula as an approximation formula or shoaling theory hence the formula is not considered as an empirical formula c sakai and battjes 1980 hereafter referred to as sb80 determined wave shoaling based on cokelet s 1977 wave theory the results were plotted in the form of curves showing relationships among h h o h o l o and h l o the curves were compared with 6 cases of measured wave heights of hansen and svendsen 1979 the agreement between the computed and the measured shoaling wave heights is good except near the breaking point where the computed wave height is larger than the measured wave height le roux 2007 recast the curves into the following equations 6 h h o αexp b h o l o in which 7 a 0 5875 h l o 0 18 f o r h l o 0 0844 0 9672 h l o 2 0 5013 h l o 0 9521 f o r 0 0844 h l o 0 6 1 f o r h l o 0 6 8 b 0 0042 h l o 2 3211 where a and b are coefficients and l o g t 2 2 π is the deepwater wavelength however le roux 2007 did not verify the formula eq 6 with any experimental data d iwagaki et al 1982 hereafter referred to as i82 determined wave shoaling based on a combination of the 4th order stokes wave theory and the approximate form of the cnoidal wave theory called the hyperbolic wave theory eight cases of measured shoaling wave heights from their own experiment were used to verify the model the agreement between the computed and the measured shoaling wave heights is good in addition they related the nonlinear shoaling coefficient with several dimensionless parameters i e linear shoaling coefficient relative depth and deep water wave steepness and fitted the results with the following formula 9 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 0015 h o h l o 2 8 h o l o 1 2 in which 1 tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h is the linear shoaling coefficient and the variables h o l o c g o and c g are calculated based on linear wave theory however the empirical formula eq 9 was not verified by any measured data e nielsen 1982 hereafter referred to as n82 proposed explicit formulas for computing various linear wave properties e g c c o c g c o and k h the formulas were derived from a curve fitting process based on an assumed general form of c c o applying the formula of c g c o for computing linear wave shoaling the formula becomes 10 h h o 4 k o h 0 25 e x p k o h 4 where k o 4 π 2 g t 2 is the deepwater wave number f nielsen 1984 hereafter referred to as n84 proposed explicit formulas for computing various linear wave properties e g k h tanh k h and c g c o the formulas were derived based on an assumed general form of k h dispersion relation and maclaurin series applying the formula of c g c o for computing linear wave shoaling the formula becomes 11 h h o 2 k o h 1 1 2 k o h 7 72 k o h 2 g kweon and goda 1996 hereafter referred to as kg96 recalibrated the formula of i82 with the computed results from the formula of s74 after recalibration the formula is modified to be 12 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 0015 h o h l o 2 87 h o l o 1 27 h muttray and oumeraci 2000 hereafter referred to as mo00 proposed an empirical formula for computing nonlinear shoaling coefficient based on the shoaling law of s74 they related the nonlinear shoaling coefficient with the linear shoaling coefficient and nonlinearity parameter π of goda 1983 rewriting the shoaling coefficient in terms of shoaling wave height the formula becomes 13 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h f o r π 2 15 h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 0 4 π 2 15 5 4 f o r 2 15 π 0 5 h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 69 0 6 π f o r π 0 5 in which 14 π h l coth 3 k h where π is the nonlinearity parameter the formula of mo00 is a piecewise function there are 3 equations for 3 regions of π each equation represents the relationship between wave heights at a particular station and the deepwater wave height a shoaling wave height can be computed directly from the known deepwater wave height therefore it is not necessary to determine the wave heights at the region boundaries i e at π 2 15 and 0 5 as in the s74 formula the formula of mo00 is simpler than that of s74 but it still has to be solved by an iteration method i tajima and madsen 2002 hereafter referred to as tm02 determined shoaling wave heights based on the modified boussinesq type model of nwogu 1993 for various wave and bottom slope conditions they related the nonlinear shoaling coefficient h h o with several dimensionless parameters i e linear shoaling coefficient relative depth beach slope and deepwater wave steepness and fitted the results with the following formula 15 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 a 1 e x p a 2 h l o in which 16 a 1 2 2 2 tanh 55 m tanh 1 6 m 1 5 25 h o l o 30 m 0 1 h o l o 17 a 2 9 5 h o l o 0 5 10 where a 1 and a 2 are coefficients and m is the beach slope it should be noted that tm02 did not verify the wave model of nwogu 1993 but they verified their empirical formula with 1 case of regular wave shoaling from cox and kobayashi s 1996 experiments however nwogu 1993 had verified his model with 3 cases of regular wave shoaling from his own experiments j wang et al 2008 hereafter referred to as w08 determined wave shoaling based on nonlinear boussinesq type wave model of lynett and liu 2004 for various wave conditions the model was verified with 4 cases of regular wave shoaling from the experiments of ting and kirby 1994 govender et al 2002 and de serio and mossa 2006 in addition they related the ratio of nonlinear and linear shoaling coefficients with the ursell parameter u r and fitted the results with the following formula 18 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 0 80 tanh u r 1070 1 06 where u r h l 2 h 3 is the local ursell parameter equation 18 is an implicit equation because u r is a function of h therefore eq 18 has to be solved by an iteration method it should be noted that w08 did not verify the empirical formula with measured data of regular wave shoaling k fenton 2013 hereafter referred to as f13 suggested to compute linear wave shoaling by using the empirical formula of fenton and mckee 1990 for computing k h he showed that the shoaling coefficient computed from his suggestion almost coincides with that of the linear wave theory the formula for computing wave shoaling can be expressed as 19 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h in which 20 k h σ 2 h g coth 2 3 σ h g 3 2 where σ 2 π t is the angular frequency l yang et al 2015 hereafter referred to as y15 developed an empirical formula for computing wave shoaling based on their own experiments the formula was developed to account for the rapid increase of shoaling wave height near the breaking point after calibration the following formula was proposed to compute the shoaling wave height near the breaking point h r 21 h r 0 72 h o l o 2 h 0 017 l o 2 h for a large relative depth the wave height h r is less than the wave height computed from linear wave theory h l the values of h r and h l increase with a decrease of the relative depth h l o but the rate of increasing h r is larger than that of h l hence the lines of h r and h l intersect at a certain point and h r h l after that in a small relative depth region the shoaling wave height is computed by selecting the larger value between the computed wave height from linear wave theory and the computed wave height from eq 21 as 22 h m a x h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 72 h o l o 2 h 0 017 l o 2 h yang et al 2015 verified their formula with 8 cases of measured wave heights from their experiments and the experiments of you 2004 and hansen and svendsen 1979 and showed that their formula gives good predictions in total there are 12 formulas to be considered in this study four formulas were developed for linear wave shoaling the formulas of a45 n82 n84 and f13 while the others were developed for nonlinear wave shoaling most of the formulas except s74 mo00 and w08 are expressed in the form of explicit equations the formulas of s74 mo00 and w08 contain implicit equations in terms of local wave height h which have to be solved by an iteration method it is well known that the linear wave formula gives under prediction for large ursell parameters which indicates large nonlinearity of waves it is expected that the accuracy of nonlinear wave formulas is better than that of linear wave formulas the existing formulas of nonlinear wave shoaling were proposed as functions of different dimensionless parameters i e h o l o l o h m π u r and u s the formulas were shown by the developers to give good prediction with laboratory data or computed results from the selected wave models that were used in the calibration or verification however as the formulas are different the computed results from various formulas should differ from each other therefore it is not clear which dimensionless parameters or formulas are suitable to describe the nonlinear wave shoaling and which formula gives better accuracy since most of the existing formulas were developed under limited laboratory conditions their validity may be limited to the range of laboratory conditions that were employed in the calibrations or verifications there is one way to examine the validity of the empirical formulas that is to verify the computed results with a wide range of wave conditions the main objective of the next section is to find the most reliable formula that predicts well for a wide range of wave conditions 3 formula verification the measured data of wave height transformation in the shoaling zone are used to verify the formulas experimental data from 6 sources including 71 cases have been collected for verifying the formulas a summary of the collected experimental data is given in table 2 the experimental data cover a wide range of wave conditions 0 001 h o l o 0 076 1 u s 1248 and 0 005 h l o 0 721 the experiments were performed with a fixed plane beach of slope m ranging between 0 03 and 0 05 the basic parameter for determination of the overall accuracy of the formulas is the root mean square relative error e r which is defined as 23 e r 100 i 1 n m h c i h m i 2 i 1 n m h m i 2 where i is the wave height number h c i is the computed wave height of number i h m i is the measured wave height of number i and n m is the total number of measured wave heights a small value of e r indicates a good overall accuracy of the formula the measured wave heights in the shoaling zone from 6 sources shown in table 2 are used to examine the accuracy of each formula the errors e r of the 12 formulas for the 6 data sources and all data points are shown in table 3 the results can be summarized as follows a the overall error e r of the 12 formulas is in the range of 5 5 2834 1 the formula of s74 gives the best overall predictions e r 5 5 while the formula of y15 gives the worst predictions e r 2834 1 b the overall accuracy of the formulas in descending order are the formulas of s74 w08 kg96 i82 mo00 f13 a45 n82 n84 tm02 sb80 and y15 c most of the formulas except sb80 tm02 and y15 give reasonably good overall predictions e r 10 the formulas of sb80 tm02 and y15 have significantly less accuracy than that of the linear wave formula and should be used with care in practice d the linear wave formula a45 gives reasonable overall predictions of shoaling wave heights e r 9 7 e the advantage of the simplified formulas for computing linear wave shoaling n82 n84 and f13 is that it is not necessary to determine the wave number by iteration as in the linear wave formula comparing among the simplified formulas for computing linear wave shoaling n82 n84 and f13 the formula of f13 gives slightly better predictions than the others for most experiments except the experiment of ss01 the simplified formulas of the linear wave theory n82 n84 and f13 have almost the same accuracy however for the experiment of ss01 the formulas of n82 and n84 have less accuracy than that of the linear wave theory a45 while the formula f13 has almost the same accuracy as that of a45 this shows that the formulas of n82 and n84 may have a limitation for computing linear wave shoaling it is interesting to see a comparison in more detail with a shoaling curve fig 1 shows the values of computed shoaling coefficients k s from the formulas of a45 n82 n84 and f13 in terms of h l o the curves indicate that the formula of f13 has good agreement with linear wave shoaling for all conditions while the formulas of n82 and n84 have good agreement only for h l o 0 3 the deviations of n82 and n84 from the linear wave theory are significant for a relative depth h l o 0 3 this means that the formulas of n82 and n84 cannot be used in general cases they should be used for computing linear wave shoaling for h l o 0 3 f as mentioned before y15 showed that their formula gives good predictions with measured wave heights however table 3 shows that y15 gives the overall worst and unrealistic predictions it is interesting to see the performance of y15 in more detail to identify limitations of the formula the ratio of computed wave height from y15 and measured wave height h c h m is plotted against several dimensionless parameters i e ursell parameter u r relative depth h l o and deepwater wave steepness h o l o it is found that the deepwater wave steepness h o l o can be used to identify the limitations of y15 fig 2 shows the relationship between h c h m and h o l o the solid line in the figure represents perfect agreement it can be seen that the formula of y15 gives quite good predictions for large deepwater wave steepness h o l o 0 02 but significantly overestimates for small deepwater wave steepness h o l o 0 02 this means that the formula of y15 is applicable only for h o l o 0 02 g comparing among the 10 empirical formulas the formula of w08 gives the best overall predictions with e r of 5 8 this number confirms in a quantitative sense the high degree of practicality of the formula this means that it is possible to use the empirical formula for computing shoaling wave heights the best empirical formula w08 has better accuracy than that of the linear wave formula a45 but has slightly less accuracy than that of s74 s formula 3 1 verification in terms of ursell parameter it is well known that the ursell parameter u r h l 2 h 3 or u s g t 2 h h 2 indicates the non linearity of waves and it is usually used for defining the range of applications for various wave theories accuracy of the selected formulas is expected to depend on u r or u s following s74 the dependence of error on u s is considered in this study in the present study u s is classified into 4 groups i e u s 30 30 u s 50 50 u s 100 and u s 100 the errors e r of the 12 formulas for 4 groups of u s are shown in table 4 the results can be summarized as follows a although the formula of s74 gives the best overall predictions it does not give the best predictions for all ranges of u s the formula has significantly better accuracy than the others for u s 100 b the errors e r of most formulas i e except n82 and n84 tend to increase with increasing u s c the errors of linear wave formulas a45 n82 n84 and f13 for u s 30 are about the same as that of 30 u s 50 and significantly increase when u s 50 d for u s 50 the linear wave formulas a45 n82 n84 and f13 give very good predictions and have slightly better accuracy than those of the top 2 formulas s74 and w08 however for u s 50 the errors of the linear wave formulas a45 n82 n84 and f13 are larger than those of s74 and w08 it is expected that the nonlinear influences become significant when u s is greater than about 50 this shows clearly that a small u s represents well the linear theory while a large u s needs nonlinear correction terms e comparing among the 8 nonlinear wave formulas s74 sb90 i82 kg96 mo00 tm02 w08 and y15 the errors of most formulas i e except s74 and w08 for u s 100 are much larger than that for u s 100 the nonlinear terms in those formulas may not be suitable for u s greater than about 100 f the top 2 formulas s74 and w08 give good predictions for all ranges of u s several researchers e g svendsen and brink kjaer 1972 shuto 1974 sakai and battjes 1980 and isobe 1985 showed that the linear wave theory gives significant underestimation for high ursell parameters therefore it is not surprising to see that the linear wave formulas give considerable error for high u s this considerable error indicates the importance of nonlinearities of waves in the region of high u s several form of equations and dimensionless parameters were introduced in the empirical formulas to account for the effect of wave nonlinearity on wave shoaling since the formulas differ from each other their accuracies are different however the best empirical formula w08 may be used to identify the significant nonlinearity parameters and the effect of nonlinearity on wave shoaling the formula of w08 consists of 2 terms i e the linear shoaling term and nonlinear correction term the nonlinear correction term in w08 is a function of u r this means that nonlinear effects on wave shoaling depend on u r this is also not surprising since the ursell parameter is a common parameter that is used to indicate the nonlinearity of waves or used to select a wave theory e g stokes or cnoidal wave theories comparing the errors of the linear wave and w08 formulas it can be seen that the effect of wave nonlinearity does not appear in the region u s 50 and the effect tends to increase with u s in the region u s 50 although it is clear that the top 2 formulas s74 and w08 have good accuracy for all ranges of u s and give considerable better predictions than that of the linear wave theory a45 it is interesting to see the performance of a45 s74 and w08 in more detail figs 3 5 show the ratio of computed wave height from a45 s74 and w08 and measured wave height h c h m versus the measured shallow water ursell parameter u s the solid line in each figure represents perfect agreement it can be seen that a the linear wave theory a45 gives good predictions for u s 40 and tends to underestimate for u s 40 for the high u s e g u s 200 the use of the linear wave theory leads to considerable underestimation and consequently unconservative designs b the formula of s74 gives generally good predictions for all ranges of u s however it tends to overestimate for u s 200 c the formula of w08 gives also generally good predictions for all ranges of u s but it tends to slightly underestimate for u s 100 as the formulas of s74 and w08 have similar accuracy and give better overall predictions than the others they are recommended to be used for computing wave shoaling however for implementation the formula of w08 is simpler than that of s74 considering accuracy and simplicity of the formulas the formula of w08 seems to be the most attractive one for practical work in addition the formula of w08 can tolerate empirical modifications whereas a theoretical one s74 cannot however the formula of w08 is in the form of an implicit equation which has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice 4 formula modification although the empirical formula of w08 gives overall good predictions e r 5 8 it is in the form of an implicit equation the formula has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice the main objective of this section is to formulate a simple explicit formula based on the formula of w08 following the concept of w08 the ratio of wave height to linear wave height h h l may be a function of nonlinear parameters s74 used u s and w08 used u r as the nonlinearity parameters to simplify the calculation the formula of w08 is modified to be an explicit equation by changing the parameter from the ursell parameter u r h l 2 h 3 or u s g t 2 h h 2 or u s g t 2 h h 2 to another dimensionless parameter that does not depend on local wave height h i e u r o h o l o 2 h 3 or u s o h o l o h 2 the general forms of the modified formula can be expressed as 24 h h l f 1 u r o 25 h h l f 2 u s o where f 1 and f 2 are functions and h l is the wave height calculated based on linear wave theory although the linear wave formula eq 4 is simple iteration is needed for computing the wave number k the formula of f13 has almost the same accuracy as that of the linear wave formula eq 4 but the calculation is simpler hence the formula of f13 eq 19 is used to compute h l as 26 h l h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h the derivation of the formula is divided into 3 steps i e determination of basic formula formula calibration and formula verification 4 1 basic formula as s74 s formula gives the best predictions it is used to identify the related nonlinearity parameter and the function f of eqs 24 and 25 synthetic data of shoaling wave heights h and linear wave heights h l are generated by using s74 s formula eq 5 and eq 26 for 6 conditions of deepwater wave steepness h o l o i e 0 001 0 002 0 005 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 then the values of h h l u r o and u s o are determined from the synthetic data the function f can be determined from the relationships of h h l versus u r o and u s o the relationships of h h l versus u r o and u s o are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that the relation of h h l versus u r o depends largely on h o l o while fig 7 shows that the relation of h h l versus u s o depends slightly on h o l o therefore the relationship of h h l versus u s o in fig 7 should be simpler than the relationship of h h l versus u r o in fig 6 hence fig 7 is used to derive the function f fig 7 shows that h h l varies systematically with u s o the value of h h l is constant and equal to 1 for a small value of u s o then increases with increasing u s o and tends to approach infinity for a large value of u s o the relationship of h h l versus u s o can be fitted to a hyperbolic cotangent function as 27 h h l coth k 1 u s o k 2 where k 1 and k 2 are constants 4 2 formula calibration the measured data from is69 and dm16 in total 13 cases are used to calibrate the constants k 1 and k 2 in eq 27 fig 8 shows the relationships of h h l and u s o h o l o h 2 based on the measured data from is69 and dm16 the calibrations are conducted by gradually adjusting the coefficients k 1 and k 2 until the minimum error e r is obtained the optimum values of k 1 and k 2 are 6 1 and 0 51 respectively the best fitted line is shown as the solid line in fig 8 substituting the constants k 1 6 1 and k 2 0 51 and h l from eq 26 into eq 27 the modified formula can be expressed as 28 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h coth 6 1 u s o 0 51 this formula is referred to as mwf hereafter the formula is in the form of an explicit equation which can be used to compute h directly the modified formula is much simpler than those of s74 and w08 4 3 formula verification a straightforward way to examine the accuracy of a formula is to compare the computed wave height with the measured data in order to evaluate the accuracy of computation the examination of the modified formula mwf is carried out by using the measured wave heights from table 2 the errors er of the modified formula mwf on computing wave shoaling are shown in the last rows of tables 3 and 4 the results from tables 3 and 4 are summarized as follows a the overall error of the modified formula mwf for computing wave shoaling is 5 2 comparing the overall errors e r of existing and modified formulas the modified formula mwf has slightly better accuracy than that of the best empirical formula w08 and s74 b in comparison with the errors of linear wave formula of a45 and the simplified linear wave formula of f13 the formula mwf has significantly better accuracy for the estimation of wave shoaling furthermore the modified formulas mwf is slightly more complicated than that of f13 but simpler than that of a45 c fig 9 shows the ratio of computed wave height from the modified formula mwf and measured wave height h c h m versus the ursell parameter u s the solid line in the figures represent perfect agreement it can be seen that the modified formula gives generally good predictions for all ranges of u s the accuracy of mwf is almost the same as that of s74 d no single formula gives the best prediction for all ranges of u s the formulas that give the best prediction for u s 50 50 u s 100 and u s 100 are a45 w08 and mwf respectively e in the present study the most suitable formula is selected based on accuracy and simplicity considering the accuracy of the formulas the formulas of s74 w08 and mwf have nearly the same accuracy 5 2 u s 5 8 and have better accuracy than the others considering the simplicity of the 3 formulas mwf is the simplest therefore mwf is judged to be overall the most suitable formula 5 conclusions this study concentrates on empirical formulas for computing shoaling wave heights the empirical formulas were introduced to facilitate engineers for design works and preliminary studies of coastal processes in a shoaling zone during the past decades several empirical formulas have been proposed for computing shoaling wave heights most of the formulas were developed empirically from computed results of nonlinear wave models which were not calibrated or calibrated with limited experimental data there are no papers describing the applicability and accuracy of various existing empirical formulas based on a wide range of wave conditions the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of 10 empirical formulas for computing regular wave shoaling seventy one cases of measured shoaling wave heights from six sources of published experimental data were used to examine the formulas the data cover a range of deepwater wave steepness from 0 001 to 0 076 the accuracy of the formulas was also compared with the often used formulas shuto s 1974 and linear wave formulas it is found that errors of most formulas tend to increase with increasing ursell parameter the shuto s 1974 formula gives the best predictions while the linear wave formula gives reasonable overall predictions of shoaling wave heights three empirical formulas out of ten have less accuracy than that of the linear wave formula and should be used with care in practice comparing the 10 empirical formulas the formula of wang et al 2008 gives the best predictions e r 5 2 the best empirical formula has better accuracy than that of the linear wave formula but has slightly less accuracy than that of shuto s 1974 formula this means that it is possible to use an empirical formula for computing shoaling wave heights however the formula of wang et al 2008 contains an implicit equation which has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice to simplify the calculation the formula of wang et al 2008 is modified to be an explicit equation by changing the parameter from the local ursell parameter u r h l 2 h 3 to a new deepwater ursell parameter u s o h o l o h 2 and replacing the linear wave shoaling of airy 1845 with that of fenton 2013 the modified formula is much simpler and has slightly better accuracy than those of shuto 1974 and wang et al 2008 however the modified formula mwf does not give the best prediction for all ranges of u s the formulas that give the best prediction for u s 50 50 u s 100 and u s 100 are a45 w08 and mwf respectively 
23575,during the past decades various empirical formulas have been proposed for computing shoaling wave heights there are no papers describing the applicability and accuracy of various empirical formulas based on a wide range of wave conditions the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of 10 empirical formulas together with the often used formulas shuto s and linear wave formulas for computing regular wave shoaling seventy one cases of measured shoaling wave heights from six sources of published experimental data were used to examine the formulas it was found that the shuto s formula gives the best predictions while the linear wave formula gives reasonable overall predictions of shoaling wave heights the best empirical formula has better accuracy than that of the linear wave formula but has slightly less accuracy than that of shuto s formula however the best empirical formula contains an implicit equation which has to be solved by an iteration method and may

empirical formula wave shoaling linear wave nonlinear wave cnoidal wave 1 introduction wave height is one of the most essential required factors for many coastal and ocean engineering applications such as the design of structures and the study of coastal and ocean processes when waves propagate to the nearshore zone wave profiles steepen and become more and more nonlinear and eventually waves break the transformation of wave heights in a shoaling zone can be determined from a wave shoaling model or formula common approaches to model the shoaling wave heights may be classified into 3 main approaches i e numerical approach analytical approach and empirical approach the numerical approach is used for solving numerically complex governing equations describing fluid or wave motions various governing equations have been used for computing wave propagation e g navier stokes equations e g the models of li and fleming 2001 li 2008 and bradford 2014 time dependent mild slope equation e g the models of copeland 1985 watanabe and maruyama 1986 and isobe 1994 and boussinesq equations e g the models of nwogu and demirbilek 2001 bingham et al 2009 and do carmo 2013 these detailed models are able to compute various wave properties however they require an extensive computational effort in addition a detailed description of wave properties e g time series of surface elevation and velocities is not needed for most practical work in the design of coastal and ocean structures the analytical approach is the use of analysis to solve simplified equations of wave motions which yield closed form solutions the common analytical wave theories are the analytical solution based on linear or 1st order stokes wave theory airy 1845 and the others are based on finite amplitude or nonlinear wave theories e g stokes higher order wave theory stokes 1847 and cnoidal wave theory korteweg and de vries 1895 the choice of a suitable wave theory is an essential task in the computation of wave shoaling no single wave theory can accurately account for wave shoaling from deep to shallow water lemehaute and wang 1980 several shoaling wave models have been proposed based on a combination of stokes and cnoidal wave theories e g the models of svendsen and brink kjaer 1972 shuto 1974 and isobe 1985 the ursell parameter is a common parameter that is used to indicate the nonlinearity of waves and is often used for defining a range of applications for stokes and cnoidal wave theories comparing the nonlinear shoaling wave models the model of shuto 1974 seems to be the most often used for practical applications isobe 1988 however because of its simplicity the linear wave theory is widely used in coastal engineering applications masselink et al 2014 the empirical approach is introduced to facilitate design works and preliminary studies of coastal processes various empirical formulas have been proposed for computing shoaling wave heights e g the formulas of iwagaki et al 1982 nielsen 1984 and yang et al 2015 most of the formulas were derived by fitting dimensionless parameters to data determined from analytical or numerical wave models the great benefit of this approach is simplicity and minimal computational effort which is easy to implement however as the formulas are crude they may not be expected to have good accuracy this makes some engineers hesitate in using the empirical formulas most of the recent research on wave shoaling concentrates on the numerical approach e g the work of beji 2016 liu and fang 2016 klonaris et al 2016 gouin et al 2016 and xiao et al 2016 however these models require an extensive computational effort in addition the analytical solutions of finite amplitude or nonlinear wave theories stokes higher order or cnoidal wave theories require considerable manipulations of long mathematical formulas for convenience some engineers prefer the simplest method which has reasonable accuracy for practical work there are 2 simple methods which may be suitable for computing wave shoaling in practical work i e the linear wave method and the empirical method applicability of the linear wave formula has been investigated by many researchers e g svendsen and brink kjaer 1972 shuto 1974 sakai and battjes 1980 and isobe 1985 it is well known that the linear wave theory underestimates on wave heights at the location of large ursell parameter near the breaking point however there are no papers describing the applicability and accuracy of various existing empirical formulas based on a wide range of wave conditions it is not clear whether the accuracies of the empirical formulas are acceptable moreover as there exist several simple empirical formulas it is not clear which formula is the most suitable hence the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of some selected empirical formulas for computing regular wave shoaling and find a suitable one the accuracy of the empirical formulas was also compared with the often used formulas for computing wave shoaling i e shuto s 1974 and linear wave formulas this paper is divided into three main parts the first part is a review of the often used formulas linear wave and shuto s 1974 formulas and the selected existing empirical formulas for computing wave shoaling the second part is the verification of the existing formulas for identifying a suitable one the third part describes the formula modification 2 existing formulas brief reviews of the often used formulas linear wave and shuto s 1974 formulas and the selected 10 empirical formulas for computing shoaling wave heights are described below a airy 1845 hereafter referred to as a45 introduced the linear wave theory 1st order stokes wave theory to describe the propagation of small amplitude wave on a horizontal bed because of the simplicity of the theory and the quite good accuracy the theory is widely used for practical work the wave height transformation is computed from the energy flux conservation law the energy flux conservation for computing wave shoaling in the shoaling zone between any stations 1 and 2 can be written as 1 f x 1 f x 2 where f x is the energy flux the energy flux based on linear wave theory can be expressed as 2 f x 1 8 ρ g h 2 c g 1 8 ρ g h 2 c 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the wave height c g is the group velocity c is the phase velocity k is the wave number which is computed from dispersion equation by an iteration method and h is the mean water depth the wave shoaling can be computed from the energy flux conservation equation eq 1 with the formula of the energy flux f x at deepwater and any position in the shoaling zone as 3 1 8 ρ g h o 2 c g o 1 8 ρ g h 2 c g or 4 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where h o is the deepwater wave height and c g o is the deepwater group velocity b shuto 1974 hereafter referred to as s74 derived approximate formulas of wave shoaling from the kakutani 1971 equation which is an extended form of korteweg and de vries 1895 equation for a mildly sloping bottom results are shown in table 1 the shoaling law depends on the shallow water ursell parameter u s as u s becomes very small less than 2 the shoaling law becomes the shoaling law of the linear wave theory in shallow water a comparison with 16 cases of measured wave shoaling over uniform slope beaches collected from 3 sources shows that the shoaling law shown in table 1 has to be adjusted and used for u s 30 while the linear wave theory has good accuracy for u s 30 for practical purposes the shoaling law shown in table 1 was simplified to be 5a h c g constant for u s 30 5b h h 2 7 constant for 30 u s 50 5c h h 5 2 u s 2 3 constant for u s 50 where u s g t 2 h h 2 is the shallow water ursell parameter the ursell parameters u s 30 and 50 are used as the boundaries for changing the shoaling formulas it should be noted that eq 5 is not exactly derived from the wave theory but is derived from both theory and experimental data therefore eq 5 may be considered as a semi empirical formula in addition eq 5 is an implicit equation because u s is a function of h therefore eq 5 has to be solved by an iteration method the shuto 1974 s formula is a piecewise function there are 3 equations for 3 regions of u s e g eq 5a is used when a wave is in the region u s 30 each equation represents the relationship between wave heights at 2 stations the equation is used to compute wave height at a particular station from the known wave height at another station but the wave heights at the 2 stations must be in the same region of u s hence the wave heights at u s 30 and u s 50 are used to determine wave heights in the region 30 u s 50 and u s 50 respectively therefore it is necessary to determine the wave heights at u s 30 and 50 before using the corresponding equations since the s74 s formula has been found to agree reasonably well with experimental data for a wide range of wave steepness it is often used in practical work isobe 1988 in addition the formula of s74 together with the formula of goda 1975 is listed in several standards e g bsi 2000 and ocdi 2002 some researchers e g iwagaki et al 1982 walker and headland 1982 hattori 1986 hardy and kraus 1987 and goda 2000 considered the formula as an approximation formula or shoaling theory hence the formula is not considered as an empirical formula c sakai and battjes 1980 hereafter referred to as sb80 determined wave shoaling based on cokelet s 1977 wave theory the results were plotted in the form of curves showing relationships among h h o h o l o and h l o the curves were compared with 6 cases of measured wave heights of hansen and svendsen 1979 the agreement between the computed and the measured shoaling wave heights is good except near the breaking point where the computed wave height is larger than the measured wave height le roux 2007 recast the curves into the following equations 6 h h o αexp b h o l o in which 7 a 0 5875 h l o 0 18 f o r h l o 0 0844 0 9672 h l o 2 0 5013 h l o 0 9521 f o r 0 0844 h l o 0 6 1 f o r h l o 0 6 8 b 0 0042 h l o 2 3211 where a and b are coefficients and l o g t 2 2 π is the deepwater wavelength however le roux 2007 did not verify the formula eq 6 with any experimental data d iwagaki et al 1982 hereafter referred to as i82 determined wave shoaling based on a combination of the 4th order stokes wave theory and the approximate form of the cnoidal wave theory called the hyperbolic wave theory eight cases of measured shoaling wave heights from their own experiment were used to verify the model the agreement between the computed and the measured shoaling wave heights is good in addition they related the nonlinear shoaling coefficient with several dimensionless parameters i e linear shoaling coefficient relative depth and deep water wave steepness and fitted the results with the following formula 9 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 0015 h o h l o 2 8 h o l o 1 2 in which 1 tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h is the linear shoaling coefficient and the variables h o l o c g o and c g are calculated based on linear wave theory however the empirical formula eq 9 was not verified by any measured data e nielsen 1982 hereafter referred to as n82 proposed explicit formulas for computing various linear wave properties e g c c o c g c o and k h the formulas were derived from a curve fitting process based on an assumed general form of c c o applying the formula of c g c o for computing linear wave shoaling the formula becomes 10 h h o 4 k o h 0 25 e x p k o h 4 where k o 4 π 2 g t 2 is the deepwater wave number f nielsen 1984 hereafter referred to as n84 proposed explicit formulas for computing various linear wave properties e g k h tanh k h and c g c o the formulas were derived based on an assumed general form of k h dispersion relation and maclaurin series applying the formula of c g c o for computing linear wave shoaling the formula becomes 11 h h o 2 k o h 1 1 2 k o h 7 72 k o h 2 g kweon and goda 1996 hereafter referred to as kg96 recalibrated the formula of i82 with the computed results from the formula of s74 after recalibration the formula is modified to be 12 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 0015 h o h l o 2 87 h o l o 1 27 h muttray and oumeraci 2000 hereafter referred to as mo00 proposed an empirical formula for computing nonlinear shoaling coefficient based on the shoaling law of s74 they related the nonlinear shoaling coefficient with the linear shoaling coefficient and nonlinearity parameter π of goda 1983 rewriting the shoaling coefficient in terms of shoaling wave height the formula becomes 13 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h f o r π 2 15 h o tanh k h 1 2 k h

piecewise function there are 3 equations for 3 regions of π each equation represents the relationship between wave heights at a particular station and the deepwater wave height a shoaling wave height can be computed directly from the known deepwater wave height therefore it is not necessary to determine the wave heights at the region boundaries i e at π 2 15 and 0 5 as in the s74 formula the formula of mo00 is simpler than that of s74 but it still has to be solved by an iteration method i tajima and madsen 2002 hereafter referred to as tm02 determined shoaling wave heights based on the modified boussinesq type model of nwogu 1993 for various wave and bottom slope conditions they related the nonlinear shoaling coefficient h h o with several dimensionless parameters i e linear shoaling coefficient relative depth beach slope and deepwater wave steepness and fitted the results with the following formula 15 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 a 1 e x p a 2 h l o in which 16 a 1 2 2 2 tanh 55 m tanh 1 6 m 1 5 25 h o l o 30 m 0 1 h o l o 17 a 2 9 5 h o l o 0 5 10 where a 1 and a 2 are coefficients and m is the beach slope it should be noted that tm02 did not verify the wave model of nwogu 1993 but they verified their empirical formula with 1 case of regular wave shoaling from cox and kobayashi s 1996 experiments however nwogu 1993 had verified his model with 3 cases of regular wave shoaling from his own experiments j wang et al 2008 hereafter referred to as w08 determined wave shoaling based on nonlinear boussinesq type wave model of lynett and liu 2004 for various wave conditions the model was verified with 4 cases of regular wave shoaling from the experiments of ting and kirby 1994 govender et al 2002 and de serio and mossa 2006 in addition they related the ratio of nonlinear and linear shoaling coefficients with the ursell parameter u r and fitted the results with the following formula 18 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 0 80 tanh u r 1070 1 06 where u r h l 2 h 3 is the local ursell parameter equation 18 is an implicit equation because u r is a function of h therefore eq 18 has to be solved by an iteration method it should be noted that w08 did not verify the empirical formula with measured data of regular wave shoaling k fenton 2013 hereafter referred to as f13 suggested to compute linear wave shoaling by using the empirical formula of fenton and mckee 1990 for computing k h he showed that the shoaling coefficient computed from his suggestion almost coincides with that of the linear wave theory the formula for computing wave shoaling can be expressed as 19 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h in which 20 k h σ 2 h g coth 2 3 σ h g 3 2 where σ 2 π t is the angular frequency l yang et al 2015 hereafter referred to as y15 developed an empirical formula for computing wave shoaling based on their own experiments the formula was developed to account for the rapid increase of shoaling wave height near the breaking point after calibration the following formula was proposed to compute the shoaling wave height near the breaking point h r 21 h r 0 72 h o l o 2 h 0 017 l o 2 h for a large relative depth the wave height h r is less than the wave height computed from linear wave theory h l the values of h r and h l increase with a decrease of the relative depth h l o but the rate of increasing h r is larger than that of h l hence the lines of h r and h l intersect at a certain point and h r h l after that in a small relative depth region the shoaling wave height is computed by selecting the larger value between the computed wave height from linear wave theory and the computed wave height from eq 21 as 22 h m a x h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 72 h o l o 2 h 0 017 l o 2 h yang et al 2015 verified their formula with 8 cases of measured wave heights from their experiments and the experiments of you 2004 and hansen and svendsen 1979 and showed that their formula gives good predictions in total there are 12 formulas to be considered in this study four formulas were developed for linear wave shoaling the formulas of a45 n82 n84 and f13 while the others were developed for nonlinear wave shoaling most of the formulas except s74 mo00 and w08 are expressed in the form of explicit equations the formulas of s74 mo00 and w08 contain implicit equations in terms of local wave height h which have to be solved by an iteration method it is well known that the linear wave formula gives under prediction for large ursell parameters which indicates large nonlinearity of waves it is expected that the accuracy of nonlinear wave formulas is better than that of linear wave formulas the existing formulas of nonlinear wave shoaling were proposed as functions of different dimensionless parameters i e h o l o l o h m π u r and u s the formulas were shown by the developers to give good prediction with laboratory data or computed results from the selected wave models that were used in the calibration or verification however as the formulas are different the computed results from various formulas should differ from each other therefore it is not clear which dimensionless parameters or formulas are suitable to describe the nonlinear wave shoaling and which formula gives better accuracy since most of the existing formulas were developed under limited laboratory conditions their validity may be limited to the range of laboratory conditions that were employed in the calibrations or verifications there is one way to examine the validity of the empirical formulas that is to verify the computed results with a wide range of wave conditions the main objective of the next section is to find the most reliable formula that predicts well for a wide range of wave conditions 3 formula verification the measured data of wave height transformation in the shoaling zone are used to verify the formulas experimental data from 6 sources including 71 cases have been collected for verifying the formulas a summary of the collected experimental data is given in table 2 the experimental data cover a wide range of wave conditions 0 001 h o l o 0 076 1 u s 1248 and 0 005 h l o 0 721 the experiments were performed with a fixed plane beach of slope m ranging between 0 03 and 0 05 the basic parameter for determination of the overall accuracy of the formulas is the root mean square relative error e r which is defined as 23 e r 100 i 1 n m h c i h m i 2 i 1 n m h m i 2 where i is the wave height number h c i is the computed wave height of number i h m i is the measured wave height of number i and n m is the total number of measured wave heights a small value of e r indicates a good overall accuracy of the formula the measured wave heights in the shoaling zone from 6 sources shown in table 2 are used to examine the accuracy of each formula the errors e r of the 12 formulas for the 6 data sources and all data points are shown in table 3 the results can be summarized as follows a the overall error e r of the 12 formulas is in the range of 5 5 2834 1 the formula of s74 gives the best overall predictions e r 5 5 while the formula of y15 gives the worst predictions e r 2834 1 b the overall accuracy of the formulas in descending order are the formulas of s74 w08 kg96 i82 mo00 f13 a45 n82 n84 tm02 sb80 and y15 c most of the formulas except sb80 tm02 and y15 give reasonably good overall predictions e r 10 the formulas of sb80 tm02 and y15 have significantly less accuracy than that of the linear wave formula and should be used with care in practice d the linear wave formula a45 gives reasonable overall predictions of shoaling wave heights e r 9 7 e the advantage of the simplified formulas for computing linear wave shoaling n82 n84 and f13 is that it is not necessary to determine the wave number by iteration as in the linear wave formula comparing among the simplified formulas for computing linear wave shoaling n82 n84 and f13 the formula of f13 gives slightly better predictions than the others for most experiments except the experiment of ss01 the simplified formulas of the linear wave theory n82 n84 and f13 have almost the same accuracy however for the experiment of ss01 the formulas of n82 and n84 have less accuracy than that of the linear wave theory a45 while the formula f13 has almost the same accuracy as that of a45 this shows that the formulas of n82 and n84 may have a limitation for computing linear wave shoaling it is interesting to see a comparison in more detail with a shoaling curve fig 1 shows the values of computed shoaling coefficients k s from the formulas of a45 n82 n84 and f13 in terms of h l o the curves indicate that the formula of f13 has good agreement with linear wave shoaling for all conditions while the formulas of n82 and n84 have good agreement only for h l o 0 3 the deviations of n82 and n84 from the linear wave theory are significant for a relative depth h l o 0 3 this means that the formulas of n82 and n84 cannot be used in general cases they should be used for computing linear wave shoaling for h l o 0 3 f as mentioned before y15 showed that their formula gives good predictions with measured wave heights however table 3 shows that y15 gives the overall worst and unrealistic predictions it is interesting to see the performance of y15 in more detail to identify limitations of the formula the ratio of computed wave height from y15 and measured wave height h c h m is plotted against several dimensionless parameters i e ursell parameter u r relative depth h l o and deepwater wave steepness h o l o it is found that the deepwater wave steepness h o l o can be used to identify the limitations of y15 fig 2 shows the relationship between h c h m and h o l o the solid line in the figure represents perfect agreement it can be seen that the formula of y15 gives quite good predictions for large deepwater wave steepness h o l o 0 02 but significantly overestimates for small deepwater wave steepness h o l o 0 02 this means that the formula of y15 is applicable only for h o l o 0 02 g comparing among the 10 empirical formulas the formula of w08 gives the best overall predictions with e r of 5 8 this number confirms in a quantitative sense the high degree of practicality of the formula this means that it is possible to use the empirical formula for computing shoaling wave heights the best empirical formula w08 has better accuracy than that of the linear wave formula a45 but has slightly less accuracy than that of s74 s formula 3 1 verification in terms of ursell parameter it is well known that the ursell parameter u r h l 2 h 3 or u s g t 2 h h 2 indicates the non linearity of waves and it is usually used for defining the range of applications for various wave theories accuracy of the selected formulas is expected to depend on u r or u s following s74 the dependence of error on u s is considered in this study in the present study u s is classified into 4 groups i e u s 30 30 u s 50 50 u s 100 and u s 100 the errors e r of the 12 formulas for 4 groups of u s are shown in table 4 the results can be summarized as follows a although the formula of s74 gives the best overall predictions it does not give the best predictions for all ranges of u s the formula has significantly better accuracy than the others for u s 100 b the errors e r of most formulas i e except n82 and n84 tend to increase with increasing u s c the errors of linear wave formulas a45 n82 n84 and f13 for u s 30 are about the same as that of 30 u s 50 and significantly increase when u s 50 d for u s 50 the linear wave formulas a45 n82 n84 and f13 give very good predictions and have slightly better accuracy than those of the top 2 formulas s74 and w08 however for u s 50 the errors of the linear wave formulas a45 n82 n84 and f13 are larger than those of s74 and w08 it is expected that the nonlinear influences become significant when u s is greater than about 50 this shows clearly that a small u s represents well the linear theory while a large u s needs nonlinear correction terms e comparing among the 8 nonlinear wave formulas s74 sb90 i82 kg96 mo00 tm02 w08 and y15 the errors of most formulas i e except s74 and w08 for u s 100 are much larger than that for u s 100 the nonlinear terms in those formulas may not be suitable for u s greater than about 100 f the top 2 formulas s74 and w08 give good predictions for all ranges of u s several researchers e g svendsen and brink kjaer 1972 shuto 1974 sakai and battjes 1980 and isobe 1985 showed that the linear wave theory gives significant underestimation for high ursell parameters therefore it is not surprising to see that the linear wave formulas give considerable error for high u s this considerable error indicates the importance of nonlinearities of waves in the region of high u s several form of equations and dimensionless parameters were introduced in the empirical formulas to account for the effect of wave nonlinearity on wave shoaling since the formulas differ from each other their accuracies are different however the best empirical formula w08 may be used to identify the significant nonlinearity parameters and the effect of nonlinearity on wave shoaling the formula of w08 consists of 2 terms i e the linear shoaling term and nonlinear correction term the nonlinear correction term in w08 is a function of u r this means that nonlinear effects on wave shoaling depend on u r this is also not surprising since the ursell parameter is a common parameter that is used to indicate the nonlinearity of waves or used to select a wave theory e g stokes or cnoidal wave theories comparing the errors of the linear wave and w08 formulas it can be seen that the effect of wave nonlinearity does not appear in the region u s 50 and the effect tends to increase with u s in the region u s 50 although it is clear that the top 2 formulas s74 and w08 have good accuracy for all ranges of u s and give considerable better predictions than that of the linear wave theory a45 it is interesting to see the performance of a45 s74 and w08 in more detail figs 3 5 show the ratio of computed wave height from a45 s74 and w08 and measured wave height h c h m versus the measured shallow water ursell parameter u s the solid line in each figure represents perfect agreement it can be seen that a the linear wave theory a45 gives good predictions for u s 40 and tends to underestimate for u s 40 for the high u s e g u s 200 the use of the linear wave theory leads to considerable underestimation and consequently unconservative designs b the formula of s74 gives generally good predictions for all ranges of u s however it tends to overestimate for u s 200 c the formula of w08 gives also generally good predictions for all ranges of u s but it tends to slightly underestimate for u s 100 as the formulas of s74 and w08 have similar accuracy and give better overall predictions than the others they are recommended to be used for computing wave shoaling however for implementation the formula of w08 is simpler than that of s74 considering accuracy and simplicity of the formulas the formula of w08 seems to be the most attractive one for practical work in addition the formula of w08 can tolerate empirical modifications whereas a theoretical one s74 cannot however the formula of w08 is in the form of an implicit equation which has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice 4 formula modification although the empirical formula of w08 gives overall good predictions e r 5 8 it is in the form of an implicit equation the formula has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice the main objective of this section is to formulate a simple explicit formula based on the formula of w08 following the concept of w08 the ratio of wave height to linear wave height h h l may be a function of nonlinear parameters s74 used u s and w08 used u r as the nonlinearity parameters to simplify the calculation the formula of w08 is modified to be an explicit equation by changing the parameter from the ursell parameter u r h l 2 h 3 or u s g t 2 h h 2 or u s g t 2 h h 2 to another dimensionless parameter that does not depend on local wave height h i e u r o h o l o 2 h 3 or u s o h o l o h 2 the general forms of the modified formula can be expressed as 24 h h l f 1 u r o 25 h h l f 2 u s o where f 1 and f 2 are functions and h l is the wave height calculated based on linear wave theory although the linear wave formula eq 4 is simple iteration is needed for computing the wave number k the formula of f13 has almost the same accuracy as that of the linear wave formula eq 4 but the calculation is simpler hence the formula of f13 eq 19 is used to compute h l as 26 h l h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h the derivation of the formula is divided into 3 steps i e determination of basic formula formula calibration and formula verification 4 1 basic formula as s74 s formula gives the best predictions it is used to identify the related nonlinearity parameter and the function f of eqs 24 and 25 synthetic data of shoaling wave heights h and linear wave heights h l are generated by using s74 s formula eq 5 and eq 26 for 6 conditions of deepwater wave steepness h o l o i e 0 001 0 002 0 005 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 then the values of h h l u r o and u s o are determined from the synthetic data the function f can be determined from the relationships of h h l versus u r o and u s o the relationships of h h l versus u r o and u s o are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that the relation of h h l versus u r o depends largely on h o l o while fig 7 shows that the relation of h h l versus u s o depends slightly on h o l o therefore the relationship of h h l versus u s o in fig 7 should be simpler than the relationship of h h l versus u r o in fig 6 hence fig 7 is used to derive the function f fig 7 shows that h h l varies systematically with u s o the value of h h l is constant and equal to 1 for a small value of u s o then increases with increasing u s o and tends to approach infinity for a large value of u s o the relationship of h h l versus u s o can be fitted to a hyperbolic cotangent function as 27 h h l coth k 1 u s o k 2 where k 1 and k 2 are constants 4 2 formula calibration the measured data from is69 and dm16 in total 13 cases are used to calibrate the constants k 1 and k 2 in eq 27 fig 8 shows the relationships of h h l and u s o h o l o h 2 based on the measured data from is69 and dm16 the calibrations are conducted by gradually adjusting the coefficients k 1 and k 2 until the minimum error e r is obtained the optimum values of k 1 and k 2 are 6 1 and 0 51 respectively the best fitted line is shown as the solid line in fig 8 substituting the constants k 1 6 1 and k 2 0 51 and h l from eq 26 into eq 27 the modified formula can be expressed as 28 h h o tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h coth 6 1 u s o 0 51 this formula is referred to as mwf hereafter the formula is in the form of an explicit equation which can be used to compute h directly the modified formula is much simpler than those of s74 and w08 4 3 formula verification a straightforward way to examine the accuracy of a formula is to compare the computed wave height with the measured data in order to evaluate the accuracy of computation the examination of the modified formula mwf is carried out by using the measured wave heights from table 2 the errors er of the modified formula mwf on computing wave shoaling are shown in the last rows of tables 3 and 4 the results from tables 3 and 4 are summarized as follows a the overall error of the modified formula mwf for computing wave shoaling is 5 2 comparing the overall errors e r of existing and modified formulas the modified formula mwf has slightly better accuracy than that of the best empirical formula w08 and s74 b in comparison with the errors of linear wave formula of a45 and the simplified linear wave formula of f13 the formula mwf has significantly better accuracy for the estimation of wave shoaling furthermore the modified formulas mwf is slightly more complicated than that of f13 but simpler than that of a45 c fig 9 shows the ratio of computed wave height from the modified formula mwf and measured wave height h c h m versus the ursell parameter u s the solid line in the figures represent perfect agreement it can be seen that the modified formula gives generally good predictions for all ranges of u s the accuracy of mwf is almost the same as that of s74 d no single formula gives the best prediction for all ranges of u s the formulas that give the best prediction for u s 50 50 u s 100 and u s 100 are a45 w08 and mwf respectively e in the present study the most suitable formula is selected based on accuracy and simplicity considering the accuracy of the formulas the formulas of s74 w08 and mwf have nearly the same accuracy 5 2 u s 5 8 and have better accuracy than the others considering the simplicity of the 3 formulas mwf is the simplest therefore mwf is judged to be overall the most suitable formula 5 conclusions this study concentrates on empirical formulas for computing shoaling wave heights the empirical formulas were introduced to facilitate engineers for design works and preliminary studies of coastal processes in a shoaling zone during the past decades several empirical formulas have been proposed for computing shoaling wave heights most of the formulas were developed empirically from computed results of nonlinear wave models which were not calibrated or calibrated with limited experimental data there are no papers describing the applicability and accuracy of various existing empirical formulas based on a wide range of wave conditions the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of 10 empirical formulas for computing regular wave shoaling seventy one cases of measured shoaling wave heights from six sources of published experimental data were used to examine the formulas the data cover a range of deepwater wave steepness from 0 001 to 0 076 the accuracy of the formulas was also compared with the often used formulas shuto s 1974 and linear wave formulas it is found that errors of most formulas tend to increase with increasing ursell parameter the shuto s 1974 formula gives the best predictions while the linear wave formula gives reasonable overall predictions of shoaling wave heights three empirical formulas out of ten have less accuracy than that of the linear wave formula and should be used with care in practice comparing the 10 empirical formulas the formula of wang et al 2008 gives the best predictions e r 5 2 the best empirical formula has better accuracy than that of the linear wave formula but has slightly less accuracy than that of shuto s 1974 formula this means that it is possible to use an empirical formula for computing shoaling wave heights however the formula of wang et al 2008 contains an implicit equation which has to be solved by an iteration method and may not be convenient in practice to simplify the calculation the formula of wang et al 2008 is modified to be an explicit equation by changing the parameter from the local ursell parameter u r h l 2 h 3 to a new deepwater ursell parameter u s o h o l o h 2 and replacing the linear wave shoaling of airy 1845 with that of fenton 2013 the modified formula is much simpler and has slightly better accuracy than those of shuto 1974 and wang et al 2008 however the modified formula mwf does not give the best prediction for all ranges of u s the formulas that give the best prediction for u s 50 50 u s 100 and u s 100 are a45 w08 and mwf respectively 
23576,the cavitation inception speed cis is very important capability for a navy vessel because the underwater radiated noise dramatically increases when cavitation occurs therefore the cis has been severely restricted and evaluated at sea trial test steps in the shipbuilding process after a naval vessel is delivered to the navy cis can vary according to the propeller and sea state conditions however inspection of cis cannot be performed frequently due to time and expense limitation therefore real time monitoring of cis is urgently required by navy personnel in order to inspect cis with real time monitoring technique the measuring method detecting fluctuation pressure of the propeller in a ship at sailing state should be developed in this research cis monitoring techniques using acceleration on the hull above the propeller that can measure the fluctuation pressure of the propeller indirectly are suggested and verified experimentally in addition the evaluation algorithm of cis using the kurtosis of the detection of envelope modulation on noise demon spectrum is used to determine the cis quantitatively keywords cavitation inception speed cis kurtosis detection of envelope modulation on noise demon acceleration 1 introduction of the naval vessels submarines and surface ships use sonar in order to detect and identify adversary ships in order to increase the detection ability of the sonar the self radiated sound of the naval vessel should be controlled and reduced the main sources of underwater radiated noise of a naval vessel can be classified into either machinery noise such as from an engine generator and pump or fluid dynamically induced noise such as propeller cavitation noise usually machinery noise is dominant at the low speed range however as the speed increases and cavitation occurs the cavitation sound becomes dominant and its level is much higher than the machinery noise in order to improve the capability of antisubmarine warfare of the naval vessel cavitation inception speed cis should be increased as much as possible many studies on the propeller with respect to the cis as well as the sound of cavitation bubbles have been performed generally the cavitation sound is produced when cavitation cavities are created and collapse minnaert 1933 derived the natural frequency of a rising bubble in water using energy conservation for the bubble motion strasberg 1956 assumed that the bubble could be modeled asa spring mass damper model with 1 degree of freedom and determined the radiated sound of a rising bubble in the water han han et al 2011 found that the natural frequency of the refrigerant bubble in the pipe was varied according to its shape in the case of cavitation of the propeller tip vortex cavitation occurs when a bubble is created at the end of the propeller tip the cavitation then develops to sheet and cloud cavitation the sound of the tip cavitation occurs from the vibratory wave of the vortex cavity and differs from the sound of the spherical bubble thomson 1880 determined the natural frequency of the vortex bubble using the dispersion relation of the inviscid cavitating vortex morozov 1974 extended thomson s theory to the sound field of the compressive fluid bosschers 2007 modified morzov s theory to determine the natural frequency of the vortex cavity at the axial free stream velocity pennings et al 2016 measured the sound of the vortex cavity produced by the model propeller in the cavitation tunnel and verified that the measured natural frequency of the vortex cavity concurred with the calculated natural frequency by theory even though the propeller cavitation is usually monitored by experiment at the cavitation tunnel with the model propeller this differs to the cavitation occurring in a real ship condition therefore cis is evaluated by the measurement of underwater radiated noise at sea when the ship is sailing in addition cis is monitored through the cavitation window installed at the aft side hull near the propeller however cis cannot be monitored continuously when the naval vessel is on a voyage since the underwater radiated noise does not occur frequently and the cavitation window is usually removed after the evaluation of the sea trial test with cis has finished in this research a new method of real time monitoring using cis in the voyage state is suggested using accelerations on the aft hull near the propeller based on the phenomenon that the cavitation bubble induces an alternating pressure on the aft hull in section 2 the sound characteristics of the spherical and vortex cavity related to the bubble dynamics are described in section 3 the experiment setup for defining cis using acceleration on the aft hull and the signal processing technique such as detection of envelope modulation on noise demon to identify cis effectively are described in section 4 the cis estimation method using acceleration on the hull is described 2 theoretical background the cavitation cavity generally produces a sound before the cavity can be visually inspected when the cavity is initiated at the tip of the propeller the cavity size is too small to inspect visually since the cavity size is so small the shape of the cavity should be spherical due to the surface tension of the surrounding water after the cavity is sufficiently developed the tip vortex cavity is created and visualized the general sonar equipment for the detection of objects in water installing submarines and military surface ships can detect the sound up to approximately 10 khz in addition since the sound of the small spherical bubble is usually lower than that of the well developed vortex bubble the sonar equipment can detect the sound from the vortex bubble rather than that from the small spherical one therefore in the current state the navy is interested in the sound from the vortex bubble rather than that from the small spherical bubble in terms of the detection of the ship cis however since sonar detection technology is being developed continuously the frequency detection range can be wider therefore in this section the sound characteristics of both the spherical and vortex cavities are described 2 1 spherical cavity the sound of the spherical cavity was first investigated by minnaert 1933 in 1933 he assumed that the cavity vibrated in the radial direction as shown in fig 1 when the cavity size is at its maximum its potential energy reaches the maximum and the kinetic energy becomes zero when the oscillating radius of cavity x is r the velocity of the oscillating radius of the cavity becomes maximum and the potential energy of the cavity becomes zero when the energy of these two conditions are equal through the energy conservation law the 0 mode s natural frequency of the cavity can be derived as shown in eq 1 the higher order modes have been suggested by lamb 1945 as shown in eq 2 1 f 0 1 t 1 2 π r 0 3 κ p ρ 2 f n n 2 1 n 2 t ρ r 0 1 2 2 π r 0 here n is the order t is the surface tension r 0 is the mean radius of the cavity ρ is the density of the surrounding fluid of the cavity κ is the specific heat ratio and p is the pressure of the surrounding fluid of the cavity since the restoring force does not exist for the translating mode the 1st mode has no resonance frequency the sound from the cavity is dominantly related to the volume variation in fig 2 the 0th mode is the mode at which only the volume variation occurs however for the higher order mode the shape variation only occurs without volume variation therefore the sound of the higher order modes is much smaller than that of the 0th mode in this research the 0th natural frequency is only considered and the high order modes are ignored 2 2 line vortex cavity observing the cavity in the tip vortex cavity as shown in fig 3 a wave can be seen in the cavity bosschers 2007 determined the 0th natural frequency in the vortex cavity with constant axial stream velocity as shown in eqs 3 5 3 ω 1 2 w k x ω n k r r c h n 1 k r r c h n 1 k r r c t w 4 ω v c r c 5 t w 1 t ρ r c v c 2 n 2 k z 2 r c 2 1 here ω is the natural frequency rad sec w is the fluid velocity at the axial direction flow m s k z is the axial wave number 1 m k r is the radial wave number 1 m n is the azimuthal wave number h n 1 is the hankel function of the 1st kind r c is the radius of the cavity m tis the surface tension ρ is the density of the fluid kg m3 and v c is the azimuthal velocity at the cavity radius when the mean axial velocity is sufficiently slower than the sound speed the radial wave number can be determined as shown in bosschers 2007 6 k r 2 1 c 2 ω w k z 2 k z 2 when the square of the radial wave number is smaller than 0 it becomes an imaginary value and the wave decreases with time therefore the hankel function of the 1st kind can be written with the macdonald function modified hankel function of the 2nd kind k in addition when the azimuthal velocity at the cavity radius is represented with a cavitation number σ n eq 3 can be approximately represented as bosschers 2007 7 ω 1 2 ω 1 2 r c w κ σ n n κ k n κ k n κ κ k z r c i k r r c 2 π λ z r c here λ z is the wave length m junger and feit 1986 stated that the high order mode does not contribute to the radiated sound of the cavity and only the 0th mode contributes to the radiated sound of the cavity because the maximum amplitude of the alternating pressure of the cavity is scaled to k r c n and the high order mode is low k r c n where n is the order number the mode shapes of each mode are shown in fig 4 bosschers 2007 fig 5 shows the natural frequencies of the spherical and vortex cavity when w 5 m s 8 m s and λ 30 mm when the axial velocity is 5 m s the natural frequency of the spherical cavity is higher than that of the vortex cavity the radius of which is equal to that of the spherical cavity as shown in fig 5 a however as the axial velocity increases to 8 0 m s the gap of the natural frequency between spherical and vortex cavity decreases as shown in fig 5 b in fig 5 the natural frequency is calculated at the point where the density of the sea water is 1025 kg m3 the specific heat ratio is 1 0 and the distance between the free surface of the sea and the propeller is 10 m assuming that the shape of cavities is spherical at the cis step and considering that their frequencies are in the range of 10 khz 25 6 khz based on the general sound spectrum at cis the size of the cavitation cavities at cis are in the range of 0 15 mm 0 39 mm when the cavities are sufficiently developed and after the formation of the vortex cavity that is visually inspected it can be estimated that the natural frequency of the vortex cavity is lower than that of the spherical cavity with a small radius from maines and arndt 1997 experiment results the natural frequencies of the vortex cavities that are visually inspected are in the range of 0 4 khz 1 1 khz when calculating the radius of the vortex cavities observing maines and arndt s experiment using eq 7 the radius of the vortex is in the ranges of 1 7 mm 4 0 mm at w 5 m s and 2 2 mm 10 0 mm at w 8 m s by comparing these natural frequencies of the vortex cavities to those of the spherical cavities it can be estimated that the natural frequency of the vortex cavity by visual inspection is much lower than that of the spherical cavities with a small radius if the cis is determined with the sound produced by small size spherical cavities signal processing should be performed with the sound of high frequency range considering the natural frequency of the incepted spherical cavities however if the cis is determined with the sound produced by tip vortex cavities it should be performed with the sound of the frequency range including the natural frequency of the tip vortex cavities 2 3 demon analysis the cavitation begins at one of the propeller blades when the speed of rotation is over the critical speed such that the static pressure of the surrounding water approaches close to the vapor pressure when the cavitation continuously develops according to the increasing speed cavitation occurs at all of the blades when the cavitation occurs the sound of the cavities modulates synchronously to the shaft rate and the blade passing frequency when applying demon analysis the noise component at the shaft rate as well as the blade passing frequency is revealed in the demon spectrum the analytic signal of demon analysis is obtained from eq 8 and the enveloped signal is the amplitude of the analytic signal as shown in randall 1987 8 h ˆ t h t j h t 9 h ˆ t h t 2 h t 2 0 5 here h t is the time signal of the raw data and h t is the hilbert transform of h t as shown in eq 10 10 h t h h t 1 π h t d t τ t from the fast fourier transform fft spectrum of eq 9 cis inspects whether the demon spectrum reveals the sound of the rotating shaft or blade passing frequency in demon analysis the selection of the bandwidth and center frequency of the band pass filter is very important they must be selected considering the frequency range where the modulation coincides with the shaft rotating and blade passing frequency this proper selection can be performed with spectral kurtosis of the short time fft described in the next section in addition cis can be identified when the overall noise level is increased to over 2db knots as the ship speed increases in this research cis is determined with the vibration signal on the aft hull located close to the propeller instead of the sound signal radiated to the under water since the pressure wave produced by the propeller cavitation induces the adjacent hull of the propeller the acceleration on the hull is the same pattern to the cavitation sound of the propeller therefore in the following section for a specific naval vessel cis is evaluated using a 1 3 octave band spectrum the overall level and demon spectrum of the hull vibration adjacent to the propeller 3 experiment in this section the acceleration on the aft hull above the propeller is measured according to the ship speed in order to estimate cis based on the acoustic characteristics of the cavitation cavity described in section 2 according to the measurement results of the underwater radiated noise with the hydrophone array that was performed prior to the present research cis was preliminary estimated and determined as vcis knots therefore the acceleration on the aft hull was measured as from vcis 8 knots to vcis 4 knots as shown in table 1 in order to compare the cis estimated with accelerations to that with underwater radiated noise 3 1 test setup the tested ship is a battleship with a combined diesel engine gas turbine propulsion system the propeller type is the controllable pitched propeller and two of each propeller are installed at the port and the starboard sides to inspect the propeller cis three accelerometers were installed at the aft hull above the propeller as shown in fig 6 since the space wherein the accelerometers were installed is void space equipment is not necessary the no 1 accelerometer was installed on the hull at the port side no 3 was installed on the hull at the starboard side and no 2 was installed between the no 1 and no 3 accelerometers as shown in fig 6 a pcb type 352a60 accelerometer and a b k3053 b12 0 data acquisition system were used to collect the signal the acceleration was recorded for 2 min for each ship speed as shown in table 1 and the sampling rate was set at 65 536samples sec 3 2 test results fig 7 shows the 1 3 octave band spectrum of the acceleration for each ship speed to be tested the acceleration levels at the high frequency range of over 5 khz for the no 1 and 3 accelerometers increased rapidly when the ship speed was t6 t7 even though the distances from the no 1 and no 3 accelerometers to the center line are identical the hull structures for example the distribution of the stiffeners are different from each other because the hulls are not quite bilaterally symmetrical in addition the dynamic pressure induced acceleration on the hull can be different between the port and starboard sides because the dynamic pressure of the propeller blade for the port and starboard sides can be nonlinearly different in accordance with the sailing conditions therefore the difference between the acceleration spectra of no 1 and no 3 can exist as shown in fig 7 even though the spectra shape of the no 1 and no 3 accelerations are different from each other they are increased rapidly and identically when the ship speed is from t6 t7 the acceleration levels at the high frequency range of over 5 khz for the no 2 accelerometer increased rapidly at t5 t6 earlier than those for no 1 and 3 accelerometers this increasing acceleration may be caused by the cavitation therefore cis can be estimated to t5 t7 the reason for why this increasing acceleration for the no 2 accelerometer started earlier than those of the no 1 and no 3 accelerometers was not clearly identified we could simply guess that the reason is as follows since 2 propellers are installed at the port and starboard sides of the ship and their blades rotate outward the cavitation cavities of the 2 propellers would be created below the center position installing no 2 accelerometers where the static pressure of the water near the propeller is the least the water can be vaporized easily at this position when the propeller speed is critical for the cavitation because the static pressure is at its lowest value therefore the pressure wave from the cavity may be transferred to the hull more easily where installing the no 2 accelerometer rather than where installing the no 1 and 3 accelerometers even though the reason for this difference was not clearly identified the cis that was estimated from the acceleration can be varied in accordance with the accelerometer installation position in this research it is assumed that the frequency range of the cavitation sound caused by the vortex and large spherical cavities is set to 3 khz 10 khz and that caused by the spherical cavities with a very small radius is set to 10 khz 25 6 khz fig 8 shows the overall acceleration level in the ranges of 3 khz 10 khz and 10 khz 25 6 khz generally cis is determined when the overall sound pressure level is increased by 2 db per 1 knot increase in speed in order to identify cis using the overall acceleration level the same criterion for identifying cis with sound is adopted in fig 8 the overall acceleration levels on the hull in which the frequency range is from 3 khz to 10 khz are increased by 2 db per 1 knot increase in speed similar to the sound pressure when the ship speed varies from t6 to t7 for the no 1 and 3 accelerometers and from t4 to t5 for the no 2 accelerometer however the overall acceleration levels on the hull in which the frequency range is from 10 khz to 25 6 khz are increased by 2 db per 1knot increase in speed similar to the sound pressure when the ship speed varies from t4 to t5 for the no 1 and 2 accelerometers but the no 3 accelerometer does not sufficiently vary 3 3 spectral kurtosis in the previous section cis was estimated to be t5 t7 based on the overall acceleration level and on the 1 3 octave band spectrum analysis in this section demon analysis described which is another method used to determine cis in order to perform demon analysis the center frequency and bandwidth of the band pass filter should first be determined in this research spectral kurtosis antoni and randall 2006 is applied to select the center frequency and the bandwidth of the band pass filter to perform cis in the mechanical rotating system periodic excited sound can be caused by a bearing or gear mesh fault when the impact force is subject to the mechanical system the vibration increases at its natural frequency therefore the vibration at the natural frequency of the mechanical system periodically appears and disappears repeatedly when the signal varies unstably due to the transient signal the kurtosis of the signal increases spectral kurtosis is the kurtosis of the signal for the spectrum at a particular frequency and is defined as antoni and randall 2006 11 k x e x 4 t e x 2 t 2 2 here e is the mean function k x is the spectral kurtosis and x t is the signal value at a particular frequency for time t if the distribution of the signal is gaussian the kurtosis becomes 0 and if the signal has high transient signal it becomes very high when the cavitation occurs the impact signal of the propeller occurs periodically synchronous to the propeller rotation and blade passing frequency in contrast to the frequency of the bearing and gear mesh fault sound the frequency of the cavitation sound is not the natural frequency of the system but that of the cavity therefore when demon analysis is performed the natural frequencies of the created cavities on the propeller should be included in the bandwidth of the band pass filter considering their shape and size fig 9 shows the kurtogram of the measured acceleration on the hull when the ship speed is t5 t7 the kurtogram is a graph of the spectral kurtosis at each frequency for the short time fft spectrum performed with 2 k frequency lines it is used to determine the center frequency and bandwidth of the bandpass filter for demon analysis in the kurtogram the horizontal axis is the frequency 0 25 6 khz and the vertical axis is k 0 7 and k is defined as n w 2 k n w window length the spectral kurtosis level is represented by the color map on the graph a high spectral kurtosis level at a given frequency band means that many transient signals have been caused by the cavitation therefore using the kurtogram the center frequency and the frequency span that comprise the maximum spectral kurtosis can be defined in fig 9 the spectral kurtosis is at a very high level at a low k k 3 bandwidth 6 4 khz and high frequency range 20 khz when the ship speed is t5 for no 1 and 2 accelerometers it means that regarding the best fit bandpass filter for the demon analysis at the ship speed of t5 it would be preferable for the center frequency and the frequency span to be more than 20 khz and 6 4 khz respectively as the ship speed increases to t6 and t7 the frequency range having the highest spectral kurtosis decreases to the lower frequency and the k level having the highest spectral kurtosis increases to 5 7 200 hz bandwidth 800 hz compared to those when the ship speed is t5 therefore regarding the center frequency of the best fit bandpass filter for the demon analysis at the ship speeds from t6 t7 it would be preferable for the speed to be lower than t5 and the frequency band to be narrower than its typical t5 value as described in section 2 2 and fig 5 spherical bubbles first appear when the cavitation is incepted and the broadband acceleration of 10 khz 25 6 khz which includes the natural frequency of the very small size cavity is modulated with the acceleration at the propeller rotating and blade passing frequency however when the cavity is developed and the tip vortex cavity starts to form the frequency of the acceleration caused by the vortex cavity is lower than the frequency of that caused by the spherical cavity therefore when the ship speed is t6 t7 spectral kurtosis increases at the frequency range of 3 10 khz which is less than the frequency range when the ship speed is t5 when kurtogram analysis is performed for the mechanical system having mechanical defaults such as bearing and gear faults the k level should be selected to include the natural frequency of the mechanical system where the response of the system increases significantly from the impact force however in cavitation the response is not the response of the mechanical system but that of the cavities therefore at a specific k level the frequencies with the highest spectral kurtosis i e natural frequencies of vortex bubbles are varied according to the different cavity size and environmental conditions in addition in the process of the merging and the collapsing of the bubbles the frequencies with the highest spectral kurtosis can also be varied therefore even though the obtained k level can be from 5 to 7 at speeds from t6 t7 narrow bandwidths such as those from 200 hz k 5 800 hz k 7 cannot be applied to perform the demon analysis for the detection of the cis considering that the frequency band of the demon analysis for the cavitation sound at the ship speed of t5 can be obtained at 6 4 k hz from the kurtogram analysis and the center frequencies of the vortex bubbles can vary widely according to their size and environmental condition the bandwidth of the bandpass filter of the demon analysis for the acceleration on the hull was selected as 6 4 khz in fact the 6 4 khz frequency band is widely used for the bandpass filter that is used to perform the demon cis detection analysis consequently the center frequencies were defined as 22 4 khz and 6 4 khz based on the kurtogram results at the ship speeds t5 and from t6 t7 respectively and the bandwidth was determined as 6 4 khz as previously stated according to the kurtogram analysis of this chapter the frequency range of the band pass filter for demon analysis is set to 22 4 khz 3 2 khz when cis is defined with the sound for the very small spherical cavities and is set to 6 4 khz 3 2 khz with that for the tip vortex cavity 3 4 results from demon demon analysis for the acceleration on the hull above the propeller is performed according to the ship s speed at which the bandwidth of the band pass filter is set to 6 4 khz and the center frequency of the band pass filter is set to 6 4 khz and 22 4 khz based on the kurtogram analysis fig 10 shows the demon spectrum when the bandwidth of the band pass filter is 6 4 khz and the center frequency is 6 4 khz here the x axis is the frequency and the y axis is the nominal value that indicates 2 times the measured time duration 2 0 5sec n n 0 200 the bandwidth and center frequency of demon analysis for the underwater radiated noise were the same as those applied in fig 10 when the cavitation is intercepted the cavity is created at one of the propeller blades if the blade dimensions of the propeller are perfectly the same as one another cavities can occur at all of the blades when they pass through the positions where the distance between end of the blade and the free surface is the smallest however due to the variation of the dimensions a cavity can occur at one of the blades first and then as the cavities are developed further the cavities start to occur at all of the blades therefore in the demon spectrum the peak at the 1st rotating frequency of the propeller shaft is firstly revealed at the cis and then its 2nd and 3rd peaks are revealed according to the rotating frequency of the shaft when the cavities are sufficiently developed the peak at the blade passing frequency is also evident therefore cis is defined from demon analysis when the demon spectrum has the peak at the rotating frequency of the shaft in fig 10 cis can be estimated as t6 t7 similar to cis estimated with underwater radiated noise since the demon spectrum has a peak at the 1st rotating frequency when the ship s speed is t6 and the blade passing frequency when the ship speed is t7 fig 11 shows the demon spectrum when the bandwidth of the band pass filter is 6 4 khz and the center frequency is 22 4 khz the spectrum value at the rotating shaft and blade passing frequency are shown at t5 and t6 respectively where the ship speed is less than that when using the band pass filter with a center frequency of 6 4 khz therefore cis can be estimated as t5 t6 from fig 11 in addition the peak value at the shaft rate can be found in the demon spectrum when the propeller pitch is minimum v t1 it means that small spherical bubble may occur when the low propeller pitch is applied as discussed in the previous section the differences in cis according to the center frequency of the band pass filter is due to the different types of cavities spherical or vortex cavity 4 discussion when the cis is estimated with 1 3 octave band spectrum overall level variation and demon spectrum analysis of the acceleration on the hull it is the same as the cis estimated with underwater radiated noise even though cis slightly varies according to the location of the installed accelerometer it is verified that cis can be determined from the acceleration on the hull above the propeller when the hydrophone and pressure sensor are applied to the hull in order to monitor cis a hole needs to be bored to install these sensors however this hole is not necessary when the accelerometer is applied to monitor the cis variation in a real ship therefore for the real time monitoring of cis it is possible to use acceleration on the hull simply with the signal processing suggested in this research through this monitoring technique the maintenance duration can be identified exactly with respect to cis even though cis can be estimated with demon spectrum analysis decoding the demon spectrum is very subjective therefore a quantitative index needs to be developed for automatic real time monitoring of cis in this section the kurtosis of the demon spectrum is suggested for this quantitative index fig 12 shows the demon spectrum at the typical time t when the cavitation begins in fig 12 the peak occurs at the blade passing frequency when the dominant peak forms as shown in fig 12 the kurtosis of the demon spectrum y as eq 12 becomes very large here x i is the demon spectrum level at each frequency x is the average spectrum level s is the standard deviation of the spectrum levels and n is the line numbers of the frequency in the demon spectrum if no dominant peak occurs in the demon spectrum the distribution of the demon spectrum level is gaussian and the kurtosis of the demon spectrum should be approximately 0 12 y n n 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 i 1 n x i x s 4 3 n 1 2 n 2 n 3 therefore the kurtosis of the demon spectrum according to the ship s speed can identify cis fig 13 is the average kurtosis for the demon spectrum of the acceleration on the hull according to the ship s speed as shown in table 1 here the frequency range of the demon spectrum is 4 100 hz and the number of the data to calculate kurtosis is 192 since the frequency resolution is 0 5 hz n 100 hz 4 hz 0 5 hz the kurtosis is calculated with the demon spectrum of the acceleration measured for 0 5sec the kurtosis is calculated for 100 s and the kurtosis shown in fig 13 is the averaged kurtosis for 100 s in fig 13 it is assumed that cis occurs when the average kurtosis is over than 4 0 then cis can be identified as t5 when the center frequency and bandwidth are set to 22 4 khz 3 2 khz as shown in fig 13 a in this case cavitation also occurs at t1 t2 where the propeller pitch ratio is very small when the center frequency and bandwidth is set to 6 4 khz 3 2 khz cis can be estimated as t6 as shown in fig 13 b cis is estimated with the average kurtosis as shown in fig 13 is the same as that estimated by qualitative analysis performed in section 3 through this average kurtosis of the demon spectrum cis can be identified quantitatively and can be used in the real time monitoring of cis in a naval vessel during a voyage when the center frequency of the band pass filter is set as 22 4 khz cis is identified earlier at about 1 knots compared to cis estimated with the band pass filter using a center frequency of 6 4 khz it is widely known that the cavity s sound can be heard ahead of the visual inspection of the bubble in the investigation of this research study the sound of the small spherical bubble firstly occurred and this was followed by the sound of the vortex bubble after the amplitude of the cavity sound is increased in accordance with the increasing of the cavity size the cavity can be visualized therefore to accurately identify the cis the cis identification method should be firstly selected since the sonar systems that are installed in navy ships detect the cis with the sound signal the cis should be defined not by the visualization of the cavity but by the sound from the cavity to define the cis with the sound signal accurately the center frequency and bandwidth of the band pass filter should be determined considering the detection capabilities of the sonar systems for the general naval vessel currently the designs of general cis detection sonar systems are usually based on the sound detection of the vortex cavity 5 conclusion in this research the cis estimation method using the signal processing technique from the acceleration on the hull above the propeller is suggested based on the mechanism in which the vibratory cavity transfers the pressure wave to the hull adjacent to the propeller the detailed conclusions from this research are as follows 1 cis can be estimated with the acceleration on the hull adjacent to the propeller from the experiment with s specific naval vessel 2 through the theoretical investigation it can be seen that the natural frequency of the spherical cavity is much higher than that of the vortex cavity with the same radius when the axial velocity of the propeller is slow therefore when the spectrum analysis using demon is performed to identify cis the cavity s shape and size should be considered 3 when the cis of a specific naval vessel is estimated from demon of the acceleration on the hull whereby the center frequency of the band pass filter is 6 4 khz and 22 khz cis estimated with a center frequency of the band pass filter of 22 4 khz is 1 knots faster than that estimated with the center frequency of the band pass filter of 6 4 khz when using 6 4 khz band pass filter cis is determined to the speed inspecting very small spherical cavities that can t visually be inspected however when using 22 4 khz band pass filter cis is determined to the speed inspecting well developed tip vortex cavities therefore cis can be different according to the frequency range of the band pass filter 4 the estimated cis differs according to the position at which the accelerometers installed therefore the proper installation position of the accelerometer should be selected in order to select the best point on the hull when transferring the pressure wave the cis estimated from the underwater radiating noise should be compared to that estimated from acceleration 5 through the estimation method of cis using the average kurtosis of the demon spectrum the quantitative evaluation of cis is possible and the cis estimated with the average kurtosis of the demon spectrum concurs well with the qualitative evaluation of the cis with 1 3 octave band and demon analysis it is expected that cis determined using the average kurtosis of the demon spectrum can be applied to the real time monitoring of cis in the future the cis monitoring and estimating system will be developed with the acceleration on the hull adjacent to the propeller in order to develop this system the installation position of the accelerometer and the type of cavity that most contributes to the underwater radiated noise should be initially identified 
23576,the cavitation inception speed cis is very important capability for a navy vessel because the underwater radiated noise dramatically increases when cavitation occurs therefore the cis has been severely restricted and evaluated at sea trial test steps in the shipbuilding process after a naval vessel is delivered to the navy cis can vary according to the propeller and sea state conditions however inspection of cis cannot be performed frequently due to time and expense limitation therefore real time monitoring of cis is urgently required by navy personnel in order to inspect cis with real time monitoring technique the measuring method detecting fluctuation pressure of the propeller in a ship at sailing state should be developed in this research cis monitoring techniques using acceleration on the hull above the propeller that can measure the fluctuation pressure of the propeller indirectly are suggested and verified experimentally in addition the evaluation algorithm of cis using the kurtosis of the detection of envelope modulation on noise demon spectrum is used to determine the cis quantitatively keywords cavitation inception speed cis kurtosis detection of envelope modulation on noise demon acceleration 1 introduction of the naval vessels submarines and surface ships use sonar in order to detect and identify adversary ships in order to increase the detection ability of the sonar the self radiated sound of the naval vessel should be controlled and reduced the main sources of underwater radiated noise of a naval vessel can be classified into either machinery noise such as from an engine generator and pump or fluid dynamically induced noise such as propeller cavitation noise usually machinery noise is dominant at the low speed range however as the speed increases and cavitation occurs the cavitation sound becomes dominant and its level is much higher than the machinery noise in order to improve the capability of antisubmarine warfare of the naval vessel cavitation inception speed cis should be increased as much as possible many studies on the propeller with respect to the cis as well as the sound of cavitation bubbles have been performed generally the cavitation sound is produced when cavitation cavities are created and collapse minnaert 1933 derived the natural frequency of a rising bubble in water using energy conservation for the bubble motion strasberg 1956 assumed that the bubble could be modeled asa spring mass damper model with 1 degree of freedom and determined the radiated sound of a rising bubble in the water han han et al 2011 found that the natural frequency of the refrigerant bubble in the pipe was varied according to its shape in the case of cavitation of the propeller tip vortex cavitation occurs when a bubble is created at the end of the propeller tip the cavitation then develops to sheet and cloud cavitation the sound of the tip cavitation occurs from the vibratory wave of the vortex cavity and differs from the sound of the spherical bubble thomson 1880 determined the natural frequency of the vortex bubble using the dispersion relation of the inviscid cavitating vortex morozov 1974 extended thomson s theory to the sound field of the compressive fluid bosschers 2007 modified morzov s theory to determine the natural frequency of the vortex cavity at the axial free stream velocity pennings et al 2016 measured the sound of the vortex cavity produced by the model propeller in the cavitation tunnel and verified that the measured natural frequency of the vortex cavity concurred with the calculated natural frequency by theory even though the propeller cavitation is usually monitored by experiment at the cavitation tunnel with the model propeller this differs to the cavitation occurring in a real ship condition therefore cis is evaluated by the measurement of underwater radiated noise at sea when the ship is sailing in addition cis is monitored through the cavitation window installed at the aft side hull near the propeller however cis cannot be monitored continuously when the naval vessel is on a voyage since the underwater radiated noise does not occur frequently and the cavitation window is usually removed after the evaluation of the sea trial test with cis has finished in this research a new method of real time monitoring using cis in the voyage state is suggested using accelerations on the aft hull near the propeller based on the phenomenon that the cavitation bubble induces an alternating pressure on the aft hull in section 2 the sound characteristics of the spherical and vortex cavity related to the bubble dynamics are described in section 3 the experiment setup for defining cis using acceleration on the aft hull and the signal processing technique such as detection of envelope modulation on noise demon to identify cis effectively are described in section 4 the cis estimation method using acceleration on the hull is described 2 theoretical background the cavitation cavity generally produces a sound before the cavity can be visually inspected when the cavity is initiated at the tip of the propeller the cavity size is too small to inspect visually since the cavity size is so small the shape of the cavity should be spherical due to the surface tension of the surrounding water after the cavity is sufficiently developed the tip vortex cavity is created and visualized the general sonar equipment for the detection of objects in water installing submarines and military surface ships can detect the sound up to approximately 10 khz in addition since the sound of the small spherical bubble is usually lower than that of the well developed vortex bubble the sonar equipment can detect the sound from the vortex bubble rather than that from the small spherical one therefore in the current state the navy is interested in the sound from the vortex bubble rather than that from the small spherical bubble in terms of the detection of the ship cis however since sonar detection technology is being developed continuously the frequency detection range can be wider therefore in this section the sound characteristics of both the spherical and vortex cavities are described 2 1 spherical cavity the sound of the spherical cavity was first investigated by minnaert 1933 in 1933 he assumed that the cavity vibrated in the radial direction as shown in fig 1 when the cavity size is at its maximum its potential energy reaches the maximum and the kinetic energy becomes zero when the oscillating radius of cavity x is r the velocity of the oscillating radius of the cavity becomes maximum and the potential energy of the cavity becomes zero when the energy of these two conditions are equal through the energy conservation law the 0 mode s natural frequency of the cavity can be derived as shown in eq 1 the higher order modes have been suggested by lamb 1945 as shown in eq 2 1 f 0 1 t 1 2 π r 0 3 κ p ρ 2 f n n 2 1 n 2 t ρ r 0 1 2 2 π r 0 here n is the order t is the surface tension r 0 is the mean radius of the cavity ρ is the density of the surrounding fluid of the cavity κ is the specific heat ratio and p is the pressure of the surrounding fluid of the cavity since the restoring force does not exist for the translating mode the 1st mode has no resonance frequency the sound from the cavity is dominantly related to the volume variation in fig 2 the 0th mode is the mode at which only the volume variation occurs however for the higher order mode the shape variation only occurs without volume variation therefore the sound of the higher order modes is much smaller than that of the 0th mode in this research the 0th natural frequency is only considered and the high order modes are ignored 2 2 line vortex cavity observing the cavity in the tip vortex cavity as shown in fig 3 a wave can be seen in the cavity bosschers 2007 determined the 0th natural frequency in the vortex cavity with constant axial stream velocity as shown in eqs 3 5 3 ω 1 2 w k x ω n k r r c h n 1 k r r c h n 1 k r r c t w 4 ω v c r c 5 t w 1 t ρ r c v c 2 n 2 k z 2 r c 2 1 here ω is the natural frequency rad sec w is the fluid velocity at the axial direction flow m s k z is the axial wave number 1 m k r is the radial wave number 1 m n is the azimuthal wave number h n 1 is the hankel function of the 1st kind r c is the radius of the cavity m tis the surface tension ρ is the density of the fluid kg m3 and v c is the azimuthal velocity at the cavity radius when the mean axial velocity is sufficiently slower than the sound speed the radial wave number can be determined as shown in bosschers 2007 6 k r 2 1 c 2 ω w k z 2 k z 2 when the square of the radial wave number is smaller than 0 it becomes an imaginary value and the wave decreases with time therefore the hankel function of the 1st kind can be written with the macdonald function modified hankel function of the 2nd kind k in addition when the azimuthal velocity at the cavity radius is represented with a cavitation number σ n eq 3 can be approximately represented as bosschers 2007 7 ω 1 2 ω 1 2 r c w κ σ n n κ k n κ k n κ κ k z r c i k r r c 2 π λ z r c here λ z is the wave length m junger and feit 1986 stated that the high order mode does not contribute to the radiated sound of the cavity and only the 0th mode contributes to the radiated sound of the cavity because the maximum amplitude of the alternating pressure of the cavity is scaled to k r c n and the high order mode is low k r c n where n is the order number the mode shapes of each mode are shown in fig 4 bosschers 2007 fig 5 shows the natural frequencies of the spherical and vortex cavity when w 5 m s 8 m s and λ 30 mm when the axial velocity is 5 m s the natural frequency of the spherical cavity is higher than that of the vortex cavity the radius of which is equal to that of the spherical cavity as shown in fig 5 a however as the axial velocity increases to 8 0 m s the gap of the natural frequency between spherical and vortex cavity decreases as shown in fig 5 b in fig 5 the natural frequency is calculated at the point where the density of the sea water is 1025 kg m3 the specific heat ratio is 1 0 and the distance between the free surface of the sea and the propeller is 10 m assuming that the shape of cavities is spherical at the cis step and considering that their frequencies are in the range of 10 khz 25 6 khz based on the general sound spectrum at cis the size of the cavitation cavities at cis are in the range of 0 15 mm 0 39 mm when the cavities are sufficiently developed and after the formation of the vortex cavity that is visually inspected it can be estimated that the natural frequency of the vortex cavity is lower than that of the spherical cavity with a small radius from maines and arndt 1997 experiment results the natural frequencies of the vortex cavities that are visually inspected are in the range of 0 4 khz 1 1 khz when calculating the radius of the vortex cavities observing maines and arndt s experiment using eq 7 the radius of the vortex is in the ranges of 1 7 mm 4 0 mm at w 5 m s and 2 2 mm 10 0 mm at w 8 m s by comparing these natural frequencies of the vortex cavities to those of the spherical cavities it can be estimated that the natural frequency of the vortex cavity by visual inspection is much lower than that of the spherical cavities with a small radius if the cis is determined with the sound produced by small size spherical cavities signal processing should be performed with the sound of high frequency range considering the natural frequency of the incepted spherical cavities however if the cis is determined with the sound produced by tip vortex cavities it should be performed with the sound of the frequency range including the natural frequency of the tip vortex cavities 2 3 demon analysis the cavitation begins at one of the propeller blades when the speed of rotation is over the critical speed such that the static pressure of the surrounding water approaches close to the vapor pressure when the cavitation continuously develops according to the increasing speed cavitation occurs at all of the blades when the cavitation occurs the sound of the cavities modulates synchronously to the shaft rate and the blade passing frequency when applying demon analysis the noise component at the shaft rate as well as the blade passing frequency is revealed in the demon spectrum the analytic signal of demon analysis is obtained from eq 8 and the enveloped signal is the amplitude of the analytic signal as shown in randall 1987 8 h ˆ t h t j h t 9 h ˆ t h t 2 h t 2 0 5 here h t is the time signal of the raw data and h t is the hilbert transform of h t as shown in eq 10 10 h t h h t 1 π h t d t τ t from the fast fourier transform fft spectrum of eq 9 cis inspects whether the demon spectrum reveals the sound of the rotating shaft or blade passing frequency in demon analysis the selection of the bandwidth and center frequency of the band pass filter is very important they must be selected considering the frequency range where the modulation coincides with the shaft rotating and blade passing frequency this proper selection can be performed with spectral kurtosis of the short time fft described in the next section in addition cis can be identified when the overall noise level is increased to over 2db knots as the ship speed increases in this research cis is determined with the vibration signal on the aft hull located close to the propeller instead of the sound signal radiated to the under water since the pressure wave produced by the propeller cavitation induces the adjacent hull of the propeller the acceleration on the hull is the same pattern to the cavitation sound of the propeller therefore in the following section for a specific naval vessel cis is evaluated using a 1 3 octave band spectrum the overall level and demon spectrum of the hull vibration adjacent to the propeller 3 experiment in this section the acceleration on the aft hull above the propeller is measured according to the ship speed in order to estimate cis based on the acoustic characteristics of the cavitation cavity described in section 2 according to the measurement results of the underwater radiated noise with the hydrophone array that was performed prior to the present research cis was preliminary estimated and determined as vcis knots therefore the acceleration on the aft hull was measured as from vcis 8 knots to vcis 4 knots as shown in table 1 in order to compare the cis estimated with accelerations to that with underwater radiated noise 3 1 test setup the tested ship is a battleship with a combined diesel engine gas turbine propulsion system the propeller type is the controllable pitched propeller and two of each propeller are installed at the port and the starboard sides to inspect the propeller cis three accelerometers were installed at the aft hull above the propeller as shown in fig 6 since the space wherein the accelerometers were installed is void space equipment is not necessary the no 1 accelerometer was installed on the hull at the port side no 3 was installed on the hull at the starboard side and no 2 was installed between the no 1 and no 3 accelerometers as shown in fig 6 a pcb type 352a60 accelerometer and a b k3053 b12 0 data acquisition system were used to collect the signal the acceleration was recorded for 2 min for each ship speed as shown in table 1 and the sampling rate was set at 65 536samples sec 3 2 test results fig 7 shows the 1 3 octave band spectrum of the acceleration for each ship speed to be tested the acceleration levels at the high frequency range of over 5 khz for the no 1 and 3 accelerometers increased rapidly when the ship speed was t6 t7 even though the distances from the no 1 and no 3 accelerometers to the center line are identical the hull structures for example the distribution of the stiffeners are different from each other because the hulls are not quite bilaterally symmetrical in addition the dynamic pressure induced acceleration on the hull can be different between the port and starboard sides because the dynamic pressure of the propeller blade for the port and starboard sides can be nonlinearly different in accordance with the sailing conditions therefore the difference between the acceleration spectra of no 1 and no 3 can exist as shown in fig 7 even though the spectra shape of the no 1 and no 3 accelerations are different from each other they are increased rapidly and identically when the ship speed is from t6 t7 the acceleration levels at the high frequency range of over 5 khz for the no 2 accelerometer increased rapidly at t5 t6 earlier than those for no 1 and 3 accelerometers this increasing acceleration may be caused by the cavitation therefore cis can be estimated to t5 t7 the reason for why this increasing acceleration for the no 2 accelerometer started earlier than those of the no 1 and no 3 accelerometers was not clearly identified we could simply guess that the reason is as follows since 2 propellers are installed at the port and starboard sides of the ship and their blades rotate outward the cavitation cavities of the 2 propellers would be created below the center position installing no 2 accelerometers where the static pressure of the water near the propeller is the least the water can be vaporized easily at this position when the propeller speed is critical for the cavitation because the static pressure is at its lowest value therefore the pressure wave from the cavity may be transferred to the hull more easily where installing the no 2 accelerometer rather than where installing the no 1 and 3 accelerometers even though the reason for this difference was not clearly identified the cis that was estimated from the acceleration can be varied in accordance with the accelerometer installation position in this research it is assumed that the frequency range of the cavitation sound caused by the vortex and large spherical cavities is set to 3 khz 10 khz and that caused by the spherical cavities with a very small radius is set to 10 khz 25 6 khz fig 8 shows the overall acceleration level in the ranges of 3 khz 10 khz and 10 khz 25 6 khz generally cis is determined when the overall sound pressure level is increased by 2 db per 1 knot increase in speed in order to identify cis using the overall acceleration level the same criterion for identifying cis with sound is adopted in fig 8 the overall acceleration levels on the hull in which the frequency range is from 3 khz to 10 khz are increased by 2 db per 1 knot increase in speed similar to the sound pressure when the ship speed varies from t6 to t7 for the no 1 and 3 accelerometers and from t4 to t5 for the no 2 accelerometer however the overall acceleration levels on the hull in which the frequency range is from 10 khz to 25 6 khz are increased by 2 db per 1knot increase in speed similar to the sound pressure when the ship speed varies from t4 to t5 for the no 1 and 2 accelerometers but the no 3 accelerometer does not sufficiently vary 3 3 spectral kurtosis in the previous section cis was estimated to be t5 t7 based on the overall acceleration level and on the 1 3 octave band spectrum analysis in this section demon analysis described which is another method used to determine cis in order to perform demon analysis the center frequency and bandwidth of the band pass filter should first be determined in this research spectral kurtosis antoni and randall 2006 is applied to select the center frequency and the bandwidth of the band pass filter to perform cis in the mechanical rotating system periodic excited sound can be caused by a bearing or gear mesh fault when the impact force is subject to the mechanical system the vibration increases at its natural frequency therefore the vibration at the natural frequency of the mechanical system periodically appears and disappears repeatedly when the signal varies unstably due to the transient signal the kurtosis of the signal increases spectral kurtosis is the kurtosis of the signal for the spectrum at a particular frequency and is defined as antoni and randall 2006 11 k x e x 4 t e x 2 t 2 2 here e is the mean function k x is the spectral kurtosis and x t is the signal value at a particular frequency for time t if the distribution of the signal is gaussian the kurtosis becomes 0 and if the signal has high transient signal it becomes very high when the cavitation occurs the impact signal of the propeller occurs periodically synchronous to the propeller rotation and blade passing frequency in contrast to the frequency of the bearing and gear mesh fault sound the frequency of the cavitation sound is not the natural frequency of the system but that of the cavity therefore when demon analysis is performed the natural frequencies of the created cavities on the propeller should be included in the bandwidth of the band pass filter considering their shape and size fig 9 shows the kurtogram of the measured acceleration on the hull when the ship speed is t5 t7 the kurtogram is a graph of the spectral kurtosis at each frequency for the short time fft spectrum performed with 2 k frequency lines it is used to determine the center frequency and bandwidth of the bandpass filter for demon analysis in the kurtogram the horizontal axis is the frequency 0 25 6 khz and the vertical axis is k 0 7 and k is defined as n w 2 k n w window length the spectral kurtosis level is represented by the color map on the graph a high spectral kurtosis level at a given frequency band means that many transient signals have been caused by the cavitation therefore using the kurtogram the center frequency and the frequency span that comprise the maximum spectral kurtosis can be defined in fig 9 the spectral kurtosis is at a very high level at a low k k 3 bandwidth 6 4 khz and high frequency range 20 khz when the ship speed is t5 for no 1 and 2 accelerometers it means that regarding the best fit bandpass filter for the demon analysis at the ship speed of t5 it would be preferable for the center frequency and the frequency span to be more than 20 khz and 6 4 khz respectively as the ship speed increases to t6 and t7 the frequency range having the highest spectral kurtosis decreases to the lower frequency and the k level having the highest spectral kurtosis increases to 5 7 200 hz bandwidth 800 hz compared to those when the ship speed is t5 therefore regarding the center frequency of the best fit bandpass filter for the demon analysis at the ship speeds from t6 t7 it would be preferable for the speed to be lower than t5 and the frequency band to be narrower than its typical t5 value as described in section 2 2 and fig 5 spherical bubbles first appear when the cavitation is incepted and the broadband acceleration of 10 khz 25 6 khz which includes the natural frequency of the very small size cavity is modulated with the acceleration at the propeller rotating and blade passing frequency however when the cavity is developed and the tip vortex cavity starts to form the frequency of the acceleration caused by the vortex cavity is lower than the frequency of that caused by the spherical cavity therefore when the ship speed is t6 t7 spectral kurtosis increases at the frequency range of 3 10 khz which is less than the frequency range when the ship speed is t5 when kurtogram analysis is performed for the mechanical system having mechanical defaults such as bearing and gear faults the k level should be selected to include the natural frequency of the mechanical system where the response of the system increases significantly from the impact force however in cavitation the response is not the response of the mechanical system but that of the cavities therefore at a specific k level the frequencies with the highest spectral kurtosis i e natural frequencies of vortex bubbles are varied according to the different cavity size and environmental conditions in addition in the process of the merging and the collapsing of the bubbles the frequencies with the highest spectral kurtosis can also be varied therefore even though the obtained k level can be from 5 to 7 at speeds from t6 t7 narrow bandwidths such as those from 200 hz k 5 800 hz k 7 cannot be applied to perform the demon analysis for the detection of the cis considering that the frequency band of the demon analysis for the cavitation sound at the ship speed of t5 can be obtained at 6 4 k hz from the kurtogram analysis and the center frequencies of the vortex bubbles can vary widely according to their size and environmental condition the bandwidth of the bandpass filter of the demon analysis for the acceleration on the hull was selected as 6 4 khz in fact the 6 4 khz frequency band is widely used for the bandpass filter that is used to perform the demon cis detection analysis consequently the center frequencies were defined as 22 4 khz and 6 4 khz based on the kurtogram results at the ship speeds t5 and from t6 t7 respectively and the bandwidth was determined as 6 4 khz as previously stated according to the kurtogram analysis of this chapter the frequency range of the band pass filter for demon analysis is set to 22 4 khz 3 2 khz when cis is defined with the sound for the very small spherical cavities and is set to 6 4 khz 3 2 khz with that for the tip vortex cavity 3 4 results from demon demon analysis for the acceleration on the hull above the propeller is performed according to the ship s speed at which the bandwidth of the band pass filter is set to 6 4 khz and the center frequency of the band pass filter is set to 6 4 khz and 22 4 khz based on the kurtogram analysis fig 10 shows the demon spectrum when the bandwidth of the band pass filter is 6 4 khz and the center frequency is 6 4 khz here the x axis is the frequency and the y axis is the nominal value that indicates 2 times the measured time duration 2 0 5sec n n 0 200 the bandwidth and center frequency of demon analysis for the underwater radiated noise were the same as those applied in fig 10 when the cavitation is intercepted the cavity is created at one of the propeller blades if the blade dimensions of the propeller are perfectly the same as one another cavities can occur at all of the blades when they pass through the positions where the distance between end of the blade and the free surface is the smallest however due to the variation of the dimensions a cavity can occur at one of the blades first and then as the cavities are developed further the cavities start to occur at all of the blades therefore in the demon spectrum the peak at the 1st rotating frequency of the propeller shaft is firstly revealed at the cis and then its 2nd and 3rd peaks are revealed according to the rotating frequency of the shaft when the cavities are sufficiently developed the peak at the blade passing frequency is also evident therefore cis is defined from demon analysis when the demon spectrum has the peak at the rotating frequency of the shaft in fig 10 cis can be estimated as t6 t7 similar to cis estimated with underwater radiated noise since the demon spectrum has a peak at the 1st rotating frequency when the ship s speed is t6 and the blade passing frequency when the ship speed is t7 fig 11 shows the demon spectrum when the bandwidth of the band pass filter is 6 4 khz and the center frequency is 22 4 khz the spectrum value at the rotating shaft and blade passing frequency are shown at t5 and t6 respectively where the ship speed is less than that when using the band pass filter with a center frequency of 6 4 khz therefore cis can be estimated as t5 t6 from fig 11 in addition the peak value at the shaft rate can be found in the demon spectrum when the propeller pitch is minimum v t1 it means that small spherical bubble may occur when the low propeller pitch is applied as discussed in the previous section the differences in cis according to the center frequency of the band pass filter is due to the different types of cavities spherical or vortex cavity 4 discussion when the cis is estimated with 1 3 octave band spectrum overall level variation and demon spectrum analysis of the acceleration on the hull it is the same as the cis estimated with underwater radiated noise even though cis slightly varies according to the location of the installed accelerometer it is verified that cis can be determined from the acceleration on the hull above the propeller when the hydrophone and pressure sensor are applied to the hull in order to monitor cis a hole needs to be bored to install these sensors however this hole is not necessary when the accelerometer is applied to monitor the cis variation in a real ship therefore for the real time monitoring of cis it is possible to use acceleration on the hull simply with the signal processing suggested in this research through this monitoring technique the maintenance duration can be identified exactly with respect to cis even though cis can be estimated with demon spectrum analysis decoding the demon spectrum is very subjective therefore a quantitative index needs to be developed for automatic real time monitoring of cis in this section the kurtosis of the demon spectrum is suggested for this quantitative index fig 12 shows the demon spectrum at the typical time t when the cavitation begins in fig 12 the peak occurs at the blade passing frequency when the dominant peak forms as shown in fig 12 the kurtosis of the demon spectrum y as eq 12 becomes very large here x i is the demon spectrum level at each frequency x is the average spectrum level s is the standard deviation of the spectrum levels and n is the line numbers of the frequency in the demon spectrum if no dominant peak occurs in the demon spectrum the distribution of the demon spectrum level is gaussian and the kurtosis of the demon spectrum should be approximately 0 12 y n n 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 i 1 n x i x s 4 3 n 1 2 n 2 n 3 therefore the kurtosis of the demon spectrum according to the ship s speed can identify cis fig 13 is the average kurtosis for the demon spectrum of the acceleration on the hull according to the ship s speed as shown in table 1 here the frequency range of the demon spectrum is 4 100 hz and the number of the data to calculate kurtosis is 192 since the frequency resolution is 0 5 hz n 100 hz 4 hz 0 5 hz the kurtosis is calculated with the demon spectrum of the acceleration measured for 0 5sec the kurtosis is calculated for 100 s and the kurtosis shown in fig 13 is the averaged kurtosis for 100 s in fig 13 it is assumed that cis occurs when the average kurtosis is over than 4 0 then cis can be identified as t5 when the center frequency and bandwidth are set to 22 4 khz 3 2 khz as shown in fig 13 a in this case cavitation also occurs at t1 t2 where the propeller pitch ratio is very small when the center frequency and bandwidth is set to 6 4 khz 3 2 khz cis can be estimated as t6 as shown in fig 13 b cis is estimated with the average kurtosis as shown in fig 13 is the same as that estimated by qualitative analysis performed in section 3 through this average kurtosis of the demon spectrum cis can be identified quantitatively and can be used in the real time monitoring of cis in a naval vessel during a voyage when the center frequency of the band pass filter is set as 22 4 khz cis is identified earlier at about 1 knots compared to cis estimated with the band pass filter using a center frequency of 6 4 khz it is widely known that the cavity s sound can be heard ahead of the visual inspection of the bubble in the investigation of this research study the sound of the small spherical bubble firstly occurred and this was followed by the sound of the vortex bubble after the amplitude of the cavity sound is increased in accordance with the increasing of the cavity size the cavity can be visualized therefore to accurately identify the cis the cis identification method should be firstly selected since the sonar systems that are installed in navy ships detect the cis with the sound signal the cis should be defined not by the visualization of the cavity but by the sound from the cavity to define the cis with the sound signal accurately the center frequency and bandwidth of the band pass filter should be determined considering the detection capabilities of the sonar systems for the general naval vessel currently the designs of general cis detection sonar systems are usually based on the sound detection of the vortex cavity 5 conclusion in this research the cis estimation method using the signal processing technique from the acceleration on the hull above the propeller is suggested based on the mechanism in which the vibratory cavity transfers the pressure wave to the hull adjacent to the propeller the detailed conclusions from this research are as follows 1 cis can be estimated with the acceleration on the hull adjacent to the propeller from the experiment with s specific naval vessel 2 through the theoretical investigation it can be seen that the natural frequency of the spherical cavity is much higher than that of the vortex cavity with the same radius when the axial velocity of the propeller is slow therefore when the spectrum analysis using demon is performed to identify cis the cavity s shape and size should be considered 3 when the cis of a specific naval vessel is estimated from demon of the acceleration on the hull whereby the center frequency of the band pass filter is 6 4 khz and 22 khz cis estimated with a center frequency of the band pass filter of 22 4 khz is 1 knots faster than that estimated with the center frequency of the band pass filter of 6 4 khz when using 6 4 khz band pass filter cis is determined to the speed inspecting very small spherical cavities that can t visually be inspected however when using 22 4 khz band pass filter cis is determined to the speed inspecting well developed tip vortex cavities therefore cis can be different according to the frequency range of the band pass filter 4 the estimated cis differs according to the position at which the accelerometers installed therefore the proper installation position of the accelerometer should be selected in order to select the best point on the hull when transferring the pressure wave the cis estimated from the underwater radiating noise should be compared to that estimated from acceleration 5 through the estimation method of cis using the average kurtosis of the demon spectrum the quantitative evaluation of cis is possible and the cis estimated with the average kurtosis of the demon spectrum concurs well with the qualitative evaluation of the cis with 1 3 octave band and demon analysis it is expected that cis determined using the average kurtosis of the demon spectrum can be applied to the real time monitoring of cis in the future the cis monitoring and estimating system will be developed with the acceleration on the hull adjacent to the propeller in order to develop this system the installation position of the accelerometer and the type of cavity that most contributes to the underwater radiated noise should be initially identified

state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university shanghai 200240 china a modal space based direct method is developed for vortex induced vibration viv prediction of flexible risers a viv response solution model is established in modal space consisting of a hydrodynamic force equation and a dynamic response equation adopting a non iterative root search method in modal space the equation set gets solved directly without power balance iterations this direct method is compared against conventional empirical models with its validity and applicability verified this method entirely gets rid of convergence problems during predictions which is conducive to practical engineering applications and puts forward fresh ideas for further development of empirical models for viv prediction keywords viv prediction modal space non iterative method flexible riser 1 introduction marine flexible risers exposed to ocean currents would experience vortex induced vibrations viv and it could be the primary cause for fatigue failures of risers however with inadequate research into viv mechanism and vortex induced hydrodynamic forces present viv predictions are far from accurate during riser design as a result a safety factor up to 10 had to be adopted which led to high manufacturing costs and operation uncertainties at present viv prediction models broadly fall into three categories cfd based models wake oscillator models and empirical models based on forced oscillation experiments chaplin et al 2005 xu 2014 cfd based models based on strip theory analyze two dimensional flows around cross section planes distributed along the riser via cfd technique through structural dynamic analysis flows on different planes strips are associated the riser s position is updated at each time step in response to the calculated vortex induced forces prediction codes adopting cfd based models include norsk hydro herfjord et al 1999 usp yamamoto et al 2004 deep flow deeplines 2002 vivic willden 2003 willden and graham 2004 etc these models hold a broad application foreground and are improving rapidly with the development of computer technology however using cfd based models for viv prediction is still exposed to problems such as large computational cost and time consumption wake oscillator models also based on strip theory take the riser and its wake field as a system and model them as a wake oscillator and a structural oscillator respectively the risers viv responses are calculated through coupled solving the wake oscillator equation and structural oscillator equation in the prediction codes such as orcina vortex tracking sarpkaya and shoaff 1979 and orcina wake oscillator falco et al 1999 currently empirical models based on forced oscillation experiments are still the most widely applied models in engineering designs for their rapidity and convenience in these models it is assumed that hydrodynamic forces on flexible risers can be computed from hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from forced oscillation tests on rigid cylinders subsequently multiple iterations over excitation coefficients vibration frequencies and amplitudes on the basis of power balance theory are conducted until convergence and the riser s vibration response gets solved these empirical models fall into two categories frequency domain models and time domain models frequency domain models based on the modal superposition method predict frequencies amplitudes phase angles and other frequency domain information of viv time domain models based on time domain analysis predict viv time history and study nonlinear problems such as multi frequency coupling problem pipeline soil coupling problem etc vivana larsen et al 2005 shear7 vandiver and li 2005 viva triantafyllou 1993 are prediction codes using frequency domain model whereas abaviv software finn et al 1998 is developed based on time domain model in this paper a hydrodynamic force model is established for viv of risers based on the excitation coefficients derived from forced oscillation model tests and the hydrodynamic damping model for viv meanwhile on the basis of finite element beam theory a dynamic response model is established for flexible risers afterwards the hydrodynamic force model and the dynamic response model are converted to modal space and a 2d equation set in modal space are established describing the hydrodynamic forces on risers as well as the structural responses of risers at the occurrence of viv as a result the solving model for risers viv responses is constructed under modal space the vibration responses are solved directly via a non iterative solving method which completely avoids power balance iterations 2 theory background 2 1 finite element model for flexible risers a cartesian coordinate system is defined in fig 1 the x axis of the o xyz system coincides with the riser s axis the flow direction is parallel to the o xz plane so the z direction is the inline il direction while the y direction is the cross flow cf direction shedding vortices are generated periodically when currents flow around the riser fluctuating hydrodynamic forces induced by vortex shedding will excite the riser s vibration termed vortex induced vibration viv the risers viv in cf and il directions are assumed to be decoupled larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 in this paper discussions are merely made on cf direction yet this prediction method can be applied equally to il direction in this study the flexible riser is analyzed by the finite element method based on the euler bernoulli beam theory according to the finite element beam theory the control equation for the riser s viv in cf direction can be written as 1 m y c s y k y f m is the riser s total mass matrix with added mass included the added mass coefficients are assumed to be 1 0 along the riser vandiver and li 2005 c s is the riser s total structural damping matrix k is the riser s total stiffness matrix with the axial tension considered as well y y and y are respectively the riser s total displacement matrix total velocity matrix and total acceleration matrix f is the riser s total hydrodynamic force matrix in cf direction it is assumed that each node 1 n on the riser has 2 degrees of freedom the linear displacement along the y axis and the angular displacement around the z axis 1 1 the prediction model is developed for risers with different boundary conditions in finite element analysis the matrix sizes should be varying with boundary conditions pined pined risers have 2n 2 degrees of freedom clamped clamped risers have 2n 4 dof and free free risers have 2n dof therefore the matrix sizes should be modified accordingly the matrix sizes in this paper have no indication of a specific boundary condition and they are written as n or 2n for easier understanding and simplification to construct the structural damping matrix c s the rayleigh damping model is not an ideal choice only two modal damping ratios ζ i ζ j are considered to determine the rayleigh damping model in viv predictions if modes other than these two are excited this model will fail to provide a desired modal structural damping conventionally in frequency domain empirical models structural damping is given out through assigning structural damping ratio of each mode ζ m m 1 2 2n larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 for the convenience of structural damping to participate in finite element analysis in a matrix form the clough damping model clough and penzien 2003 is adopted this damping model is an improved proportional damping model which can independently consider the contributions of all the excited modal damping ratios this model has a clear physical meaning the structural damping matrix is correlated to mass and stiffness matrices and contribution of each mode to the structural damping matrix is proportional to structural damping ratio ζ m of that mode which appropriately makes use of all the assigned structural damping ratios and reflects the physical meaning of structural damping in viv prediction this model can be expressed as 2 c s 2 m 1 2 n φ m ζ m ω m m m φ m t m ω m m 1 2 2n represents the riser s mth order eigenfrequency natural frequency φ m represents its corresponding eigenvector modal shape m m represents its corresponding modal mass which can be calculated by 3 m m φ m 1 2 n t m 2 n 2 n φ m 2 n 1 in this paper the riser s excited modes and exciting damping regions are identified by the identification method in conventional empirical models larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 according to the modal superposition theory the riser s vibration response can be expressed as the linear superposition of vibration responses of excited modes assuming that mode α mode β δ modes in total are excited the riser s total displacement matrix can be expressed as 4 y 2 n s φ 2 n δ p δ s matrix y 2n s consists of the time histories of linear displacements and angular displacements at n nodes s represents the number of total time steps φ 2n δ is the riser s modal shape matrix consisting of δ excited modal shape vectors it can be expressed as 5 φ 2 n δ φ α 2 n 1 φ α 1 2 n 1 φ m 2 n 1 φ β 2 n 1 where φ m is the riser s modal shape vector for mode m which can be expressed as 6 φ m 2 n 1 φ y 1 m φ θ 1 m φ y 2 m φ θ 2 m φ y n m φ θ n m t element φ yi m φ θi m respectively represent the terms in φ m corresponding to the linear displacement and angular displacement at node i i 1 2 n for the convenience of distinguishing linear displacements from angular displacements vector φ m is divided into two sub vectors linear displacement modal shape vector φ y m and angular displacement modal shape vector φ θ m 7 φ y m n 1 φ y 1 m φ y 2 m φ y n m t φ θ m n 1 φ θ 1 m φ θ 2 m φ θ n m t in eq 4 p δ s is the modal response matrix of excited modes which can be expressed as 8 p δ s p α s 1 p α 1 s 1 p m s 1 p β s 1 t each modal response is assumed to be a simple harmonic vibration larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 so the modal response time history for mode m can be expressed as 9 p m 1 s a m sin ω m t s γ m s 1 2 s where a m is the amplitude of the riser s modal response for mode m and ω m rad s is the riser s mth order natural frequency during viv assuming an ideal lock in condition occurs the riser s vibration frequency and exciting frequency of mode m are identical to the mth order natural frequency thus the three types of frequencies are all represented with ω m in this paper t s represents the sth s 1 2 3 s time step in the whole time history γ m is the initial phase angle of the modal response time history for mode m substituting eq 5 and eq 8 into eq 4 the displacement matrix y can be expressed as the linear superposition of vibration displacements of excited modes α β 10 y 2 n s α β y m φ α 2 n 1 φ α 1 2 n 1 φ m 2 n 1 φ β 2 n 1 p α s 1 p α 1 s 1 p m s 1 p β s 1 t y m is the riser s mth order vibration displacement matrix which can be expressed as the product of modal shape column vector and the modal response row vector of mode m 11 y m 2 n s φ m 2 n 1 p m 1 s a m φ y 1 m φ θ 1 m φ y 2 m φ θ 2 m φ y n m φ θ n m t sin ω m t s γ m extracting nodal linear displacement terms from the odd rows of the above matrix and the nodal linear displacement matrix of the riser s mth order vibration can be obtained 12 y m n s φ y m n 1 p m 1 s a m φ y 1 m φ y 2 m φ y n m t sin ω m t s γ m where y m represents nodal linear displacements of the riser s mth order vibration and φ y m is the linear displacement modal shape vector of mode m thus subsequent to differentiation each nodal linear velocity of the riser s mth order vibration can be expressed as 13 y m n s φ y m n 1 p m 1 s a m ω m φ y 1 m φ y 2 m φ y n m t cos ω m t s γ m assuming that the riser s total hydrodynamic force doesn t contain coupled force terms of different modes it can be expressed as the linear superposition of forces of excited modes 14 f 2 n s α β f m c 2 n s f m c is the riser s hydrodynamic force matrix of mode m under cartesian coordinate system 2 2 the notations of forces are distinguished by superscripts force matrix under cartesian system f m c modal force f m m excitation force at node i f m i e damping force at node i 1 f m i 1 d substituting eq 10 and eq 14 into eq 1 vibration control equation of the riser under cartesian coordinate system is obtained 15 m α β y m c s α β y m k α β y m α β f m c assuming that no modal coupling effect exists between hydrodynamic forces and vibration responses of different modes the above equation can be divided into δ independent equations consisting of equations of excited mode α mode β if the riser s mode m is excited the vibration control equation of the riser for mode m can be expressed as 16 m y m c s y m k y m f m c where y m and y m are the riser s vibration velocity and acceleration matrix for mode m 2 2 hydrodynamic force model for viv in conventional empirical prediction models the riser is split over its length into exciting and damping regions for every excited mode it is assumed that excitation force and damping force act respectively in exciting and damping regions of every excited mode larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 the excitation force is in phase with vibration velocity in each mode whereas the damping force is in reversed phase with the vibration velocity in each mode the distribution of hydrodynamic force of mode m over the riser s length is illustrated in fig 2 thus the riser s hydrodynamic force matrix of mode m f m c can be expressed as 17 f m c f m 1 d 0 f m i 1 d 0 damping region f m i e 0 f m j e 0 exciting region f m j 1 d 0 f m n d 0 damping region t where nodal forces are in odd rows of the above matrix and nodal moments are in even rows in this study the hydrodynamic forces are calculated on discrete points 1 n and when we are building the finite element model the nodes are chosen to be exactly at these points for simplification as a result the nodal forces are equal to the discrete forces and the nodal moments are zero as long as the riser s fe model has adequate nodes e g n 10 or namely enough discrete forces are calculated along the riser the simplification will not introduce a considerable error to the results in the above force matrix f m i e and f m j e represent the excitation force time history at node i and node j in the riser s exciting region of excited mode m similarly f m i 1 d and f m j 1 d represent the damping force time history at node i 1 and node j 1 in the riser s damping regions of excited mode m in exciting region of excited mode m excitation force at node i can be expressed as blevins 1990 18 f m i 1 s e c l i a m ω m ρ f u i 2 d i l 2 cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where ρ f is the fluid density u i is the flow velocity at node i d i is the riser s hydrodynamic diameter at node i and l is the riser s element length c l i a m ω m is the excitation coefficient at node i which is related to the non dimensional vibration amplitude and frequency of excited mode m thus it can be expressed as the function of mth order vibration amplitude a m and frequency ω m this excitation coefficient model was derived from gopalkrishnan s forced oscillation experiments on rigid cylinders gopalkrishnan 1993 and modified according to flexible riser model experiments it is assumed that under the same reynolds number excitation coefficients are related to the non dimensional vibration frequency f and non dimensional vibration amplitude a larsen et al 2005 according to eq 12 the non dimensional vibration amplitude at each node for the excited mode m can be expressed as 19 a a m d φ y m the non dimensional vibration frequency at each node for the excited mode m can be expressed as 20 f ω m d 2 π u under the same non dimensional frequency f the relation between excitation coefficient c l and non dimensional vibration amplitude a d is illustrate in fig 3 ab and bc are parabolas point a represents the excitation coefficient as a d 0 c l a d 0 point b represents the excitation coefficient reaches a maximum at a d cl max c l max point c represents the excitation coefficient reaches zero at a d cl 0 the coordinate of a b and c are 0 c l a d 0 a d cl max c l max and a d cl 0 0 respectively these three parameters a d cl max c l max a d cl 0 are deriveded from gopalkrishnan s forced oscillation experiments after simplifications c l a d 0 is obtained through extrapolation fig 4 is the values of the above four parameters under different non dimensional frequencies larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 to satisfy that the hydrodynamic force is strictly in phase with vibration velocity of excited mode m eq 18 is rewritten as 21 f m i e c l i a m ω m ρ f u i 2 d i l 2 cos ω m t s γ m sgn φ y i m where φ yi m is the term corresponding to the linear displacement at node i in the modal shape vector of mode m and sgn φ yi m is the sign of φ yi m in damping region of excited mode m damping force at node i 1 can be expressed as 22 f m i 1 1 s d c h i 1 y m i 1 1 s c h i 1 φ y i 1 m a m ω m cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where y m i 1 is the mth order vibration linear velocity at node i 1 corresponding to the i 1st row vector of the mth order vibration linear velocity matrix in eq 13 c h i 1 is the riser s damping coefficient at node i 1 which adopts venugopal s hydrodynamic damping model venugopal 1996 the hydrodynamic damping model is proposed by venugopal for risers undergoing viv it depends on local reduced velocities and takes different forms for low reduced velocity regions and high reduced velocity regions the low reduced velocity damping model is 23 c h ω π ρ f d 2 2 2 2 re ω c s w a x d 2 c r l ρ f d u re ω ωd 2 ν is a vibration reynolds number where ω is the riser s vibration frequency and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid c rl and c sw are empirical coefficients which are taken to be 0 18 and 0 2 respectively vandiver and li 2005 the high reduced velocity damping model is 24 c h c r h ρ f u 2 ω because c h is a per unit length damping coefficient it must be multiplied by the riser s element length l for applications in fea substitute eq 21 and eq 22 into eq 17 and the hydrodynamic force matrix of excited mode m is obtained 25 f m c 2 n s f m c a m p 2 n 1 cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where f m c a m p represents the hydrodynamic force amplitude matrix of mode m which can be written as 26 f m c a m p 2 n s c h 1 φ y 1 m a m ω m 0 c h i 1 φ y i 1 m a m ω m 0 damping region c l i ρ f u i 2 d i l 2 sgn φ y i m 0 c l j ρ f u j 2 d j l 2 sgn φ y j m 0 exciting region c h j 1 φ y j 1 m a m ω m 0 c h n φ y n m a m ω m 0 damping region t c l represents the excitation coefficients distributing along the riser which are related to the non dimensional vibration amplitudes and frequencies larsen et al 2005 consequently it can be expressed as the function of mth order vibration amplitude a m and frequency ω m written as c l a m ω m whenever the riser s structural properties are determined vibration frequencies ω r are determined as a result ω m is no longer a variable for c l and excitation coefficients at each node are single variable functions of a m written as c l a m similarly the damping coefficients c h at each node are single variable functions of a m see next section consequently terms in the hydrodynamic force matrix of mode m are all single variable functions of a m written as f m c a m a m p by converting these excitation and damping forces into modal space a 2d functional relation between modal force and modal response can be derived 2 3 viv response solving model in modal space substitute eq 11 into eq 16 multiply the transpose of modal shape matrix φ m t of mode m with both sides of the equation and vibration control equation for the riser in modal space is obtained 27 φ m t m φ m p m φ m t c s φ m p m φ m t k φ m p m φ m t f m c after simplification last equation can be written as a single freedom vibration equation 28 m m p m c m p m k m p m f m m m m φ m t m φ m is the riser s modal mass of mode m k m φ m t k φ m is the riser s modal stiffness of mode m c m φ m t c s φ m is the riser s modal damping of mode m f m 1 s m φ m 1 2 n t f m c 2 n s is the riser s modal force time history of mode m substituting eq 25 into it the modal force of mode m can be further expressed as 29 f m 1 s m φ m t 1 2 n f m c a m p 2 n 1 cos ω m t s γ m 1 s f m a m p m cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where f m a m p m is amplitude of the riser s modal force of mode m which can be expressed as 30 f m a m p m φ m 1 2 n t f m c a m p 2 n 1 because elements in vector f m c a m p are all single variable functions of a m amplitude of the modal force f m a m p m of mode m is a single variable function of a m as well according to the excitation coefficient model and the hydrodynamic damping model described in the following sections a schematic for the f m a m p m a m functional relation is illustrated in fig 5 substitute eq 9 and eq 29 into eq 28 and the riser s vibration control equation in the modal space can be written as 31 m m a m ω m 2 sin ω m t s γ m c m a m ω m cos ω m t s γ m k m a m sin ω m t s γ m f m a m p m cos ω m t s γ m on the basis of the orthogonality of sine and cosine terms sum of sine term coefficients and sum of cosine term coefficients are both zero 32 m m a m ω m 2 k m a m 0 c m a m ω m f m a m p m 0 thus the dynamic response equation in the modal space for risers undergoing viv can be obtained 33 a m f m a m p m c m ω m because c m has no relation to ω m and a m f m m is proportional to a m a schematic for the second f m a m p m a m functional relation is illustrated in fig 6 so far the hydrodynamic force equation and dynamic response equation in modal space for risers viv have been derived solve this equation set listed below and the amplitude of the modal response of mode m can be obtained 34 f m a m p m φ m t f m c a m a m p f m a m p m c m ω m a m obviously this equation set is merely about two variables f m a m p m and a m and it s also a 2 d function set f m a m p m a m thus it is convenient to solve it by plotting the two function curves above figs 5 and 6 in one coordinate system and pinpointing the intersection point as illustrated in fig 7 while in the prediction program the function values f m a m p m of the two functions in eq 34 are enumerated a m f 1 a m f 2 and an absolute difference sequence f 1 f 2 is derived accordingly the modal response amplitude a m we are trying to solve is corresponding to min f 1 f 2 the solving process is illustrated in table 1 obviously no iterations exist in the solving program ultimately linearly superpose excited modal responses and the riser s total viv response in cf direction can be obtained 35 y 2 n s α β φ m 2 n 1 p m 1 s α β a m φ m 2 n 1 sin ω m t s γ m 1 s 2 4 discussions in conventional empirical models a power balance iterative formula is deduced by seeking a balance between risers modal input and output powers vandiver and li 2005 while in the present method the modal input and output powers can be calculated by multiplying modal velocity with modal force described in eq 34 the modal velocity of mode m is expressed as p m a m ω m cos ω m t s γ m multiply p m and the modal force s time item cos ω m t s γ m with both sides of functions in eq 34 and the following formulae are derived where p in and p out are respectively modal input and output powers 36 p i n φ m t f m c a m p p m cos ω m t s γ m φ m t f m c a m p a m ω m cos 2 ω m t s γ m p o u t c m ω m a m p m cos ω m t m γ m c m a m 2 ω m 2 cos 2 ω m t s γ m by time averaging and simplifying eq 36 the power balance iterative formula in conventional empirical models can be derived thus the direct method and conventional empirical models ought to give identical prediction results mit professor j kim vandiver stated that the empirical program shear7 has used a similar graphical solution since its first release in the early 1990s a simple root search is conducted which minimizes f1 f2 personal communication with prof j kim vandiver 20 january 2017 to explain how the direct method is developed that naturally there is one point requiring clarification as well in conventional empirical models the hydrodynamic damping c h is generally considered together with structural damping c s as a damping item larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 whereas in the present method c h is considered together with the excitation force as a force item this unnoticeable difference makes the dynamic response equation eq 33 a linear relationship and thus simplifies the non iterative root search process the prediction procedures of the present method are illustrated in fig 8 and table 2 3 prediction results this chapter applies the modal space based direct method to predict the cf direction viv responses of experimental working conditions which were respectively carried out under uniform flow and linear sheared flow in addition in order to verify the validity of this method prediction results of the present method are compared with results of a conventional prediction model and experimental results 3 1 prediction results under uniform flow the viv experiment on a flexible riser under uniform flow was carried out in the towing tank of shanghai ship and shipping research institute the experimental apparatus is illustrated in fig 9 in the

state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university shanghai 200240 china a modal space based direct method is developed for vortex induced vibration viv prediction of flexible

space the equation set gets solved directly without power balance iterations this direct method is compared against conventional empirical models with its validity and applicability verified this method entirely gets rid of convergence problems during predictions which is conducive to practical engineering applications and puts forward fresh ideas for further development of empirical models for viv prediction keywords viv prediction modal space non iterative method flexible riser 1 introduction marine flexible risers exposed to ocean currents would experience vortex induced vibrations viv and it could be the primary cause for fatigue failures of risers however with inadequate research into viv mechanism and vortex induced hydrodynamic forces present viv predictions are far from accurate during riser design as a result a safety factor up to 10 had to be adopted which led to high manufacturing costs and operation uncertainties at present viv prediction models broadly fall into three categories cfd based models wake oscillator models and empirical models based on forced oscillation experiments chaplin et al 2005 xu 2014 cfd based models based on strip theory analyze two dimensional flows around cross section planes distributed along the riser via cfd technique through structural dynamic analysis flows on different planes strips are associated the riser s position is updated at each time step in response to the calculated vortex induced forces prediction codes adopting cfd based models include norsk hydro herfjord et al 1999 usp yamamoto et al 2004 deep flow deeplines 2002 vivic willden 2003 willden and graham 2004 etc these models hold a broad application foreground and are improving rapidly with the development of computer technology however using cfd based models for viv prediction is still exposed to problems such as large computational cost and time consumption wake oscillator models also based on strip theory take the riser and its wake field as a system and model them as a wake oscillator and a structural oscillator respectively the risers viv responses are calculated through coupled solving the wake oscillator equation and structural oscillator equation in the prediction codes such as orcina vortex tracking sarpkaya and shoaff 1979 and orcina wake oscillator falco et al 1999 currently empirical models based on forced oscillation experiments are still the most widely applied models in engineering designs for their rapidity and convenience in these models it is assumed that hydrodynamic forces on flexible risers can be computed from hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from forced oscillation tests on rigid cylinders subsequently multiple iterations over excitation coefficients vibration frequencies and amplitudes on the basis of power balance theory are conducted until convergence and the riser s vibration response gets solved these empirical models fall into two categories frequency domain models and time domain models frequency domain models based on the modal superposition method predict frequencies amplitudes phase angles and other frequency domain information of viv time domain models based on time domain analysis predict viv time history and study nonlinear problems such as multi frequency coupling problem pipeline soil coupling problem etc vivana larsen et al 2005 shear7 vandiver and li 2005 viva triantafyllou 1993 are prediction codes using frequency domain model whereas abaviv software finn et al 1998 is developed based on time domain model in this paper a hydrodynamic force model is established for viv of risers based on the excitation coefficients derived from forced oscillation model tests and the hydrodynamic damping model for viv meanwhile on the basis of finite element beam theory a dynamic response model is established for flexible risers afterwards the hydrodynamic force model and the dynamic response model are converted to modal space and a 2d equation set in modal space are established describing the hydrodynamic forces on risers as well as the structural responses of risers at the occurrence of viv as a result the solving model for risers viv responses is constructed under modal space the vibration responses are solved directly via a non iterative solving method which completely avoids power balance iterations 2 theory background 2 1 finite element model for flexible risers a cartesian coordinate system is defined in fig 1 the x axis of the o xyz system coincides with the riser s axis the flow direction is parallel to the o xz plane so the z direction is the inline il direction while the y direction is the cross flow cf direction shedding vortices are generated periodically when currents flow around the riser fluctuating hydrodynamic forces induced by vortex shedding will excite the riser s vibration termed vortex induced vibration viv the risers viv in cf and il directions are assumed to be decoupled larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 in this paper discussions are merely made on cf direction yet this prediction method can be applied equally to il direction in this study the flexible riser is analyzed by the finite element method based on the euler bernoulli beam theory according to the finite element beam theory the control equation for the riser s viv in cf direction can be written as 1 m y c s y k y f m is the riser s total mass matrix with added mass included the added mass coefficients are assumed to be 1 0 along the riser vandiver and li 2005 c s is the riser s total structural damping matrix k is the riser s total stiffness matrix with the axial tension considered as well y y and y are respectively the riser s total displacement matrix total velocity matrix and total acceleration matrix f is the riser s total hydrodynamic force matrix in cf direction it is assumed that each node 1 n on the riser has 2 degrees of freedom the linear displacement along the y axis and the angular displacement around the z axis 1 1 the prediction model is developed for risers with different boundary conditions in finite element analysis the matrix sizes should be varying with boundary conditions pined pined risers have 2n 2 degrees of freedom clamped clamped risers have 2n 4 dof and free free risers have 2n dof therefore the matrix sizes should be modified accordingly the matrix sizes in this paper have no indication of a specific boundary condition and they are written as n or 2n for easier understanding and simplification to construct the structural damping matrix c s the rayleigh damping model is not an ideal choice only two modal damping ratios ζ i ζ j are considered to determine the rayleigh damping model in viv predictions if modes other than these two are excited this model will fail to provide a desired modal structural damping conventionally in frequency domain empirical models structural damping is given out through assigning structural damping ratio of each mode ζ m m 1 2 2n larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 for the convenience of structural damping to participate in finite element analysis in a matrix form the clough damping model clough and penzien 2003 is adopted this damping model is an improved proportional damping model which can independently consider the contributions of all the excited modal damping ratios this model has a clear physical meaning the structural damping matrix is correlated to mass and stiffness matrices and contribution of each mode to the structural damping matrix is proportional to structural damping ratio ζ m of that mode which appropriately makes use of all the assigned structural damping ratios and reflects the physical meaning of structural damping in viv prediction this model can be expressed as 2 c s 2 m 1 2 n φ m ζ m ω m m m φ m t m ω m m 1 2 2n represents the riser s mth order eigenfrequency natural frequency φ m represents its corresponding eigenvector modal shape m m represents its corresponding modal mass which can be calculated by 3 m m φ m 1 2 n t m 2 n 2 n φ m 2 n 1 in this paper the riser s excited modes and exciting damping regions are identified by the identification method in conventional empirical models larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 according to the modal superposition theory the riser s vibration response can be expressed as the linear superposition of vibration responses of excited modes assuming that mode α mode β δ modes in total are excited the riser s total displacement matrix can be expressed as 4 y 2 n s φ 2 n δ p δ s matrix y 2n s consists of the time histories of linear displacements and angular displacements at n nodes s represents the number of total time steps φ 2n δ is the riser s modal shape matrix consisting of δ excited modal shape vectors it can be expressed as 5 φ 2 n δ φ α 2 n 1 φ α 1 2 n 1 φ m 2 n 1 φ β 2 n 1 where φ m is the riser s modal shape vector for mode m which can be expressed as 6 φ m 2 n 1 φ y 1 m φ θ 1 m φ y 2 m φ θ 2 m φ y n m φ θ n m t element φ yi m φ θi m respectively represent the terms in φ m corresponding to the linear displacement and angular displacement at node i i 1 2 n for the convenience of distinguishing linear displacements from angular displacements vector φ m is divided into two sub vectors linear displacement modal shape vector φ y m and angular displacement modal shape vector φ θ m 7 φ y m n 1 φ y 1 m φ y 2 m φ y n m t φ θ m n 1 φ θ 1 m φ θ 2 m φ θ n m t in eq 4 p δ s is the modal response matrix of excited modes which can be expressed as 8 p δ s p α s 1 p α 1 s 1 p m s 1 p β s 1 t each modal response is assumed to be a simple harmonic vibration larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 so the modal response time history for mode m can be expressed as 9 p m 1 s a m sin ω m t s γ m s 1 2 s where a m is the amplitude of the riser s modal response for mode m and ω m rad s is the riser s mth order natural frequency during viv assuming an ideal lock in condition occurs the riser s vibration frequency and exciting frequency of mode m are identical to the mth order natural frequency thus the three types of frequencies are all represented with ω m in this paper t s represents the sth s 1 2 3 s time step in the whole time history γ m is the initial phase angle of the modal response time history for mode m substituting eq 5 and eq 8 into eq 4 the displacement matrix y can be expressed as the linear superposition of vibration displacements of excited modes α β 10 y 2 n s α β y m φ α 2 n 1 φ α 1 2 n 1 φ m 2 n 1 φ β 2 n 1 p α s 1 p α 1 s 1 p m s 1 p β s 1 t y m is the riser s mth order vibration displacement matrix which can be expressed as the product of modal shape column vector and the modal response row vector of mode m 11 y m 2 n s φ m 2 n 1 p m 1 s a m φ y 1 m φ θ 1 m φ y 2 m φ θ 2 m φ y n m φ θ n m t sin ω m t s γ m extracting nodal linear displacement terms from the odd rows of the above matrix and the nodal linear displacement matrix of the riser s mth order vibration can be obtained 12 y m n s φ y m n 1 p m 1 s a m φ y 1 m φ y 2 m φ y n m t sin ω m t s γ m where y m represents nodal linear displacements of the riser s mth order vibration and φ y m is the linear displacement modal shape vector of mode m thus subsequent to differentiation each nodal linear velocity of the riser s mth order vibration can be expressed as 13 y m n s φ y m n 1 p m 1 s a m ω m φ y 1 m φ y 2 m φ y n m t cos ω m t s γ m assuming that the riser s total hydrodynamic force doesn t contain coupled force terms of different modes it can be expressed as the linear superposition of forces of excited modes 14 f 2 n s α β f m c 2 n s f m c is the riser s hydrodynamic force matrix of mode m under cartesian coordinate system 2 2 the notations of forces are distinguished by superscripts force matrix under cartesian system f m c modal force f m m excitation force at node i f m i e damping force at node i 1 f m i 1 d substituting eq 10 and eq 14 into eq 1 vibration control equation of the riser under cartesian coordinate system is obtained 15 m α β y m c s α β y m k α β y m α β f m c assuming that no modal coupling effect exists between hydrodynamic forces and vibration responses of different modes the above equation can be divided into δ independent equations consisting of equations of excited mode α mode β if the riser s mode m is excited the vibration control equation of the riser for mode m can be expressed as 16 m y m c s y m k y m f m c where y m and y m are the riser s vibration velocity and acceleration matrix for mode m 2 2 hydrodynamic force model for viv in conventional empirical prediction models the riser is split over its length into exciting and damping regions for every excited mode it is assumed that excitation force and damping force act respectively in exciting and damping regions of every excited mode larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 triantafyllou 1993 the excitation force is in phase with vibration velocity in each mode whereas the damping force is in reversed phase with the vibration velocity in each mode the distribution of hydrodynamic force of mode m over the riser s length is illustrated in fig 2 thus the riser s hydrodynamic force matrix of mode m f m c can be expressed as 17 f m c f m 1 d 0 f m i 1 d 0 damping region f m i e 0 f m j e 0 exciting region f m j 1 d 0 f m n d 0 damping region t where nodal forces are in odd rows of the above matrix and nodal moments are in even rows in this study the hydrodynamic forces are calculated on discrete points 1 n and when we are building the finite element model the nodes are chosen to be exactly at these points for simplification as a result the nodal forces are equal to the discrete forces and the nodal moments are zero as long as the riser s fe model has adequate nodes e g n 10 or namely enough discrete forces are calculated along the riser the simplification will not introduce a considerable error to the results in the above force matrix f m i e and f m j e represent the excitation force time history at node i and node j in the riser s exciting region of excited mode m similarly f m i 1 d and f m j 1 d represent the damping force time history at node i 1 and node j 1 in the riser s damping regions of excited mode m in exciting region of excited mode m excitation force at node i can be expressed as blevins 1990 18 f m i 1 s e c l i a m ω m ρ f u i 2 d i l 2 cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where ρ f is the fluid density u i is the flow velocity at node i d i is the riser s hydrodynamic diameter at node i and l is the riser s element length c l i a m ω m is the excitation coefficient at node i which is related to the non dimensional vibration amplitude and frequency of excited mode m thus it can be expressed as the function of mth order vibration amplitude a m and frequency ω m this excitation coefficient model was derived from gopalkrishnan s forced oscillation experiments on rigid cylinders gopalkrishnan 1993 and modified according to flexible riser model experiments it is assumed that under the same reynolds number excitation coefficients are related to the non dimensional vibration frequency f and non dimensional vibration amplitude a larsen et al 2005 according to eq 12 the non dimensional vibration amplitude at each node for the excited mode m can be expressed as 19 a a m d φ y m the non dimensional vibration frequency at each node for the excited mode m can be expressed as 20 f ω m d 2 π u under the same non dimensional frequency f the relation between excitation coefficient c l and non dimensional vibration amplitude a d is illustrate in fig 3 ab and bc are parabolas point a represents the excitation coefficient as a d 0 c l a d 0 point b represents the excitation coefficient reaches a maximum at a d cl max c l max point c represents the excitation coefficient reaches zero at a d cl 0 the coordinate of a b and c are 0 c l a d 0 a d cl max c l max and a d cl 0 0 respectively these three parameters a d cl max c l max a d cl 0 are deriveded from gopalkrishnan s forced oscillation experiments after simplifications c l a d 0 is obtained through extrapolation fig 4 is the values of the above four parameters under different non dimensional frequencies larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 to satisfy that the hydrodynamic force is strictly in phase with vibration velocity of excited mode m eq 18 is rewritten as 21 f m i e c l i a m ω m ρ f u i 2 d i l 2 cos ω m t s γ m sgn φ y i m where φ yi m is the term corresponding to the linear displacement at node i in the modal shape vector of mode m and sgn φ yi m is the sign of φ yi m in damping region of excited mode m damping force at node i 1 can be expressed as 22 f m i 1 1 s d c h i 1 y m i 1 1 s c h i 1 φ y i 1 m a m ω m cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where y m i 1 is the mth order vibration linear velocity at node i 1 corresponding to the i 1st row vector of the mth order vibration linear velocity matrix in eq 13 c h i 1 is the riser s damping coefficient at node i 1 which adopts venugopal s hydrodynamic damping model venugopal 1996 the hydrodynamic damping model is proposed by venugopal for risers undergoing viv it depends on local reduced velocities and takes different forms for low reduced velocity regions and high reduced velocity regions the low reduced velocity damping model is 23 c h ω π ρ f d 2 2 2 2 re ω c s w a x d 2 c r l ρ f d u re ω ωd 2 ν is a vibration reynolds number where ω is the riser s vibration frequency and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid c rl and c sw are empirical coefficients which are taken to be 0 18 and 0 2 respectively vandiver and li 2005 the high reduced velocity damping model is 24 c h c r h ρ f u 2 ω because c h is a per unit length damping coefficient it must be multiplied by the riser s element length l for applications in fea substitute eq 21 and eq 22 into eq 17 and the hydrodynamic force matrix of excited mode m is obtained 25 f m c 2 n s f m c a m p 2 n 1 cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where f m c a m p represents the hydrodynamic force amplitude matrix of mode m which can be written as 26 f m c a m p 2 n s c h 1 φ y 1 m a m ω m 0 c h i 1 φ y i 1 m a m ω m 0 damping region c l i ρ f u i 2 d i l 2 sgn φ y i m 0 c l j ρ f u j 2 d j l 2 sgn φ y j m 0 exciting region c h j 1 φ y j 1 m a m ω m 0 c h n φ y n m a m ω m 0 damping region t c l represents the excitation coefficients distributing along the riser which are related to the non dimensional vibration amplitudes and frequencies larsen et al 2005 consequently it can be expressed as the function of mth order vibration amplitude a m and frequency ω m written as c l a m ω m whenever the riser s structural properties are determined vibration frequencies ω r are determined as a result ω m is no longer a variable for c l and excitation coefficients at each node are single variable functions of a m written as c l a m similarly the damping coefficients c h at each node are single variable functions of a m see next section consequently terms in the hydrodynamic force matrix of mode m are all single variable functions of a m written as f m c a m a m p by converting these excitation and damping forces into modal space a 2d functional relation between modal force and modal response can be derived 2 3 viv response solving model in modal space substitute eq 11 into eq 16 multiply the transpose of modal shape matrix φ m t of mode m with both sides of the equation and vibration control equation for the riser in modal space is obtained 27 φ m t m φ m p m φ m t c s φ m p m φ m t k φ m p m φ m t f m c after simplification last equation can be written as a single freedom vibration equation 28 m m p m c m p m k m p m f

n s is the riser s modal force time history of mode m substituting eq 25 into it the modal force of mode m can be further expressed as 29 f m 1 s m φ m t 1 2 n f m c a m p 2 n 1 cos ω m t s γ m 1 s f m a m p m cos ω m t s γ m 1 s where f m a m p m is amplitude of the riser s modal force of mode m which can be expressed as 30 f m a m p m φ m 1 2 n t f m c a m p 2 n 1 because elements in vector f m c a m p are all single variable functions of a m amplitude of the modal force f m a m p m of mode m is a single variable function of a m as well according to the excitation coefficient model and the hydrodynamic damping model described in the following sections a schematic for the f m a m p m a m functional relation is illustrated in fig 5 substitute eq 9 and eq 29 into eq 28 and the riser s vibration control equation in the modal space can be written as 31 m m a m ω m 2 sin ω m t s γ m c m a m ω m cos ω m t s γ m k m a m sin ω m t s γ m f m a m p m cos ω m t s γ m on the basis of the orthogonality of sine and cosine terms sum of sine term coefficients and sum of cosine term coefficients are both zero 32 m m a m ω m 2 k m a m 0 c m a m ω m f m a m p m 0 thus the dynamic response equation in the modal space for risers undergoing viv can be obtained 33 a m f m a m p m c m ω m because c m has no relation to ω m and a m f m m is proportional to a m a schematic for the second f m a m p m a m functional relation is illustrated in fig 6 so far the hydrodynamic force equation and dynamic response equation in modal space for risers viv have been derived solve this equation set listed below and the amplitude of the modal response of mode m can be obtained 34 f m a m p m φ m t f m c a m a m p f m a m p m c m ω m a m obviously this equation set is merely about two variables f m a m p m and a m and it s also a 2 d function set f m a m p m a m thus it is convenient to solve it by plotting the two function curves above figs 5 and 6 in one coordinate system and pinpointing the intersection point as illustrated in fig 7 while in the prediction program the function values f m a m p m of the two functions in eq 34 are enumerated a m f 1 a m f 2 and an absolute difference sequence f 1 f 2 is derived accordingly the modal response amplitude a m we are trying to solve is corresponding to min f 1 f 2 the solving process is illustrated in table 1 obviously no iterations exist in the solving program ultimately linearly superpose excited modal responses and the riser s total viv response in cf direction can be obtained 35 y 2 n s α β φ m 2 n 1 p m 1 s α β a m φ m 2 n 1

prediction results mit professor j kim vandiver stated that the empirical program shear7 has used a similar graphical solution since its first release in the early 1990s a simple root search is conducted which minimizes f1 f2 personal communication with prof j kim vandiver 20 january 2017 to explain how the direct method is developed that naturally there is one point requiring clarification as well in conventional empirical models the hydrodynamic damping c h is generally considered together with structural damping c s as a damping item larsen et al 2005 vandiver and li 2005 whereas in the present method c h is considered together with the excitation force as a force item this unnoticeable difference makes the dynamic response equation eq 33 a linear relationship and thus simplifies the non iterative root search process the prediction procedures of the present method are illustrated in fig 8 and table 2 3 prediction results this chapter applies the modal space based direct method

w and the powers of mode 3 and mode 5 are respectively 51 above cutoff 0 2 and 11 below cutoff of this value with st 0 2 the excited ranges for flow velocities are calculated as 1 32 m s 1 99 m s for mode 3 and 2 09 m s 3 13 m s for mode 4 therefore it is determined that the 3rd and 4th modes of this riser model are excited and the exciting regions of these two modes are at 2 49 m 3 74 m and 3 91m 5 86 m on the riser model respectively the 3rd and 4th order natural frequencies are f 3 10 73 hz and f 4 16 81 hz the riser model s modal shapes and exciting and damping regions of excited modes are

modal response amplitudes are a 3 0 138d and a 4 0 298d and the corresponding modal force amplitudes are f 3 a m p m 1 0n and f 4 a m p m 5 2n the distributions of excitation coefficients and hydrodynamic damping coefficients for 3rd and 4th mode along the riser model are illustrated in fig 17 after modal superposition the distribution of rms value of non dimensional displacement amplitude on the riser model is derived which is illustrated in fig 18 as shown in fig 18 the prediction result of the present method is coinciding with that of the conventional empirical model and is conservative compared with the experimental result but not overly so except for this working condition more predictions under linear sheared flow for riser model 2 are carried out for method verification with results listed in table 4 in appendix 4 conclusion a modal space based direct prediction method for viv of flexible risers is proposed in this paper a hydrodynamic force equation and a dynamic response equation are established in modal space for viv prediction utilizing a non iterative solving process in the modal space the equations are solved without power balance iterations

using a two dimensional numerical wave tank are examined in this study a high order boundary element method is used to compute the fluid flow in the eulerian frame fully nonlinear boundary conditions are applied to achieve the unique solution of the boundary value problem hence kinematics of the fluid particles on the exact free surface boundary is calculated using the material node approach in the lagrangian frame runge kutta time integration is employed to update the boundary values and the computational control volume to implement the body condition the time derivative of the velocity

efficiency of the submerged bristol cylinder is compared with experimental data and numerical solutions for different incident waves to verify the present numerical model and the accuracy of the solution is also investigated the convergence of the present fully nonlinear model in the simulation of the freely rotating cylinder about the off centered axis as a wave energy converter is evaluated for different submergence depths off center distances and a robust nonlinear incident wave keywords wave energy converter mixed eulerian lagrangian acceleration potential numerical wave tank oscillating cylinder 1 introduction a broad range of the wave body interaction problem has been solved using numerical wave tanks nwt in the past two decades the various approaches have been developed for applying the free surface boundary conditions and body boundary condition the free surface boundary conditions have been linearized to simulate the wave body interaction in the time and the frequency domain by nakos et al 1993 despite the intricate implementation of the perturbation theory it has been used in the weakly nonlinear wave body interaction problems linear and second order interaction of wave and floating bodies were simulated by kim et al 1998 using the diffraction theory and the perturbation theory in addition the second order interaction of wave ocean current and the floating body was studied by liu and teng 2010 and bai and teng 2013 the fully nonlinear free surface problems have been solved using mixed eulerian lagrangian mel method proposed by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 in this regards the free surface boundary values have been calculated in the eulerian frame at each time step and the boundary conditions were updated in the lagrangian frame the fully nonlinear free surface flow due to wave overturning on the arbitrary seabed was modeled using an nwt by grilli et al 2001 moreover the fully nonlinear interaction of waves and current interaction was simulated by ryu et al 2003 transmission and propagation of linear and nonlinear irregular waves have been studied also by ning and teng 2007 tang and huang 2008 ning et al 2009 and abbasnia and ghiasi 2014a wave interaction with an array of vertical and horizontal fixed cylinders was studied by wang and wu 2007 and abbasnia and ghiasi 2014b respectively interaction of nonlinear waves and freely floating bodies has been simulated by koo and kim 2004 in a two dimensional nwt and abbasnia et al 2015a in a three dimensional nwt different orders of boundary element method bem formulation have been widely employed in nwts to solve laplace equation in the eulerian frame a high order formulation of bem was proposed by abbasnia and ghiasi 2014c to model the fully nonlinear free surface evolution accurately several schemes of time integration have been used to update the fluctuating boundaries in nwts for instance the fourth order runge kutta method by koo and kim 2004 the fourth order adams bashforth moulton and the fifth order runge kutta gil methods by zhang et al 2006 the acceleration potential approaches which were compared by bandyk and beck 2011 have been used to compute the hydrodynamic loads on the bodies indeed the time derivative of the velocity potential on the body is obtained implicitly therefore the motion equations of the fluid and the body are solved instantaneously the acceleration potential formulation was firstly derived by vinje and brevig 1981 implicit body boundary condition approach was addressed by tanizawa 2000 to obtain the time derivative of the velocity potential on a freely floating body abbasnia and guedes soares 2017 developed an accurate methodology to compute the exact hydrodynamic loads on the floating structures in the time domain based on the implicit body boundary condition approach the different types of wave makers and wave absorbers sponge layers have been summarized by cointe 1990 and tanizawa 2000 the open water condition is retained using the wave maker and damping zones however the inflow boundary acts as a wave maker to generate the incident wave and the end wall acts as a sponge layer to diminish the wave reflection a submerged circular cylinder operating as a wave energy converter the so called bristol cylinder was studied analytically and experimentally by evans et al 1979 in this regard in one wave period the wave energy has been converted to the spring damper and the cylinder inertia and buoyancy powers simulation of the wave interaction with the submerged cylinder rotating about off centered axis has been conducted by lucas 2011 in the frequency domain linear wave theory was used by cruz and salter 2006 to simulate numerically a modified version of the edinburgh duck wave energy device and the results were compared with the experimental data the linear theory was also used by crowley et al 2014 to simulate the motions of a new submerged cylindrical wave energy converter with internal sloshing power take off which allowed to pitch freely about an axis below its center a prescribed large amplitude motion of a submerged circular cylinder and the free motion of the cylinder have been modeled by guerber et al 2012 in the time domain an analytical study of wave interaction with a wave energy converter in two modes has been conducted by heikkinen et al 2013 they used a horizontally orientated cylinder as a wave energy converter which can be positioned at different depths the oscillation of the cylinder in the horizontal and vertical directions is transformed into mechanical energy wave interaction with a submerged circular cylinder which rotating about off center axis freely as a novel wave energy converter was modeled in a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank by abbasnia et al 2015b in the time domain furthermore a viscous numerical wave tank has been developed by anbarsooz et al 2014 they evaluated the performance of a bristol cylinder for different wave steepness using a viscous model developed by mirzaii and passandideh fard 2012 a viscous numerical model was used by chen et al 2016 to simulate wave interaction with single and double horizontal floating cylinders perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation in this study the high order bem in association with the acceleration potential is implemented to develop a fully nonlinear two dimensional potential nwt for simulating the robust nonlinearities of a wave energy converter performance in the time domain to solve the fully nonlinear boundary value problem the boundary conditions should be specified on the exact boundary surfaces the normal flux of nonlinear wave velocity potential is applied on the upstream fixed wall which acts as a wave maker to reduce the wave reflection due to the presence of the downstream end wall and the objects two artificial sponge layers are deployed on the specific length of the exact free surface rear of the upstream end wall and behind of the downstream end wall hence open water condition is conserved meanwhile of the long time simulation the material node approach is chosen to implement the mixed eulerian lagrangian method in this regards the nodal points on the exact free surface are allowed to move with the fluid particles in the lagrangian frame kinematics of the free surface particles is computed in the eulerian manner the fourth order runge kutta time integration scheme is used to update the positions of free surface nodes the exact hydrodynamic pressure is achieved using bernoulli equation hence the time derivative of the velocity potential on the body is calculated implicitly using the acceleration potential to solve the acceleration potential field implicit body boundary condition scheme is used to assign the boundary value on the body surface in the primary study of wave interaction with a cylindrical wave energy converter carried out by abbasnia et al 2015b the same two dimensional numerical wave tank was used as well the convergence of the nwt was examined in the absence of the cylinder and then a second order stokes wave was chosen to interact with a cylindrical wave energy converter however the nwt was not verified with the prior studies in presence of a cylindrical wave energy converter and moreover the chosen weak nonlinear incident was not enough to show the capability of the nwt in the simulation of the robust free surface nonlinearities although motions of a bristol submerged cylinder performing as a wave energy converter in waves are modeled to verify the present numerical procedure in the present study firstly the wave absorption efficiencies for different incident waves are compared with the experiments and the prior numerical solutions to examine the accuracy of the present model time history of the absorbed power in two orthogonal directions of the global coordinate system are shown snapshots of the fully nonlinear free surface evolution for the different incident waves along the tank along the tank is presented time history of the cylinder movements for the different incident waves also is shown secondly the capability of the present fully nonlinear model is examined for simulating the robust nonlinearities due to wave interaction with the cylinder for the different boundary conditions hence for various submergence depths pitch angular velocity and total power of the cylinder are compared due to a nonlinear incident wave nonlinearity of free surface is studied on upstream and downstream of the cylinder for different off center distances pitch moment on the cylinder and its pitch displacement are shown fully nonlinear free surface evolution is illustrated for different off center differences also in addition the time history of the total power of the cylinder is depicted to assess the convergence of the present fully nonlinear model a robust nonlinear incident wave is chosen to interact with the cylindrical wave energy converter hence propagation of a fifth order stokes wave in absence of the wave energy converter is shown then time history of the excited pitch moment on the cylinder due to the incident wave is illustrated for a submergence depth and an off center axis to examine the convergence of the present model time history of wave elevation is also shown to evaluate the numerical stability of the present model for a robust steep wave 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 mathematical model the interaction of the nonlinear regular waves and a submerged horizontal cylinder rotating freely about the off center axis is simulated using nwt as shown in fig 1 the fixed coordinates system o x z lies on the still water level the o x z coordinate system is fixed on the rotation axis of a homogenous cylinder with radius a the moving coordinate system o x z is fixed on the geometric center of the cylinder the tank length is l the depth of tank is d and the submergence depth of the rotation axis is h the assumptions are the inviscid incompressible and homogeneous fluid and the irrotational flow hence the flow field ℜ t can be described by the potential theory the laplace equation as the governing equation is defined as 1 2 ϕ 0 in ℜ t the boundary conditions are applied to obtain the unique solution of the boundary value problem the fully nonlinear kinematics free surface boundary condition kfsbc and dynamics free surface boundary condition dfsbc are assigned on the exact free surface γ f as 2 η t ϕ z ϕ x η x kfsbc ϕ t g z 1 2 ϕ 2 dfsbc where η x t is the wave elevation measured from the calm free surface and g is the gravitational acceleration boundary value is specified on the fixed upstream end wall γ w as 3 ϕ n ϕ i w x where ϕ i w is the theoretical wave velocity potential and the unit normal vector n on the boundary is directed out of the fluid the impermeable condition is assigned to the downstream end wall γ d and bottom γ b as 4 ϕ n 0 the boundary condition applied to the moving cylinder body hull γ c is 5 ϕ n v c n where v c is the body velocity to solve the time domain boundary value problem the initial condition is defined as 6 η x t 0 0 ϕ x z t 0 0 the second green identity is used to solve laplace equation in the eulerian frame the boundary integral equation is derived as 7 c i ϕ i γ g ϕ n ϕ g n d γ where c i θ 2 π in which θ is the internal angle of the source point i on the boundary surface γ γ f γ w γ b γ d γ c of the computational domain the green function is defined as 8 g 1 2 π ln 1 r g n 1 2 π r n r 2 where r r x x 0 2 z z 0 2 represents the distance between the source point x z and the field point x 0 z 0 on the boundaries 2 2 time marching scheme the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel approach is chosen to characterize the fully nonlinear free surface evolution hence the solution of the laplace equation obtained in the eulerian frame is used to find the boundary values at each time step and the kinematics of collocation points on the exact free surface therefore the total time derivative on the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions is derived in the lagrangian frame as abbasnia and ghiasi 2014c 9 δ ϕ δ t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 δ ζ δ t ϕ on γ f where ζ is the coordinates of the collocation points x z on the exact free surface the free surface collocation points are allowed to move with the fluid particles on the free surface in the material node approach in the following the fourth order runge kutta time integration approach is employed to update the boundary conditions for the next time step 2 3 artificial damping zone two artificial sponge layers should be deployed at both ends of the wave tank to obtain the proper computational solutions as shown in fig 1 the wave energy absorption scheme is provided by adding an artificial damping term to the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions over the assigned length of the free surface two damping zones are defined adjacent to the wave maker boundary and end wall boundary the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions within the damping zones are addressed by cointe 1990 as 10 δ ϕ δ t g η 1 2 ϕ ϕ ν x ϕ ϕ e δ ζ δ t ϕ ν x ζ ζ e on γ f where the subscript e represents the reference configuration for the free surface the function ν x is the damping coefficient given as 11 ν x α ω k 2 π x x 0 2 x 0 x x 1 x 0 2 π β k the strength and length of the damping zone are adjusted by the dimensionless parameters α and β respectively the incident wave number is k 2 π λ λ is the wavelength ω 2 π t is the incident wave angular frequency and t is the wave period the terms ϕ e and ζ e x e z e are reference values when the reference values are set to calm water condition ϕ e 0 z e 0 the damping zone 2 is made which is used downstream of the numerical wave tank as a simple absorber if a propagating wave is used as a reference value this damping zone allows only this wave to pass through which is used upstream of the numerical wave tank damping zone 1 indeed the damping zones absorb the energy of the reflected and radiated waves due downstream end wall and motion of the wave energy converter respectively hence the damping zones conserve the open sea condition during the simulation 2 4 movement of the freely rotating cylinder and acceleration potential the hydrodynamic forces and momentum on the cylinder body due to the incident wave can be computed by integrating pressure p over the body surface γ c hence the pressure distribution over the cylinder body is obtained using the bernoulli equation as 12 p ρ ϕ t 1 2 ϕ ϕ g z the second term and third term on the right hand side of bernoulli s equation are calculated explicitly using the solution of velocity potential field whereas the first term is evaluated implicitly the time derivative of the velocity potential can be determined by computing the acceleration potential field the acceleration of fluid particle can be defined by the gradient of acceleration potential φ written as 13 a φ the acceleration is the total time derivative of the fluid velocity v and is derived as 14 a δ v δ t v t v v on the other hand v ϕ equation 14 can be reformulated as 15 a ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 therefore the acceleration potential is defined as 16 φ ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 it is transparent that the acceleration potential does not satisfy laplace equation 2 φ 0 due to the nonlinear term 1 2 ϕ 2 although φ is not solved directly and the solutions of the velocity potential field can be used to compute the nonlinear term explicitly whereas ϕ t satisfies laplace equation boundary integral equation is used to find the time derivative of the velocity potential on the cylinder body surface which is written as 17 c i ϕ i t γ g 2 ϕ n t ϕ t g n d γ the boundary values should be designated to achieve the unique solution hence the fully nonlinear dynamic free surface condition written as 18 ϕ t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 is specified on the exact free surface the boundary condition on the upstream end wall is given as 19 2 ϕ n t 2 ϕ i w x t on the bottom and downstream walls the boundary condition is specified as 20 2 ϕ n t 0 implicit body boundary conditions on the cylinder is assigned as 21 2 ϕ t n n μ 1 γ c ϕ t n d s q where 22 q n μ 1 γ c g z 1 2 ϕ 2 n d s f g q n 1 2 ϕ 2 and 23 q n ω c ω c r κ n ϕ ω c r 2 n 2 ω c ϕ ω c r in which r r x r z is position vector

momentums f g includes gravity thrust and mooring implicit body boundary condition is an integral equation which defines the relation between 2 ϕ t n and ϕ t on the body surface abbasnia and guedes soares 2017 conducted the discretization of the boundary integral equation to compute the time derivatives of the velocity potential on the boundary surfaces the hydrodynamic forces and momentum f f exerted on the body of the cylinder is computed by the solution of the time derivative of the velocity potential over the cylinder body as 25 f f γ c p n d s acceleration of the cylinder α b a x a y ω c is calculated as 26 μ α b f g f f and the kinematics of the cylinder is obtained to update the body boundary conditions at each time step generally the present model proceeds to trace the free surface and the cylinder body at each time based on the following procedure as i the velocity potential field is solved and kinematics of fluid particles is determined ii the boundary conditions for time derivatives of the velocity potential field is obtained using the velocity potential field iii the acceleration potential field is solved and the time derivative of the velocity potential on the body surface is determined iv hydrodynamics pressure on the cylinder is obtained using the solution of the acceleration potential field and the kinematics of the cylinder is computed v the moving boundaries and boundary values are updated using the kinematics of the cylinder from the fourth step and the fluid particles velocity from the first step to start the next time step 3 numerical formulation 3 1 discretization of boundary integral the linear elements are used to describe the inflow outflow bottom boundaries and the cylinder body γ 1 γ w γ d γ b γ c and the free surface boundary γ 2 γ f is defined by the curvilinear elements hence γ 1 is divided into n 1 elements and γ 2 is divided into n 2 high order elements and the boundary integral equation 7 is discretized as

2014b c abbasnia et al 2015a b for simulation of wave interaction with the fixed bodies and the freely floating bodies in this study accuracy and convergence of the numerical wave tank are examined to predict the performance of a wave energy converter for the robust nonlinear boundary conditions hence wave interaction of a submerged circular cylinder bristol cylinder as a wave energy converter wec is simulated firstly in the nwt to validate the present numerical solution with the experimental data and the other numerical solutions for different incident nonlinear waves the accuracy of the present numerical procedure is examined also secondly free rotation of a submerged circular cylinder about the off centered axis is modeled to assess the convergence of present fully nonlinear model for different boundary conditions 4 1 motion of a submerged circular cylinder a submerged homogeneous circular cylinder with 500 k g m 3 density is considered as a wave energy converter introduced by davis 1990 as shown in fig 2 the radius of the cylinder is 0 05 m water depth is 0 35 m and submergence depth of the cylinder is set to h a 4 0 the second order stokes incident waves tabulated in table 1 are considered to interact with the wec total velocity potential of the incident wave is formulated as 40 ϕ i w ϕ i w 1 ϕ i w 2 where the first order part of the velocity potential is defined as 41 ϕ i w 1 g a ω cosh k d z cosh k d sin k x ω t and the second order part is given as 42 ϕ i w 2 3 8 a 2 ω cosh 2 k z d sinh 4 k d sin 2 k x ω t in which a is the amplitude of the incident wave the characteristics and dimensions of the nwt are adjusted to the davis experimental setup the tank length l is 8 0 m the length of the damping zone 1 and the damping zone 2 is 0 25 m and 1 0 m respectively and α is unity for both damping zones the longitudinal distance of center of cylinder from inlet wall l c is 4 0 m the spring coefficient of the cylinder in each direction is k x k y 826 n m and the damping coefficients of the cylinder dampers in the both directions are c x c y 20 n s m linear elements are used to discretize the input boundary bottom end wall boundary and the submerged circular cylinder body the curvilinear elements are applied to describe the free surface the size of the element is d 40 on the inflow and outflow boundaries on the bottom the element size is equal to λ 10 the length of the free surface element is λ 30 the body surface is divided radially into the segment of π 40 and the time step size is t 60 the simulation is done by a laptop core i7 cpu 2 50 ghz and 8 00 gb ram with 64 bit operating system the computer code is provided in fortran intel parallel studio xe for each case study 700 iterations have been passed and it takes time about 2 h the absorption efficiency by the cylinder in a wave period is used for comparison which is determined as 43 η 1 t t t t f e x c v c d t 1 2 γ a 2 c g 100 f e x c is the exciting wave force and γ ρ

n g f d a m p e r f b o u y a n c y by substituting equation 45 into equation 43 the mean power of spring force the buoyancy and inertia force are eliminated due to the periodic motion of the cylinder and equation 43 is derived as 46 η 1 t t t t f d a m p e r v c d t 1 2 γ a 2 c g 100 the efficiencies of total power absorption are compared with the analytical solution by evans et al 1979 davis experimental data and numerical calculations and numerical results of anbarsooz et al 2014 in fig 3 it shows that linear theory has a substantial discrepancy between the experimental data and the analytical solutions whereas davis was used the linear theory for numerical solution the prediction of the maximum efficiency frequency is lower than the experimental determination the maximum efficiency is occurred on about 6 9115 rad s however the nonlinear nwt solution prediction is close to the experimental data for both wave amplitudes tracking of the experimental data shows that the maximum efficiency frequency happened on the 8 9 rad s range for the both wave amplitudes such as approximated by the nwt solutions also for 2 a 3 10 c m the nwt solution and the experimental data have been in good agreements on the 5 7 rad s range the present model has better agreement with the absorption efficiency amplitude of the experimental data for ω 8 in fig 3b against the linear model where the incident wave is steeper viscous effect is the significant reason which make the inconsistency between the experimental data and the present model solutions therefore the differences between the solutions amplify for 8 ω 9 in fig 3b in addition there is inconsistency between the present model and the linear model for ω 9 in both wave amplitude which raise from the considered type of incident wave applied on the wave maker despite second order stokes wave is chosen to model the incident wave in the present model the linear model neglect the nonlinear effects of the steeper incident wave the time series of the absorbed power due to the motion of the cylinder in x and y directions for wave 7 and 2 a 3 10 c m is illustrated in fig 4 to show the energy absorption process in detail it shows that the absorbed power in the x direction is greater than the absorbed power in z direction and the phase difference between them is π it is repeated for other incident wave and different wave steepness there is an apparent discrepancy between the maximum absorbed powers in z direction for a wave period the asymmetric motion of the cylinder in z direction due to different boundary conditions on the free surface and bottom surfaces makes it transparent the sum of the absorbed power in both orthogonal directions is the total absorbed power the snapshots of the free surface elevation are shown in fig 5 due to waves 1 5 and 9 of table 1 with different wave amplitudes the percentage of wave energy absorbed by the cylinder can be found by the decrement of the wave height on the downstream of the wec rather than the wave height of the upstream of the wec also the nonlinear free surface evolution due to the presence of the wec is propagated along the tank by the nwt as shown manifestly in wave 5 for 2 a 3 10 c m the time history of the wec displacement for waves 1 5 and 9 of table 1 with different wave amplitudes is depicted in fig 6 it is shown that the range of movement of the cylinder for wave 5 is larger than the other frequencies whereas the free surface boundary conditions and the bottom boundary condition are not same the magnitude of the cylinder movements for z 0 is greater than its magnitude for z 0 it seems that the rigid bottom boundary condition makes the back pressure to avoid the cylinder motion in z direction 4 2 performance of the cylinder rotating about off centric axis as a wec a submerged cylinder rotating freely about the off centered axis is subjected to the nonlinear incident wave in a numerical wave tank with length 6 49 m and depth 0 6 m the cylinder with radius a 5 c m acts as a wec and its performance is evaluated for the different submergence depths and the off center distances wave no 5 of table 1 with 2 a 3 10 c m is chosen to interact with the wec to retain the open water condition two sponge layers are set on both sides of the tank the assigned lengths of the upstream and downstream sponge layers are λ and 2 λ respectively the time history of the pitch angular velocity and the total power of the cylinder are depicted for two submergence depths h a 3 0 4 0 on fig 7 and fig 8 the cylinder is in stable equilibrium at zero time step and off center distance is o o 0 02 m the time step size and the mesh size is the same of the previous case study it is recognized that the amplitude of the pitch angular velocity is increased slightly when the submergence depth is decreased also the same manner as shown by comparing the total power of cylinder for different the submerged depths two numerical wave probes are set on the upstream and downstream of the cylinder at 2 λ 0 and 3 λ 0 the time histories of wave elevation recorded by both wave probes are compared for different submergence depths in fig 9 and fig 10 these are shown that the wave heights on both sides of the cylinder are shrinking when the submergence depths are increased as anticipated intuitively the free surface is more influenced by decreasing the submergence depths the incident wave profile is affected by waves due to radiation reflection and transmission also the nonlinearity of free surface is amplified when the submergence depth is decreased particularly in the downstream zone the present model predicts qualitatively the effects of the position of the body on the fully nonlinear free surface as shown in fig 10 the off center distance of the cylinder is increased o o 0 04 m for h a 4 0 the exerted pitch moment on the cylinder is compared with the o o 0 02 m case study in fig 11 it shows that the amplitude of pitch moment is amplified by increasing the off center distance also the nonlinearity of pitch moment is magnified for larger off center distance it is recognized that the fully nonlinear motion equation of the cylinder is solved implicitly with the motion equation of flow fluid and the acceleration potential method is implemented properly also there are phase differences due to augmenting of the exciting pitch moment on the cylinder and the restoring buoyant moment at the same time furthermore the pitch motion of the cylinder for two off center distances is illustrated in fig 12 the angular interval of the pitch motion is magnified by increasing the off center distance for 5 s t 14 s it is shrinking for t 14 s to reach the steady time periodic state snapshots of free surface evolution are shown at t t 22 5 in fig 13 it shows that the sponge layers on the upstream and downstream of the cylinder perform properly to retain the open water condition also the nonlinearity of the free surface evolution becomes stronger when the off center distance is increased and the present model is successful to model the fully nonlinear free surface evolution due to different off center distances and the total power of the cylinder for both cases studies have been determined in fig 14 the simulation has been run for t 45 s to achieve the steady time periodic state it shows that the steady time periodic state is achieved for t 28 s however total power for larger off center distance is smaller than the power of the smaller off center for the steady time periodic state fifth order stokes wave presented by fenton 1985 is chosen as the robust nonlinear incident wave to evaluate the convergence of the present model hence the fully developed wave propagation of the wave no 5 of table 1 with 2 a 9 30 c m is shown fig 15 the wave steepness is close to the breaking criteria and a numerical wave probe is employed at the middle of the tank to record wave elevation the numerical result is compared with the analytical solution and it shows that robust nonlinearity of the free surface is simulated accurately and the numerical procedure has the numerical stability the excited pitch moment on the cylinder due to the incident wave is shown in fig 16 for h a 4 0 and o o 0 02 m in addition time history of wave elevation recorded using the wave probe is shown in fig 17 it shows that the present numerical procedure is converged and the numerical stability is retained for the robust steep waves 5 conclusion convergence and accuracy of a developed two dimensional nwt are examined to simulate the fully nonlinear interaction of the wave energy converter with the robust nonlinear wave in this paper high order boundary element method combined mel method was implemented to develop the numerical wave tank to update the fully nonlinear free surface boundary condition material node approach was applied and fourth order runge kutta time integration scheme was employed for time stepping the exact boundary conditions were applied to solve the time domain boundary value problem two artificial damping zones sponge layer are deployed at both ends of the tank to retain open water condition perturbation sources were embedded on the inflow boundary to provide artificial wave generator to find kinematics of the cylinder accurately acceleration potential was employed to solve acceleration potential field implicit body boundary condition was applied the motion of a bristol cylinder was modeled for different wave steepness to validate the numerical procedure the wave absorption efficiency for the different wave frequencies and the wave amplitudes was compared with the experiments and the prior numerical solutions it showed that the present numerical wave tank was converged to compute the dynamics of the bristol cylinder for the different steepness of the incident waves it shows that the maximum efficiency frequency of the present numerical solutions occurred close to experimental maximum frequency the absorbed power in both directions of the fixed coordinate system was shown to explain the energy absorption process the power absorbed in the x direction has been slightly greater than the absorbed power in the z direction also this was confirmed using comparing the cylinder dynamics in both directions snapshots of the nonlinear wave elevation for different incident waves along the tank were shown nonlinearity of the free surface evolution was modeled and propagated along the tank due to the presence of the cylinder the time history of the cylinder motion for different incident waves also was shown whereas the free surface boundary conditions and the bottom boundary condition were not same the magnitude of the cylinder movements was not symmetric in z direction dynamics of the cylinder rotating freely about off centered axis was simulated as a wave energy converter in the present numerical wave tank the cylinder was subjected to the nonlinear waves in stable equilibrium performance of the cylinder was modeled for the different submergence depths and the different off center distances to examine the convergence of the present nwt for different body boundary conditions the pitch angular velocity of the cylinder was compared for two submergence depths also the total power of the cylinder was illustrated for both case studies these were shown that the amplitude of pitch velocity and the maximum total power is increased slightly when the submergence depths is decreased the intensity of free surface nonlinearity was shown intuitively on upstream and downstream of the cylinder this was shown that the numerical wave tank was modeled qualitatively the nonlinear free surface propagation furthermore the pitch moment on the cylinder and its pitch displacement were compared for different off center distances these have shown that the amplitudes of pitch moment and the pitch displacement were magnified by increasing the off center distances nonlinear free surface evolution for both case studies is compared it has shown that the effect of the off center distance on the nonlinearity of the free surface is predicted using the present nwt what was expected the time history of the cylinder total power for different off center distances was shown at steady time periodic state accordingly the maximum total power was intensified for decreasing the off center distances at the steady time periodic state robust nonlinear incident wave was chosen to interact the cylinder to evaluate the numerical stability of the present numerical procedure hence a fifth order stokes wave was propagated within the nwt in absence of the cylinder it shows that the nonlinear free surface was simulated accurately the fully nonlinear interaction of the incident wave and the cylinder was simulated properly and the time history of pitch moment was shown that the nwt is converged and the numerical stability was conserved for steep waves which shown in time history of wave elevation at the middle of the tank acknowledgements this work was performed within the strategic research plan of

for different submergence depths off center distances and a robust nonlinear incident wave keywords wave energy converter mixed eulerian lagrangian acceleration potential numerical wave tank oscillating cylinder 1 introduction a broad range of the wave body interaction problem has been solved using numerical wave tanks nwt in the past two decades the various approaches have been developed for applying the free surface boundary conditions and body boundary condition the free surface boundary conditions have been linearized to simulate the wave body interaction in the time and the frequency domain by nakos et al 1993 despite the intricate implementation of the perturbation theory it has been used in the weakly nonlinear wave body interaction problems linear and second order interaction of wave and floating bodies were simulated by kim et al 1998 using the diffraction theory and the perturbation theory in addition the second order interaction of wave ocean current and the floating body was studied by liu and teng 2010 and bai and teng 2013 the fully nonlinear free surface problems have been solved using mixed eulerian lagrangian mel method proposed by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 in this regards the free surface boundary values have been calculated in the eulerian frame at each time step and the boundary conditions were updated in the lagrangian frame the fully nonlinear free surface flow due to wave overturning on the arbitrary seabed was modeled using an nwt by grilli et al 2001 moreover the fully nonlinear interaction of waves and current interaction was simulated by ryu et al 2003 transmission and propagation of linear and nonlinear irregular waves have been studied also by ning and teng 2007 tang and huang 2008 ning et al 2009 and abbasnia and ghiasi 2014a wave interaction with an array of vertical and horizontal fixed cylinders was studied by wang and wu 2007 and abbasnia and ghiasi 2014b respectively interaction of nonlinear waves and freely floating bodies has been simulated by koo and kim 2004 in a two dimensional nwt and abbasnia et al 2015a in a three dimensional nwt different orders of boundary element method bem formulation have been widely employed in nwts to solve laplace equation in the eulerian frame a high order formulation of bem was proposed by abbasnia and ghiasi 2014c to model the fully nonlinear free surface evolution accurately several schemes of time integration have been used to update the fluctuating boundaries in nwts for instance the fourth order runge kutta method by koo and kim 2004 the fourth order adams bashforth moulton and the fifth order runge kutta gil methods by zhang et al 2006 the acceleration potential approaches which were compared by bandyk and beck 2011 have been used to compute the hydrodynamic loads on the bodies indeed the time derivative of the velocity potential on the body is obtained implicitly therefore the motion equations of the fluid and the body are solved instantaneously the acceleration potential formulation was firstly derived by vinje and brevig 1981 implicit body boundary condition approach was addressed by tanizawa 2000 to obtain the time derivative of the velocity potential on a freely floating body abbasnia and guedes soares 2017 developed an accurate methodology to compute the exact hydrodynamic loads on the floating structures in the time domain based on the implicit body boundary condition approach the different types of wave makers and wave absorbers sponge layers have been summarized by cointe 1990 and tanizawa 2000 the open water condition is retained using the wave maker and damping zones however the inflow boundary acts as a wave maker to generate the incident wave and the end wall acts as a sponge layer to diminish the wave reflection a submerged circular cylinder operating as a wave energy converter the so called bristol cylinder was studied analytically and experimentally by evans et al 1979 in this regard in one wave period the wave energy has been converted to the spring damper and the cylinder inertia and buoyancy powers simulation of the wave interaction with the submerged cylinder rotating about off centered axis has been conducted by lucas 2011 in the frequency domain linear wave theory was used by cruz and salter 2006 to simulate numerically a modified version of the edinburgh duck wave energy device and the results were compared with the experimental data the linear theory was also used by crowley et al 2014 to simulate the motions of a new submerged cylindrical wave energy converter with internal sloshing power take off which allowed to pitch freely about an axis below its center a prescribed large amplitude motion of a submerged circular cylinder and the free motion of the cylinder have been modeled by guerber et al 2012 in the time domain an analytical study of wave interaction with a wave energy converter in two modes has been conducted by heikkinen et al 2013 they used a horizontally orientated cylinder as a wave energy converter which can be positioned at different depths the oscillation of the cylinder in the horizontal and vertical directions is transformed into mechanical energy wave interaction with a submerged circular cylinder which rotating about off center axis freely as a novel wave energy converter was modeled in a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank by abbasnia et al 2015b in the time domain furthermore a viscous numerical wave tank has been developed by anbarsooz et al 2014 they evaluated the performance of a bristol cylinder for different wave steepness using a viscous model developed by mirzaii and passandideh fard 2012 a viscous numerical model was used by chen et al 2016 to simulate wave interaction with single and double horizontal floating cylinders perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation in this study the high order bem in association with the acceleration potential is implemented to develop a fully nonlinear two dimensional potential nwt for simulating the robust nonlinearities of a wave energy converter performance in the time domain to solve the fully nonlinear boundary value problem the boundary conditions should be specified on the exact boundary surfaces the normal flux of nonlinear wave velocity potential is applied on the upstream fixed wall which acts as a wave maker to reduce the wave reflection due to the presence of the downstream end wall and the objects two artificial sponge layers are deployed on the specific length of the exact free surface rear of the upstream end wall and behind of the downstream end wall hence open water condition is conserved meanwhile of the long time simulation the material node approach is chosen to implement the mixed eulerian lagrangian method in this regards the nodal points on the exact free surface are allowed to move with the fluid particles in the lagrangian frame kinematics of the free surface particles is computed in the eulerian manner the fourth order runge kutta time integration scheme is used to update the positions of free surface nodes the exact hydrodynamic pressure is achieved using bernoulli equation hence the time derivative of the velocity potential on the body is calculated implicitly using the acceleration potential to solve the acceleration potential field implicit body boundary condition scheme is used to assign the boundary value on the body surface in the primary study of wave interaction with a cylindrical wave energy converter carried out by abbasnia et al 2015b the same two dimensional numerical wave tank was used as well the convergence of the nwt was examined in the absence of the cylinder and then a second order stokes wave was chosen to interact with a cylindrical wave energy converter however the nwt was not verified with the prior studies in presence of a cylindrical wave energy converter and moreover the chosen weak nonlinear incident was not enough to show the capability of the nwt in the simulation of the robust free surface nonlinearities although motions of a bristol submerged cylinder performing as a wave energy converter in waves are modeled to verify the present numerical procedure in the present study firstly the wave absorption efficiencies for different incident waves are compared with the experiments and the prior numerical solutions to examine the accuracy of the present model time history of the absorbed power in two orthogonal directions of the global coordinate system are shown snapshots of the fully nonlinear free surface evolution for the different incident waves along the tank along the tank is presented time history of the cylinder movements for the different incident waves also is shown secondly the capability of the present fully nonlinear model is examined for simulating the robust nonlinearities due to wave interaction with the cylinder for the different boundary conditions hence for various submergence depths pitch angular velocity and total power of the cylinder are compared due to a nonlinear incident wave nonlinearity of free surface is studied on upstream and downstream of the cylinder for different off center distances pitch moment on the cylinder and its pitch displacement are shown fully nonlinear free surface evolution is illustrated for different off center differences also in addition the time history of the total power of the cylinder is depicted to assess the convergence of the present fully nonlinear model a robust nonlinear incident wave is chosen to interact with the cylindrical wave energy converter hence propagation of a fifth order stokes wave in absence of the wave energy converter is shown then time history of the excited pitch moment on the cylinder due to the incident wave is illustrated for a submergence depth and an off center axis to examine the convergence of the present model time history of wave elevation is also shown to evaluate the numerical stability of the present model for a robust steep wave 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 mathematical model the interaction of the nonlinear regular waves and a submerged horizontal cylinder rotating freely about the off center axis is simulated using nwt as shown in fig 1 the fixed coordinates system o x z lies on the still water level the o x z coordinate system is fixed on the rotation axis of a homogenous cylinder with radius a the moving coordinate system o x z is fixed on the geometric center of the cylinder the tank length is l the depth of tank is d and the submergence depth of the rotation axis is h the assumptions are the inviscid incompressible and homogeneous fluid and the irrotational flow hence the flow field ℜ t can be described by the potential theory the laplace equation as the governing equation is defined as 1 2 ϕ 0 in ℜ t the boundary conditions are applied to obtain the unique solution of the boundary value problem the fully nonlinear kinematics free surface boundary condition kfsbc and dynamics free surface boundary condition dfsbc are assigned on the exact free surface γ f as 2 η t ϕ z ϕ x η x kfsbc ϕ t g z 1 2 ϕ 2 dfsbc where η x t is the wave elevation measured from the calm free surface and g is the gravitational acceleration boundary value is specified on the fixed upstream end wall γ w as 3 ϕ n ϕ i w x where ϕ i w is the theoretical wave velocity potential and the unit normal vector n on the boundary is directed out of the fluid the impermeable condition is assigned to the downstream end wall γ d and bottom γ b as 4 ϕ n 0 the boundary condition applied to the moving cylinder body hull γ c is 5 ϕ n v c n where v c is the body velocity to solve the time domain boundary value problem the initial condition is defined as 6 η x t 0 0 ϕ x z t 0 0 the second green identity is used to solve laplace equation in the eulerian frame the boundary integral equation is derived as 7 c i ϕ i γ g ϕ n ϕ g n d γ where c i θ 2 π in which θ is the internal angle of the source point i on the boundary surface γ γ f γ w γ b γ d γ c of the computational domain the green function is defined as 8 g 1 2 π ln 1 r g n 1 2 π r n r 2 where r r x x 0 2 z z 0 2 represents the distance between the source point x z and the field point x 0 z 0 on the boundaries 2 2 time marching scheme the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel approach is chosen to characterize the fully nonlinear free surface evolution hence the solution of the laplace equation obtained in the eulerian frame is used to find the boundary values at each time step and the kinematics of collocation points on the exact free surface therefore the total time derivative on the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions is derived in the lagrangian frame as abbasnia and ghiasi 2014c 9 δ ϕ δ t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 δ ζ δ t ϕ on γ f where ζ is the coordinates of the collocation points x z on the exact free surface the free surface collocation points are allowed to move with the fluid particles on the free surface in the material node approach in the following the fourth order runge kutta time integration approach is employed to update the boundary conditions for the next time step 2 3 artificial damping zone two artificial sponge layers should be deployed at both ends of the wave tank to obtain the proper computational solutions as shown in fig 1 the wave energy absorption scheme is provided by adding an artificial damping term to the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions over the assigned length of the free surface two damping zones are defined adjacent to the wave maker boundary and end wall boundary the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions within the damping zones are addressed by cointe 1990 as 10 δ ϕ δ t g η 1 2 ϕ ϕ ν x ϕ ϕ e δ ζ δ t ϕ ν x ζ ζ e on γ f where the subscript e represents the reference configuration for the free surface the function ν x is the damping coefficient given as 11 ν x α ω k 2 π x x 0 2 x 0 x x 1 x 0 2 π β k the strength and length of the damping zone are adjusted by the dimensionless parameters α and β respectively the incident wave number is k 2 π λ λ is the wavelength ω 2 π t is the incident wave angular frequency and t is the wave period the terms ϕ e and ζ e x e z e are reference values when the reference values are set to calm water condition ϕ e 0 z e 0 the damping zone 2 is made which is used downstream of the numerical wave tank as a simple absorber if a propagating wave is used as a reference value this damping zone allows only this wave to pass through which is used upstream of the numerical wave tank damping zone 1 indeed the damping zones absorb the energy of the reflected and radiated waves due downstream end wall and motion of the wave energy converter respectively hence the damping zones conserve the open sea condition during the simulation 2 4 movement of the freely rotating cylinder and acceleration potential the hydrodynamic forces and momentum on the cylinder body due to the incident wave can be computed by integrating pressure p over the body surface γ c hence the pressure distribution over the cylinder body is obtained using the bernoulli equation as 12 p ρ ϕ t 1 2 ϕ ϕ g z the second term and third term on the right hand side of bernoulli s equation are calculated explicitly using the solution of velocity potential field whereas the first term is evaluated implicitly the time derivative of the velocity potential can be determined by computing the acceleration potential field the acceleration of fluid particle can be defined by the gradient of acceleration potential φ written as 13 a φ the acceleration is the total time derivative of the fluid velocity v and is derived as 14 a δ v δ t v t v v on the other hand v ϕ equation 14 can be reformulated as 15 a ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 therefore the acceleration potential is defined as 16 φ ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 it is transparent that the acceleration potential does not satisfy laplace equation 2 φ 0 due to the nonlinear term 1 2 ϕ 2 although φ is not solved directly and the solutions of the velocity potential field can be used to compute the nonlinear term explicitly whereas ϕ t satisfies laplace equation boundary integral equation is used to find the time derivative of the velocity potential on the cylinder body surface which is written as 17 c i ϕ i t γ g 2 ϕ n t ϕ t g n d γ the boundary values should be designated to achieve the unique solution hence the fully nonlinear dynamic free surface condition written as 18 ϕ t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 is specified on the exact free surface the boundary condition on the upstream end wall is given as 19 2 ϕ n t 2 ϕ i w x t on the bottom and downstream walls the boundary condition is specified as 20 2 ϕ n t 0 implicit body boundary conditions on the cylinder is assigned as 21 2 ϕ t n n μ 1 γ c ϕ t n d s q where 22 q n μ 1 γ c g z 1 2 ϕ 2 n d s f g q n 1 2 ϕ 2 and 23 q n ω c ω c r κ n ϕ ω c r 2 n 2 ω c ϕ ω c r in which r r x r z is position vector

achieved in the same manner as shown in equation 30 and equation 33 4 numerical solutions and results applications of the numerical wave tank have been validated in prior studies abbasnia and ghiasi 2014b c abbasnia et al 2015a b for simulation of wave interaction with the fixed bodies and the freely floating bodies in this study accuracy and convergence of the numerical wave tank are examined to predict the performance of a wave energy converter for the robust nonlinear boundary conditions hence wave interaction of a submerged circular cylinder bristol cylinder as a wave energy converter wec is simulated firstly in the nwt to validate the present numerical solution with the experimental data and the other numerical solutions for different incident nonlinear waves the accuracy of the present numerical procedure is examined also secondly free rotation of a submerged circular cylinder about the off centered axis is modeled to assess the convergence of present fully nonlinear model for different boundary conditions 4 1 motion of a submerged circular cylinder a submerged homogeneous circular cylinder with 500 k g m 3 density is considered as a wave energy converter introduced by davis 1990 as shown in fig 2 the radius of the cylinder is 0 05 m water depth is 0 35 m and submergence depth of the cylinder is set to h a 4 0 the second order stokes incident waves tabulated in table 1 are considered to interact with the wec total velocity potential of the incident wave is formulated as 40 ϕ i w ϕ i w 1 ϕ i w 2 where the first order part of the velocity potential is defined as 41 ϕ i w 1 g a ω cosh k d z cosh k d sin k x ω t and the second order part is given as 42 ϕ i w 2 3 8 a 2 ω cosh 2 k z d sinh 4 k d sin 2 k x ω t in which a is the amplitude of the incident wave the characteristics and dimensions of the nwt are adjusted to the davis experimental setup the tank length l is 8 0 m the length of the damping zone 1 and the damping zone 2 is 0 25 m and 1 0 m respectively and α is unity for both damping zones the longitudinal distance of center of cylinder from inlet wall l c is 4 0 m the spring coefficient of the cylinder in each direction is k x k y 826 n m and the damping coefficients of the cylinder dampers in the both directions are c x c y 20 n s m linear elements are used to discretize the input boundary bottom end wall boundary and the submerged circular cylinder body the curvilinear elements are applied to describe the free surface the size of the element is d 40 on the inflow and outflow boundaries on the bottom the element size is equal to λ 10 the length of the free surface element is λ 30 the body surface is divided radially into the segment of π 40 and the time step size is t 60 the simulation is done by a laptop core i7 cpu 2 50 ghz and 8 00 gb ram with 64 bit operating system the computer code is provided in fortran intel parallel studio xe for each case study 700 iterations have been passed and it takes time about 2 h the absorption efficiency by the cylinder in a wave period is used for comparison which is determined as 43 η 1 t t t t f e x c v c d t 1 2 γ a 2 c g 100 f e x c is the exciting wave force and γ ρ

n g f d a m p e r f b o u y a n c y by substituting equation 45 into equation 43 the mean power of spring force the buoyancy and inertia force are eliminated due to the periodic motion of the cylinder and equation 43 is derived as 46 η 1 t t t t f d a m p e r v c d t 1 2 γ a 2 c g 100 the efficiencies of total power absorption are compared with the analytical solution by evans et al 1979 davis experimental data and numerical calculations and numerical results of anbarsooz et al 2014 in fig 3 it shows that linear theory has a substantial discrepancy between the experimental data and the analytical solutions whereas davis was used the linear theory for numerical solution the prediction of the maximum efficiency frequency is lower than the experimental determination the maximum efficiency is occurred on about 6 9115 rad s however the nonlinear nwt solution prediction is close to the experimental data for both wave amplitudes tracking of the experimental data shows that the maximum efficiency frequency happened on the 8 9 rad s range for the both wave amplitudes such as approximated by the nwt solutions also for 2 a 3 10 c m the nwt solution and the experimental data have been in good agreements on the 5 7 rad s range the present model has better agreement with the absorption efficiency amplitude of the experimental data for ω 8 in fig 3b against the linear model where the incident wave is steeper viscous effect is the significant reason which make the inconsistency between the experimental data and the present model solutions therefore the differences between the solutions amplify for 8 ω 9 in fig 3b in addition there is inconsistency between the present model and the linear model for ω 9 in both wave amplitude which raise from the considered type of incident wave applied on the wave maker despite second order stokes wave is chosen to model the incident wave in the present model the linear model neglect the nonlinear effects of the steeper incident wave the time series of the absorbed power due to the motion of the cylinder in x and y directions for wave 7 and 2 a 3 10 c m is illustrated in fig 4 to show the energy absorption process in detail it shows that the absorbed power in the x direction is greater than the absorbed power in z direction and the phase difference between them is π it is repeated for other incident wave and different wave steepness there is an apparent discrepancy between the maximum absorbed powers in z direction for a wave period the asymmetric motion of the cylinder in z direction due to different boundary conditions on the free surface and bottom surfaces makes it transparent the sum of the absorbed power in both orthogonal directions is the total absorbed power the snapshots of the free surface elevation are shown in fig 5 due to waves 1 5 and 9 of table 1 with different wave amplitudes the percentage of wave energy absorbed by the cylinder can be found by the decrement of the wave height on the downstream of the wec rather than the wave height of the upstream of the wec also the nonlinear free surface evolution due to the presence of the wec is propagated along the tank by the nwt as shown manifestly in wave 5 for 2 a 3 10 c m the time history of the wec displacement for waves 1 5 and 9 of table 1 with different wave amplitudes is depicted in fig 6 it is shown that the range of movement of the cylinder for wave 5 is larger than the other frequencies whereas the free surface boundary conditions and the bottom boundary condition are not same the magnitude of the cylinder movements for z 0 is greater than its magnitude for z 0 it seems that the rigid bottom boundary condition makes the back pressure to avoid the cylinder motion in z direction 4 2 performance of the cylinder rotating about off centric axis as a wec a submerged cylinder rotating freely about the off centered axis is subjected to the nonlinear incident wave in a numerical wave tank with length 6 49 m and depth 0 6 m the cylinder with radius a 5 c m acts as a wec and its performance is evaluated for the different submergence depths and the off center distances wave no 5 of table 1 with 2 a 3 10 c m is chosen to interact with the wec to retain the open water condition two sponge layers are set on both sides of the tank the assigned lengths of the upstream and downstream sponge layers are λ and 2 λ respectively the time history of the pitch angular velocity and the total power of the cylinder are depicted for two submergence depths h a 3 0 4 0 on fig 7 and fig 8 the cylinder is in stable equilibrium at zero time step and off center distance is o o 0 02 m the time step size and the mesh size is the same of the previous case study it is recognized that the amplitude of the pitch angular velocity is increased slightly when the submergence depth is decreased also the same manner as shown by comparing the total power of cylinder for different the submerged depths two numerical wave probes are set on the upstream and downstream of the cylinder at 2 λ 0 and 3 λ 0 the time histories of wave elevation recorded by both wave probes are compared for different submergence depths in fig 9 and fig 10 these are shown that the wave heights on both sides of the cylinder are shrinking when the submergence depths are increased as anticipated intuitively the free surface is more influenced by decreasing the submergence depths the incident wave profile is affected by waves due to radiation reflection and transmission also the nonlinearity of free surface is amplified when the submergence depth is decreased particularly in the downstream zone the present model predicts qualitatively the effects of the position of the body on the fully nonlinear free surface as shown in fig 10 the off center distance of the cylinder is increased o o 0 04 m for h a 4 0 the exerted pitch moment on the cylinder is compared with the o o 0 02 m case study in fig 11 it shows that the amplitude of pitch moment is amplified by increasing the off center distance also the nonlinearity of pitch moment is magnified for larger off center distance it is recognized that the fully nonlinear motion equation of the cylinder is solved implicitly with the motion equation of flow fluid and the acceleration potential method is implemented properly also there are phase differences due to augmenting of the exciting pitch moment on the cylinder and the restoring buoyant moment at the same time furthermore the pitch motion of the cylinder for two off center distances is illustrated in fig 12 the angular interval of the pitch motion is magnified by increasing the off center distance for 5 s t 14 s it is shrinking for t 14 s to reach the steady time periodic state snapshots of free surface evolution are shown at t t 22 5 in fig 13 it shows that the sponge layers on the upstream and downstream of the cylinder perform properly to retain the open water condition also the nonlinearity of the free surface evolution becomes stronger when the off center distance is increased and the present model is successful to model the fully nonlinear free surface evolution due to different off center distances and the total power of the cylinder for both cases studies have been determined in fig 14 the simulation has been run for t 45 s to achieve the steady time periodic state it shows that the steady time periodic state is achieved for t 28 s however total power for larger off center distance is smaller than the power of the smaller off center for the steady time periodic state fifth order stokes wave presented by fenton 1985 is chosen as the robust nonlinear incident wave to evaluate the convergence of the present model hence the fully developed wave propagation of the wave no 5 of table 1 with 2 a 9 30 c m is shown fig 15 the wave steepness is close to the breaking criteria and a numerical wave probe is employed at the middle of the tank to record wave elevation the numerical result is compared with the analytical solution and it shows that robust nonlinearity of the free surface is simulated accurately and the numerical procedure has the numerical stability the excited pitch moment on the cylinder due to the incident wave is shown in fig 16 for h a 4 0 and o o 0 02 m in addition time history of wave elevation recorded using the wave probe is shown in fig 17 it shows that the present numerical procedure is converged and the numerical stability is retained for the robust steep waves 5 conclusion convergence and accuracy of a developed two dimensional nwt are examined to simulate the fully nonlinear interaction of the wave energy converter with the robust nonlinear wave in this paper high order boundary element method combined mel method was implemented to develop the numerical wave tank to update the fully nonlinear free surface boundary condition material node approach was applied and fourth order runge kutta time integration scheme was employed for time stepping the exact boundary conditions were applied to solve the time domain boundary value problem two artificial damping zones sponge layer are deployed at both ends of the tank to retain open water condition perturbation sources were embedded on the inflow boundary to provide artificial wave generator to find kinematics of the cylinder accurately acceleration potential was employed to solve acceleration potential field implicit body boundary condition was applied the motion of a bristol cylinder was modeled for different wave steepness to validate the numerical procedure the wave absorption efficiency for the different wave frequencies and the wave amplitudes was compared with the experiments and the prior numerical solutions it showed that the present numerical wave tank was converged to compute the dynamics of the bristol cylinder for the different steepness of the incident waves it shows that the maximum efficiency frequency of the present numerical solutions occurred close to experimental maximum frequency the absorbed power in both directions of the fixed coordinate system was shown to explain the energy absorption process the power absorbed in the x direction has been slightly greater than the absorbed power in the z direction also this was confirmed using comparing the cylinder dynamics in both directions snapshots of the nonlinear wave elevation for different incident waves along the tank were shown nonlinearity of the free surface evolution was modeled and propagated along the tank due to the presence of the cylinder the time history of the cylinder motion for different incident waves also was shown whereas the free surface boundary conditions and the bottom boundary condition were not same the magnitude of the cylinder movements was not symmetric in z direction dynamics of the cylinder rotating freely about off centered axis was simulated as a wave energy converter in the present numerical wave tank the cylinder was subjected to the nonlinear waves in stable equilibrium performance of the cylinder was modeled for the different submergence depths and the different off center distances to examine the convergence of the present nwt for different body boundary conditions the pitch angular velocity of the cylinder was compared for two submergence depths also the total power of the cylinder was illustrated for both case studies these were shown that the amplitude of pitch velocity and the maximum total power is increased slightly when the submergence depths is decreased the intensity of free surface nonlinearity was shown intuitively on upstream and downstream of the cylinder this was shown that the numerical wave tank was modeled qualitatively the nonlinear free surface propagation furthermore the pitch moment on the cylinder and its pitch displacement were compared for different off center distances these have shown that the amplitudes of pitch moment and the pitch displacement were magnified by increasing the off center distances nonlinear free surface evolution for both case studies is compared it has shown that the effect of the off center distance on the nonlinearity of the free surface is predicted using the present nwt what was expected the time history of the cylinder total power for different off center distances was shown at steady time periodic state accordingly the maximum total power was intensified for decreasing the off center distances at the steady time periodic state robust nonlinear incident wave was chosen to interact the cylinder to evaluate the numerical stability of the present numerical procedure hence a fifth order stokes wave was propagated within the nwt in absence of the cylinder it shows that the nonlinear free surface was simulated accurately the fully nonlinear interaction of the incident wave and the cylinder was simulated properly and the time history of pitch moment was shown that the nwt is converged and the numerical stability was conserved for steep waves which shown in time history of wave elevation at the middle of the tank acknowledgements this work was performed within the strategic research plan of

23579,this paper presents an improvised coupling technique for stress impact and dynamic response studies of a deepwater flowline riser pipe system exposed to cyclic loadings resulting from severe slug flow it involved partial coupling of transient multiphase flow simulator olga and structural finite element code abaqus in this analysis a parametric study was carried out where mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s were sampled in order to reflect the corresponding marginal flow rates of 6000 950 4 m3 day 8000 1267 2 m3 day and 10000 1584 m3 day barrels of oil per day bbl day for a typically aged offshore oilfield presumed to be piped with a 10 inch 0 254 m diameter subsea production pipe system numerical results obtained have shown that the 6000 bbl day flow rate imposed predominant stress at the riser base by producing maximum stress values of 64 mpa 63 mpa and 68 mpa in the axial transversal and lateral global directions of the flowline riser cross section respectively this observation has further validated the severity of severe slug flow to low flow rate of reservoir fluids with this and other data provided in this paper will enhance the fatigue design optimisation of deepwater production risers keywords severe slugging finite element analysis olga 7 abaqus fluid structural interaction top tensioned riser 1 introduction equipment integrity and systems reliability are of paramount interest in oil and gas industry as they guarantee not only the safety of personnel working in the field but also for the protection of environmental degradation that could inadvertently occur due to unprecedented equipment failure the determination of the life of an engineering structure is based on two precepts which are the knowledge of the structure itself and knowledge of how that structure is loaded deepwater offshore production risers suffer fatigue loadings from various sources such as first order wave effects direct wave loads and associated floater motions second order floater motions vortex induced vibrations internal fluid slugging effect thermal and pressure induced stress cycles etc dnv rp f204 2010 in order to ensure adequate fatigue life of deepwater riser systems it is important to have detailed technical data for all the identified fatigue loadings in a given operational condition of a certain riser system in service severe slugging is a flow assurance issue in offshore production systems especially for shallow and deepwater flowline riser systems due to sagging irregular boundaries peculiar problems associated with such flow geometry are flow instabilities and production losses pressure fluctuations at the riser base flooding of separator due to accumulated liquid surges separator damage due to high liquid and gas flow rates boe 1981 baliño et al 2007 bert et al 1987 fabre et al 1990 issa et al 2011 schmidt et al 1980 taitel and barnea 1990 wang et al 2013 xing and yeung 2010 other related slug flow problems include fatigue damage on the marine structures armando and euro 2010 arturo et al 2012 2013 audun 1982 chen and jian 2015 ibrahim et al 2013 jia 2012 2013 mac darlington et al 2016 marcio and motohiko 2010 monette and pettigrew 2004 montoya hernández et al 2014 paul et al 2012 peter and rogers 1995 philip et al 2009 rabih et al 2008 especially that imposed by severe slug flow which is usually associated with hydrostatic pressure fluctuations and is significantly dominant at the base of an offshore production riser the physical model describing the phenomenon of severe slugging was first presented by schmidt et al 1980 where he described the four stages of severe slug cycle which are slug formation slug movement into the separator gas blowout and liquid fallback as shown in fig 1 a b c and d respectively the analytical model proposed by schmidt was aimed at predicting the slug length slug frequency slug density slug velocity and pressure fluctuations at the riser base literature detailing the fluid structure interactions between severe slug flow and offshore production risers are limited but much research studies have been done on structural responses due to loadings coming from slug flow conditions arturo et al 2013 chen and jian 2015 ibrahim et al 2013 jia 2013 monette and pettigrew 2004 philip et al 2009 thus the need for optimising the design capability of offshore production risers which usually is exposed to intense severe slug loadings during the later production life of an aged oilfield during this stage the production facilities of an offshore oilfield will experience severe slugging problems otherwise known as flow assurance issues and such flow conditions have impact on the structural integrity and reliability of the production equipment therefore with the emergence of competent modeling and computing tools coupled with relevant field data complex problems like multiphase flows and its structural interactions can be efficiently simulated and analysed thereby providing a starting point for the design optimisation of these marine structures which invariably will enhance in the extension of their service life presently there s no single industrial commercial code that can simultaneously and effectively model multiphase flow problems and structural analysis in view of this backdrop this paper adopted a quasi coupling technique involving the use of olga and abaqus simulators which respectively are renowned industrial commercial codes for multiphase flow studies and fem fea analysis exploring the tenacity of this concept has enabled the provision of the much needed technical data that will enhance in the design improvement of a 10 inch 0 254 m top tensioned riser pipe by modeling a typical offshore oilfield production facility with the aforementioned production tubing which is presumed to be experiencing repeated loadings posed by severe slug flow at the riser base the modeling encompasses parametric studies that evaluated the stress state and dynamic behaviour of the riser base to three different mass flow rate scenarios 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s in flowline riser pipe system the riser base happens to be the vulnerable section of the riser that is exposed to fatigue damage due to the cyclic behaviour of the severe slug buildup in the riser emphasis on this analysis is aimed at providing detail understanding of the maximum stress distribution and dynamic responses to changes in flow conditions of a 10 inch 0 254 m flowline riser pipe system that is under severe slug loading since the pipe dimension and properties chosen in this study has been found to have wider applications in offshore oil and gas industry especially in deepwater oilfields simulation study with industry s acclaimed commercial software codes becomes indispensable when laboratory experiment is incapable enough to analyse the actual physical problem having said that pvtsim and olga which are renowned industry codes on flow assurance study for multiphase flows of gas and oil in pipelines were chosen for the severe slug flow analysis in the riser pipe while abaqus which is a famous software on finite element modeling fem was quasi coupled with olga by the use of the latter s pressure time series predictions at the riser base as a source of dynamic loadings for the finite element modeling and analysis fem fea of the riser with respect to parametric case studies of severe slugging conditions 2 simulation procedures in olga 2 1 generating fluid properties table for the fluid model simulation process in olga starts with the preparation of the fluid properties table using pvtsim olga 7 user manual guide olga simulator interfaces with pvtsim simulator which was used to prepare the fluid properties file of a typical heavy oil fluid model with api gravity in the range of 23 27 a pressure temperature pt flash of the fluid model was done at 1 00 bar and 15 c with the use of srk peneloux equation of state eos then a table file that contains the fluid properties for the fluid model meant for input in olga was prepared for a pressure range of 1 200 bar and temperature range of 20 100 c pvtsim 20 user manual nemoto et al 2010 with this fluid table olga solver will be able to compute the flow behaviour of the sampled fluid within the specified pressure and temperature ranges table 1 below shows the fluid components of the heavy oil fluid model used in this study as was also used by nemoto et al 2010 2 2 modeling of the contextual pipeline riser geometry the seabed topography water depth lateral distance from the wellhead and flowline riser pipe production system for a typical offshore oilfield that forms the analytical case study of the present work were all drawn from different offshore fields profiles in order to represent the actual and obtainable offshore oilfield situation rather than making fictitious and exaggerated conditions in our model that may not be feasible in actual sense the water depth lateral distance and fluid type were drawn from egina deepwater offshore oilfield in the gulf of guinea located 150 km off the coast of nigeria for the modeling of the actual offshore field environment the water depth of the field ranges from 1150 to 1750 m and has a lateral distance from the wellhead to fpso of about 4200 m with characterized reservoir fluids of approximately api 23 27 as reported by omowunmi et al 2013 while the sea bed topography of tyrihans offshore oilfield in the north sea was incorporated into egina to describe the seabed undulations of the contextual offshore oilfield fig 2 shows the 3d profile of the contextual flowline riser pipe system while fig 3 shows its 1d numerical pipe sections as executed in olga owing to the fact that olga is a one dimensional code simulator table 2 highlights the dimensions of the numerical pipe sections for the flowline riser pipe system as modeled in olga simulator where the entire 4400 m length of pipe network was divided into a total of 78 numerical sections of different sectional length throughout the profile the flowline and riser pipe are of the same outer diameter od of 10 75 inch 0 273 m and of wall thickness 0 562 inch 0 0143 m the roughness of the pipe was given as 0 000028 m with density 7850 kg m3 and specific heat of 500 j kg k and thermal conductivity of 50 w m k the insulation properties for the flowline pipe were modeled with density 1000 kg m3 specific heat 1500 j kg k thermal conductivity 0 135 w m k thickness 0 015 m the modeled riser height was 1600 m and was not insulated the entire flowline segment was 4300 m with topsides to separator of 100 m meanwhile modeling of the topsides processing facilities was not considered in the present study 2 3 boundary and inlet conditions the inlet boundary to the flowline was modeled with a no flow node while a mass source was used to modeled the inflow into the flowline with a constant mass flow of different rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s which in other words corresponds to a typically aged oilfield presumed to be producing marginally at the rates of 6000 950 4 m3 day 8000 1267 2 m3 day and 10000 1584 m3 day barrels of oil per day bbl day respectively inlet temperature was maintained constantly at 54 c 2 4 outlet boundary conditions the riser outlet to the topsides was modeled with a pressure node since the modeling of the topsides facilities is not within the scope of this study therefore the reference pressure and temperature for the olga solver was set at 28 3 bar 2 83 mpa and 27 c respectively the selected temperature value will ensure no wax deposition plugging the inner section of the pipelines during production since the chosen value is above the wax appearance temperature wat 2 5 slug tracking and pressure time series predictions for transient simulation of severe slug tracking it is recommended practice to run the simulation initially as a steady state flow by invoking the steady steady solver of the simulator without the slug tracking module being initiated this method will give indication of any possible slug occurrence during the flow process by studying the nature of flow pattern across the pipe profile throughout the simulation time thus by having a profile plot of the flow regime it will reveal regions of the flow path that experience slugging if eventually slug flow occurs in olga simulator numbers are used to designate different flow patterns where 1 2 3 and 4 represent stratified annular slug and bubble flow patterns respectively in this study fig 4 shows the profile plot of geometry flow pattern id liquid holdup hol pressure pt and temperature tm for a 5 hr steady state simulation run while that of fig 5 shows the time series trend plot of pressure temperature and liquid holdup at the riser base from this plot it is clearly seen that slugging id 3 occurred between the horizontal distance of 1000 2000 m where the pipe geometry has upward inclination and downward declination and at another point at the riser base that corresponds to horizontal distance of 4400 m where the downward declination of the flowline connects with the riser through the riser pipe bend this pressure behaviour at the riser base as predicted by olga conforms to similar behaviour observed experimentally by fabre et al 1990 taitel and barnea 19904 after the result analysis of the profile plot for the steady state simulation has given indications there was slugging in the system then the slug tracking module in olga was activated to track properly the slug development and statistics during the simulation run which was executed as a restart run for another 5 hr from the end of the steady state run the initial conditions for the slug tracking did not start from zero in order to capture effectively the existing flow behaviour in similar dimension trend plot in olga was used to plot the output variables of interest with respect to time at specific positions in the tubing or pipe therefore a trend plot of pressure at the riser base was requested for the parametric studies of the various flow rates in the 5 hr restart simulation run with the activation of slug tracking module in order to know the pressure history at the riser base throughout the time period fig 6 shows the profile plot for the slug tracking simulation and similar flow patterns as predicted in the steady state run for the identified slugging regions of the flow loop is seen similarities obtained with this figure to that of steady state run in fig 4 are both runs captured the slug occurrence at the undulated segments of the flow loop i e between distance ranges of 1000 1700 m in the pipeline and at the downward declined point of the riser base distance 4344 m while their differences lie in fig 6 which shows a comprehensive track of all the flow regimes associated with slug flow cycle in the riser stratified slug annular and bubble distance 4344 5856 m which the steady state run could not capture fig 7 shows the amplitude of pressure fluctuations with respect to time at riser base for the three different mass flow rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s 16 kg s with their maximum and minimum values of 70 4 bar 68 bar 66 7 bar and 48 6 bar 42 6 bar and 51 bar respectively the nature of these pressure fluctuations has further validated the observations made by baliño et al 2007 bert et al 1987 fabre et al 1990 jia 2013 montoya hernández et al 2014 schmidt et al 1980 wang et al 2013 xing and yeung 2010 which reveals that riser base experiences high rate of pressure fluctuations due to hydrostatic pressure rise owing to the liquid slug buildup in the riser during severe slug cycle and the process is seen to be repeated thus this pressure behaviour at the riser base which is cyclic and repetitive in nature is the rationale behind the objective contest of this paper which aims at carrying out finite element analysis fea of the riser pipe in order to ascertain the nature of stress distribution and dynamic response due to severe slug loadings the extracted pressure time series obtained at the riser base during the 5 hr transient slug tracking simulation was used as an input values to plot the pressure amplitude curve for the periodic pressure loading in abaqus during the analysis of the finite element model of the riser base 3 simulation procedures in abaqus structural modeling in abaqus starts by creating the part model abaqus user guide 2014 since the critical region of interest is the riser base this section of the lower part of the riser and downstream of the flowline connecting the riser base as indicated in fig 2 was modeled in abaqus using the specifications for a 10 inch 0 254 m pipe bend 3 1 flowline riser pipe cross section the 3d flowline and riser deformable part was given a cross sectional length of 2 m respectively while the pipe bend for the riser base was modeled with a center radius of 1 27 m in order to ensure the actual pipe features are verily represented since this is the normal design value for a 10 inch nominal pipe size fig 2 shows the points of these cross sections while table 3 shows the pipe properties as model in abaqus furthermore a hexahedral 20 nodes 3d continuum element with reduced integration c3d20r was used for the finite element modeling of this cross section 3 2 material assignment the properties of api 5l grade x 65 steel materials were assigned to the material model this is a high tensile strength elastic plastic steel material and has found wider applications in offshore pipelines design an et al 2012 campbell et al 2006 canada oil group feng et al 2005 fragiel et al 2005 the properties of the material are given in table 4 3 2 1 elastic property for the steel material modeling in abaqus requires definition of the constitutive model of the material structure hence an isotropic elastic material that obeys hooke s law of elasticity was used to model the elastic property of this high yield steel material table 4 above highlights the values of young modulus and poisson ratio of the elastic properties for the api 5l grade x 65 steel material as was inputted in the material property module of abaqus 3 2 2 plastic property for the steel material in the same vein for defining the constitutive model for the elasticity of the material structure ramberg osgood model eq 1 was used to generate the nonlinear stress strain relationship fig 8 that represents the elastic plastic behaviour of the material structure which abaqus requires in order to analyse the structural behaviour of the instanced part model when loaded the strain hardening parameter n in the model was given the value of 13 6 to generate the stress strain curve and this value was chosen since previous studies arjomandi and taheri 2011 yeh and kyriakides 1986 have expressed that models created with this hardening parameter value of 13 6 can effectively capture the characteristic behaviour and normalized collapse pressure capacity for the elastic plastic material structure in view of this the numerical modeling of the stress strain relationship was defined as a piecewise nonlinear dataset with plastic material behaviour defined by the von mises yield criterion with isotropic hardening 1 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ y n 1 3 3 sectioning and assembly a solid 3d homogeneous section was created and assigned to the part model with the specified material definition x 65 steel and its elastic plastic properties then an independent instance of the part model was created in the assembly module and the instanced part model was then assembled to ensure conformity and unifications between the coordinates of all the features of the part model 3 4 analysis solver step abaqus standard dynamic implicit solver was used to carry out the finite element analysis fea of the riser base with nonlinear geometry activated this was to ensure that the geometrical nonlinearity is considered during the analysis solution the analysis period was set at 16493 s in order to capture more cycles of severe slug loading in the riser 3 5 load and boundary conditions the transient pressures shown in fig 7 were used to prepare the pressure amplitude functions for the respective mass flow rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s 16 kg s which was defined to be applied as an internal pressure load in the inner surface of the riser base as shown in fig 9 six degrees of freedom for the ends of the flowline and riser pipes were fixed and was defined to be effective from the beginning of the analysis solver as shown in fig 10 this is to represent the real conditions for the flowline and riser ends that are fixed at the wellhead and separator respectively 3 6 meshing of the part instance the finite element model of the pipeline riser pipe section was discretized by using a 20 node continuum element of second degree order of interpolation with reduced integration localized seeding by number was done for the ends of the pipe system leading to the assignment of four seeds and three elements for the pipe thickness fig 11 while a global seeding with an element size of 0 02 m was effected for the whole structure which led to the generation of fine mesh for the finite element model of the flowline riser pipe system as shown in fig 12 however before arriving at this mesh size preliminary calculations were performed to study the dependency of the numerical solution on mesh density by varying several mesh sizes until no significant change in solutions was obtained for the mesh size of 0 02 m table 5 shows the mesh properties of the finite element model of the riser pipe structure 3 7 simulation algorithm this section brings together the sequence of all the procedures and simulations carried out in this numerical study with the aim of refreshing the reader s mind on the dynamics of the simulation processes carried out however section 2 of this paper has dealt comprehensively the detailed procedures for modeling in olga the multiphase flows of oil and gas in offshore deepwater production system while section 3 discusses the finite element modeling of the contextual flowline riser system in abaqus effort was made to explain the coupling technique between olga and abaqus which has to do with the application of pressure time series extracted from olga dynamic transient slug tracking simulation as amplitude input load case in the finite element model of the riser fig 13 shows the flowchart of the simulation stages 4 numerical results and discussion firstly before discussing the numerical results of this study it is imperative to reiterate that in abaqus there is no built in units system of measurement which means users are obliged to maintain consistency in the units of values they re using by virtue of that table 6 below shows the units of measurement as used in this paper for abaqus fea analysis however the following section discusses the results obtained from the structural analysis of the riser cross section in abaqus cae 4 1 normal stress analysis the impact of severe slug loads on riser base for a given flow condition will be analysed the analysis will focus on multiaxial stress distributions along the vulnerable section of the riser riser base for the various flow conditions critical point of interest for the stress analysis will focus on the most stressed element s in all the examined flow conditions i e for the different mass flow rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s 16 kg s fig 14 compares the magnitude of longitudinal normal stress values σ x produced by different mass flow rates in a given severe slug flow close observation of the plot shows that 9 8 kg s is the dominant mass flow rate with maximum stress value σ x m a x of 64 mpa having identified the critical mass flow rate from the parametric values examined hence fig 15 which shows the contour plots of the stress distributions associated with this flow condition was used to further evaluate the change in normal stress δ σ x that acts axially global x direction of the flowline riser cross section from equation 2 given below the change in normal stress δ σ x for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate was found to be 70 4 mpa figs 16 and 18 show the combined plot of the stress distributions for the various mass flow rates along the transverse σ y and lateral σ z directions while figs 17 and 19 show the contour plots of the dominant stresses in their respective directions from equation 3 the maximum normal stress value σ y m a x and the change in normal stress δ σ y along the transverse direction were found to be 63 mpa and 69 3 mpa respectively while the corresponding values in the lateral direction σ z m a x and δ σ z from equation 4 were found to be 68 mpa and 74 4 mpa respectively furthermore fig 20 a and b shows the element positions where the maximum values of the axial and transversal loads act 2 δ σ x σ x m a x σ x m i n 64 6 37 70 4 m p a 3 δ σ y σ y m a x σ y m i n 63 6 309 69 3 m p a 4 δ σ z σ z m a x σ z m i n 68 6 364 74 4 m p a 4 2 shear stress analysis the shear stress acting in different planes xy xz yz for the various flow conditions will be looked into fig 21 a b and c plots the contour graphs of shear stress values τ x y acting in the xy plane for the 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s mass flow rates maximum shear stress dominated by 9 8 kg s mass flow rate was found to be 19 mpa correspondingly figs 22 and 23 show the shear stresses in the xz τ x z and yz τ y z planes where maximum values were found to be 36 mpa and 35 mpa respectively for the dominant mass flow of 9 8 kg s equations 5 7 were used to obtain the changes in shear stresses for the respective planes of the dominant mass flow of 9 8 kg s which were 37 mpa 68 5 mpa and 66 7 mpa respectively 5 δ τ x y τ x y m a x τ x y m i n 19 18 1 37 m p a 6 δ τ x z τ x z m a x τ x z m i n 36 32 47 68 5 m p a 7 δ τ y z τ y z m a x τ y z m i n 35 31 68 66 7 m p a 4 3 von mises stress analysis in order to provide more details for the structural condition of a severely slugged deepwater production riser fig 24 shows the maximum von mises stress values at element no 12062 fig 27 for the various flow conditions it can also be seen from the plot that the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate imposed dominant mises stress with maximum value of 65 mpa however fig 25 shows the mises stress profile plotted along the distance path of the riser base shown in fig 26 4 4 dynamic response it is imperative to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the flowline riser pipe section because mechanical vibration would lead to system instability causing fatigue damage on material structure and could lead to equipment failure in most extreme cases in view of that response analysis of the riser structure was studied through the node no 18955 as indicated by red dot in fig 28 fig 29 showcases the impact of various mass flow rates on the dynamic response of the riser system maximum displacement of 0 26 mm was found for the mass flow rate of 9 8 kg s fig 30 plots the spatial displacement of node 18955 for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate though these displacement values are low reason was due to the short length of the flowline riser cross section but it tells more there are possible vibrations to occur if it were to be a larger length section 5 conclusion numerical modeling and analysis of a 10 inch 0 254 m top tensioned offshore production flowline riser pipe system experiencing severe slug flow was a huge task that involved several complex commercial software codes that required great deal of computational time however effort committed in providing the stress values and dynamic behaviour of the contextual production riser pipe presumed to be transporting different rates of reservoir fluids at 6000 bbl day 950 4 m3 day 8000 bbl day 1267 2 m3 day and 10000 bbl day 1584 m3 day is well appreciated by the authors since the offshore oil industry is presently lacking an integrated single software package that could analyse complex multiphase flow problems interchangeably with structural response while waiting for the development of such complex and well integrated commercial codes the data provided in this paper will remain valuable to those concerned in the riser pipe design especially in the fatigue designs of 10 inch production risers which have gotten wider application in offshore oilfield development therefore the following conclusions are drawn from the numerical results the maximum normal stress values acting in the axial global x axis direction for a 10 inch pipe of api 5l grade x 65 steel materials experiencing heavy severe slugging are 64 mpa 61 mpa and 60 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum normal stress values for the transversal global y axis direction are 63 mpa 59 mpa and 58 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum normal stress values acting in lateral global z axis direction are 68 mpa 66 mpa and 65 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum shear stress values acting in xy plane are 19 mpa 17 5 mpa and 17 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s for the xz plane the maximum shear stress values are 36 mpa 34 5 mpa and 33 5 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum shear stress values for the yz plane are 35 mpa 34 mpa and 33 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s maximum values for the mises stresses are 65 mpa 63 mpa and 62 mpa respectively for mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s changes in normal stress for the axial transversal and lateral directions of the flowline riser pipe system were found to be 70 4 mpa 69 3 mpa and 74 4 mpa respectively for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate changes in planar stress acting in the xy xz and yz planes for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate were found to be 37 mpa 68 5 mpa and 66 7 mpa respectively the analysis also provided the dynamic response of the riser system with respect to the aforementioned mass flow rates as 0 26 mm 0 25 mm and 0 24 mm respectively olga a renowned multiphase flow simulator for modeling of oil and gas transportation in pipelines made good pressure predictions that conform to the basic theories of severe slug flow in flowline riser pipe system pressure values of 70 401 bar 68 bar and 66 7 bar were predicted as the hydrostatic pressures acting at the riser base for the respective cases of the mass flow rates this paper has demonstrated the skill and concept of improvising with available tools i e partial coupling of olga and abaqus in the absence of integrated commercial codes to model the actual field condition that can enhance efficient numerical study of the fluid structure interaction of severe slug flow in deepwater production systems abaqus which is famous in finite element modeling and analysis gave us the understanding of the stress state of this system and how these stresses were distributed at the base of the rise pipe acknowledgement this work was supported by national key research and development plan grant no 2016yfc0303700 of the institute for ocean engineering china university of petroleum beijing the authors also express their appreciation to china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for their assistance and resources that also ensured the actualization of this research work 
23579,this paper presents an improvised coupling technique for stress impact and dynamic response studies of a deepwater flowline riser pipe system exposed to cyclic loadings resulting from severe slug flow it involved partial coupling of transient multiphase flow simulator olga and structural finite element code abaqus in this analysis a parametric study was carried out where mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s were sampled in order to reflect the corresponding marginal flow rates of 6000 950 4 m3 day 8000 1267 2 m3 day and 10000 1584 m3 day barrels of oil per day bbl day for a typically aged offshore oilfield presumed to be piped with a 10 inch 0 254 m diameter subsea production pipe system numerical results obtained have shown that the 6000 bbl day flow rate imposed predominant stress at the riser base by producing maximum stress values of 64 mpa 63 mpa and 68 mpa in the axial transversal and lateral global directions of the flowline riser cross section respectively this observation has further validated the severity of severe slug flow to low flow rate of reservoir fluids with this and other data provided in this paper will enhance the fatigue design optimisation of deepwater production risers keywords severe slugging finite element analysis olga 7 abaqus fluid structural interaction top tensioned riser 1 introduction equipment integrity and systems reliability are of paramount interest in oil and gas industry as they guarantee not only the safety of personnel working in the field but also for the protection of environmental degradation that could inadvertently occur due to unprecedented equipment failure the determination of the life of an engineering structure is based on two precepts which are the knowledge of the structure itself and knowledge of how that structure is loaded deepwater offshore production risers suffer fatigue loadings from various sources such as first order wave effects direct wave loads and associated floater motions second order floater motions vortex induced vibrations internal fluid slugging effect thermal and pressure induced stress cycles etc dnv rp f204 2010 in order to ensure adequate fatigue life of deepwater riser systems it is important to have detailed technical data for all the identified fatigue loadings in a given operational condition of a certain riser system in service severe slugging is a flow assurance issue in offshore production systems especially for shallow and deepwater flowline riser systems due to sagging irregular boundaries peculiar problems associated with such flow geometry are flow instabilities and production losses pressure fluctuations at the riser base flooding of separator due to accumulated liquid surges separator damage due to high liquid and gas flow rates boe 1981 baliño et al 2007 bert et al 1987 fabre et al 1990 issa et al 2011 schmidt et al 1980 taitel and barnea 1990 wang et al 2013 xing and yeung 2010 other related slug flow problems include fatigue damage on the marine structures armando and euro 2010 arturo et al 2012 2013 audun 1982 chen and jian 2015 ibrahim et al 2013 jia 2012 2013 mac darlington et al 2016 marcio and motohiko 2010 monette and pettigrew 2004 montoya hernández et al 2014 paul et al 2012 peter and rogers 1995 philip et al 2009 rabih et al 2008 especially that imposed by severe slug flow which is usually associated with hydrostatic pressure fluctuations and is significantly dominant at the base of an offshore production riser the physical model describing the phenomenon of severe slugging was first presented by schmidt et al 1980 where he described the four stages of severe slug cycle which are slug formation slug movement into the separator gas blowout and liquid fallback as shown in fig 1 a b c and d respectively the analytical model proposed by schmidt was aimed at predicting the slug length slug frequency slug density slug velocity and pressure fluctuations at the riser base literature detailing the fluid structure interactions between severe slug flow and offshore production risers are limited but much research studies have been done on structural responses due to loadings coming from slug flow conditions arturo et al 2013 chen and jian 2015 ibrahim et al 2013 jia 2013 monette and pettigrew 2004 philip et al 2009 thus the need for optimising the design capability of offshore production risers which usually is exposed to intense severe slug loadings during the later production life of an aged oilfield during this stage the production facilities of an offshore oilfield will experience severe slugging problems otherwise known as flow assurance issues and such flow conditions have impact on the structural integrity and reliability of the production equipment therefore with the emergence of competent modeling and computing tools coupled with relevant field data complex problems like multiphase flows and its structural interactions can be efficiently simulated and analysed thereby providing a starting point for the design optimisation of these marine structures which invariably will enhance in the extension of their service life presently there s no single industrial commercial code that can simultaneously and effectively model multiphase flow problems and structural analysis in view of this backdrop this paper adopted a quasi coupling technique involving the use of olga and abaqus simulators which respectively are renowned industrial commercial codes for multiphase flow studies and fem fea analysis exploring the tenacity of this concept has enabled the provision of the much needed technical data that will enhance in the design improvement of a 10 inch 0 254 m top tensioned riser pipe by modeling a typical offshore oilfield production facility with the aforementioned production tubing which is presumed to be experiencing repeated loadings posed by severe slug flow at the riser base the modeling encompasses parametric studies that evaluated the stress state and dynamic behaviour of the riser base to three different mass flow rate scenarios 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s in flowline riser pipe system the riser base happens to be the vulnerable section of the riser that is exposed to fatigue damage due to the cyclic behaviour of the severe slug buildup in the riser emphasis on this analysis is aimed at providing detail understanding of the maximum stress distribution and dynamic responses to changes in flow conditions of a 10 inch 0 254 m flowline riser pipe system that is under severe slug loading since the pipe dimension and properties chosen in this study has been found to have wider applications in offshore oil and gas industry especially in deepwater oilfields simulation study with industry s acclaimed commercial software codes becomes indispensable when laboratory experiment is incapable enough to analyse the actual physical problem having said that pvtsim and olga which are renowned industry codes on flow assurance study for multiphase flows of gas and oil in pipelines were chosen for the severe slug flow analysis in the riser pipe while abaqus which is a famous software on finite element modeling fem was quasi coupled with olga by the use of the latter s pressure time series predictions at the riser base as a source of dynamic loadings for the finite element modeling and analysis fem fea of the riser with respect to parametric case studies of severe slugging conditions 2 simulation procedures in olga 2 1 generating fluid properties table for the fluid model simulation process in olga starts with the preparation of the fluid properties table using pvtsim olga 7 user manual guide olga simulator interfaces with pvtsim simulator which was used to prepare the fluid properties file of a typical heavy oil fluid model with api gravity in the range of 23 27 a pressure temperature pt flash of the fluid model was done at 1 00 bar and 15 c with the use of srk peneloux equation of state eos then a table file that contains the fluid properties for the fluid model meant for input in olga was prepared for a pressure range of 1 200 bar and temperature range of 20 100 c pvtsim 20 user manual nemoto et al 2010 with this fluid table olga solver will be able to compute the flow behaviour of the sampled fluid within the specified pressure and temperature ranges table 1 below shows the fluid components of the heavy oil fluid model used in this study as was also used by nemoto et al 2010 2 2 modeling of the contextual pipeline riser geometry the seabed topography water depth lateral distance from the wellhead and flowline riser pipe production system for a typical offshore oilfield that forms the analytical case study of the present work were all drawn from different offshore fields profiles in order to represent the actual and obtainable offshore oilfield situation rather than making fictitious and exaggerated conditions in our model that may not be feasible in actual sense the water depth lateral distance and fluid type were drawn from egina deepwater offshore oilfield in the gulf of guinea located 150 km off the coast of nigeria for the modeling of the actual offshore field environment the water depth of the field ranges from 1150 to 1750 m and has a lateral distance from the wellhead to fpso of about 4200 m with characterized reservoir fluids of approximately api 23 27 as reported by omowunmi et al 2013 while the sea bed topography of tyrihans offshore oilfield in the north sea was incorporated into egina to describe the seabed undulations of the contextual offshore oilfield fig 2 shows the 3d profile of the contextual flowline riser pipe system while fig 3 shows its 1d numerical pipe sections as executed in olga owing to the fact that olga is a one dimensional code simulator table 2 highlights the dimensions of the numerical pipe sections for the flowline riser pipe system as modeled in olga simulator where the entire 4400 m length of pipe network was divided into a total of 78 numerical sections of different sectional length throughout the profile the flowline and riser pipe are of the same outer diameter od of 10 75 inch 0 273 m and of wall thickness 0 562 inch 0 0143 m the roughness of the pipe was given as 0 000028 m with density 7850 kg m3 and specific heat of 500 j kg k and thermal conductivity of 50 w m k the insulation properties for the flowline pipe were modeled with density 1000 kg m3 specific heat 1500 j kg k thermal conductivity 0 135 w m k thickness 0 015 m the modeled riser height was 1600 m and was not insulated the entire flowline segment was 4300 m with topsides to separator of 100 m meanwhile modeling of the topsides processing facilities was not considered in the present study 2 3 boundary and inlet conditions the inlet boundary to the flowline was modeled with a no flow node while a mass source was used to modeled the inflow into the flowline with a constant mass flow of different rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s which in other words corresponds to a typically aged oilfield presumed to be producing marginally at the rates of 6000 950 4 m3 day 8000 1267 2 m3 day and 10000 1584 m3 day barrels of oil per day bbl day respectively inlet temperature was maintained constantly at 54 c 2 4 outlet boundary conditions the riser outlet to the topsides was modeled with a pressure node since the modeling of the topsides facilities is not within the scope of this study therefore the reference pressure and temperature for the olga solver was set at 28 3 bar 2 83 mpa and 27 c respectively the selected temperature value will ensure no wax deposition plugging the inner section of the pipelines during production since the chosen value is above the wax appearance temperature wat 2 5 slug tracking and pressure time series predictions for transient simulation of severe slug tracking it is recommended practice to run the simulation initially as a steady state flow by invoking the steady steady solver of the simulator without the slug tracking module being initiated this method will give indication of any possible slug occurrence during the flow process by studying the nature of flow pattern across the pipe profile throughout the simulation time thus by having a profile plot of the flow regime it will reveal regions of the flow path that experience slugging if eventually slug flow occurs in olga simulator numbers are used to designate different flow patterns where 1 2 3 and 4 represent stratified annular slug and bubble flow patterns respectively in this study fig 4 shows the profile plot of geometry flow pattern id liquid holdup hol pressure pt and temperature tm for a 5 hr steady state simulation run while that of fig 5 shows the time series trend plot of pressure temperature and liquid holdup at the riser base from this plot it is clearly seen that slugging id 3 occurred between the horizontal distance of 1000 2000 m where the pipe geometry has upward inclination and downward declination and at another point at the riser base that corresponds to horizontal distance of 4400 m where the downward declination of the flowline connects with the riser through the riser pipe bend this pressure behaviour at the riser base as predicted by olga conforms to similar behaviour observed experimentally by fabre et al 1990 taitel and barnea 19904 after the result analysis of the profile plot for the steady state simulation has given indications there was slugging in the system then the slug tracking module in olga was activated to track properly the slug development and statistics during the simulation run which was executed as a restart run for another 5 hr from the end of the steady state run the initial conditions for the slug tracking did not start from zero in order to capture effectively the existing flow behaviour in similar dimension trend plot in olga was used to plot the output variables of interest with respect to time at specific positions in the tubing or pipe therefore a trend plot of pressure at the riser base was requested for the parametric studies of the various flow rates in the 5 hr restart simulation run with the activation of slug tracking module in order to know the pressure history at the riser base throughout the time period fig 6 shows the profile plot for the slug tracking simulation and similar flow patterns as predicted in the steady state run for the identified slugging regions of the flow loop is seen similarities obtained with this figure to that of steady state run in fig 4 are both runs captured the slug occurrence at the undulated segments of the flow loop i e between distance ranges of 1000 1700 m in the pipeline and at the downward declined point of the riser base distance 4344 m while their differences lie in fig 6 which shows a comprehensive track of all the flow regimes associated with slug flow cycle in the riser stratified slug annular and bubble distance 4344 5856 m which the steady state run could not capture fig 7 shows the amplitude of pressure fluctuations with respect to time at riser base for the three different mass flow rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s 16 kg s with their maximum and minimum values of 70 4 bar 68 bar 66 7 bar and 48 6 bar 42 6 bar and 51 bar respectively the nature of these pressure fluctuations has further validated the observations made by baliño et al 2007 bert et al 1987 fabre et al 1990 jia 2013 montoya hernández et al 2014 schmidt et al 1980 wang et al 2013 xing and yeung 2010 which reveals that riser base experiences high rate of pressure fluctuations due to hydrostatic pressure rise owing to the liquid slug buildup in the riser during severe slug cycle and the process is seen to be repeated thus this pressure behaviour at the riser base which is cyclic and repetitive in nature is the rationale behind the objective contest of this paper which aims at carrying out finite element analysis fea of the riser pipe in order to ascertain the nature of stress distribution and dynamic response due to severe slug loadings the extracted pressure time series obtained at the riser base during the 5 hr transient slug tracking simulation was used as an input values to plot the pressure amplitude curve for the periodic pressure loading in abaqus during the analysis of the finite element model of the riser base 3 simulation procedures in abaqus structural modeling in abaqus starts by creating the part model abaqus user guide 2014 since the critical region of interest is the riser base this section of the lower part of the riser and downstream of the flowline connecting the riser base as indicated in fig 2 was modeled in abaqus using the specifications for a 10 inch 0 254 m pipe bend 3 1 flowline riser pipe cross section the 3d flowline and riser deformable part was given a cross sectional length of 2 m respectively while the pipe bend for the riser base was modeled with a center radius of 1 27 m in order to ensure the actual pipe features are verily represented since this is the normal design value for a 10 inch nominal pipe size fig 2 shows the points of these cross sections while table 3 shows the pipe properties as model in abaqus furthermore a hexahedral 20 nodes 3d continuum element with reduced integration c3d20r was used for the finite element modeling of this cross section 3 2 material assignment the properties of api 5l grade x 65 steel materials were assigned to the material model this is a high tensile strength elastic plastic steel material and has found wider applications in offshore pipelines design an et al 2012 campbell et al 2006 canada oil group feng et al 2005 fragiel et al 2005 the properties of the material are given in table 4 3 2 1 elastic property for the steel material modeling in abaqus requires definition of the constitutive model of the material structure hence an isotropic elastic material that obeys hooke s law of elasticity was used to model the elastic property of this high yield steel material table 4 above highlights the values of young modulus and poisson ratio of the elastic properties for the api 5l grade x 65 steel material as was inputted in the material property module of abaqus 3 2 2 plastic property for the steel material in the same vein for defining the constitutive model for the elasticity of the material structure ramberg osgood model eq 1 was used to generate the nonlinear stress strain relationship fig 8 that represents the elastic plastic behaviour of the material structure which abaqus requires in order to analyse the structural behaviour of the instanced part model when loaded the strain hardening parameter n in the model was given the value of 13 6 to generate the stress strain curve and this value was chosen since previous studies arjomandi and taheri 2011 yeh and kyriakides 1986 have expressed that models created with this hardening parameter value of 13 6 can effectively capture the characteristic behaviour and normalized collapse pressure capacity for the elastic plastic material structure in view of this the numerical modeling of the stress strain relationship was defined as a piecewise nonlinear dataset with plastic material behaviour defined by the von mises yield criterion with isotropic hardening 1 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ y n 1 3 3 sectioning and assembly a solid 3d homogeneous section was created and assigned to the part model with the specified material definition x 65 steel and its elastic plastic properties then an independent instance of the part model was created in the assembly module and the instanced part model was then assembled to ensure conformity and unifications between the coordinates of all the features of the part model 3 4 analysis solver step abaqus standard dynamic implicit solver was used to carry out the finite element analysis fea of the riser base with nonlinear geometry activated this was to ensure that the geometrical nonlinearity is considered during the analysis solution the analysis period was set at 16493 s in order to capture more cycles of severe slug loading in the riser 3 5 load and boundary conditions the transient pressures shown in fig 7 were used to prepare the pressure amplitude functions for the respective mass flow rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s 16 kg s which was defined to be applied as an internal pressure load in the inner surface of the riser base as shown in fig 9 six degrees of freedom for the ends of the flowline and riser pipes were fixed and was defined to be effective from the beginning of the analysis solver as shown in fig 10 this is to represent the real conditions for the flowline and riser ends that are fixed at the wellhead and separator respectively 3 6 meshing of the part instance the finite element model of the pipeline riser pipe section was discretized by using a 20 node continuum element of second degree order of interpolation with reduced integration localized seeding by number was done for the ends of the pipe system leading to the assignment of four seeds and three elements for the pipe thickness fig 11 while a global seeding with an element size of 0 02 m was effected for the whole structure which led to the generation of fine mesh for the finite element model of the flowline riser pipe system as shown in fig 12 however before arriving at this mesh size preliminary calculations were performed to study the dependency of the numerical solution on mesh density by varying several mesh sizes until no significant change in solutions was obtained for the mesh size of 0 02 m table 5 shows the mesh properties of the finite element model of the riser pipe structure 3 7 simulation algorithm this section brings together the sequence of all the procedures and simulations carried out in this numerical study with the aim of refreshing the reader s mind on the dynamics of the simulation processes carried out however section 2 of this paper has dealt comprehensively the detailed procedures for modeling in olga the multiphase flows of oil and gas in offshore deepwater production system while section 3 discusses the finite element modeling of the contextual flowline riser system in abaqus effort was made to explain the coupling technique between olga and abaqus which has to do with the application of pressure time series extracted from olga dynamic transient slug tracking simulation as amplitude input load case in the finite element model of the riser fig 13 shows the flowchart of the simulation stages 4 numerical results and discussion firstly before discussing the numerical results of this study it is imperative to reiterate that in abaqus there is no built in units system of measurement which means users are obliged to maintain consistency in the units of values they re using by virtue of that table 6 below shows the units of measurement as used in this paper for abaqus fea analysis however the following section discusses the results obtained from the structural analysis of the riser cross section in abaqus cae 4 1 normal stress analysis the impact of severe slug loads on riser base for a given flow condition will be analysed the analysis will focus on multiaxial stress distributions along the vulnerable section of the riser riser base for the various flow conditions critical point of interest for the stress analysis will focus on the most stressed element s in all the examined flow conditions i e for the different mass flow rates 9 8 kg s 13 kg s 16 kg s fig 14 compares the magnitude of longitudinal normal stress values σ x produced by different mass flow rates in a given severe slug flow close observation of the plot shows that 9 8 kg s is the dominant mass flow rate with maximum stress value σ x m a x of 64 mpa having identified the critical mass flow rate from the parametric values examined hence fig 15 which shows the contour plots of the stress distributions associated with this flow condition was used to further evaluate the change in normal stress δ σ x that acts axially global x direction of the flowline riser cross section from equation 2 given below the change in normal stress δ σ x for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate was found to be 70 4 mpa figs 16 and 18 show the combined plot of the stress distributions for the various mass flow rates along the transverse σ y and lateral σ z directions while figs 17 and 19 show the contour plots of the dominant stresses in their respective directions from equation 3 the maximum normal stress value σ y m a x and the change in normal stress δ σ y along the transverse direction were found to be 63 mpa and 69 3 mpa respectively while the corresponding values in the lateral direction σ z m a x and δ σ z from equation 4 were found to be 68 mpa and 74 4 mpa respectively furthermore fig 20 a and b shows the element positions where the maximum values of the axial and transversal loads act 2 δ σ x σ x m a x σ x m i n 64 6 37 70 4 m p a 3 δ σ y σ y m a x σ y m i n 63 6 309 69 3 m p a 4 δ σ z σ z m a x σ z m i n 68 6 364 74 4 m p a 4 2 shear stress analysis the shear stress acting in different planes xy xz yz for the various flow conditions will be looked into fig 21 a b and c plots the contour graphs of shear stress values τ x y acting in the xy plane for the 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s mass flow rates maximum shear stress dominated by 9 8 kg s mass flow rate was found to be 19 mpa correspondingly figs 22 and 23 show the shear stresses in the xz τ x z and yz τ y z planes where maximum values were found to be 36 mpa and 35 mpa respectively for the dominant mass flow of 9 8 kg s equations 5 7 were used to obtain the changes in shear stresses for the respective planes of the dominant mass flow of 9 8 kg s which were 37 mpa 68 5 mpa and 66 7 mpa respectively 5 δ τ x y τ x y m a x τ x y m i n 19 18 1 37 m p a 6 δ τ x z τ x z m a x τ x z m i n 36 32 47 68 5 m p a 7 δ τ y z τ y z m a x τ y z m i n 35 31 68 66 7 m p a 4 3 von mises stress analysis in order to provide more details for the structural condition of a severely slugged deepwater production riser fig 24 shows the maximum von mises stress values at element no 12062 fig 27 for the various flow conditions it can also be seen from the plot that the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate imposed dominant mises stress with maximum value of 65 mpa however fig 25 shows the mises stress profile plotted along the distance path of the riser base shown in fig 26 4 4 dynamic response it is imperative to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the flowline riser pipe section because mechanical vibration would lead to system instability causing fatigue damage on material structure and could lead to equipment failure in most extreme cases in view of that response analysis of the riser structure was studied through the node no 18955 as indicated by red dot in fig 28 fig 29 showcases the impact of various mass flow rates on the dynamic response of the riser system maximum displacement of 0 26 mm was found for the mass flow rate of 9 8 kg s fig 30 plots the spatial displacement of node 18955 for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate though these displacement values are low reason was due to the short length of the flowline riser cross section but it tells more there are possible vibrations to occur if it were to be a larger length section 5 conclusion numerical modeling and analysis of a 10 inch 0 254 m top tensioned offshore production flowline riser pipe system experiencing severe slug flow was a huge task that involved several complex commercial software codes that required great deal of computational time however effort committed in providing the stress values and dynamic behaviour of the contextual production riser pipe presumed to be transporting different rates of reservoir fluids at 6000 bbl day 950 4 m3 day 8000 bbl day 1267 2 m3 day and 10000 bbl day 1584 m3 day is well appreciated by the authors since the offshore oil industry is presently lacking an integrated single software package that could analyse complex multiphase flow problems interchangeably with structural response while waiting for the development of such complex and well integrated commercial codes the data provided in this paper will remain valuable to those concerned in the riser pipe design especially in the fatigue designs of 10 inch production risers which have gotten wider application in offshore oilfield development therefore the following conclusions are drawn from the numerical results the maximum normal stress values acting in the axial global x axis direction for a 10 inch pipe of api 5l grade x 65 steel materials experiencing heavy severe slugging are 64 mpa 61 mpa and 60 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum normal stress values for the transversal global y axis direction are 63 mpa 59 mpa and 58 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum normal stress values acting in lateral global z axis direction are 68 mpa 66 mpa and 65 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum shear stress values acting in xy plane are 19 mpa 17 5 mpa and 17 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s for the xz plane the maximum shear stress values are 36 mpa 34 5 mpa and 33 5 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s the maximum shear stress values for the yz plane are 35 mpa 34 mpa and 33 mpa for the respective mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s maximum values for the mises stresses are 65 mpa 63 mpa and 62 mpa respectively for mass flow rates of 9 8 kg s 13 kg s and 16 kg s changes in normal stress for the axial transversal and lateral directions of the flowline riser pipe system were found to be 70 4 mpa 69 3 mpa and 74 4 mpa respectively for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate changes in planar stress acting in the xy xz and yz planes for the 9 8 kg s mass flow rate were found to be 37 mpa 68 5 mpa and 66 7 mpa respectively the analysis also provided the dynamic response of the riser system with respect to the aforementioned mass flow rates as 0 26 mm 0 25 mm and 0 24 mm respectively olga a renowned multiphase flow simulator for modeling of oil and gas transportation in pipelines made good pressure predictions that conform to the basic theories of severe slug flow in flowline riser pipe system pressure values of 70 401 bar 68 bar and 66 7 bar were predicted as the hydrostatic pressures acting at the riser base for the respective cases of the mass flow rates this paper has demonstrated the skill and concept of improvising with available tools i e partial coupling of olga and abaqus in the absence of integrated commercial codes to model the actual field condition that can enhance efficient numerical study of the fluid structure interaction of severe slug flow in deepwater production systems abaqus which is famous in finite element modeling and analysis gave us the understanding of the stress state of this system and how these stresses were distributed at the base of the rise pipe acknowledgement this work was supported by national key research and development plan grant no 2016yfc0303700 of the institute for ocean engineering china
