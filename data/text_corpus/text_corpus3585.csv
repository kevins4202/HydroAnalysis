17925,triclocarban tcc is a highly effective antibacterial agent which is widely used in a variety of applications and present at significant levels e g 760 μg l in wastewater worldwide however the interaction between tcc and nitrifiers important microbial cultures in wastewater treatment plants has not been documented this work therefore aimed to evaluate the fate of tcc in a nitrifying culture and its impact on nitrifiers in four long term nitrifiers rich reactors which received synthetic wastewater containing 0 0 1 1 or 5 mg l tcc experimental results showed that 36 7 50 7 of wastewater tcc was removed by nitrifying cultures in stable operation mass balance analysis revealed that the removal of tcc was mainly achieved through adsorption rather than biodegradation adsorption kinetic analysis indicated that inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for the removal while fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that several functional groups such as hydroxyl amide and polysaccharide seemed to be the main adsorption sites the adsorbed tcc significantly deteriorated settleability and performance of nitrifying cultures with an increase of influent tcc from 0 to 5 mg l reactor volatile suspended solids and effluent nitrate decreased from 1200 90 mg l and 300 81 7 52 mg l to 880 80 and 7 35 4 62 mg l while effluent ammonium and nitrite increased from 0 41 0 03 and 0 45 0 23 mg l to104 65 3 46 and 182 06 7 54 mg l respectively tcc increased the extracellular polymeric substances of nitrifying cultures inhibited the specific activities of nitrifiers and altered the abundance of nitrifiers especially nitrospira sp in particular tcc at environmentally relevant concentration i e 0 1 mg l significantly inhibited nob activity and reduced nob population graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrifiers wastewater treatment adsorption triclocarban toxicity 1 introduction triclocarban tcc is one typical broad spectrum antimicrobial that is extensively used as an additive in numerous personal care products and household consumables such as soaps shampoos cosmetics toothpastes and kitchen utensils gautam et al 2014 it was documented that each person daily consumed 2 06 0 68 mg tcc and its consumption amount achieved 227 454 tons in usa annually usepa 2002 the large use of tcc inevitably leads to its environmental release recently tcc is ubiquitously detected in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in 2014 brumovsky et al 2017 investigated the open surface water of western mediterranean sea and confirmed the existence of tcc even far beyond the environmental test line i e 5 6 μg l it is reported that the tcc concentrations detected by halden and paul 2004 and 2005 in river and wastewater of baltimore urban streams reached 5 6 μg l and 6 75 μg l in 2005 respectively in 2013 subedi et al 2017 investigated raw wastewater influent of sewage treatment plant in the state of karnataka southern india and found tcc concentration was in the range of 1 2 10 μg l according to our survey on five wwtps in central china e g changsha in 2018 tcc concentration in municipal sewage ranged from 60 to 760 μg l the widespread existence of tcc readily contacts organisms in environment and is even accumulated into organisms at significant levels it was documented that tcc accumulated was 300 ng g in algae 69 ng g in rats 92 9 ng g in feces and 79 μg g in human urine respectively coogan et al 2007 kennedy et al 2015 schebb et al 2011 as an antibacterial agent tcc could inhibit the growth and metabolisms of microbes through either impairing the reproductive system nolen and dierckman 1979 or disturbing the estrogen and androgen receptors schebb et al 2011 yang et al 2008 demonstrated that tcc had strong inhibitory effects on algae p subcapitata with 50 inhibition concentration of 17 5 μg l for algal growth tcc caused antibiotic toxicity to c elegans with 50 inhibition concentration being 910 μg l lenz et al 2017 thus the fate of tcc in environment and its potential toxicity to organisms have recently attracted increasing attention as the last barriers before the released tcc into the natural environment wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major places to remove wastewater tcc thereby playing a crucial role in alleviating its environmental risks in the past years several efforts were dedicated to investigating the removal of tcc in wastewater treatment process and demonstrated that tcc was incompletely removed with 75 98 removal efficiency be usually achieved during the whole wastewater treatment employing conventional activated sludge process gautam et al 2014 chalew and halen 2009 lozano et al 2013 found that in a wwtp in the mid atlantic region of u s the concentration of tcc was 4 92 1 00 μg l in the influent but only 0 13 0 01 μg l in the effluent with 13 1 0 9 μg g dry wt being detected in activated sludge suggesting that most of tcc were transferred from wastewater to waste activated sludge by measuring the concentrations of tcc in influent and effluent of a typical wwtp in u s halden 2014 also demonstrated that 97 1 of tcc present in wastewater was removed besides wang et al 2017 2019 2020 found that the presence of tcc severely inhibited the activities of anaerobes such as methanogens however these previous studies merely demonstrated either the transportation of tcc from the liquid to sludge phase in wastewater treatment process or the impact of tcc on anaerobes in sludge treatment process nitrifiers which are key aerobic bacteria in wwtps responsible for oxidation of ammonium play significant roles in nitrogen removal in wwtps the presence of tcc in wastewater might be intercepted by nitrifiers and therefore affects the activities of nitrifiers to date however the interaction between tcc and nitrifiers is still poorly understood thus the objective of this study is to assess the fate of tcc in nitrifying cultures and its impact on nitrifiers firstly the fate of tcc in nitrifying cultures was comprehensively investigated by assessing the removal efficiency of tcc differentiating the contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to tcc removal analyzing the sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm and identifying the possible adsorption sites then the effect of tcc ranging from 0 to 5 mg l on nitrifiers was investigated finally details of how tcc affects nitrifiers were explored through analyzing the variations of extracellular polymeric substances eps transformations of metabolic intermediates and variations in specific activities of nitrifiers and microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of parent reactor a 16 l working volume reactor was operated in a temperature controlled room 22 1 c as the parent reactor to enrich nitrifiers the reactor was fed with a synthetic medium containing 300 mg nh 4 n l and without any organic carbon the seed sludge was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the reactor was operated two cycles daily each cycle consisted of a 9 0 h oxic phase and a 2 h settling phase followed by 20 min decanting and 40 min idle phases in the last 10 min of the idle phase 10 l synthetic wastewater with composition described as below was pumped into the reactor dissolved oxygen do was maintained between 2 5 and 3 0 mg l in the oxic phase using a programmed logic controller and ph in this phase was controlled at 7 5 by dosing 1 m nahco3 the hydraulic retention time hrt were maintained at 14 h it should be emphasized that no sludge wasting was conducted here and the sludge retention time srt in stable operation was estimated to be 27 d approximately on the basis of the measured total suspended solids and effluent total suspended solids after about 2 month operation stable operation 0 6 0 3 mg n l of effluent ammonia 1 5 0 5 mg n l of effluent nitrite and 290 10 0 mg n l of effluent nitrate was achieved in this parent reactor and then the sludge was withdrawn for the following tests synthetic medium was used in this work and prepared daily to enrich nitrifiers the synthetic medium contained approximately 300 mg l ammonium nh 4 n without organic carbon source the detailed composition of synthetic wastewater was as below mg l 1146 4 nh4cl 43 94 kh2po4 5 cacl2 10 mgso4 7h2o and 0 5 ml l of trace element solution the trace metals solution consisted of g l 1 50 fecl3 6h2o 0 06 na2moo4 2h2o 0 03 cuso4 5h2o 0 12 mncl2 4h2o 0 15 cocl2 6h2o 0 12 znso4 7h2o 0 15 h3bo3 0 18 ki and 10 ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid yang et al 2020 2 2 mass balance analysis of tcc in nitrifying cultures in stable operation mass balance analysis was carried out to indicate whether biodegradation was responsible for tcc removal the cyclic variations of tcc content in liquid and sludge phases were measured the removal of tcc refers to both adsorption and biodegradation and its removal efficiency is calculated by formula 1 1 removal efficiency of tcc c i c e c i where ci is the concentration of tcc in the influent and ce is the concentration of tcc in the effluent the biodegradation of tcc in different reactors is indicated by the loss of tcc which is calculated by formula 2 2 the loss of tcc m l t 1 m l t m s m s t 1 m l t 1 m s t 1 where ml t and ml t 1 is respectively the total mass of tcc in the liquor phase of reactor in the current t and previous time t 1 and ms t and ms t 1 is the total mass of tcc in the sludge phase of reactor in the current t and previous time t 1 respectively 2 3 batch tests for the analyses of sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm tcc adsorption kinetics experiment was carried out in a beaker with a working volume of 500 ml the beaker first received 250 ml the cultured nitrifying sludge withdrawn from the parent reactor it should be emphasized that these tests were performed without biomass inactivating synthetic wastewater was then added to the beaker to a final volume of 500 ml tcc concentration in the beaker was controlled at 1 mg l because this concentration was close to the maximal environmental concentration besides this concentration benefited to reduce tcc loss as compared with 0 1 mg l after tcc addition the beaker was mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm samples were taken from the beaker at 10 20 30 45 60 90 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 and 540 min respectively the collected samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8000 rpm and 4 c and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane before tcc measurement the pseudo second order kinetic model see details below are used to fit the data in addition ftir was used to characterize the change of functional groups on the sludge surface before and after adsorption of tcc 3 pseudo

beakers with a working volume of 500 ml each were performed each beaker received 250 ml nitrifying sludge removed from the parent reactor and then diluted with synthetic wastewater to a final volume of 500 ml the tcc concentrations in these beakers were respectively 0 1 0 5 1 2 2 5 and 5 mg l all other operations were the same as described in the adsorption kinetics test the freundlich langmuir

on nitrifiers after the parent reactor reached stable operation the following experiment was carried out in 4 replicate reactors with working volume of 3 l each a total of 12 l of sludge mixture was withdrawn from the parent reactor at the end of oxic phase and divided equally into the four reactors after a 2 h settling each reactor decanted 2 l of supernatant and received the same amount of fresh synthetic wastewaters the initial vss in each reactor was about 1200 mg l the wastewaters fed into the four reactors contained 0 0 1 1 or 5 mg l of tcc except tcc level other composition and concentration of the synthetic wastewaters were the same with the parent reactor all the operational conditions were also the same to the parent reactor due to the impact of tcc vss in the tcc presence reactors decreased with operation time and in stable operation vss was approximately 1210 1150 970 and 880 mg l in the 0 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc reactors respectively based on the measured total suspended solids and effluent total suspended solids srt in the 0 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc reactors in stable operation was estimated to be approximately 27 26 22 and 20 d respectively the effluent concentration of ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n nitrite nitrogen no 2 n and nitrate nitrogen no 3 n was recorded daily the values of volatile suspended solids vss sludge volume index svi and eps were recorded every five days after the reactors achieved stable operation cyclic measurements and microbial analysis were performed for cyclic measurements samples were obtained on days 86 90 and 94 nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n were measured every 30 min during one cycle the effect of tcc on the bacterial community was explored by high throughput sequencing and the samples were obtained on day 90 2 5 batch tests to measure the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob after tcc exposure for the measurement of aob and nob activities 500 ml mixed liquor was first withdrawn from each reactor operated above in stable operation on the 90th day centrifuged 5000 rpm for 5 min at 20 c and washed with tap water to remove the residual nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n and then re suspended in tap water with a final volume of 500 ml before being transformed in a reactor afterwards 5 ml nh 4 n stock solution 10 g n l and 5 ml no 2 n stock solution 10 g n l were respectively added to the reactor resulting in an initial nh 4 n and no 2 n concentration of 100 mg nh 4 n l and 100 mg no 2 n l respectively do was not limiting do 5 mg l while ph was controlled at 7 5 0 1 by dosing 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh during the whole experimental period each reactor was operated for 1 h during which samples were taken at 15 min intervals for nh 4 n and no 3 n measurements vss concentration was determined at the end of the test the volumetric nh 4 n oxidation or nitrate production rate were measured through linear regression of the corresponding profile and the aob and nob activities indicated by biomass specific nh 4 n oxidation and no 3 n production rates were then calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rates by the vss concentration 2 6 analytical methods the determinations of nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and vss were carried out in accordance with standard methods apha 1998 liu et al 2020a zhao et al 2018 polysaccharides and proteins were determined by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard respectively d wang et al 2019 liu et al 2019b temperature ph and do were detected using portable multiparameters detector wtw germany the infrared spectra of freeze dried sludge was measured in potassium bromide pellets via ftir according to the method reported previously feng et al 2018 dong et al 2019 a heat extraction method was applied to extract different eps fractions liu et al 2019a 2020b and the extraction process was detailed in supporting information text s1 tcc was detected by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry wang et al 2017 briefly 10 ml sample sludge was taken from the reactor centrifuged and dried using a vacuum dryer then 0 1 g dried sludge was weighed and dissolved in 10 ml trichloromethane the dissolved mixture was shaken for 5 min before being placed in an ultrasonic machine for 30 min and then collected in a 100 ml conical flask for the next solid phase extraction the collected samples were concentrated using a termovap sample concentrator and then cleaned with 20 ml of ultrapure water the clean out fluid was fractionated using solid phase oasis hlb cartridges 6 ml 200 mg sorbent the sample was desorbed from the cartridges with 12 ml of a methanol acetonitrile 1 1 solution and then evaporated under 1 ml with a weak nitrogen a constant volume of 1 ml solvent was filtered through 0 22 μm organic membranes prior to analysis 10 ml of water sample was taken out from the reactor and filtered through a 0 45 μm aqueous filter the filtered residue was dissolved in 30 ml of methanol followed by solid phase extraction as described above and filtration through 0 22 μm organic membranes after pretreatment the sample was injected into the detector for analysis the isocratic mobile phase used acetonitrile and ultrapure water at a following rate of 200 μl min the liquid chromatography was starting at 60 can with a ramp to 90 acn for 7 min held at 90 can over 2 min decreased back to 60 can for 1 min and finally held at 60 can for 3 min the samples were separated with bid 21 100 mm c18 column with 1 8 μm particle size preceded by an equivalent guard column a switching valve allowed sample to flow to the ms ms between 4 and 12 min of each 13 min run the source parameters were set as follows curtain gas 25 psi gas 1 70 psi gas 2 50 psi ion source 4500 ev temperature 500 c entrance potential ep 10 ev and collision activated dissociation cad gas 12 psi the bacterial community structure was assayed by pcr and high throughput sequencing in accordance with the reference mino et al 1998 dna was extracted from the withdrawn sludge using the fast dna kit mobio laboratories the quantity and purity were analyzed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de usa extracted dna was stored at 20 c the primers 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 targeting the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s dna genes were used for real time pcr assays the pcr amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 c for 2 min followed by 25 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the dna samples were then subjected to illumina miseq sequencing analysis illumina miseq pf300 platform the operation taxonomic units outs were divided into genus family class and phylum using the 97 identity thresholds for analyzing the taxonomic classification 2 7 statistical analysis all the measurements were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 tcc removal in nitrifying cultures in stable operation it was found that 0 06 0 02 0 58 0 03 and 2 47 0 06 mg l tcc were respectively determined in the effluent of the 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc reactors table 1 further calculations showed that when tcc concentration was in the range of 0 1 5 mg l tcc removal efficiency varied from 36 7 1 7 to 50 7 2 5 which was lower than that measured in conventional activated sludge processes by measuring the variation of tcc in a real wwtp lozano et al 2013 found that about 79 of influent tcc was removed by the conventional activated sludge process consisting of an anaerobic phase and an aerobic phase the anaerobic phase operated in the conventional activated sludge process might be the reason for the enhancement tcc removal through either adsorption or degradation it was documented that anaerobic phase is more effective in removal of some emerging pollutants e g perfluorooctanoic acid than oxic phase yang et al 2020 as real wwtps contain more abundant microbes than nitrifying cultures enriched in our lab an alternative explanation is that conventional activated sludge cultured in the wwtp may contain some microorganisms that can be effective in tcc removal organic removal is usually achieved by two behaviors i e adsorption and biodegradation to clarify the main behavior of tcc removal in these nitrifying cultures mass balance analyses of tcc in the liquid and sludge phases were performed with the results being summarized in table 1 it can be seen that with the decrease of tcc content in liquid phase tcc content in sludge phase increased however the sum of tcc content in liquid and sludge phases did not change largely in the reactors receiving 0 1 1 or 5 mg l tcc the sum of tcc content in the liquid and sludge phases at the end of oxic period decreased slightly as compared with that at the beginning of oxic period table 1 these changes were calculated to be statistically insignificant p 0 05 table s1 further calculations exhibited that the total tcc loss in the treatment process was less than 9 in all the nitrifying cultures this indicated that tcc present in wastewater was primarily removed through nitrifying cultures adsorption rather than biodegradation armstrong et al 2019 studied the fate of triclocarban and its transformation products during wastewater treatment and observed that tcc could not be significantly degraded during the nitrification process which well supported the results obtained in this work it can be also seen from table 1 that the loss of tcc i e biodegradation increased with the increase of influent tcc concentration probably due to that the increase of tcc benefits to enrich the tcc degradation microbes 3 2 mechanism of nitrifying cultures adsorb tcc to identify the adsorption behavior of tcc we first investigated the adsorption kinetics of nitrifying cultures it was observed that the pseudo second order model described the experimental data very well with r2 of 0 9997 being obtained fig 1a i this suggested that the adsorption of nitrifying cultures to tcc was dominated by chemical adsorption based on the model it was calculated that the equilibrium adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate of nitrifying cultures were 0 11 mg g and 0 02 mg g min respectively fig 1a ii li et al 2019 found that the equilibrium adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate of a magnetic nanocomposite fe3o4 cofs for tcc were 0 14 mg g and 0 71 mg g min respectively obviously the adsorption capacity and rate of nitrifying cultures were lower than those of the nanocomposite which might be the reason for nitrifying cultures obtaining low tcc removal efficiencies this is likely due to that the nanocomposite fe3o4 cofs has larger adsorption area than biomass i e nitrifiers the adsorption isotherm model is commonly used to describe the adsorption of organic matter from liquid phase to solid phase ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 in this work three adsorption isotherms models i e langmuir freundlich and temkin were employed with their fitting results being shown in fig 1b i 1b ii and 1b iii the freundlich langmuir and temkin adsorption isotherms models were mainly used to describe multi layer adsorption on irregular surfaces single layer adsorption on uniform surfaces and chemisorption process under electrostatic forces respectively gulnaz et al 2005 it was found that all the three adsorption isotherms models could be used to describe the experimental data with r2 0 7 being obtained in all the cases fig 1 b among them freundlich model was found to describe the tcc adsorption much better than the other two models with r2 of 0 9921 being obtained fig 1b ii the results indicated that the multi layer adsorption of irregular surfaces was mainly responsible for tcc adsorption the effect of tcc on the possible functional groups was investigated using ftir and the results are shown in fig 2 the peaks at 2927 cm 1 1653 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1242 cm 1 represent c h of the alkyl groups c o of secondary amide c o of carboxylate group and c n group respectively did not change significantly which might be due to the inability of these functional groups to interact with tcc compared to that before adsorption the peak at 3304 cm 1 represented o h showing a shift to 3423 cm 1 significantly after exposure to tcc and the intensity of the peak increased there was a peak at 1543 cm 1 corresponding to the absorption band of the amide in proteins after adsorption of tcc the peak shifted to 1546 cm 1 the peak at 1072 cm 1 representing c o c of polysaccharides showed a shift to 1053 cm 1 the changes in these functional groups indicated that hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides were the major adsorption sites when nitrifying cultures was exposed to tcc 3 3 impact of tcc on settleability of nitrifying cultures in stable operation it was found that the presence of tcc decreased vss with the increase of tcc concentration from 0 to 5 0 mg l vss decreased from 1200 90 mg l to 880 80 mg l fig 3 a one possible reason for this decrease is that tcc as a typical broad spectrum antimicrobial inhibited the growth of nitrifiers which can be supported by the data shown in table 2 please see the discussion in section 3 4 2 below since vss concentration is largely relevant to the settleability of biomass thus an alternative explanation is that the presence of tcc reduced the settleability of nitrifying cultures it can be observed that svi increased from 46 4 ml g to 90 5 ml g with tcc increasing from 0 to 5 0 mg l fig 3a confirming the decrease of the settleability in the tcc presence reactors fig 3b presents variations in eps components in the reactors as tcc concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg l protein and carbohydrate content in eps increased respectively from 79 1 5 4 and 26 6 4 1 to 107 9 5 3 and 39 8 3 2 mg g vss eps are the main components of activated sludge closely relating to the structure and function of microorganisms and protecting microorganisms in activated sludge from environmental toxins henriques and love 2007 relevant studies showed that the increase in svi and the deterioration of sludge settleability were mainly due to the increase in eps martínez et al 2004 all the results demonstrated that the presence of tcc stimulated the secretion of eps content of nitrifiers which thereby deteriorated the settleability 3 4 impact of tcc on performance of nitrifying cultures 3 4 1 impact of tcc on reactor performance fig 4 shows the effluent nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n during 80 d operation in the presence of different tcc concentrations it was found that effluent nh 4 n in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor was maintained at very low levels in the entire operation suggesting that 0 1 mg l did not inhibit aob obviously after 28 d operation however effluent no 2 n increased significantly accompanied with a significant decrease of effluent no 3 n indicating nob was suppressed by this level of tcc when 1 and 5 mg l tcc were used effluent nh 4 n started to be accumulated on day 55 and day 30 respectively however effluent no 2 n increased largely in the initial 5 days this indicated that tcc inhibited nob much severer than aob it should be emphasized that vss and nh 4 n and no 2 n oxidation rates in all the tcc presence reactors gradually decreased with operation time thus the low effluent nh 4 n and no 2 n concentrations in initial operation days were due to a combination of decreased vss and nh 4 n and no 2 n oxidation rates rather than a delay in inhibitory effect after about 60 d effluent nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n in all the tcc presence reactors did not changed with time obviously with an increase of tcc concentration from 0 to 5 mg l effluent nh 4 n increased from 0 41 0 03 to 104 65 3 46 mg l while effluent no 3 n decreased from 300 81 7 52 to 7 35 4 62 mg l this indicated that the presence of tcc inhibited both aob and nob the higher the tcc concentration the greater the inhibition due to the inhibition to nob effluent no 2 n increased consequently effluent no 2 n concentration increased from 0 45 0 23 to 182 06 7 54 mg l with tcc concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mg l it should be emphasized that compared with the control 0 1 mg l tcc environmentally relevant concentration that could be found in real wastewaters did not affect aob activity and this can be reflected by effluent nh 4 n data measured in the two reactors fig 4a however 0 1 mg l tcc led to a decrease of effluent no 3 n from 300 63 6 26 the control to 38 66 7 84 mg l in stable operation fig 4c suggesting that this level of tcc inhibited nob significantly the results indicated that aob could bear higher tcc concentration than nob in the literature it was also reported that aob could tolerate greater concentration of toxic substances such as free nitrous acid and free ammonia xu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 fig 5 exhibits cyclic variations of nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n during the 9 h oxic phase in stable operation most of nh 4 n in the control reactor was oxidized within 3 5 h accompanied with a rapid increase of no 2 n however no 3 n increased slowly in this period this suggested that aob and nob competed the available do do was controlled between 2 5 and 3 0 mg l during the oxic phase and aob could have a do advantage on nob when nh 4 n was almost consumed the produced no 2 n decreased quickly accompanied with an increase of no 3 n at the end of oxic phase 0 59 0 15 mg l of nh 4 n and 0 11 0 04 mg l of no 2 n were measured while 297 25 8 92 mg l of no 3 n was determined the cyclic variation of nh 4 n in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor showed almost the same to that in the control confirming again that this level of tcc did not inhibit aob activity however no 2 n concentration at any time measured in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor was higher than that in the control in addition no 3 n concentration in the former was much lower than that in the latter this demonstrated that 0 1 mg l tcc caused severe inhibition to nob when 1 mg l and 5 mg l tcc were added nh 4 n and no 2 n oxidations were inhibited obviously with 40 92 6 03 and 101 65 7 08 mg l nh 4 n 248 43 8 61 and 186 15 7 42 mg l no 2 n and 9 46 3 25 and 8 85 3 64 mg l no 3 n being measured at the end of oxic phase respectively 3 4 2 impact of tcc on aob and nob activities the bioprocesses of ammonium and nitrite oxidations are strongly associated with the activities and abundances of nitrifiers i e aob and nob to further understand how tcc presence affects ammonium and nitrite conversions the effect of tcc exposure on the specific activities of aob and nob was first investigated with the results being summarized in table 2 ammonium oxidation rate in the control without tcc can be considered the original activities of aob it can be seen that 0 1 mg l tcc decreased ammonium oxidation rate slightly statistical analysis showed this decrease was insignificant p 0 05 which indicated that this level of tcc did not affect aob activities when 1 and 5 mg l tcc was added aob activities reduced by 27 8 and 45 6 respectively compared with aob nob however was inhibited much severer by tcc it was calculated that 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc suppressed nob activity by 49 0 74 7 and 84 4 respectively it was clear that the presence of tcc caused different inhibitions to aob and nob activities and the inhibition to nob was much severer than that to aob this can well explain the data presented in figs 4 and 5 3 4 3 impact of tcc on the abundance of nitrifiers the abundance of aob and nob are also closely relevant to nitrogen transformation thus we finally compared the microbial communities among the reactors using illumina miseq sequencing the numbers of common and unique otus in the four microbial samples are shown in the form of wenn diagram the total number of otus of the four samples is 276 and the number of otus shared by the four samples is 140 it was found that 72 3 of otus was shared by the control and 0 1 mg l tcc reactors while the corresponding values were 63 0 by the control and 1 mg l tcc reactors and 56 2 by the control and 5 mg l tcc reactors fig s1 supporting information the higher the concentration of tcc the fewer the otus this indicated that tcc had an inhibitory effect on many microbes in nitrifying cultures the nitrification process is closely related to the abundance of some key microorganisms proteobacteria nitrospirae bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria and armatimonadetes deinococcus thermus were the predominate phyla in all the tested reactors accounting for 97 of the total bacterial sequences fig s2 supporting information with an increase of tcc most of the abundances of these phyla such as proteobacteria nitrospirae and bacteroidetes decreased however deinococcus thermus 1 10 increased from 1 to 10 with tcc concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mg l fig s2 supporting information suggesting that the bacteria belonged to this phyla can tolerate the toxicity of tcc fig 6 further shows the genus level distributions of microbial populations in the reactors in the control reactor without tcc addition one typical aob nitrosomonas sp and one representative nob nitrospira sp were detected which accounted for 30 and 16 of the total bacterial sequences respectively when 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc was added 11 6 and 2 of the relative abundances of nitrospira sp were respectively measured demonstrating that the presence of tcc highly suppressed nob however the relative populations of nitrosomonas sp increased in the presence of pertinent tcc the relative population of aob was measured at 38 in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor 49 in the 1 mg l tcc reactor and 47 in the 5 mg l tcc reactor it should be noted that the absolute abundance of aob decreased from 25187 to 20150 with tcc concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mg l the results confirmed again that the presence of tcc suppressed both aob and nob and the suppression to nob was much severe than that to aob which supported the effluent nitrogen data in figs 4 and 5 well apart from nitrifiers many other bacteria were also detected in these reactors for example several heterotrophic bacteria such as alphaproteobacteria sp chloroflexi unidentified and anaerolineae unidentified were determined in all the reactors the secretion or lysis products of nitrifiers can provide substrates for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria though no organic carbon was prepared in the synthetic wastewater moreover the relative abundances of arenimonas and truepera increased from 10 to 1 0 mg l tcc to 21 and 10 5 mg l tcc respectively it has been reported that arenimonas and truepera are highly resistant to environmental hazards barbara et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 as a consequence these bacteria can grow in the presence of toxic substances the toxicity of tcc to nitrifiers might be caused by the reaction of chlorine atoms on tcc with nitrifiers proteins tcc is an aniline compound having a plurality of cl fig s3 supporting information it is reported that aniline compounds can induce cell death by adsorbing and damaging the semipermeability of the cytoplasmic membrane interference of aniline on protein or phospholipid bilayers can destroy proton motive force on the bacterial surface and or disrupt active transport and energy metabolism snyder and o connor 2013 in addition mccarty 1999 mccarty and bremner 1989 demonstrated that heterocyclic nitrogen compounds containing cl on the ring had significant inhibitions to nitrification possibly due to that chlorine atom was a strongly polar group and a highly active nucleophilic group it is known that aob and nob have similar growth kinetics but our experimental results indicates that they have different thresholds to tcc inhibition thus one might want to know why aob can tolerate greater tcc than nob previous publications showed that external detrimental environments induce nitrosomonas to undergo oxidative stress which thereby up regulated a number of enzymes involved in oxidative stress such as ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine oxidoreductasem and other enzymes in dna and protein repairs laloo et al 2018 wood and sorensen 2001 these up regulated enzymes help to maintain homeostasis which might cause aob to be more tolerant to toxic substances than nob it was previously reported that nob is generally more sensitive than aob to the presence of toxic substances such as sulfide free nitrous acid chlorates hydrazine and halide laloo et al 2018 ge et al 2015 3 5 implications for wwtps operation this is the first work to reveal the fate of tcc in a nitrifying culture and its impact on nitrifiers filling a fundamental gap associated with tcc toxicity to the nitrification process due to the limit adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of biomass 36 7 50 7 of wastewater tcc was only removed through adsorption by nitrifying cultures in stable operation to enhance tcc removal in real wwtps pertinent increase of vss concentration in bioreactors is therefore needed the results demonstrated that tcc even at environmentally relevant levels inhibited nitrifiers suggesting that manipulation of wastewater treatment process e g using biofilm based wastewater treatment process to replace conventional activated sludge process to mitigate the negative impact of tcc or other emerging pollutants is urgently required considering that tcc caused severer inhibition to nob than aob thus nitritation based nitrogen removal technologies e g mainstream deammonifcation are highly recommended experimental results also showed that the removal of tcc was mainly achieved through biomass adsorption which inevitably resulted in sludge tcc at high levels it is therefore necessary to assess its impact on the subsequent sludge treatment process e g anaerobic digestion of sludge in the future apart from nitrifiers biological wastewater treatment processes also contain other functional microbes such as denitrifiers and phosphorus accumulating organisms thus the fate and impact of tcc in these microbes are necessitated to be evaluated as well based on the systematic assessments strategies that can enhance tcc removal especially tcc degradation and mitigate its negative impact on function microbes in wwtps concurrently may be developed efficiently 4 conclusion the results showed that nitrifying cultures removed about 36 7 50 7 of wastewater tcc mainly by inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption in stable operation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that several functional groups such as hydroxyl amide and polysaccharide seemed to be the main adsorption sites the adsorbed tcc significantly deteriorated settleability and performance of nitrifying cultures when influent tcc increased from 0 to 5 mg l vss concentration in reactor and effluent nitrate decreased from 1200 90 mg l and 300 81 7 52 mg l to 880 80 and 7 35 4 62 mg l respectively meanwhile effluent ammonium and nitrite increased from 0 41 0 03 and 0 45 0 23 mg l to104 65 3 46 and 182 06 7 54 mg l respectively it was further observed that tcc even at environmentally relevant level i e 0 1 mg l increased the extracellular polymeric substances of nitrifying cultures inhibited the specific activities of nitrifiers and decreased the abundance of nitrifiers especially nitrospira sp these findings obtained from this study would expand the understanding scope for tcc s toxicity to nitrifying culture and may have important implications on the future operation of wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17925,triclocarban tcc is a highly effective antibacterial agent which is widely used in a variety of applications and present at significant levels e g 760 μg l in wastewater worldwide however the interaction between tcc and nitrifiers important microbial cultures in wastewater treatment plants has not been documented this work therefore aimed to evaluate the fate of tcc in a nitrifying culture and its impact on nitrifiers in four long term nitrifiers rich reactors which received synthetic wastewater containing 0 0 1 1 or 5 mg l tcc experimental results showed that 36 7 50 7 of wastewater tcc was removed by nitrifying cultures in stable operation mass balance analysis revealed that the removal of tcc was mainly achieved through adsorption rather than biodegradation adsorption kinetic analysis indicated that inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for the removal while fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that several functional groups such as hydroxyl amide and polysaccharide seemed to be the main adsorption sites the adsorbed tcc significantly deteriorated settleability and performance of nitrifying cultures with an increase of influent tcc from 0 to 5 mg l reactor volatile suspended solids and effluent nitrate decreased from 1200 90 mg l and 300 81 7 52 mg l to 880 80 and 7 35 4 62 mg l while effluent ammonium and nitrite increased from 0 41 0 03 and 0 45 0 23 mg l to104 65 3 46 and 182 06 7 54 mg l respectively tcc increased the extracellular polymeric substances of nitrifying cultures inhibited the specific activities of nitrifiers and altered the abundance of nitrifiers especially nitrospira sp in particular tcc at environmentally relevant concentration i e 0 1 mg l significantly inhibited nob activity and reduced nob population graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrifiers wastewater treatment adsorption triclocarban toxicity 1 introduction triclocarban tcc is one typical broad spectrum antimicrobial that is extensively used as an additive in numerous personal care products and household consumables such as soaps shampoos cosmetics toothpastes and kitchen utensils gautam et al 2014 it was documented that each person daily consumed 2 06 0 68 mg tcc and its consumption amount achieved 227 454 tons in usa annually usepa 2002 the large use of tcc inevitably leads to its environmental release recently tcc is ubiquitously detected in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in 2014 brumovsky et al 2017 investigated the open surface water of western mediterranean sea and confirmed the existence of tcc even far beyond the environmental test line i e 5 6 μg l it is reported that the tcc concentrations detected by halden and paul 2004 and 2005 in river and wastewater of baltimore urban streams reached 5 6 μg l and 6 75 μg l in 2005 respectively in 2013 subedi et al 2017 investigated raw wastewater influent of sewage treatment plant in the state of karnataka southern india and found tcc concentration was in the range of 1 2 10 μg l according to our survey on five wwtps in central china e g changsha in 2018 tcc concentration in municipal sewage ranged from 60 to 760 μg l the widespread existence of tcc readily contacts organisms in environment and is even accumulated into organisms at significant levels it was documented that tcc accumulated was 300 ng g in algae 69 ng g in rats 92 9 ng g in feces and 79 μg g in human urine respectively coogan et al 2007 kennedy et al 2015 schebb et al 2011 as an antibacterial agent tcc could inhibit the growth and metabolisms of microbes through either impairing the reproductive system nolen and dierckman 1979 or disturbing the estrogen and androgen receptors schebb et al 2011 yang et al 2008 demonstrated that tcc had strong inhibitory effects on algae p subcapitata with 50 inhibition concentration of 17 5 μg l for algal growth tcc caused antibiotic toxicity to c elegans with 50 inhibition concentration being 910 μg l lenz et al 2017 thus the fate of tcc in environment and its potential toxicity to organisms have recently attracted increasing attention as the last barriers before the released tcc into the natural environment wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major places to remove wastewater tcc thereby playing a crucial role in alleviating its environmental risks in the past years several efforts were dedicated to investigating the removal of tcc in wastewater treatment process and demonstrated that tcc was incompletely removed with 75 98 removal efficiency be usually achieved during the whole wastewater treatment employing conventional activated sludge process gautam et al 2014 chalew and halen 2009 lozano et al 2013 found that in a wwtp in the mid atlantic region of u s the concentration of tcc was 4 92 1 00 μg l in the influent but only 0 13 0 01 μg l in the effluent with 13 1 0 9 μg g dry wt being detected in activated sludge suggesting that most of tcc were transferred from wastewater to waste activated sludge by measuring the concentrations of tcc in influent and effluent of a typical wwtp in u s halden 2014 also demonstrated that 97 1 of tcc present in wastewater was removed besides wang et al 2017 2019 2020 found that the presence of tcc severely inhibited the activities of anaerobes such as methanogens however these previous studies merely demonstrated either the transportation of tcc from the liquid to sludge phase in wastewater treatment process or the impact of tcc on anaerobes in sludge treatment process nitrifiers which are key aerobic bacteria in wwtps responsible for oxidation of ammonium play significant roles in nitrogen removal in wwtps the presence of tcc in wastewater might be intercepted by nitrifiers and therefore affects the activities of nitrifiers to date however the interaction between tcc and nitrifiers is still poorly understood thus the objective of this study is to assess the fate of tcc in nitrifying cultures and its impact on nitrifiers firstly the fate of tcc in nitrifying cultures was comprehensively investigated by assessing the removal efficiency of tcc differentiating the contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to tcc removal analyzing the sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm and identifying the possible adsorption sites then the effect of tcc ranging from 0 to 5 mg l on nitrifiers was investigated finally details of how tcc affects nitrifiers were explored through analyzing the variations of extracellular polymeric substances eps transformations of metabolic intermediates and variations in specific activities of nitrifiers and microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of parent reactor a 16 l working volume reactor was operated in a temperature controlled room 22 1 c as the parent reactor to enrich nitrifiers the reactor was fed with a synthetic medium containing 300 mg nh 4 n l and without any organic carbon the seed sludge was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the reactor was operated two cycles daily each cycle consisted of a 9 0 h oxic phase and a 2 h settling phase followed by 20 min decanting and 40 min idle phases in the last 10 min of the idle phase 10 l synthetic wastewater with composition described as below was pumped into the reactor dissolved oxygen do was maintained between 2 5 and 3 0 mg l in the oxic phase using a programmed logic controller and ph in this phase was controlled at 7 5 by dosing 1 m nahco3 the hydraulic retention time hrt were maintained at 14 h it should be emphasized that no sludge wasting was conducted here and the sludge retention time srt in stable operation was estimated to be 27 d approximately on the basis of the measured total suspended solids and effluent total suspended solids after about 2 month operation stable operation 0 6 0 3 mg n l of effluent ammonia 1 5 0 5 mg n l of effluent nitrite and 290 10 0 mg n l of effluent nitrate was achieved in this parent reactor and then the sludge was withdrawn for the following tests synthetic medium was used in this work and prepared daily to enrich nitrifiers the synthetic medium contained approximately 300 mg l ammonium nh 4 n without organic carbon source the detailed composition of synthetic wastewater was as below mg l 1146 4 nh4cl 43 94 kh2po4 5 cacl2 10 mgso4 7h2o and 0 5 ml l of trace element solution the trace metals solution consisted of g l 1 50 fecl3 6h2o 0 06 na2moo4 2h2o 0 03 cuso4 5h2o 0 12 mncl2 4h2o 0 15 cocl2 6h2o 0 12 znso4 7h2o 0 15 h3bo3 0 18 ki and 10 ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid yang et al 2020 2 2 mass balance analysis of tcc in nitrifying cultures in stable operation mass balance analysis was carried out to indicate whether biodegradation was responsible for tcc removal the cyclic variations of tcc content in liquid and sludge phases were measured the removal of tcc refers to both adsorption and biodegradation and its removal efficiency is calculated by formula 1 1 removal efficiency of tcc c i c e c i where ci is the concentration of tcc in the influent and ce is the concentration of tcc in the effluent the biodegradation of tcc in different reactors is indicated by the loss of tcc which is calculated by formula 2 2 the loss of tcc m l t 1 m l t m s m s t 1 m l t 1 m s t 1 where ml t and ml t 1 is respectively the total mass of tcc in the liquor phase of reactor in the current t and previous time t 1 and ms t and ms t 1 is the total mass of tcc in the sludge phase of reactor in the current t and previous time t 1 respectively 2 3 batch tests for the analyses of sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm tcc adsorption kinetics experiment was carried out in a beaker with a working volume of 500 ml the beaker first received 250 ml the cultured nitrifying sludge withdrawn from the parent reactor it should be emphasized that these tests were performed without biomass inactivating synthetic wastewater was then added to the beaker to a final volume of 500 ml tcc concentration in the beaker was controlled at 1 mg l because this concentration was close to the maximal environmental concentration besides this concentration benefited to reduce tcc loss as compared with 0 1 mg l after tcc addition the beaker was mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm samples were taken from the beaker at 10 20 30 45 60 90 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 and 540 min respectively the collected samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8000 rpm and 4 c and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane before tcc measurement the pseudo second order kinetic model see details below are used to fit the data in addition ftir was used to characterize the change of functional groups on the sludge surface before and after adsorption of tcc 3 pseudo

beakers with a working volume of 500 ml each were performed each beaker received 250 ml nitrifying sludge removed from the parent reactor and then diluted with synthetic wastewater to a final volume of 500 ml the tcc concentrations in these beakers were respectively 0 1 0 5 1 2 2 5 and 5 mg l all other operations were the same as described in the adsorption kinetics test the freundlich langmuir

on nitrifiers after the parent reactor reached stable operation the following experiment was carried out in 4 replicate reactors with working volume of 3 l each a total of 12 l of sludge mixture was withdrawn from the parent reactor at the end of oxic phase and divided equally into the four reactors after a 2 h settling each reactor decanted 2 l of supernatant and received the same amount of fresh synthetic wastewaters the initial vss in each reactor was about 1200 mg l the wastewaters fed into the four reactors contained 0 0 1 1 or 5 mg l of tcc except tcc level other composition and concentration of the synthetic wastewaters were the same with the parent reactor all the operational conditions were also the same to the parent reactor due to the impact of tcc vss in the tcc presence reactors decreased with operation time and in stable operation vss was approximately 1210 1150 970 and 880 mg l in the 0 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc reactors respectively based on the measured total suspended solids and effluent total suspended solids srt in the 0 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc reactors in stable operation was estimated to be approximately 27 26 22 and 20 d respectively the effluent concentration of ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n nitrite nitrogen no 2 n and nitrate nitrogen no 3 n was recorded daily the values of volatile suspended solids vss sludge volume index svi and eps were recorded every five days after the reactors achieved stable operation cyclic measurements and microbial analysis were performed for cyclic measurements samples were obtained on days 86 90 and 94 nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n were measured every 30 min during one cycle the effect of tcc on the bacterial community was explored by high throughput sequencing and the samples were obtained on day 90 2 5 batch tests to measure the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob after tcc exposure for the measurement of aob and nob activities 500 ml mixed liquor was first withdrawn from each reactor operated above in stable operation on the 90th day centrifuged 5000 rpm for 5 min at 20 c and washed with tap water to remove the residual nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n and then re suspended in tap water with a final volume of 500 ml before being transformed in a reactor afterwards 5 ml nh 4 n stock solution 10 g n l and 5 ml no 2 n stock solution 10 g n l were respectively added to the reactor resulting in an initial nh 4 n and no 2 n concentration of 100 mg nh 4 n l and 100 mg no 2 n l respectively do was not limiting do 5 mg l while ph was controlled at 7 5 0 1 by dosing 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh during the whole experimental period each reactor was operated for 1 h during which samples were taken at 15 min intervals for nh 4 n and no 3 n measurements vss concentration was determined at the end of the test the volumetric nh 4 n oxidation or nitrate production rate were measured through linear regression of the corresponding profile and the aob and nob activities indicated by biomass specific nh 4 n oxidation and no 3 n production rates were then calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rates by the vss concentration 2 6 analytical methods the determinations of nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and vss were carried out in accordance with standard methods apha 1998 liu et al 2020a zhao et al 2018 polysaccharides and proteins were determined by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard respectively d wang et al 2019 liu et al 2019b temperature ph and do were detected using portable multiparameters detector wtw germany the infrared spectra of freeze dried sludge was measured in potassium bromide pellets via ftir according to the method reported previously feng et al 2018 dong et al 2019 a heat extraction method was applied to extract different eps fractions liu et al 2019a 2020b and the extraction process was detailed in supporting information text s1 tcc was detected by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry wang et al 2017 briefly 10 ml sample sludge was taken from the reactor centrifuged and dried using a vacuum dryer then 0 1 g dried sludge was weighed and dissolved in 10 ml trichloromethane the dissolved mixture was shaken for 5 min before being placed in an ultrasonic machine for 30 min and then collected in a 100 ml conical flask for the next solid phase extraction the collected samples were concentrated using a termovap sample concentrator and then cleaned with 20 ml of ultrapure water the clean out fluid was fractionated using solid phase oasis hlb cartridges 6 ml 200 mg sorbent the sample was desorbed from the cartridges with 12 ml of a methanol acetonitrile 1 1 solution and then evaporated under 1 ml with a weak nitrogen a constant volume of 1 ml solvent was filtered through 0 22 μm organic membranes prior to analysis 10 ml of water sample was taken out from the reactor and filtered through a 0 45 μm aqueous filter the filtered residue was dissolved in 30 ml of methanol followed by solid phase extraction as described above and filtration through 0 22 μm organic membranes after pretreatment the sample was injected into the detector for analysis the isocratic mobile phase used acetonitrile and ultrapure water at a following rate of 200 μl min the liquid chromatography was starting at 60 can with a ramp to 90 acn for 7 min held at 90 can over 2 min decreased back to 60 can for 1 min and finally held at 60 can for 3 min the samples were separated with bid 21 100 mm c18 column with 1 8 μm particle size preceded by an equivalent guard column a switching valve allowed sample to flow to the ms ms between 4 and 12 min of each 13 min run the source parameters were set as follows curtain gas 25 psi gas 1 70 psi gas 2 50 psi ion source 4500 ev temperature 500 c entrance potential ep 10 ev and collision activated dissociation cad gas 12 psi the bacterial community structure was assayed by pcr and high throughput sequencing in accordance with the reference mino et al 1998 dna was extracted from the withdrawn sludge using the fast dna kit mobio laboratories the quantity and purity were analyzed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de usa extracted dna was stored at 20 c the primers 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 targeting the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s dna genes were used for real time pcr assays the pcr amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 c for 2 min followed by 25 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the dna samples were then subjected to illumina miseq sequencing analysis illumina miseq pf300 platform the operation taxonomic units outs were divided into genus family class and phylum using the 97 identity thresholds for analyzing the taxonomic classification 2 7 statistical analysis all the measurements were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 tcc removal in nitrifying cultures in stable operation it was found that 0 06 0 02 0 58 0 03 and 2 47 0 06 mg l tcc were respectively determined in the effluent of the 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc reactors table 1 further calculations showed that when tcc concentration was in the range of 0 1 5 mg l tcc removal efficiency varied from 36 7 1 7 to 50 7 2 5 which was lower than that measured in conventional activated sludge processes by measuring the variation of tcc in a real wwtp lozano et al 2013 found that about 79 of influent tcc was removed by the conventional activated sludge process consisting of an anaerobic phase and an aerobic phase the anaerobic phase operated in the conventional activated sludge process might be the reason for the enhancement tcc removal through either adsorption or degradation it was documented that anaerobic phase is more effective in removal of some emerging pollutants e g perfluorooctanoic acid than oxic phase yang et al 2020 as real wwtps contain more abundant microbes than nitrifying cultures enriched in our lab an alternative explanation is that conventional activated sludge cultured in the wwtp may contain some microorganisms that can be effective in tcc removal organic removal is usually achieved by two behaviors i e adsorption and biodegradation to clarify the main behavior of tcc removal in these nitrifying cultures mass balance analyses of tcc in the liquid and sludge phases were performed with the results being summarized in table 1 it can be seen that with the decrease of tcc content in liquid phase tcc content in sludge phase increased however the sum of tcc content in liquid and sludge phases did not change largely in the reactors receiving 0 1 1 or 5 mg l tcc the sum of tcc content in the liquid and sludge phases at the end of oxic period decreased slightly as compared with that at the beginning of oxic period table 1 these changes were calculated to be statistically insignificant p 0 05 table s1 further calculations exhibited that the total tcc loss in the treatment process was less than 9 in all the nitrifying cultures this indicated that tcc present in wastewater was primarily removed through nitrifying cultures adsorption rather than biodegradation armstrong et al 2019 studied the fate of triclocarban and its transformation products during wastewater treatment and observed that tcc could not be significantly degraded during the nitrification process which well supported the results obtained in this work it can be also seen from table 1 that the loss of tcc i e biodegradation increased with the increase of influent tcc concentration probably due to that the increase of tcc benefits to enrich the tcc degradation microbes 3 2 mechanism of nitrifying cultures adsorb tcc to identify the adsorption behavior of tcc we first investigated the adsorption kinetics of nitrifying cultures it was observed that the pseudo second order model described the experimental data very well with r2 of 0 9997 being obtained fig 1a i this suggested that the adsorption of nitrifying cultures to tcc was dominated by chemical adsorption based on the model it was calculated that the equilibrium adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate of nitrifying cultures were 0 11 mg g and 0 02 mg g min respectively fig 1a ii li et al 2019 found that the equilibrium adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate of a magnetic nanocomposite fe3o4 cofs for tcc were 0 14 mg g and 0 71 mg g min respectively obviously the adsorption capacity and rate of nitrifying cultures were lower than those of the nanocomposite which might be the reason for nitrifying cultures obtaining low tcc removal efficiencies this is likely due to that the nanocomposite fe3o4 cofs has larger adsorption area than biomass i e nitrifiers the adsorption isotherm model is commonly used to describe the adsorption of organic matter from liquid phase to solid phase ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 in this work three adsorption isotherms models i e langmuir freundlich and temkin were employed with their fitting results being shown in fig 1b i 1b ii and 1b iii the freundlich langmuir and temkin adsorption isotherms models were mainly used to describe multi layer adsorption on irregular surfaces single layer adsorption on uniform surfaces and chemisorption process under electrostatic forces respectively gulnaz et al 2005 it was found that all the three adsorption isotherms models could be used to describe the experimental data with r2 0 7 being obtained in all the cases fig 1 b among them freundlich model was found to describe the tcc adsorption much better than the other two models with r2 of 0 9921 being obtained fig 1b ii the results indicated that the multi layer adsorption of irregular surfaces was mainly responsible for tcc adsorption the effect of tcc on the possible functional groups was investigated using ftir and the results are shown in fig 2 the peaks at 2927 cm 1 1653 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1242 cm 1 represent c h of the alkyl groups c o of secondary amide c o of carboxylate group and c n group respectively did not change significantly which might be due to the inability of these functional groups to interact with tcc compared to that before adsorption the peak at 3304 cm 1 represented o h showing a shift to 3423 cm 1 significantly after exposure to tcc and the intensity of the peak increased there was a peak at 1543 cm 1 corresponding to the absorption band of the amide in proteins after adsorption of tcc the peak shifted to 1546 cm 1 the peak at 1072 cm 1 representing c o c of polysaccharides showed a shift to 1053 cm 1 the changes in these functional groups indicated that hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides were the major adsorption sites when nitrifying cultures was exposed to tcc 3 3 impact of tcc on settleability of nitrifying cultures in stable operation it was found that the presence of tcc decreased vss with the increase of tcc concentration from 0 to 5 0 mg l vss decreased from 1200 90 mg l to 880 80 mg l fig 3 a one possible reason for this decrease is that tcc as a typical broad spectrum antimicrobial inhibited the growth of nitrifiers which can be supported by the data shown in table 2 please see the discussion in section 3 4 2 below since vss concentration is largely relevant to the settleability of biomass thus an alternative explanation is that the presence of tcc reduced the settleability of nitrifying cultures it can be observed that svi increased from 46 4 ml g to 90 5 ml g with tcc increasing from 0 to 5 0 mg l fig 3a confirming the decrease of the settleability in the tcc presence reactors fig 3b presents variations in eps components in the reactors as tcc concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg l protein and carbohydrate content in eps increased respectively from 79 1 5 4 and 26 6 4 1 to 107 9 5 3 and 39 8 3 2 mg g vss eps are the main components of activated sludge closely relating to the structure and function of microorganisms and protecting microorganisms in activated sludge from environmental toxins henriques and love 2007 relevant studies showed that the increase in svi and the deterioration of sludge settleability were mainly due to the increase in eps martínez et al 2004 all the results demonstrated that the presence of tcc stimulated the secretion of eps content of nitrifiers which thereby deteriorated the settleability 3 4 impact of tcc on performance of nitrifying cultures 3 4 1 impact of tcc on reactor performance fig 4 shows the effluent nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n during 80 d operation in the presence of different tcc concentrations it was found that effluent nh 4 n in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor was maintained at very low levels in the entire operation suggesting that 0 1 mg l did not inhibit aob obviously after 28 d operation however effluent no 2 n increased significantly accompanied with a significant decrease of effluent no 3 n indicating nob was suppressed by this level of tcc when 1 and 5 mg l tcc were used effluent nh 4 n started to be accumulated on day 55 and day 30 respectively however effluent no 2 n increased largely in the initial 5 days this indicated that tcc inhibited nob much severer than aob it should be emphasized that vss and nh 4 n and no 2 n oxidation rates in all the tcc presence reactors gradually decreased with operation time thus the low effluent nh 4 n and no 2 n concentrations in initial operation days were due to a combination of decreased vss and nh 4 n and no 2 n oxidation rates rather than a delay in inhibitory effect after about 60 d effluent nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n in all the tcc presence reactors did not changed with time obviously with an increase of tcc concentration from 0 to 5 mg l effluent nh 4 n increased from 0 41 0 03 to 104 65 3 46 mg l while effluent no 3 n decreased from 300 81 7 52 to 7 35 4 62 mg l this indicated that the presence of tcc inhibited both aob and nob the higher the tcc concentration the greater the inhibition due to the inhibition to nob effluent no 2 n increased consequently effluent no 2 n concentration increased from 0 45 0 23 to 182 06 7 54 mg l with tcc concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mg l it should be emphasized that compared with the control 0 1 mg l tcc environmentally relevant concentration that could be found in real wastewaters did not affect aob activity and this can be reflected by effluent nh 4 n data measured in the two reactors fig 4a however 0 1 mg l tcc led to a decrease of effluent no 3 n from 300 63 6 26 the control to 38 66 7 84 mg l in stable operation fig 4c suggesting that this level of tcc inhibited nob significantly the results indicated that aob could bear higher tcc concentration than nob in the literature it was also reported that aob could tolerate greater concentration of toxic substances such as free nitrous acid and free ammonia xu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 fig 5 exhibits cyclic variations of nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n during the 9 h oxic phase in stable operation most of nh 4 n in the control reactor was oxidized within 3 5 h accompanied with a rapid increase of no 2 n however no 3 n increased slowly in this period this suggested that aob and nob competed the available do do was controlled between 2 5 and 3 0 mg l during the oxic phase and aob could have a do advantage on nob when nh 4 n was almost consumed the produced no 2 n decreased quickly accompanied with an increase of no 3 n at the end of oxic phase 0 59 0 15 mg l of nh 4 n and 0 11 0 04 mg l of no 2 n were measured while 297 25 8 92 mg l of no 3 n was determined the cyclic variation of nh 4 n in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor showed almost the same to that in the control confirming again that this level of tcc did not inhibit aob activity however no 2 n concentration at any time measured in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor was higher than that in the control in addition no 3 n concentration in the former was much lower than that in the latter this demonstrated that 0 1 mg l tcc caused severe inhibition to nob when 1 mg l and 5 mg l tcc were added nh 4 n and no 2 n oxidations were inhibited obviously with 40 92 6 03 and 101 65 7 08 mg l nh 4 n 248 43 8 61 and 186 15 7 42 mg l no 2 n and 9 46 3 25 and 8 85 3 64 mg l no 3 n being measured at the end of oxic phase respectively 3 4 2 impact of tcc on aob and nob activities the bioprocesses of ammonium and nitrite oxidations are strongly associated with the activities and abundances of nitrifiers i e aob and nob to further understand how tcc presence affects ammonium and nitrite conversions the effect of tcc exposure on the specific activities of aob and nob was first investigated with the results being summarized in table 2 ammonium oxidation rate in the control without tcc can be considered the original activities of aob it can be seen that 0 1 mg l tcc decreased ammonium oxidation rate slightly statistical analysis showed this decrease was insignificant p 0 05 which indicated that this level of tcc did not affect aob activities when 1 and 5 mg l tcc was added aob activities reduced by 27 8 and 45 6 respectively compared with aob nob however was inhibited much severer by tcc it was calculated that 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc suppressed nob activity by 49 0 74 7 and 84 4 respectively it was clear that the presence of tcc caused different inhibitions to aob and nob activities and the inhibition to nob was much severer than that to aob this can well explain the data presented in figs 4 and 5 3 4 3 impact of tcc on the abundance of nitrifiers the abundance of aob and nob are also closely relevant to nitrogen transformation thus we finally compared the microbial communities among the reactors using illumina miseq sequencing the numbers of common and unique otus in the four microbial samples are shown in the form of wenn diagram the total number of otus of the four samples is 276 and the number of otus shared by the four samples is 140 it was found that 72 3 of otus was shared by the control and 0 1 mg l tcc reactors while the corresponding values were 63 0 by the control and 1 mg l tcc reactors and 56 2 by the control and 5 mg l tcc reactors fig s1 supporting information the higher the concentration of tcc the fewer the otus this indicated that tcc had an inhibitory effect on many microbes in nitrifying cultures the nitrification process is closely related to the abundance of some key microorganisms proteobacteria nitrospirae bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria and armatimonadetes deinococcus thermus were the predominate phyla in all the tested reactors accounting for 97 of the total bacterial sequences fig s2 supporting information with an increase of tcc most of the abundances of these phyla such as proteobacteria nitrospirae and bacteroidetes decreased however deinococcus thermus 1 10 increased from 1 to 10 with tcc concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mg l fig s2 supporting information suggesting that the bacteria belonged to this phyla can tolerate the toxicity of tcc fig 6 further shows the genus level distributions of microbial populations in the reactors in the control reactor without tcc addition one typical aob nitrosomonas sp and one representative nob nitrospira sp were detected which accounted for 30 and 16 of the total bacterial sequences respectively when 0 1 1 and 5 mg l tcc was added 11 6 and 2 of the relative abundances of nitrospira sp were respectively measured demonstrating that the presence of tcc highly suppressed nob however the relative populations of nitrosomonas sp increased in the presence of pertinent tcc the relative population of aob was measured at 38 in the 0 1 mg l tcc reactor 49 in the 1 mg l tcc reactor and 47 in the 5 mg l tcc reactor it should be noted that the absolute abundance of aob decreased from 25187 to 20150 with tcc concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mg l the results confirmed again that the presence of tcc suppressed both aob and nob and the suppression to nob was much severe than that to aob which supported the effluent nitrogen data in figs 4 and 5 well apart from nitrifiers many other bacteria were also detected in these reactors for example several heterotrophic bacteria such as alphaproteobacteria sp chloroflexi unidentified and anaerolineae unidentified were determined in all the reactors the secretion or lysis products of nitrifiers can provide substrates for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria though no organic carbon was prepared in the synthetic wastewater moreover the relative abundances of arenimonas and truepera increased from 10 to 1 0 mg l tcc to 21 and 10 5 mg l tcc respectively it has been reported that arenimonas and truepera are highly resistant to environmental hazards barbara et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 as a consequence these bacteria can grow in the presence of toxic substances the toxicity of tcc to nitrifiers might be caused by the reaction of chlorine atoms on tcc with nitrifiers proteins tcc is an aniline compound having a plurality of cl fig s3 supporting information it is reported that aniline compounds can induce cell death by adsorbing and damaging the semipermeability of the cytoplasmic membrane interference of aniline on protein or phospholipid bilayers can destroy proton motive force on the bacterial surface and or disrupt active transport and energy metabolism snyder and o connor 2013 in addition mccarty 1999 mccarty and bremner 1989 demonstrated that heterocyclic nitrogen compounds containing cl on the ring had significant inhibitions to nitrification possibly due to that chlorine atom was a strongly polar group and a highly active nucleophilic group it is known that aob and nob have similar growth kinetics but our experimental results indicates that they have different thresholds to tcc inhibition thus one might want to know why aob can tolerate greater tcc than nob previous publications showed that external detrimental environments induce nitrosomonas to undergo oxidative stress which thereby up regulated a number of enzymes involved in oxidative stress such as ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine oxidoreductasem and other enzymes in dna and protein repairs laloo et al 2018 wood and sorensen 2001 these up regulated enzymes help to maintain homeostasis which might cause aob to be more tolerant to toxic substances than nob it was previously reported that nob is generally more sensitive than aob to the presence of toxic substances such as sulfide free nitrous acid chlorates hydrazine and halide laloo et al 2018 ge et al 2015 3 5 implications for wwtps operation this is the first work to reveal the fate of tcc in a nitrifying culture and its impact on nitrifiers filling a fundamental gap associated with tcc toxicity to the nitrification process due to the limit adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of biomass 36 7 50 7 of wastewater tcc was only removed through adsorption by nitrifying cultures in stable operation to enhance tcc removal in real wwtps pertinent increase of vss concentration in bioreactors is therefore needed the results demonstrated that tcc even at environmentally relevant levels inhibited nitrifiers suggesting that manipulation of wastewater treatment process e g using biofilm based wastewater treatment process to replace conventional activated sludge process to mitigate the negative impact of tcc or other emerging pollutants is urgently required considering that tcc caused severer inhibition to nob than aob thus nitritation based nitrogen removal technologies e g mainstream deammonifcation are highly recommended experimental results also showed that the removal of tcc was mainly achieved through biomass adsorption which inevitably resulted in sludge tcc at high levels it is therefore necessary to assess its impact on the subsequent sludge treatment process e g anaerobic digestion of sludge in the future apart from nitrifiers biological wastewater treatment processes also contain other functional microbes such as denitrifiers and phosphorus accumulating organisms thus the fate and impact of tcc in these microbes are necessitated to be evaluated as well based on the systematic assessments strategies that can enhance tcc removal especially tcc degradation and mitigate its negative impact on function microbes in wwtps concurrently may be developed efficiently 4 conclusion the results showed that nitrifying cultures removed about 36 7 50 7 of wastewater tcc mainly by inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption in stable operation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that several functional groups such as hydroxyl amide and polysaccharide seemed to be the main adsorption sites the adsorbed tcc significantly deteriorated settleability and performance of nitrifying cultures when influent tcc increased from 0 to 5 mg l vss concentration in reactor and effluent nitrate decreased from 1200 90 mg l and 300 81 7 52 mg l to 880 80 and 7 35 4 62 mg l respectively meanwhile effluent ammonium and nitrite increased from 0 41 0 03 and 0 45 0 23 mg l to104 65 3 46 and 182 06 7 54 mg l respectively it was further observed that tcc even at environmentally relevant level i e 0 1 mg l increased the extracellular polymeric substances of nitrifying cultures inhibited the specific activities of nitrifiers and decreased the abundance of nitrifiers especially nitrospira sp these findings obtained from this study would expand the understanding scope for tcc s toxicity to nitrifying culture and may have important implications on the future operation of wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17926,biofilm community of bacteria ubiquitously present in natural environment may interact with plastic particles and affect the transport of plastic particles in environment the significance of biofilm escherichia coli on the transport and deposition behaviors of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mp and 2 μm mp were examined under both 10 mm and 50 mm nacl solutions by comparing the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of plastic particles in bare sand versus those in biofilm coated sand regardless of ionic strengths the presence of biofilm increases the deposition of all three sized plastic particles in porous media via employing x ray microtomography imaging xmt and scanning electron microscope sem we find that the presence of biofilm could narrow the flow path especially near to the inlet of the column and increase the surface roughness of porous media by decreasing dlvo repulsive interaction which contributes to the enhanced the deposition of plastic particles extracellular polymeric substances eps present on the biofilm are found to contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles packed column experiments quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d as well as parallel plate flow chamber experiments all show that three major components of eps proteins polysaccharide and humic substances all contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles o h and n h groups present on cell surfaces are highly likely to form hydrogen bond with plastic particles and increase the deposition plastic particles elution experiments show that decreasing solution ionic strength could release small portion of plastic particles from both bare and biofilm coated sand columns especially from the segments near to the column inlet with slighter lower percentage from biofilm coated columns based on the total mass of retained plastics in contrast increasing flow rate does not obviously detach the plastic particles that already deposited onto porous media the results of this study clearly show that the presence of biofilm in natural environment could enhance the deposition and decrease the transport of plastic particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic particles biofilm extracellular polymeric substances surface roughness xmt quartz sand 1 introduction plastic particles are found to be

2016 huffer et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 plastic particles are found to serve as the mobile carrier of pollutants and have potential threats to the natural ecosystem and human health arias et al 2019 bosker et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 sharma and chatterjee 2017 the potential risks of plastic particles are highly related to their fate and transport behaviors in natural porous media thus the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media have recently drawn great attentions factors such as flow rate knappenberger et al 2014 yang et al 2015 solution chemistry jin et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 porous media type torkzaban et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the copresence of colloids such as natural organic matter yang et al 2015 fullerene dong et al 2019 biochar tong et al 2020 and iron oxides li et al 2019 have been demonstrated to have great influence on the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media biofilm community of microorganisms accumulated in matrix

bozorg et al 2015 found that the presence of biofilm increased the deposition efficiencies of bacteria by 36 wang et al 2019 recently reported that the coating of a microbial biofilm on quartz sand could enhance the retention of biogenic selenium nanoparticles recent studies have shown that plastic particles could interact with bacteria he et al 2018 johansen et al 2019 indicating that the presence of biofilm might affect the transport of plastic particles in porous media however to the best of our knowledge the effects and the mechanisms of biofilm on the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media have not been systematically explored and thus requires investigation hence this study was designed to investigate the influence of biofilm on the transport and

formation of uniform biofilm distribution inside the column the lb broth was injected into the column from the bottom of the columns to their top for the first 12 h columns were then turned upside

qcm d experiment the influence of eps as well as protein polysaccharides humic substances the three major components of eps on the deposition of plastic particles was investigated in qcm d e1 system q

substances qcm d experiments were performed with 5 mhz at cut quartz sensor crystals with silica coated surface the detailed protocol of coating silica surfaces with eps or three major components of eps is provided in supplementary materials the deposition of three different sized plastic particles on bare and eps major components of eps coated silica surfaces were examined in both 10 and 50 mm nacl solutions the deposition rate k f of plastic particles can be determined from the slope of the initial linear portion of the change in normalized frequency f 3 versus time curve which can be calculated by using the following formula 1 chen and elimelech 2006 nguyen and elimelech 2007 1 k f d δ f 3 d t 2 6 parallel plate flow chamber experiments plastic particles deposition experiments were also conducted in a vacuum sealed parallel plate flow chamber glyco tech ma usa with inner dimensions of 4 1 cm and a height of 254 μm to directly observe the deposition of plastic particles onto silica surfaces or eps coated or three major component of eps protein polysaccharides and humic acid coated silica surfaces the parallel plate chamber was installed on the stage of an inverted

in a previous study jin et al 2015 and was also provided in supplementary materials representative images of 2 μm plastic particles deposited onto different surfaces after 1 h deposition experiments 20 images for each condition were acquired 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of biofilm on the transport of plastic particles in porous media to understand the influence of biofilm on the transport and deposition of nano and micron plastic particles the transport experiments of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 μm 0 2 μm and 2 μm in quartz sand both without and with biofilm coating were conducted at two ionic strengths 10 and 50 mm in nacl solutions in quartz sand without biofilm the breakthrough curves of plastic particles in 50 mm nacl solutions are relatively lower than those in 10 mm nacl solutions fig 1 left which is consistent with less negative cell zeta potentials at higher ionic strength table s1 and agrees with previous studies cai et al 2019 li et al 2019 peng et al 2017 more noteworthy observation is that under both examined solution conditions 10 and 50 mm in nacl solutions the breakthrough curves of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand are lower and the corresponding retained profiles are higher than those in clean sand without biofilm coating fig 1 p 0 001 for instance in 10 mm nacl solution the breakthrough percentage for 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mp and 2 μm mp in clean quartz sand is 81 5 84 2 and 87 6 respectively while their corresponding percentage in biofilm coated sand decreases to 58 0 16 8 and 35 2 respectively the observation indicates that the presence of biofilm in quartz sand can decrease the transport and increase the retention of all three different sized plastic particles at both examined solution ionic strength conditions in nacl solutions the decreased transport and increased retention of engineered nanoparticles by the presence of biofilm has also been previously reported han et al 2016 li et al 2013 mitzel et al 2016 tripathi et al 2012 xiao and wiesner 2013 3 2 mechanisms driving to enhanced plastic retention by biofilm 3 2 1 change of flow path the growing biofilm onto quartz sand surfaces might change the porosity of sand columns and affect the flow path in porous media x ray microtomography xmt was employed to directly characterize pore structure of sand columns both with and without biofilm coating comparison the porosity of representative analysis zone central cylinder of 3 5 cm 1 8 cm near the bottom of the columns fig 2 a in both bare and biofilm coated sand columns shows that the porosity of biofilm coated sand column is lower relative to that in bare sand columns without biofilm coating fig 2b the observation is consistent with the lower of calculated overall porosity of biofilm coated columns 0 40 than that of bare sand columns 0 42 resulted from the slightly increases of the weight of sand columns due to the growing of biofilm from 168 1 0 1 g before the formation of biofilm to 168 6 0 2 g after the growing of biofilm the slightly decreased porosity due to the formation of biofilm has also been reported previously mitzel et al 2016 tripathi et al 2012 the lower porosity in biofilm coated sand column relative to bare sand column suggests that the pore throats in biofilm coated columns would be narrower than that of bare sand column in contrast with the relatively constant of porosity among the analysis zone the porosity in biofilm coated sand column slightly increases with increasing the distance from the column inlet with the lowest near to the column bottom the observation agrees with shape of biofilm along the column with the relatively greater amount of biofilm near to the column inlet than in the middle section of column fig s1 clearly in the biofilm coated columns the pore throats would be slightly increases with increasing distance from the column inlet direct comparison the three dimensions pore skeleton of biofilm coated sand column versus that of bare sand column fig 2c does show that the amounts of green colored narrow flow paths especially in the inlet of the column in the biofilm coated column are greater relative to that without biofilm coating the smaller converging point in biofilm coated sand column than that of bare sand column fig 2d further confirms that the presence of greater amount of narrow flow paths in biofilm coated sand column relative to bare sand column clearly the presence of biofilm narrows the pore throats especially in the inlet of the column more amounts of bacteria in the inlet of column fig s1 although the equivalent breakthrough curves of tracer in biofilm coated sand columns to those in clean sand columns fig s3 were obtained we deduce that it would be easier for plastic particles to be retained at narrow pore throats due to the high possibility for plastic particles to collide with porous media than at large pore throats bradford et al 2007 jiang et al 2013 as a result greater retention of plastic particles especially in column inlet of sand columns with biofilm coating relative to those without biofilm coating was acquired the retained profiles of all three different sized plastic particles in biofilm coated sand thus are higher and steeper relative to those without biofilm fig 1 right 3 2 2 change of porous media surface properties the change of porous media surface charge has been found to greatly affect the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media he et al 2019 li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the zeta potentials of bacteria and quartz sand in both 10 mm and 50 mm nacl solutions were determined we found that under both ionic strength conditions the zeta potentials of bacteria are more negatively than those of clean quartz sand table s1 the observation suggests that the presence of biofilm would negatively increase the surface charge of porous media the changed surface charges of porous media due to the presence of biofilm has been reported lerner et al 2012 wang et al 2019 xiao and wiesner 2013 comparison the dlvo interaction energy profiles between plastics and biofilm versus those between plastics and sand fig s4 shows that for all three different sized plastic particles the interaction energy between plastics and sand with biofilm coating are more repulsive relative to that between plastics and quartz sand without biofilm coating under both ionic strength conditions for instance the energy barriers between the 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mps and 2 μm mps and the clean quartz sand in 10 mm nacl solution are about 15 kt 200 kt and 2200 kt respectively while with the presence of biofilm the values increase to 25 kt 390 kt and 4100 kt respectively the results theoretically predict an increased transport and decreased deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand under the examined experimental conditions which is opposite with our observation that decreased transport and increased retention of plastic particles in quartz sand with biofilm coating fig 1 other mechanisms thus contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles by biofilm previous studies found that the increase of surface roughness could enhance colloidal particle deposition on media surfaces by reducing energy barrier and increasing physical trapping bradford and torkzaban 2013 2015 jin et al 2017 tong and johnson 2006 sem images of both quartz sand without and with biofilm coating fig s5 show that the biofilm coated sand surface is relatively rougher than sand surface without biofilm which might contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated quartz sand by decreasing the energy barrier or the increasing the physical trapping of plastic particles interaction energy between all three sized plastic particles and sand with without biofilm coating with the consideration of sand surface roughness under both ionic strength conditions were calculated details on the interaction energy calculation were provided in the supplementary materials with the consideration of roughness the energy barriers between plastic particles and sand with biofilm coating become lower relative to those without biofilm coating fig s6 for instance in 10 mm nacl solution the energy barriers between the 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mps and 2 μm mps and the clean quartz sand are about 5 kt 11 kt and 19 kt respectively while the energy barriers of three sized plastic particles and biofilm coated sand nearly disappear with the consideration of surface roughness the decreased energy barrier induced by the presence of biofilm theoretically supports the observation that greater deposition of plastic particles in the biofilm coated sand relative to those in the clean sand in addition plastic particles would be more easily to be trapped in the rougher and softer biofilm surfaces relative to the rigid quartz sand surfaces the greater deposition of nanoparticles onto much rougher surfaces have also been reported previously tong et al 2010 thus we deduce that the changed surface roughness of quartz sand surfaces induced by the presence of biofilm might be a contributor to the greater plastic particle deposition in biofilm coated sand columns 3 2 3 contribution by extracellular polymeric substances eps biofilm surfaces are commonly covered by extracellular polymeric substances eps which has been found to affect the deposition of colloids including nanoparticles lin et al 2017 tong et al 2010 clay particles leon morales et al 2007 and bacteria liu et al 2007 to investigate whether eps would affect the deposition of plastic particles we first conducted plastic particle deposition experiments on both bare and eps coated silica in 10 mm and 50 mm nacl solutions by using qcm d system since the trend of effects of biofilm on three sized plastic particles was similar to simplify 0 2 μm mps was then chosen as represent plastic particles to yield deposition mechanisms by eps in both 10 and 50 mm nacl solutions the deposition rates k f of 0 2 μm mps onto eps coated silica surfaces are greater than those on bare silica surfaces fig 3 the results indicate that eps on biofilm surface would contribute to the greater deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand than in clean sand previous study shows eps mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins humic substances lipid and so on flemming and wingender 2010 direct analysis the composition of eps also shows that proteins polysaccharides and humic acid are the major components of eps fig s7 the details about detection of components of eps were provided in supplementary materials to clarify which component of eps polysaccharide or proteins or humic acid affect the deposition of plastic particles plastic particle deposition experiments onto silica coated with either polysaccharides or proteins or humic substances were performed by using qcm d system alginate bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha commonly employed as representative polysaccharides protein and humic substances respectively xiao and wiesner 2013 were employed as model polysaccharides proteins and humic substances in present study the deposition rates onto all surfaces increase with increasing solution ionic strength which is consistent with the less negative zeta potentials of 0 2 μm mps as well as all surfaces at high ionic strength table s1 more interestingly the deposition rates onto all three major components coated surfaces are greater than those onto bare silica surfaces fig 3 the observation indicates that the presence of bsa alginate and ha all three model major components of eps increase the deposition of 0 2 μm mps thus it is reasonable for us to conclude that protein polysaccharide and humic substances the three major components of eps contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles p 0 05 since the amount of protein in eps was greater than that of polysaccharides and humic substances the contribution of proteins might be more dominant note that the deposition rates of plastic particles varies for different surfaces the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of eps bsa alginate ha biofilm coated sand were detected by using rose bengal a hydrophobic dye and nile blue a hydrophilic dye xiao and wiesner 2013 the details about organic dye adsorption method were provided in supplementary materials the results show that among all different surfaces bsa coated sand surface is the most hydrophobic and alginate coated sand surface is the most hydrophilic fig s8 since eps is mainly constituted by protein polysaccharides and ha it is reasonable that the hydrophobicity of eps coated sand surfaces is between that of bsa and alginate coated sand surfaces it should be noted that plastic particles are hydrophobic he et al 2018 li et al 2019 it would be easier for the deposition of plastic particles on bsa coated quartz sand surface than eps coated surface leading to the higher deposition rates onto bsa coated surfaces relative to those of eps coated surfaces to further confirm the contribution of eps as well as the three major components of eps to the greater deposition of plastic particles deposition experiments of 2 μm mps as representative on the quartz slide eps coated as well as three major components of eps coated surfaces were conducted in parallel plate flow chamber system at least 20 images of deposited 2 μm mps on different surfaces were acquired at 60 min of experiment the statistical data of different images was provided in table s4 and the representative images are provided in fig 4 comparing with that on the bare quartz slide the numbers of deposited 2 μm mps onto eps coated surfaces are greater moreover the numbers of deposited 2 μm mps onto bsa alginate and ha coated surfaces are also greater than that onto bare silica surfaces clearly consistent with the results of qcm d experiments parallel plate flow chamber experiments also show that the presence of eps on silica surfaces contributes to the greater deposition of plastic particles furthermore all three components of eps protein polysaccharide and humic substances have contribution to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles to further verify the contribution of protein polysaccharides humic substances to the plastic particle transport 0 2 μm mps transport experiments were conducted in bsa alginate and ha coated quartz sand columns detail informations about prepared bsa alginate and ha coated quartz sand columns were provided in supplementary materials the results show that in both 10 and 50 mm nacl solutions the breakthrough curves of 0 2 μm mps in bsa alginate and ha coated sand columns are all lower and the corresponding retained profiles are higher than those in clean sand fig 5 p 0 001 the observations indicate that regardless of ionic strength conditions the presence of bsa ha and alginate onto quartz sand surfaces decrease the transport and increase the deposition of plastic particles in porous media consistent with the results of qcm d and parallel plate flow chamber experiments column experiments also suggested that proteins humic acid and alginate all three major components in eps contribute to the enhanced the deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated quartz sand columns it is worth pointing out that the narrowed flow path as well as the increased grain to grain contact also contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in the biofilm coated sand columns thus unlike the slightly lower deposition rates of plastic particles onto eps coated surfaces relative to bsa coated surfaces the deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand columns yet is greater than that in bsa coated sand columns ftir spectra of e coli showed that o h and n h functional groups might result from protein are present on cell surfaces fig s9 these functional groups are likely to form non dlvo interactions such as hydrogen bond with plastic particles with cooh groups thus increased the deposition of plastic particles and decreased their transport in biofilm coated sand columns jiang et al 2013 walker et al 2004 xiao and wiesner 2013 3 3 immobilization of plastic particles to investigate whether the plastic particles deposition on biofilm coated sand was reversible deposition in the secondary energy minimum washing experiments were conducted by choosing 0 2 μm mps as representative plastic particles and 50 mm nacl solution as representative deposition experimental solution condition after the transport experiment of 0 2 μm mps in 50 mm nacl solution condition in both bare sand and biofilm coated sand columns 5 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solution at ph 6 was injected into the columns with the same flow rate of transport experiment 0 73 ml min 1 the results fig 6 a show that with the injection of low ionic strength solution into columns 21 0 1 6 and 12 8 0 8 of 0 2 μm mps were flushed out of biofilm coated and bare sand columns respectively based on the total amount of plastics injected into columns the observation indicates that in both bare sand and biofilm coated sand columns portion of plastic particles are retained in secondary energy minimum based on the total amount of plastics retained in columns the percentage of 0 2 μm mps flushed out of biofilm coated sand 21 7 1 8 is lower than that of bare sand columns 36 5 4 8 the observation suggests that comparing with bare sand columns the plastic particles are relatively more tightly retained in biofilm coated sand columns more deposited in primary energy minimum in biofilm coated column than bare sand column to determine whether the increase of flow rate would further lead to the release of previously deposited plastic particles from columns 5 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solutions was injected into the columns with increasing flow rate from 0 73 ml min 1 to 4 ml min 1 we find that only very small amount of 0 2 μm mps were flush out of both clean sand 0 69 0 06 and biofilm coated sand columns 0 61 0 02 based on the total amount of plastics retained in columns when the flow rate was increased to 4 ml min 1 the results indicate that the increasing flow rate have negligible effect on the release of plastic particles obviously comparing with the decrease of solution ionic strength the increase of flow rate has negligible contribution to the release of plastic particles to determine whether the release plastic particles from biofilm coated sand was associated with the released bacteria from the columns the concentrations of released bacteria during the transport and flush duration were also detected fig 6b small amount of bacteria released from biofilm coated sand during the flush duration with either decreasing solution ionic strength or increasing flow rate which might contribute to the release of plastic particles that previously deposited on their surfaces however it should be noted that based on the total amount of bacteria present in the biofilm coated columns the percentage of released bacteria in response to the decrease of solution ionic strength or increasing flow rate is negligible 1 8 0 1 therefore we believe that release plastic particles from biofilm coated sand was not associated with the released bacteria from the column close comparison of retained profiles without washing processes versus with washing processes shows that washing processes would change the shape of retained profiles of plastic particles fig s10 specifically for both bare sand columns and biofilm coated sand column the remobilization of 0 2 μm mps mainly occurs in segments near to the column inlet which leads to the decrease of the concentrations of deposited in column inlet and the increase of the concentrations in column outlet the retained profiles of plastic particles with washing durations thus were relatively more flat than those without washing durations with decreasing ionic strength and increasing flow rate due to greater amount of 0 2 μm mps deposited in column inlet in biofilm coated sand columns than in clean sand columns the change of shape of retained profiles thus are more obvious in biofilm coated sand columns 4 conclusions this study gives an insight into the influence of biofilm on the transport and deposition behaviors of nano and microparticles in porous media the results show that regardless of plastic particle sizes 0 02 μm 0 2 μm 2 μm the presence of biofilm decreases the transport and increases the deposition of plastic particles in both low and high ionic strength conditions the presence of biofilm would narrow the flow path in the inlet of the column and increase the surface roughness of porous media by decreasing dlvo interaction between plastic particles and porous media thus enhance the deposition of plastic particles we find that eps the major component in biofilm outer surfaces contributes to the increased deposition of plastic particles furthermore we find that the three major component of eps protein polysaccharides and humic substances all contribute to the enhanced the deposition and decreased the transport of plastic particles in porous media since the amount of proteins are larger than polysaccharides and humic substances we speculate that proteins play more dominant roles o h and n h groups on cell surfaces are likely to form hydrogen bond with carboxyl functionalized plastic particles which also contribute to the deposition of plastic particles moreover we find that in both bare and biofilm coated sand columns portion of plastic particles retained in secondary energy minimum and can be released out with decreasing solution ionic strength however comparing with bare sand columns the plastic particles are more tightly retained in biofilm coated sand more deposited in primary energy minimum increasing flow rate doesn t have obvious contribution to the release of plastic particles from biofilm clearly in natural environment at sites where biofilm is abundant the retention of plastic particles would be much greater comparing with those without biofilm coated porous media the mobility of plastic particles in porous media with biofilm thus would be decreased declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17926,biofilm community of bacteria ubiquitously present in natural environment may interact with plastic particles and affect the transport of plastic particles in environment the significance of biofilm escherichia coli on the transport and deposition behaviors of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mp and 2 μm mp were examined under both 10 mm and 50 mm nacl solutions by comparing the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of plastic particles in bare sand versus those in biofilm coated sand regardless of ionic strengths the presence of biofilm increases the deposition of all three sized plastic particles in porous media via employing x ray microtomography imaging xmt and scanning electron microscope sem we find that the presence of biofilm could narrow the flow path especially near to the inlet of the column and increase the surface roughness of porous media by decreasing dlvo repulsive interaction which contributes to the enhanced the deposition of plastic particles extracellular polymeric substances eps present on the biofilm are found to contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles packed column experiments quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d as well as parallel plate flow chamber experiments all show that three major components of eps proteins polysaccharide and humic substances all contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles o h and n h groups present on cell surfaces are highly likely to form hydrogen bond with plastic particles and increase the deposition plastic particles elution experiments show that decreasing solution ionic strength could release small portion of plastic particles from both bare and biofilm coated sand columns especially from the segments near to the column inlet with slighter lower percentage from biofilm coated columns based on the total mass of retained plastics in contrast increasing flow rate does not obviously detach the plastic particles that already deposited onto porous media the results of this study clearly show that the presence of biofilm in natural environment could enhance the deposition and decrease the transport of plastic particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic particles biofilm extracellular polymeric substances surface roughness xmt quartz sand 1 introduction plastic particles are found to be wide present in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems luo et al 2019 peeken et al 2018 qi et al 2020 due to their adsorption capability towards the organic pollutants and heavy metals brennecke et al 2016 huffer et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 plastic particles are found to serve as the mobile carrier of pollutants and have potential threats to the natural ecosystem and human health arias et al 2019 bosker et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 sharma and chatterjee 2017 the potential risks of plastic particles are highly related to their fate and transport behaviors in natural porous media thus the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media have recently drawn great attentions factors such as flow rate knappenberger et al 2014 yang et al 2015 solution chemistry jin et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 porous media type torkzaban et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the copresence of colloids such as natural organic matter yang et al 2015 fullerene dong et al 2019 biochar tong et al 2020 and

bozorg et al 2015 found that the presence of biofilm increased the deposition efficiencies of bacteria by 36 wang et al 2019 recently reported that the coating of a microbial biofilm on quartz sand could enhance the retention of biogenic selenium nanoparticles recent studies have shown that plastic particles could interact with bacteria he et al 2018 johansen et al 2019 indicating that the presence of biofilm might affect the transport of plastic particles in porous media however to the best of our knowledge the effects and the mechanisms of biofilm on the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media have not been systematically explored and thus requires investigation hence this study was designed to investigate the influence of biofilm on the transport and

qcm d experiment the influence of eps as well as protein polysaccharides humic substances the three major components of eps on the deposition of plastic particles was investigated in qcm d e1 system q sense ab gothenburg sweden by pre coating the silica surfaces with eps extracted from e coli bovine serum albumin bsa as model protein alginate as model polysaccharides and humic acid as model humic substances qcm d experiments were performed with 5 mhz at cut quartz sensor crystals with silica coated surface the detailed protocol of coating silica surfaces with eps or three major components of eps is provided in supplementary materials the deposition of three different sized plastic particles on bare and eps major components of eps coated silica surfaces were examined in both 10 and 50 mm nacl solutions the deposition rate k f of plastic particles can be determined from the slope of the initial linear portion of the change in normalized frequency f 3 versus time curve which can be calculated by using the following formula 1 chen and elimelech 2006 nguyen and elimelech 2007 1 k f d δ f 3 d t 2 6 parallel plate flow chamber experiments plastic particles deposition experiments were also conducted in a vacuum sealed parallel plate flow chamber glyco tech ma usa with inner dimensions of 4 1 cm and a height of 254 μm to directly observe the deposition of plastic particles onto silica surfaces or eps coated or three major component of eps protein polysaccharides and humic acid coated silica surfaces the parallel plate chamber was installed on the stage of an inverted

in a previous study jin et al 2015 and was also provided in supplementary materials representative images of 2 μm plastic particles deposited onto different surfaces after 1 h deposition experiments 20 images for each condition were acquired 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of biofilm on the transport of plastic particles in porous media to understand the influence of biofilm on the transport and deposition of nano and micron plastic particles the transport experiments of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 μm 0 2 μm and 2 μm in quartz sand both without and with biofilm coating were conducted at two ionic strengths 10 and 50 mm in nacl solutions in quartz sand without biofilm the breakthrough curves of plastic particles in 50 mm nacl solutions are relatively lower than those in 10 mm nacl solutions fig 1 left which is consistent with less negative cell zeta potentials at higher ionic strength table s1 and agrees with previous studies cai et al 2019 li et al 2019 peng et al 2017 more noteworthy observation is that under both examined solution conditions 10 and 50 mm in nacl solutions the breakthrough curves of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand are lower and the corresponding retained profiles are higher than those in clean sand without biofilm coating fig 1 p 0 001 for instance in 10 mm nacl solution the breakthrough percentage for 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mp and 2 μm mp in clean quartz sand is 81 5 84 2 and 87 6 respectively while their corresponding percentage in biofilm coated sand decreases to 58 0 16 8 and 35 2 respectively the observation indicates that the presence of biofilm in quartz sand can decrease the transport and increase the retention of all three different sized plastic particles at both examined solution ionic strength conditions in nacl solutions the decreased transport and increased retention of engineered nanoparticles by the presence of biofilm has also been previously reported han et al 2016 li et al 2013 mitzel et al 2016 tripathi et al 2012 xiao and wiesner 2013 3 2 mechanisms driving to enhanced plastic retention by biofilm 3 2 1 change of flow path the growing biofilm onto quartz sand surfaces might change the porosity of sand columns and affect the flow path in porous media x ray microtomography xmt was employed to directly characterize pore structure of sand columns both with and without biofilm coating comparison the porosity of representative analysis zone central cylinder of 3 5 cm 1 8 cm near the bottom of the columns fig 2 a in both bare and biofilm coated sand columns shows that the porosity of biofilm coated sand column is lower relative to that in bare sand columns without biofilm coating fig 2b the observation is consistent with the lower of calculated overall porosity of biofilm coated columns 0 40 than that of bare sand columns 0 42 resulted from the slightly increases of the weight of sand columns due to the growing of biofilm from 168 1 0 1 g before the formation of biofilm to 168 6 0 2 g after the growing of biofilm the slightly decreased porosity due to the formation of biofilm has also been reported previously mitzel et al 2016 tripathi et al 2012 the lower porosity in biofilm coated sand column relative to bare sand column suggests that the pore throats in biofilm coated columns would be narrower than that of bare sand column in contrast with the relatively constant of porosity among the analysis zone the porosity in biofilm coated sand column slightly increases with increasing the distance from the column inlet with the lowest near to the column bottom the observation agrees with shape of biofilm along the column with the relatively greater amount of biofilm near to the column inlet than in the middle section of column fig s1 clearly in the biofilm coated columns the pore throats would be slightly increases with increasing distance from the column inlet direct comparison the three dimensions pore skeleton of biofilm coated sand column versus that of bare sand column fig 2c does show that the amounts of green colored narrow flow paths especially in the inlet of the column in the biofilm coated column are greater relative to that without biofilm coating the smaller converging point in biofilm coated sand column than that of bare sand column fig 2d further confirms that the presence of greater amount of narrow flow paths in biofilm coated sand column relative to bare sand column clearly the presence of biofilm narrows the pore throats especially in the inlet of the column more amounts of bacteria in the inlet of column fig s1 although the equivalent breakthrough curves of tracer in biofilm coated sand columns to those in clean sand columns fig s3 were obtained we deduce that it would be easier for plastic particles to be retained at narrow pore throats due to the high possibility for plastic particles to collide with porous media than at large pore throats bradford et al 2007 jiang et al 2013 as a result greater retention of plastic particles especially in column inlet of sand columns with biofilm coating relative to those without biofilm coating was acquired the retained profiles of all three different sized plastic particles in biofilm coated sand thus are higher and steeper relative to those without biofilm fig 1 right 3 2 2 change of porous media surface properties the change of porous media surface charge has been found to greatly affect the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media he et al 2019 li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the zeta potentials of bacteria and quartz sand in both 10 mm and 50 mm nacl solutions were determined we found that under both ionic strength conditions the zeta potentials of bacteria are more negatively than those of clean quartz sand table s1 the observation suggests that the presence of biofilm would negatively increase the surface charge of porous media the changed surface charges of porous media due to the presence of biofilm has been reported lerner et al 2012 wang et al 2019 xiao and wiesner 2013 comparison the dlvo interaction energy profiles between plastics and biofilm versus those between plastics and sand fig s4 shows that for all three different sized plastic particles the interaction energy between plastics and sand with biofilm coating are more repulsive relative to that between plastics and quartz sand without biofilm coating under both ionic strength conditions for instance the energy barriers between the 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mps and 2 μm mps and the clean quartz sand in 10 mm nacl solution are about 15 kt 200 kt and 2200 kt respectively while with the presence of biofilm the values increase to 25 kt 390 kt and 4100 kt respectively the results theoretically predict an increased transport and decreased deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand under the examined experimental conditions which is opposite with our observation that decreased transport and increased retention of plastic particles in quartz sand with biofilm coating fig 1 other mechanisms thus contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles by biofilm previous studies found that the increase of surface roughness could enhance colloidal particle deposition on media surfaces by reducing energy barrier and increasing physical trapping bradford and torkzaban 2013 2015 jin et al 2017 tong and johnson 2006 sem images of both quartz sand without and with biofilm coating fig s5 show that the biofilm coated sand surface is relatively rougher than sand surface without biofilm which might contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated quartz sand by decreasing the energy barrier or the increasing the physical trapping of plastic particles interaction energy between all three sized plastic particles and sand with without biofilm coating with the consideration of sand surface roughness under both ionic strength conditions were calculated details on the interaction energy calculation were provided in the supplementary materials with the consideration of roughness the energy barriers between plastic particles and sand with biofilm coating become lower relative to those without biofilm coating fig s6 for instance in 10 mm nacl solution the energy barriers between the 0 02 μm nps 0 2 μm mps and 2 μm mps and the clean quartz sand are about 5 kt 11 kt and 19 kt respectively while the energy barriers of three sized plastic particles and biofilm coated sand nearly disappear with the consideration of surface roughness the decreased energy barrier induced by the presence of biofilm theoretically supports the observation that greater deposition of plastic particles in the biofilm coated sand relative to those in the clean sand in addition plastic particles would be more easily to be trapped in the rougher and softer biofilm surfaces relative to the rigid quartz sand surfaces the greater deposition of nanoparticles onto much rougher surfaces have also been reported previously tong et al 2010 thus we deduce that the changed surface roughness of quartz sand surfaces induced by the presence of biofilm might be a contributor to the greater plastic particle deposition in biofilm coated sand columns 3 2 3 contribution by extracellular polymeric substances eps biofilm surfaces are commonly covered by extracellular polymeric substances eps which has been found to affect the deposition of colloids including nanoparticles lin et al 2017 tong et al 2010 clay particles leon morales et al 2007 and bacteria liu et al 2007 to investigate whether eps would affect the deposition of plastic particles we first conducted plastic particle deposition experiments on both bare and eps coated silica in 10 mm and 50 mm nacl solutions by using qcm d system since the trend of effects of biofilm on three sized plastic particles was similar to simplify 0 2 μm mps was then chosen as represent plastic particles to yield deposition mechanisms by eps in both 10 and 50 mm nacl solutions the deposition rates k f of 0 2 μm mps onto eps coated silica surfaces are greater than those on bare silica surfaces fig 3 the results indicate that eps on biofilm surface would contribute to the greater deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand than in clean sand previous study shows eps mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins humic substances lipid and so on flemming and wingender 2010 direct analysis the composition of eps also shows that proteins polysaccharides and humic acid are the major components of eps fig s7 the details about detection of components of eps were provided in supplementary materials to clarify which component of eps polysaccharide or proteins or humic acid affect the deposition of plastic particles plastic particle deposition experiments onto silica coated with either polysaccharides or proteins or humic substances were performed by using qcm d system alginate bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha commonly employed as representative polysaccharides protein and humic substances respectively xiao and wiesner 2013 were employed as model polysaccharides proteins and humic substances in present study the deposition rates onto all surfaces increase with increasing solution ionic strength which is consistent with the less negative zeta potentials of 0 2 μm mps as well as all surfaces at high ionic strength table s1 more interestingly the deposition rates onto all three major components coated surfaces are greater than those onto bare silica surfaces fig 3 the observation indicates that the presence of bsa alginate and ha all three model major components of eps increase the deposition of 0 2 μm mps thus it is reasonable for us to conclude that protein polysaccharide and humic substances the three major components of eps contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles p 0 05 since the amount of protein in eps was greater than that of polysaccharides and humic substances the contribution of proteins might be more dominant note that the deposition rates of plastic particles varies for different surfaces the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of eps bsa alginate ha biofilm coated sand were detected by using rose bengal a hydrophobic dye and nile blue a hydrophilic dye xiao and wiesner 2013 the details about organic dye adsorption method were provided in supplementary materials the results show that among all different surfaces bsa coated sand surface is the most hydrophobic and alginate coated sand surface is the most hydrophilic fig s8 since eps is mainly constituted by protein polysaccharides and ha it is reasonable that the hydrophobicity of eps coated sand surfaces is between that of bsa and alginate coated sand surfaces it should be noted that plastic particles are hydrophobic he et al 2018 li et al 2019 it would be easier for the deposition of plastic particles on bsa coated quartz sand surface than eps coated surface leading to the higher deposition rates onto bsa coated surfaces relative to those of eps coated surfaces to further confirm the contribution of eps as well as the three major components of eps to the greater deposition of plastic particles deposition experiments of 2 μm mps as representative on the quartz slide eps coated as well as three major components of eps coated surfaces were conducted in parallel plate flow chamber system at least 20 images of deposited 2 μm mps on different surfaces were acquired at 60 min of experiment the statistical data of different images was provided in table s4 and the representative images are provided in fig 4 comparing with that on the bare quartz slide the numbers of deposited 2 μm mps onto eps coated surfaces are greater moreover the numbers of deposited 2 μm mps onto bsa alginate and ha coated surfaces are also greater than that onto bare silica surfaces clearly consistent with the results of qcm d experiments parallel plate flow chamber experiments also show that the presence of eps on silica surfaces contributes to the greater deposition of plastic particles furthermore all three components of eps protein polysaccharide and humic substances have contribution to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles to further verify the contribution of protein polysaccharides humic substances to the plastic particle transport 0 2 μm mps transport experiments were conducted in bsa alginate and ha coated quartz sand columns detail informations about prepared bsa alginate and ha coated quartz sand columns were provided in supplementary materials the results show that in both 10 and 50 mm nacl solutions the breakthrough curves of 0 2 μm mps in bsa alginate and ha coated sand columns are all lower and the corresponding retained profiles are higher than those in clean sand fig 5 p 0 001 the observations indicate that regardless of ionic strength conditions the presence of bsa ha and alginate onto quartz sand surfaces decrease the transport and increase the deposition of plastic particles in porous media consistent with the results of qcm d and parallel plate flow chamber experiments column experiments also suggested that proteins humic acid and alginate all three major components in eps contribute to the enhanced the deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated quartz sand columns it is worth pointing out that the narrowed flow path as well as the increased grain to grain contact also contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in the biofilm coated sand columns thus unlike the slightly lower deposition rates of plastic particles onto eps coated surfaces relative to bsa coated surfaces the deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated sand columns yet is greater than that in bsa coated sand columns ftir spectra of e coli showed that o h and n h functional groups might result from protein are present on cell surfaces fig s9 these functional groups are likely to form non dlvo interactions such as hydrogen bond with plastic particles with cooh groups thus increased the deposition of plastic particles and decreased their transport in biofilm coated sand columns jiang et al 2013 walker et al 2004 xiao and wiesner 2013 3 3 immobilization of plastic particles to investigate whether the plastic particles deposition on biofilm coated sand was reversible deposition in the secondary energy minimum washing experiments were conducted by choosing 0 2 μm mps as representative plastic particles and 50 mm nacl solution as representative deposition experimental solution condition after the transport experiment of 0 2 μm mps in 50 mm nacl solution condition in both bare sand and biofilm coated sand columns 5 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solution at ph 6 was injected into the columns with the same flow rate of transport experiment 0 73 ml min 1 the results fig 6 a show that with the injection of low ionic strength solution into columns 21 0 1 6 and 12 8 0 8 of 0 2 μm mps were flushed out of biofilm coated and bare sand columns respectively based on the total amount of plastics injected into columns the observation indicates that in both bare sand and biofilm coated sand columns portion of plastic particles are retained in secondary energy minimum based on the total amount of plastics retained in columns the percentage of 0 2 μm mps flushed out of biofilm coated sand 21 7 1 8 is lower than that of bare sand columns 36 5 4 8 the observation suggests that comparing with bare sand columns the plastic particles are relatively more tightly retained in biofilm coated sand columns more deposited in primary energy minimum in biofilm coated column than bare sand column to determine whether the increase of flow rate would further lead to the release of previously deposited plastic particles from columns 5 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solutions was injected into the columns with increasing flow rate from 0 73 ml min 1 to 4 ml min 1 we find that only very small amount of 0 2 μm mps were flush out of both clean sand 0 69 0 06 and biofilm coated sand columns 0 61 0 02 based on the total amount of plastics retained in columns when the flow rate was increased to 4 ml min 1 the results indicate that the increasing flow rate have negligible effect on the release of plastic particles obviously comparing with the decrease of solution ionic strength the increase of flow rate has negligible contribution to the release of plastic particles to determine whether the release plastic particles from biofilm coated sand was associated with the released bacteria from the columns the concentrations of released bacteria during the transport and flush duration were also detected fig 6b small amount of bacteria released from biofilm coated sand during the flush duration with either decreasing solution ionic strength or increasing flow rate which might contribute to the release of plastic particles that previously deposited on their surfaces however it should be noted that based on the total amount of bacteria present in the biofilm coated columns the percentage of released bacteria in response to the decrease of solution ionic strength or increasing flow rate is negligible 1 8 0 1 therefore we believe that release plastic particles from biofilm coated sand was not associated with the released bacteria from the column close comparison of retained profiles without washing processes versus with washing processes shows that washing processes would change the shape of retained profiles of plastic particles fig s10 specifically for both bare sand columns and biofilm coated sand column the remobilization of 0 2 μm mps mainly occurs in segments near to the column inlet which leads to the decrease of the concentrations of deposited in column inlet and the increase of the concentrations in column outlet the retained profiles of plastic particles with washing durations thus were relatively more flat than those without washing durations with decreasing ionic strength and increasing flow rate due to greater amount of 0 2 μm mps deposited in column inlet in biofilm coated sand columns than in clean sand columns the change of shape of retained profiles thus are more obvious in biofilm coated sand columns 4 conclusions this study gives an insight into the influence of biofilm on the transport and deposition behaviors of nano and microparticles in porous media the results show that regardless of plastic particle sizes 0 02 μm 0 2 μm 2 μm the presence of biofilm decreases the transport and increases the deposition of plastic particles in both low and high ionic strength conditions the presence of biofilm would narrow the flow path in the inlet of the column and increase the surface roughness of porous media by decreasing dlvo interaction between plastic particles and porous media thus enhance the deposition of plastic particles we find that eps the major component in biofilm outer surfaces contributes to the increased deposition of plastic particles furthermore we find that the three major component of eps protein polysaccharides and humic substances all contribute to the enhanced the deposition and decreased the transport of plastic particles in porous media since the amount of proteins are larger than polysaccharides and humic substances we speculate that proteins play more dominant roles o h and n h groups on cell surfaces are likely to form hydrogen bond with carboxyl functionalized plastic particles which also contribute to the deposition of plastic particles moreover we find that in both bare and biofilm coated sand columns portion of plastic particles retained in secondary energy minimum and can be released out with decreasing solution ionic strength however comparing with bare sand columns the plastic particles are more tightly retained in biofilm coated sand more deposited in primary energy minimum increasing flow rate doesn t have obvious contribution to the release of plastic particles from biofilm clearly in natural environment at sites where biofilm is abundant the retention of plastic particles would be much greater comparing with those without biofilm coated porous media the mobility of plastic particles in porous media with biofilm thus would be decreased declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17927,the presence of nitrite no2 is inevitable with concentrations of several mg l 1 in some typical water bodies in this study uv at wavelength of 365 nm was investigated to degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs in the presence of no2 at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 six selected cecs with different structures were efficiently removed because of the generation of reactive nitrogen species rns and hydroxyl radical ho from photolysis of no2 contributions of uv365 photolysis rns and ho to cec degradation in uv365 no2 system were calculated and rns were found to be the predominant species that are responsible for cec degradation the second major contributor is ho for the degradation of selected cecs except for the case of sulfadiazine impacts of water matrix components including dissolved oxygen solution ph and natural organic matter on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system were evaluated furthermore evolution profiles of cecs and no2 in uv365 no2 system were tracked when actual water samples were used as background and a simultaneous removal of cecs and no2 was observed transformation products of bisphenol a and carbamazepine were proposed according to the results of hplc ms and quantum chemistry calculations nitration induced by rns and hydroxylation induced by ho are main reactions occurred during cec degradation in uv365 no2 system overall uv365 is a potential technology to remove cecs and no2 in aquatic environment when residual no2 is present our present study also provides possibility for the application of sunlight to remediate water co polluted by cecs and no2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords residual nitrite contaminants of emerging concern reactive nitrogen species hydroxyl radical degradation pathways 1 introduction in our daily life large amounts of contaminants of emerging concern cecs are being discharged to domestic wastewater agricultural runoffs and surface runoffs which then enter into groundwater rivers and drinking water treatment plants dwtp bu et al 2019 richardson and kimura 2017 cecs from our household products are typically of trace concentrations bioaccumulative and are thus of great concerns for aquatic life on the positive side advanced engineering solutions such as advanced oxidation processes aops adsorption and membrane technologies are confirmed to be efficient to remove cecs richardson and ternes 2018 including in case these cecs are found in trace concentrations in the source waters ng l 1 μg l 1 taking the removal performance and economic cost into consideration aop is a competitive choice among the above mentioned technologies richardson and kimura 2017 which can mineralize or transform cecs aops rely on the generation of reactive species of which reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radical ho superoxide radical singlet oxygen hydroperoxyl radical fernandez castro et al 2015 and reactive chlorine species rcs e g chlorine radical chlorine oxide radical chlorohydroxyl radical dichloride radical duan et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b are among the most common apart from ros and rcs reactive nitrogen species rns are also important class of reactive species in aops rns include nitrogen oxide radical no nitrogen dioxide radical no2 nitrogen trioxide radical no3 peroxynitrite onoo and amino radical nh2 bu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 neta et al 1988 among various rns no3 is a strong oxidant with a redox potential in the range of 2 3 2 5 v while no2 1 03 v and no 0 39 v are of relatively moderate strength oxidants but effective nitrating and nitrosating reagents lancaster jr 1996 neta et al 1988 therefore reaction mechanisms of cecs with rns are very different from cecs with ros or rcs under most circumstances rns are unintendedly generated from the residual nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 via two ways bu et al 2020a mack and bolton 1999 tugaoen et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 1 reactions of strong radicals e g ho with nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 2 photolysis of no3 or no2 the latter one is the predominant way of rns formation in natural environment with the simultaneous generation of ho because no3 is ubiquitous and can sometimes reach up to 50 mg n l 1 in groundwater or agricultural runoffs photolysis of no3 is frequently investigated also within the context of degradation of cecs bu et al 2020b ge et al 2019 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 however the used concentration of no3 in the aforementioned publications ranged from 5 to 10 mm 70 140 mg n l 1 which is higher than the observed maximum concentration 50 mg n l 1 in natural waters and much higher than the regulated concentration 10 mg n l 1 for drinking water therefore cecs can hardly be efficiently degraded by the photolysis of no3 at environmentally relevant concentrations and extra addition of no3 to the treated water will lead to a serious secondary pollution chain reactions induced by photolysis of no2 involve the dynamic cycles of no2 and no3 as shown in equations 1 6 gligorovski et al 2015 zafiriou and true 1979 of note the quantum yield of ho and rns from photolysis of no2 is documented to be higher than that from photolysis of no3 thus no2 is two orders of magnitude more efficient than no3 in generating radicals at equivalent concentrations gligorovski et al 2015 moreover herrmann found that no2 in natural waters is more important than no3 to degrade cecs in spite of the relatively lower concentration of no2 herrmann 2007 therefore naturally present no2 may play an important role on the degradation of cecs in natural environment calza et al 2012 as the concentration of no2 is regulated as no more than 1 0 mg n l 1 in drinking water and can reach up to several mg n l 1 in environmental waters such as groundwater and agricultural runoffs concentrations of no2 in terms of n at 0 1 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 were used in this study 1 no2 hv no o 2 o h2o ho oh 3 ho no2 no2 oh 4 ho no2 onoo 5 2no2 h2o no3 h hno2 6 no3 hv no2 o furthermore the maximum absorption bands of no2 is mainly distributed around uv a 315 400 nm area especially 350 nm lee and yoon 2007 shah et al 2011 which is also the predominant uv bands in the sunlight thus uv at wavelength of 365 nm was used to evaluate the potential use of sunlight and better identify the role of no2 recently uv light emitting diodes leds at different wavelengths were employed to inactivate pathogens wan et al 2020 coupled with chlorine to degrade cecs zou et al 2019 and examined in the control of formation of disinfection byproducts gao et al 2019 uv led 255 nm generally performed no worse than low pressure uv 254 nm on degradation of cecs in uv h2o2 process huang et al 2020 and uv chlorine process duan et al 2018 besides leds have advantages such as availability in various wavelengths lower required energy no mercury pollution and longer lifetime nyangaresi et al 2019 sholtes and linden 2019 therefore uv led365 was chosen to degrade cecs in this study overall the present study aims to 1 investigate the degradation of cecs with different structures by uv365 in the presence of low concentrations of no2 and calculate the respective contributions of uv365 photolysis rns and ho 2 evaluate the impacts of ph dissolved oxygen do and natural organic matter nom on the degradation of cecs 3 explore the evolution profiles of cecs and no2 in actual waters and 4 propose possible degradation pathways of bpa and cbz in uv365 no2 system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bisphenol a bpa bisphenol s bps carbamazepine cbz atrazine atz sulfadiazine

na2hpo4 were purchased from sinopharm china nom purchased from international humic substances society usa was extracted from suwannee river nano2 solution was freshly prepared every day 2 2 photochemical experiments photochemical experiments were conducted in an equipment shown in si fig s1 with a uv led emitting at wavelength of 365 nm the average uv intensity i 0 was measured as 3 05 mw cm 2 detailed information about investigated cecs are shown in table 1 experiments were conducted as follows unless otherwise specified initial concentrations of cecs and probe compound of 2 μm and no2 of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 were prepared in a solution of 50 ml solution ph was maintained at 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 using phosphate buffer of 2 0 mm at determined time intervals samples of 150 μl were sampled and subsequently quenched using methanol of 50 μl for hplc analysis and samples of 1 ml were collected for no3 no2 determination nitrogen of high purity 99 999 was sparged to the solution for 30 min in advance of the initiation of the degradation process when the impacts of do were investigated initial concentrations of cecs of 10 μm were used in experiments focused on the identification of transformation products actual water samples were collected from changsha yanghu dwtp at point a influent and point b after sedimentation to evaluate cec degradation in actual waters all experiments were conducted for three times 2 3 determination of contributions of uv photolysis ho and rns as shown the concentrations of no2 during the whole process did not change si fig s2 because no2 is the predominant final product from the photolysis of no2 tugaoen et al 2017 thus the steady state assumption can be used in this process for the concentrations of radicals huang et al 2018 to determine the respective contributions of uv365 photolysis ho and rns to the degradation of cecs by uv no2 system the steady state concentration of ho ho ss was calculated using nb 2 μm as a probe compound because nb does not react with rns huang et al 2018 therefore ho ss can be calculated based on the results shown in si fig s3 via rearranging the following equation 7 d n b d t k u v n b n b k h o n b h o s s n b k o b s n b n b besides the evolution profiles of cecs can be expressed as 8 d c e c d t k u v c e c c e c k h o c e c h o s s c e c k r n s c e c r n s c e c k o b s c e c c e c where k u v n b and k u v c e c are pseudo first order rate constants of the degradation of nb and cecs under uv photolysis respectively and k h o n b k h o c e c and k r n s c e c are the second order rate constant of ho with nb ho with cecs and rns with cecs respectively therefore the removal of cecs can be represented as the sum of three terms 9 r r u v r h o r r n s determination of r uv r ho and r rns was calculated using the method reported in previous studies cheng et al 2018 huang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 and shown in si text s1 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of all cecs and probe compounds in this study were measured using an agilent 1260 hplc detailed conditions can be found at si table s1 the concentrations of no3 and no2 were determined using a dionex aquion ion chromatography with an ionpac as28 4 μm column transformation products of cecs were identified using an agilent 1260 hplc tandem 6420 triple quadrupole qqq mass detailed conditions can be found at si text s2 2 5 molecular orbital distributions calculation based on density functional theory gaussian 16 program was used to calculate the molecular orbital distributions i e highest occupied molecular orbitals homo at the level of b3lyp 6 31g 2df p frontier electron density fed2 was then analyzed using multiwfn lu and chen 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of cecs by uv365 photolysis in the presence of no2 degradation of selected cecs i e bpa bps cbz atz sdz and nax by uv365 photolysis in the presence of 0 0 1 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 no2 are shown in si fig s4 and all degradation kinetics obey the pseudo first order kinetics the observed rate constants are presented in fig 1 as shown bpa bps cbz atz and nax are refractory to photolysis using uv365 with rate constants of no more than 6 10 5 s 1 while sdz could be removed with rate constants of 3 667 10 4 s 1 the corresponding degradation rate constants in the presence of 0 1 mg l 1 no2 increased by 1 61 99 4 folds for the selected cecs compared to those in the absence of no2 the enhanced degradation could be attributed to ho and rns generated from the photolysis of no2 the increment further enlarged by 6 6 81 2 with the increase in the concentration of no2 from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 si table s2 with more reactive species formed however when the concentration of no2 increased from 1 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 rate constants of bpa cbz and sdz kept increasing by 45 5 0 6 and 58 7 respectively but degradation of other three cecs were inhibited by 22 7 40 6 this can be explained from three aspects 1 excess no2 can transform ho to no2 as shown in equation 3 with a rate constant of 1 1010 m 1 s 1 mack and bolton 1999 which thereby leads to increase in steady state concentration of rns and decrease in steady state concentration of ho si table s2 2 rns especially no2 prefer to react with compounds with electron donating moieties such as bpa phenol cbz olefin weakly electron donating and sdz anilines chon et al 2015 neta et al 1988 and 3 rns exhibit lower reactivity to compounds with electron withdrawing moieties e g atz and nax huang et al 2018 of note bps as an analogue of bpa is also a typical phenolic compound but shows different tendency from bpa at no2 of 1 0 5 0 mg l 1 according to the pka values of bps 7 42 and 8 03 choi and lee 2017 and bpa 9 6 and 10 2 cheng et al 2018 the so2 moiety in bps has much stronger electron withdrawing ability than c ch3 2 moiety in bpa it was reported that phenolic compounds with electron withdrawing moieties are more resistant to oxidants than those with electron donating moieties and appear to show electron withdrawing ability li et al 2018 stone 1987 therefore degradation of bps was much slower than bpa and showed similar tendency to cecs with electron withdrawing moieties 3 2 contributions of uv365 photolysis ho and rns to cec degradation the second order rate constants of ho with cecs are listed in table 1 of which kho bps was determined using the relative rate method reported in previous studies bu et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the detailed procedures are demonstrated in si text s3 and fig s5 contributions of uv365 photolysis ho and rns to the degradation of cecs at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 are presented in fig 2 uv365 photolyzed cecs slowly with observed rate constants ranging from 5 48 10 6 to 3 667 10 4 s 1 table 1 during the uv365 no2 system at no2 concentration of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 negligible contribution of uv365 photolysis was around 1 of the initial concentrations with exception of sdz and nax contributions of uv365 photolysis to sdz and nax degradation were 30 2 and 5 5 of their initial concentrations at no2 concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 in addition the contributions of uv365 photolysis to the degradation of all selected cecs decreased slightly when the concentration of no2 increased because more uv365 was absorbed by the increasing no2 and less uv365 can be used to photolyze cecs ho can be generated from no2 with a quantum yield of 4 5 1 0 at 365 nm alif and boule 1991 which thereby contributed to cec degradation in uv no2 system contributions of ho to degradation of cecs are generally proportional to the second order rate constants of ho with cecs when concentration of no2 was the same taking 0 5 mg l 1 no2 as an example eliminated cecs by ho exposure accounted for 16 9 16 1 15 0 7 9 6 8 and 3 7 for bpa cbz nax sdz atz and bps respectively the order is generally the same as that of their rate constants with ho as presented ho is not the main contributor for cec degradation despite their high reaction rate constants with cecs 109 1010 m 1s 1 which is due to the low ho ss at 10 14 m specifically ho ss was calculated as 2 41 10 14 2 58 10 14 2 94 10 14 and 2 56 10 14 m at no2 concentration of 0 1 0 5 1 0 5 0 mg l 1 respectively si table s2 ho ss increased with no2 concentration ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 but decreased when no2 concentration further increased to 5 0 mg l 1 because of the transformation from ho to rns however the contribution of ho to cec degradation was similar at different no2 concentrations 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 because the corresponding ho ss was in the same order of magnitude rns in this study are namely no from equation 1 no2 from equation 3 and onoo from equation 4 as shown in fig 2 rns is the predominant contributor for degradation of investigated cecs at no2 concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 except sdz and nax specifically at no2 concentration of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 cec removal resulting from rns was 61 4 84 8 86 0 89 6 53 9 73 7 61 1 78 2 23 4 71 4 and 39 4 61 0 of the total removal of bpa bps cbz atz sdz and nax respectively similar to the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constants of cecs the contributions of rns to cec degradation generally increased when the concentrations of no2 increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 at no2 concentrations of 5 0 mg l 1 contributions of rns to target pollutant degradation further increased for bpa cbz and sdz but decreased in the case of bps atz and nax the phenomena can be explained by the large amount of formation and self scavenging effect of rns it has been discussed in section 3 1 that rns have high reactivity with electron rich substrates overall rns is the most important species in uv365 no2 system to remove cecs the individual contributions of no no2 and onoo and their reaction mechanisms are also interesting to investigate which still requires further research 3 3 impacts of do and ph on cec degradation do and ph are two important water quality parameters that impact photo degradation of cecs in environmental water bodies hence the impacts of do and ph on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system were investigated at no2 concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 below drinking water regulations of china us and who as shown in fig 3 a 73 9 and 62 9 of bpa and cbz was removed at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 with the rate constants of 11 48 10 4 and 8 08 10 4 s 1 respectively on the other hand when do was excluded by n2 a slight lower removal was achieved namely 68 0 and 58 9 of bpa and cbz was removed at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 with the rate constants of 9 98 10 4 and 7 63 10 4 s 1 respectively the slower degradation of cecs with n2 purging indicated the participation of do during the generation of reactive species the phenomenon can be attributed to the following equations 10 no2 hv no2 e 11 e o2 o2 12 o2 no onoo 13 o2 h2o hoo ho of which equation 10 is a side reaction of no2 photolysis with a very low quantum yield of no more than 10 3 fischer and warneck 1996 therefore only a slight inhibition on the degradation of selected cecs was observed when do was excluded in spite of the high rate constants of equation 11 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 and 12 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 shankar et al 2007 tugaoen et al 2017 of note a similar phenomenon was found in another study when they investigated cec degradation by xenon lamp 280 nm no3 system ge et al 2019 the impact of ph 6 0 8 0 on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system is illustrated in fig 3b as shown 52 0 73 1 and 70 5 of bpa was removed at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively it was reported that the quantum yield of ho from photolysis of no3 and no2 is ph independent 6 0 9 0 zellner et al 1990 however bpa degradation at ph 6 0 is obviously slower than those at ph 7 0 and 8 0 therefore the relatively slower degradation of bpa at ph 6 0 could be attributed to the species of rns for example onoo generated from equation 4 is stable at ph 7 0 and 8 0 pka 6 6 7 0 but rapidly isomerizes to no3 from honoo at ph 6 0 equation 14 løgager and sehested 1993 which therefore has no oxidation ability 14 honoo no3 h ph 6 6 3 4 impacts of nom and actual water components on cec degradation and no2 evolution as nom usually co exists with no2 in environmental waters the impact of nom on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system was investigated figs 4a and si fig s6 as shown rate constants of bpa degradation were 11 48 10 4 8 83 10 4 10 37 10 4 and 10 05 10 4 s 1 with nom concentrations at 0 1 2 and 3 mg c l 1 respectively revealing that nom does not monotonically inhibit or accelerate bpa degradation in uv365 no2 system the phenomenon indicated that nom shows a multiple effect in uv365 no2 system 1 suwannee river nom was reported to have a singlet oxygen 1o2 quantum yield of 2 46 0 14 and a high energy triplet state 3nom quantum yield of 1 47 0 12 under simulated solar irradiation zhou et al 2019a and both species play critical roles in cec degradation de laurentiis et al 2013 grebel et al 2012 besides activation of nom could absorb part intensity of uv365 which attenuate the photolysis of no2 anyhow the involvement of nom significantly impacted the radical chain reactions initiated by photolysis of no2 2 nom also plays a competitive role to consume generated reactive species e g k h o n o m 1 4 10 4 l m g c 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 from photolysis of no2 furthermore actual water a influent and b after sedimentation collected from dwtp were used as background as shown in fig 4 b 73 9 77 0 and 83 5 of bpa was removed in deionized di water actual water a and actual water b with rate constants of 11 48 10 4 12 03 10 4 and 14 63 10 4 s 1 respectively at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 and no2 concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 the increase in degradation efficiency in actual waters could be attributed to the presence of no3 no2 and chromophoric nom see si table s4 which are known as the main sources of ho in aqueous environment it should be noted that although the investigated no2 concentration 0 5 mg l 1 is acceptable in drinking water it is better if no2 and cecs can be simultaneously removed however the concentration of no2 kept constant when the experiment was conducted in di water si fig s2 considered the complex background components in actual waters the evolution profiles of no2 may present different trends as presented in fig 4c concentrations of no2 in actual waters a and b obviously decreased and corresponding concentration of no3 increased si fig s7 indicating that part of no2 was transformed to no3 in actual waters therefore uv365 has promising potential to be utilized in dwtp to simultaneously remove the residual no2 and cecs 3 5 transformation products of cbz and bpa in uv no2 system we assigned the tentative structures of transformation products of bpa and cbz in the uv365 no2 system based on the mass to charge value m z corresponding spectra and geometries si figs s8 s12 and fed2 of each atom si tables s5 s6 details of detected transformation products are summarized in si table s7 as shown in fig 5 hydroxylation induced by ho and nitration induced by no2 are main reactions occurred on bpa and cbz during the investigated system as hydroxylation and nitration reactions are both electrophilic substitutions the fed2 of each atom on the structures of bpa and cbz were calculated of which the atoms with higher fed2 are reactive sites that are readier to be attacked by electrophilic reagents chu et al 2016 as shown in fig 5a carbon atoms c1 c2 c15 and c16 of bpa have relatively higher fed2 indicating the aromatic rings especially the above mentioned four atoms are more easily to be substituted by ho and no2 the similar values of fed2 of c1 and c15 c2 and c16 indicated that bpa has a balanced structure therefore hydroxylation and dehydroxylation nitration are initial reactions occurred on bpa to generate p1 m z 243 1027 p2 m z 272 0928 and p3 m z 256 0979 further hydroxylation on p1 to form p4 m z 259 0976 was also observed in cbz molecular structure c12 c21 c23 and n30 have highest values of fed2 implying that aromatic ring the right one composed of c11 16 and olefin c21 c23 are most susceptible sites for electrophilic reagents to attack cbz as exhibited in fig 5b ho and no2 are easily substituted on the right aromatic ring of cbz to generate p5 m z 253 0972 and p6 m z 282 0873 then p7 m z 298 0873 on the other hand undergoing ho attack and electron transfer si scheme s1 cbz converted to p8 m z 271 1077 with the breakdown of double bond between c21 and c23 kosjek et al 2009 then p9 m z 300 0979 and p10 m z 284 103 could be generated from p8 via nitration and nitrosation by no2 and no meanwhile with the further attack of ho and the release of peroxyl radical p11 m z 269 0921 was formed via scheme s2 bu et al 2018 of note nitration and hydroxylation also occurred on the products of cbz p12 m z 180 0808 to yield p13 m z 225 0659 and p14 m z 241 0608 moreover evolution profiles of each detected transformation products of bpa and cbz are shown in fig 6 all detected bpa products p1 p4 initially increased and then decreased with uv fluence fig 6a meaning that detected compounds are initial products of bpa in uv365 no2 system as known the nitrated nitrosated cecs may exhibit higher stability and toxicity than the parent cecs d ischia et al 2011 the results relieve some concerns on this potential risk on the other hand for products of cbz only p5 p8 m z of 253 0972 282 0873 298 0873 and 271 1077 and p10 m z 284 103 reached their peak values in the investigated uv fluence and other cbz products i e p9 m z 300 0979 and p11 p14 m z 269 0921 180 0808 225 0659 and 241 0608 kept increasing the results indicated that p5 p8 and p10 are initial products of cbz and p9 and p11 p14 are probably further products generated from the initial cbz products 4 conclusion due to the generation of rns and ho no2 of low concentration photolyzed by uv365 is confirmed to be promising to degrade cecs indicating the potential application of sunlight when no2 is residual in water main conclusions were obtained as follows 1 pseudo first order rate constants of all investigated cecs increased with the increase of no2 concentration 0 1 0 mg l 1 degradation rate constants of bpa cbz and sdz further increased while those of bps atz and nax decreased when no2 concentration was increased to 5 0 mg l 1 modeling analysis revealed that rns is the predominant contributor to cec degradation at no2 concentration of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 in uv365 no2 system while ho was found to be the second predominant contributor except for the case of sdz it was also determined that uv365 photolysis is the second predominant contributor to sdz degradation 2 the presence of do has slight acceleration on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system ph 6 0 8 0 impacts cec degradation mainly through altering the patterns of rns i e honoo or onoo rather than the yield of rns nom play a dual role for cec degradation in uv365 no2 system 3 cec degradation was enhanced when actual water samples were used as water matrices in uv365 no2 system because of the presence of no3 chromophoric nom and other photo sensitized compounds simultaneous removal of cecs and no2 was observed in actual waters 4 degradation pathways of bpa and cbz in uv365 no2 system were proposed based on the results of mass and quantum chemistry

17927,the presence of nitrite no2 is inevitable with concentrations of several mg l 1 in some typical water bodies in this study uv at wavelength of 365 nm was investigated to degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs in the presence of no2 at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 six selected cecs with different structures were efficiently removed because of the generation of reactive nitrogen species rns and hydroxyl radical ho from photolysis of no2 contributions of uv365 photolysis rns and ho to cec degradation in uv365 no2 system were calculated and rns were found to be the predominant species that are responsible for cec degradation the second major contributor is ho for the degradation of selected cecs except for the case of sulfadiazine impacts of water matrix components including dissolved oxygen solution ph and natural organic matter on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system were evaluated furthermore evolution profiles of cecs and no2 in uv365 no2 system were tracked when actual water samples were used as background and a simultaneous removal of cecs and no2 was observed transformation products of bisphenol a and carbamazepine were proposed according to the results of hplc ms and quantum chemistry calculations nitration induced by rns and hydroxylation induced by ho are main reactions occurred during cec degradation in uv365 no2 system overall uv365 is a potential technology to remove cecs and no2 in aquatic environment when residual no2 is present our present study also provides possibility for the application of sunlight to remediate water co polluted by cecs and no2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords residual nitrite contaminants of emerging concern reactive nitrogen species hydroxyl radical degradation pathways 1 introduction in our daily life large amounts of contaminants of emerging concern cecs are being discharged to domestic wastewater agricultural runoffs and surface runoffs which then enter into groundwater rivers and drinking water treatment plants dwtp bu et al 2019 richardson and kimura 2017 cecs from our household products are typically of trace concentrations bioaccumulative and are thus of great concerns for aquatic life on the positive side advanced engineering solutions such as advanced oxidation processes aops adsorption and membrane technologies are confirmed to be efficient to remove cecs richardson and ternes 2018 including in case these cecs are found in trace concentrations in the source waters ng l 1 μg l 1 taking the removal performance and economic cost into consideration aop is a competitive choice among the above mentioned technologies richardson and kimura 2017 which can mineralize or transform cecs aops rely on the generation of reactive species of which reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radical ho superoxide radical singlet oxygen hydroperoxyl radical fernandez castro et al 2015 and reactive chlorine species rcs e g chlorine radical chlorine oxide radical chlorohydroxyl radical dichloride radical duan et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b are among the most common apart from ros and rcs reactive nitrogen species rns are also important class of reactive species in aops rns include nitrogen oxide radical no nitrogen dioxide radical no2 nitrogen trioxide radical no3 peroxynitrite onoo and amino radical nh2 bu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 neta et al 1988 among various rns no3 is a strong oxidant with a redox potential in the range of 2 3 2 5 v while no2 1 03 v and no 0 39 v are of relatively moderate strength oxidants but effective nitrating and nitrosating reagents lancaster jr 1996 neta et al 1988 therefore reaction mechanisms of cecs with rns are very different from cecs with ros or rcs under most circumstances rns are unintendedly generated from the residual nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 via two ways bu et al 2020a mack and bolton 1999 tugaoen et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 1 reactions of strong radicals e g ho with nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 2 photolysis of no3 or no2 the latter one is the predominant way of rns formation in natural environment with the simultaneous generation of ho because no3 is ubiquitous and can sometimes reach up to 50 mg n l 1 in groundwater or agricultural runoffs photolysis of no3 is frequently investigated also within the context of degradation of cecs bu et al 2020b ge et al 2019 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 however the used concentration of no3 in the aforementioned publications ranged from 5 to 10 mm 70 140 mg n l 1 which is higher than the observed maximum concentration 50 mg n l 1 in natural waters and much higher than the regulated concentration 10 mg n l 1 for drinking water therefore cecs can hardly be efficiently degraded by the photolysis of no3 at environmentally relevant concentrations and extra addition of no3 to the treated water will lead to a serious secondary pollution chain reactions induced by photolysis of no2 involve the dynamic cycles of no2 and no3 as shown in equations 1 6 gligorovski et al 2015 zafiriou and true 1979 of note the quantum yield of ho and rns from photolysis of no2 is documented to be higher than that from photolysis of no3 thus no2 is two orders of magnitude more efficient than no3 in generating radicals at equivalent concentrations gligorovski et al 2015 moreover herrmann found that no2 in natural waters is more important than no3 to degrade cecs in spite of the relatively lower concentration of no2 herrmann 2007 therefore naturally present no2 may play an important role on the degradation of cecs in natural environment calza et al 2012 as the concentration of no2 is regulated as no more than 1 0 mg n l 1 in drinking water and can reach up to several mg n l 1 in environmental waters such as groundwater and agricultural runoffs concentrations of no2 in terms of n at 0 1 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 were used in this study 1 no2 hv no o 2 o h2o ho oh 3 ho no2 no2 oh 4 ho no2 onoo 5 2no2 h2o no3 h hno2 6 no3 hv no2 o furthermore the maximum absorption bands of no2 is mainly distributed around uv a 315 400 nm area especially 350 nm lee and yoon 2007 shah et al 2011 which is also the predominant uv bands in the sunlight thus uv at wavelength of 365 nm was used to evaluate the potential use of sunlight and better identify the role of no2 recently uv light emitting diodes leds at different wavelengths were employed to inactivate pathogens wan et al 2020 coupled with chlorine to degrade cecs zou et al 2019 and examined in the control of formation of disinfection byproducts gao et al 2019 uv led 255 nm generally performed no worse than low pressure uv 254 nm on degradation of cecs in uv h2o2 process huang et al 2020 and uv chlorine process duan et al 2018 besides leds have advantages such as availability in various wavelengths lower required energy no mercury pollution and longer lifetime nyangaresi et al 2019 sholtes and linden 2019 therefore uv led365 was chosen to degrade cecs in this study overall the present study aims to 1 investigate the degradation of cecs with different structures by uv365 in the presence of low concentrations of no2 and calculate the respective contributions of uv365 photolysis rns and ho 2 evaluate the impacts of ph dissolved oxygen do and natural organic matter nom on the degradation of cecs 3 explore the evolution profiles of cecs and no2 in actual waters and 4 propose possible degradation pathways of bpa and cbz in uv365 no2 system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bisphenol a bpa bisphenol s bps carbamazepine cbz atrazine atz sulfadiazine

na2hpo4 were purchased from sinopharm china nom purchased from international humic substances society usa was extracted from suwannee river nano2 solution was freshly prepared every day 2 2 photochemical experiments photochemical experiments were conducted in an equipment shown in si fig s1 with a uv led emitting at wavelength of 365 nm the average uv intensity i 0 was measured as 3 05 mw cm 2 detailed information about investigated cecs are shown in table 1 experiments were conducted as follows unless otherwise specified initial concentrations of cecs and probe compound of 2 μm and no2 of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 were prepared in a solution of 50 ml solution ph was maintained at 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 using phosphate buffer of 2 0 mm at determined time intervals samples of 150 μl were sampled and subsequently quenched using methanol of 50 μl for hplc analysis and samples of 1 ml were collected for no3 no2 determination nitrogen of high purity 99 999 was sparged to the solution for 30 min in advance of the initiation of the degradation process when the impacts of do were investigated initial concentrations of cecs of 10 μm were used in experiments focused on the identification of transformation products actual water samples were collected from changsha yanghu dwtp at point a influent and point b after sedimentation to evaluate cec degradation in actual waters all experiments were conducted for three times 2 3 determination of contributions of uv photolysis ho and rns as shown the concentrations of no2 during the whole process did not change si fig s2 because no2 is the predominant final product from the photolysis of no2 tugaoen et al 2017 thus the steady state assumption can be used in this process for the concentrations of radicals huang et al 2018 to determine the respective contributions of uv365 photolysis ho and rns to the degradation of cecs by uv no2 system the steady state concentration of ho ho ss was calculated using nb 2 μm as a probe compound because nb does not react with rns huang et al 2018 therefore ho ss can be calculated based on the results shown in si fig s3 via rearranging the following equation 7 d n b d t k u v n b n b k h o n b h o s s n b k o b s n b n b besides the evolution profiles of cecs can be expressed as 8 d c e c d t k u v c e c c e c k h o c e c h o s s c e c k r n s c e c r n s c e c k o b s c e c c e c where k u v n b and k u v c e c are pseudo first order rate constants of the degradation of nb and cecs under uv photolysis respectively and k h o n b k h o c e c and k r n s c e c are the second order rate constant of ho with nb ho with cecs and rns with cecs respectively therefore the removal of cecs can be represented as the sum of three terms 9 r r u v r h o r r n s determination of r uv r ho and r rns was calculated using the method reported in previous studies cheng et al 2018 huang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 and shown in si text s1 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of all cecs and probe compounds in this study were measured using an agilent 1260 hplc detailed conditions can be found at si table s1 the concentrations of no3 and no2 were determined using a dionex aquion ion chromatography with an ionpac as28 4 μm column transformation products of cecs were identified using an agilent 1260 hplc tandem 6420 triple quadrupole qqq mass detailed conditions can be found at si text s2 2 5 molecular orbital distributions calculation based on density functional theory gaussian 16 program was used to calculate the molecular orbital distributions i e highest occupied molecular orbitals homo at the level of b3lyp 6 31g 2df p frontier electron density fed2 was then analyzed using multiwfn lu and chen 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of cecs by uv365 photolysis in the presence of no2 degradation of selected cecs i e bpa bps cbz atz sdz and nax by uv365 photolysis in the presence of 0 0 1 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 no2 are shown in si fig s4 and all degradation kinetics obey the pseudo first order kinetics the observed rate constants are presented in fig 1 as shown bpa bps cbz atz and nax are refractory to photolysis using uv365 with rate constants of no more than 6 10 5 s 1 while sdz could be removed with rate constants of 3 667 10 4 s 1 the corresponding degradation rate constants in the presence of 0 1 mg l 1 no2 increased by 1 61 99 4 folds for the selected cecs compared to those in the absence of no2 the enhanced degradation could be attributed to ho and rns generated from the photolysis of no2 the increment further enlarged by 6 6 81 2 with the increase in the concentration of no2 from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 si table s2 with more reactive species formed however when the concentration of no2 increased from 1 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 rate constants of bpa cbz and sdz kept increasing by 45 5 0 6 and 58 7 respectively but degradation of other three cecs were inhibited by 22 7 40 6 this can be explained from three aspects 1 excess no2 can transform ho to no2 as shown in equation 3 with a rate constant of 1 1010 m 1 s 1 mack and bolton 1999 which thereby leads to increase in steady state concentration of rns and decrease in steady state concentration of ho si table s2 2 rns especially no2 prefer to react with compounds with electron donating moieties such as bpa phenol cbz olefin weakly electron donating and sdz anilines chon et al 2015 neta et al 1988 and 3 rns exhibit lower reactivity to compounds with electron withdrawing moieties e g atz and nax huang et al 2018 of note bps as an analogue of bpa is also a typical phenolic compound but shows different tendency from bpa at no2 of 1 0 5 0 mg l 1 according to the pka values of bps 7 42 and 8 03 choi and lee 2017 and bpa 9 6 and 10 2 cheng et al 2018 the so2 moiety in bps has much stronger electron withdrawing ability than c ch3 2 moiety in bpa it was reported that phenolic compounds with electron withdrawing moieties are more resistant to oxidants than those with electron donating moieties and appear to show electron withdrawing ability li et al 2018 stone 1987 therefore degradation of bps was much slower than bpa and showed similar tendency to cecs with electron withdrawing moieties 3 2 contributions of uv365 photolysis ho and rns to cec degradation the second order rate constants of ho with cecs are listed in table 1 of which kho bps was determined using the relative rate method reported in previous studies bu et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the detailed procedures are demonstrated in si text s3 and fig s5 contributions of uv365 photolysis ho and rns to the degradation of cecs at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 are presented in fig 2 uv365 photolyzed cecs slowly with observed rate constants ranging from 5 48 10 6 to 3 667 10 4 s 1 table 1 during the uv365 no2 system at no2 concentration of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 negligible contribution of uv365 photolysis was around 1 of the initial concentrations with exception of sdz and nax contributions of uv365 photolysis to sdz and nax degradation were 30 2 and 5 5 of their initial concentrations at no2 concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 in addition the contributions of uv365 photolysis to the degradation of all selected cecs decreased slightly when the concentration of no2 increased because more uv365 was absorbed by the increasing no2 and less uv365 can be used to photolyze cecs ho can be generated from no2 with a quantum yield of 4 5 1 0 at 365 nm alif and boule 1991 which thereby contributed to cec degradation in uv no2 system contributions of ho to degradation of cecs are generally proportional to the second order rate constants of ho with cecs when concentration of no2 was the same taking 0 5 mg l 1 no2 as an example eliminated cecs by ho exposure accounted for 16 9 16 1 15 0 7 9 6 8 and 3 7 for bpa cbz nax sdz atz and bps respectively the order is generally the same as that of their rate constants with ho as presented ho is not the main contributor for cec degradation despite their high reaction rate constants with cecs 109 1010 m 1s 1 which is due to the low ho ss at 10 14 m specifically ho ss was calculated as 2 41 10 14 2 58 10 14 2 94 10 14 and 2 56 10 14 m at no2 concentration of 0 1 0 5 1 0 5 0 mg l 1 respectively si table s2 ho ss increased with no2 concentration ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 but decreased when no2 concentration further increased to 5 0 mg l 1 because of the transformation from ho to rns however the contribution of ho to cec degradation was similar at different no2 concentrations 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 because the corresponding ho ss was in the same order of magnitude rns in this study are namely no from equation 1 no2 from equation 3 and onoo from equation 4 as shown in fig 2 rns is the predominant contributor for degradation of investigated cecs at no2 concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 except sdz and nax specifically at no2 concentration of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 cec removal resulting from rns was 61 4 84 8 86 0 89 6 53 9 73 7 61 1 78 2 23 4 71 4 and 39 4 61 0 of the total removal of bpa bps cbz atz sdz and nax respectively similar to the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constants of cecs the contributions of rns to cec degradation generally increased when the concentrations of no2 increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 at no2 concentrations of 5 0 mg l 1 contributions of rns to target pollutant degradation further increased for bpa cbz and sdz but decreased in the case of bps atz and nax the phenomena can be explained by the large amount of formation and self scavenging effect of rns it has been discussed in section 3 1 that rns have high reactivity with electron rich substrates overall rns is the most important species in uv365 no2 system to remove cecs the individual contributions of no no2 and onoo and their reaction mechanisms are also interesting to investigate which still requires further research 3 3 impacts of do and ph on cec degradation do and ph are two important water quality parameters that impact photo degradation of cecs in environmental water bodies hence the impacts of do and ph on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system were investigated at no2 concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 below drinking water regulations of china us and who as shown in fig 3 a 73 9 and 62 9 of bpa and cbz was removed at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 with the rate constants of 11 48 10 4 and 8 08 10 4 s 1 respectively on the other hand when do was excluded by n2 a slight lower removal was achieved namely 68 0 and 58 9 of bpa and cbz was removed at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 with the rate constants of 9 98 10 4 and 7 63 10 4 s 1 respectively the slower degradation of cecs with n2 purging indicated the participation of do during the generation of reactive species the phenomenon can be attributed to the following equations 10 no2 hv no2 e 11 e o2 o2 12 o2 no onoo 13 o2 h2o hoo ho of which equation 10 is a side reaction of no2 photolysis with a very low quantum yield of no more than 10 3 fischer and warneck 1996 therefore only a slight inhibition on the degradation of selected cecs was observed when do was excluded in spite of the high rate constants of equation 11 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 and 12 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 shankar et al 2007 tugaoen et al 2017 of note a similar phenomenon was found in another study when they investigated cec degradation by xenon lamp 280 nm no3 system ge et al 2019 the impact of ph 6 0 8 0 on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system is illustrated in fig 3b as shown 52 0 73 1 and 70 5 of bpa was removed at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively it was reported that the quantum yield of ho from photolysis of no3 and no2 is ph independent 6 0 9 0 zellner et al 1990 however bpa degradation at ph 6 0 is obviously slower than those at ph 7 0 and 8 0 therefore the relatively slower degradation of bpa at ph 6 0 could be attributed to the species of rns for example onoo generated from equation 4 is stable at ph 7 0 and 8 0 pka 6 6 7 0 but rapidly isomerizes to no3 from honoo at ph 6 0 equation 14 løgager and sehested 1993 which therefore has no oxidation ability 14 honoo no3 h ph 6 6 3 4 impacts of nom and actual water components on cec degradation and no2 evolution as nom usually co exists with no2 in environmental waters the impact of nom on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system was investigated figs 4a and si fig s6 as shown rate constants of bpa degradation were 11 48 10 4 8 83 10 4 10 37 10 4 and 10 05 10 4 s 1 with nom concentrations at 0 1 2 and 3 mg c l 1 respectively revealing that nom does not monotonically inhibit or accelerate bpa degradation in uv365 no2 system the phenomenon indicated that nom shows a multiple effect in uv365 no2 system 1 suwannee river nom was reported to have a singlet oxygen 1o2 quantum yield of 2 46 0 14 and a high energy triplet state 3nom quantum yield of 1 47 0 12 under simulated solar irradiation zhou et al 2019a and both species play critical roles in cec degradation de laurentiis et al 2013 grebel et al 2012 besides activation of nom could absorb part intensity of uv365 which attenuate the photolysis of no2 anyhow the involvement of nom significantly impacted the radical chain reactions initiated by photolysis of no2 2 nom also plays a competitive role to consume generated reactive species e g k h o n o m 1 4 10 4 l m g c 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 from photolysis of no2 furthermore actual water a influent and b after sedimentation collected from dwtp were used as background as shown in fig 4 b 73 9 77 0 and 83 5 of bpa was removed in deionized di water actual water a and actual water b with rate constants of 11 48 10 4 12 03 10 4 and 14 63 10 4 s 1 respectively at uv fluence of 3660 mj cm 2 and no2 concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 the increase in degradation efficiency in actual waters could be attributed to the presence of no3 no2 and chromophoric nom see si table s4 which are known as the main sources of ho in aqueous environment it should be noted that although the investigated no2 concentration 0 5 mg l 1 is acceptable in drinking water it is better if no2 and cecs can be simultaneously removed however the concentration of no2 kept constant when the experiment was conducted in di water si fig s2 considered the complex background components in actual waters the evolution profiles of no2 may present different trends as presented in fig 4c concentrations of no2 in actual waters a and b obviously decreased and corresponding concentration of no3 increased si fig s7 indicating that part of no2 was transformed to no3 in actual waters therefore uv365 has promising potential to be utilized in dwtp to simultaneously remove the residual no2 and cecs 3 5 transformation products of cbz and bpa in uv no2 system we assigned the tentative structures of transformation products of bpa and cbz in the uv365 no2 system based on the mass to charge value m z corresponding spectra and geometries si figs s8 s12 and fed2 of each atom si tables s5 s6 details of detected transformation products are summarized in si table s7 as shown in fig 5 hydroxylation induced by ho and nitration induced by no2 are main reactions occurred on bpa and cbz during the investigated system as hydroxylation and nitration reactions are both electrophilic substitutions the fed2 of each atom on the structures of bpa and cbz were calculated of which the atoms with higher fed2 are reactive sites that are readier to be attacked by electrophilic reagents chu et al 2016 as shown in fig 5a carbon atoms c1 c2 c15 and c16 of bpa have relatively higher fed2 indicating the aromatic rings especially the above mentioned four atoms are more easily to be substituted by ho and no2 the similar values of fed2 of c1 and c15 c2 and c16 indicated that bpa has a balanced structure therefore hydroxylation and dehydroxylation nitration are initial reactions occurred on bpa to generate p1 m z 243 1027 p2 m z 272 0928 and p3 m z 256 0979 further hydroxylation on p1 to form p4 m z 259 0976 was also observed in cbz molecular structure c12 c21 c23 and n30 have highest values of fed2 implying that aromatic ring the right one composed of c11 16 and olefin c21 c23 are most susceptible sites for electrophilic reagents to attack cbz as exhibited in fig 5b ho and no2 are easily substituted on the right aromatic ring of cbz to generate p5 m z 253 0972 and p6 m z 282 0873 then p7 m z 298 0873 on the other hand undergoing ho attack and electron transfer si scheme s1 cbz converted to p8 m z 271 1077 with the breakdown of double bond between c21 and c23 kosjek et al 2009 then p9 m z 300 0979 and p10 m z 284 103 could be generated from p8 via nitration and nitrosation by no2 and no meanwhile with the further attack of ho and the release of peroxyl radical p11 m z 269 0921 was formed via scheme s2 bu et al 2018 of note nitration and hydroxylation also occurred on the products of cbz p12 m z 180 0808 to yield p13 m z 225 0659 and p14 m z 241 0608 moreover evolution profiles of each detected transformation products of bpa and cbz are shown in fig 6 all detected bpa products p1 p4 initially increased and then decreased with uv fluence fig 6a meaning that detected compounds are initial products of bpa in uv365 no2 system as known the nitrated nitrosated cecs may exhibit higher stability and toxicity than the parent cecs d ischia et al 2011 the results relieve some concerns on this potential risk on the other hand for products of cbz only p5 p8 m z of 253 0972 282 0873 298 0873 and 271 1077 and p10 m z 284 103 reached their peak values in the investigated uv fluence and other cbz products i e p9 m z 300 0979 and p11 p14 m z 269 0921 180 0808 225 0659 and 241 0608 kept increasing the results indicated that p5 p8 and p10 are initial products of cbz and p9 and p11 p14 are probably further products generated from the initial cbz products 4 conclusion due to the generation of rns and ho no2 of low concentration photolyzed by uv365 is confirmed to be promising to degrade cecs indicating the potential application of sunlight when no2 is residual in water main conclusions were obtained as follows 1 pseudo first order rate constants of all investigated cecs increased with the increase of no2 concentration 0 1 0 mg l 1 degradation rate constants of bpa cbz and sdz further increased while those of bps atz and nax decreased when no2 concentration was increased to 5 0 mg l 1 modeling analysis revealed that rns is the predominant contributor to cec degradation at no2 concentration of 0 1 5 0 mg l 1 in uv365 no2 system while ho was found to be the second predominant contributor except for the case of sdz it was also determined that uv365 photolysis is the second predominant contributor to sdz degradation 2 the presence of do has slight acceleration on cec degradation in uv365 no2 system ph 6 0 8 0 impacts cec degradation mainly through altering the patterns of rns i e honoo or onoo rather than the yield of rns nom play a dual role for cec degradation in uv365 no2 system 3 cec degradation was enhanced when actual water samples were used as water matrices in uv365 no2 system because of the presence of no3 chromophoric nom and other photo sensitized compounds simultaneous removal of cecs and no2 was observed in actual waters 4 degradation pathways of bpa and cbz in uv365 no2 system were proposed based on the results of mass and quantum chemistry calculation methods nitration nitrosation induced by rns and hydroxylation induced by ho are main reactions occurred in this system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17928,anion exchange resin aer adsorption is an established technology for water treatment and groundwater remediation two contaminants amenable to aer treatment are natural organic matter nom and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas specifically anionic perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas such as perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and is often targeted for removal pfas occurrence in water resources is a human health concern accordingly the goal of this research was to provide new insights on the use of aer for water treatment considering separate and combined removal of nom and pfaas batch experiments were conducted comparing polystyrene and polyacrylic aer in both chloride and sulfate forms using natural groundwater spiked with suwannee river natural organic matter srnom and or six pfaas the polymer composition of the aer had a significant impact on contaminant removal with polystyrene resin more effective for pfaa removal and polyacrylic resin more effective for srnom removal both resins had type i quaternary ammonium functional groups however the polyacrylic resin had trimethyl ammonium whereas the polystyrene resin had triethyl ammonium therefore the influence of polymer composition could not be isolated conclusively from functional group chemistry polystyrene aer showed greater removal of pfaas with sulfonate than carboxylate head group and 8 carbon than 4 carbon chain length removal of srnom and pfaas by both resin polymer compositions were greater when sulfate was the mobile counterion ion than chloride the results of this research have important implications for using aer for water treatment and remediation foremost polymer composition and mobile counterion form of the resin can be selected to target specific contaminants and maximize contaminant removal when contaminants have unique interactions with aer such as srnom and polyacrylic resin and pfaas and polystyrene resin the presence of one contaminant does not impact removal of the other contaminant keywords ion exchange per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas perfluorooctanoate pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos polyacrylic polystyrene 1 introduction the presence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in water resources is of growing concern globally due to low removal by conventional treatment processes and the adverse impacts of pfas contaminated water on human health appleman et al 2014 banzhaf et al 2017 toms et al 2019 whether for drinking water treatment or groundwater remediation granular activated carbon gac adsorption is the most studied process for treatment of pfas contaminated water and shows effective removal of long chain pfas such as perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos liu et al 2019 park et al 2020 an alternative adsorption process to gac is anion exchange resin aer which is well established for removal of natural organic matter nom and inorganic contaminants from natural waters boyer 2015 levchuk et al 2018 plummer et al 2018 and has emerged as a viable process for removal of pfas from contaminated waters emery et al 2019 woodard et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the adsorption mechanism for aer is stoichiometric exchange between mobile counterions in the resin with contaminant ions in water boyer and singer 2008 rahmani and mohseni 2017 with the potential for van der waals hydrophobic interactions between the resin and contaminant landry and boyer 2013 landry et al 2015 li and sengupta 1998 with respect to pfas the perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa category which includes pfoa and pfos is amenable to aer treatment because pfaas have pka 1 and hence are deprotonated anionic in water zhang et al 2019 the literature on pfaa removal by aer is growing in scope appleman et al 2014 carter and farrell 2010 chularueangaksorn et al 2013 2014 conte et al 2015 deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2019 du et al 2015 franke et al 2019 gao et al 2017 kothawala et al 2017 lampert et al 2007 maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 schaefer et al 2019 senevirathna et al 2010a 2010b woodard et al 2017 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 the main emphasis is aer removal of pfoa and pfos since 2014 many of the studies have expanded the list of pfaas to include the shorter chain c8 analogs of pfoa and pfos previous studies have compared aer and gac for pfaa removal explored the impact of resin properties functional group polymer composition and pore structure on pfaa removal and investigated the impact of solution composition on pfaa removal by aer the main results from previous studies are highlighted here to place this research in the proper context based on the experimental conditions tested aer exhibited equal or greater adsorption capacity or removal of pfaas than gac considering batch isotherms and column studies kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 senevirathna et al 2010b yu et al 2009 there is not a clear consensus on the impact of resin properties on removal of pfaas due to limited data available for example one study showed the highest pfhxs adsorption capacity for strong base polystyrene macroporous resin maimaiti et al 2018 whereas another study showed the highest pfos adsorption capacity for weak base polyacrylic gel resin deng et al 2010 both studies showed that strong base polystyrene gel resin had the lowest adsorption capacity for pfaas meanwhile competition from the background water matrix explains absence of the best resin properties for all around pfaa removal several studies have evaluated the impact of nom or dissolved organic carbon doc on pfaa removal by aer kothawala et al 2017 showed that the addition of 2 8 mg l doc resulted in approximately 10 percentage point reduction in pfaa removal by polystyrene aer dixit et al 2019 showed a greater impact of doc with pfoa and pfos removal by polyacrylic aer reduced by 25 percentage points or more the differing impacts of nom on pfaa removal by aer is due to the combination of nom characteristics e g aromaticity molecular weight and aer properties e g polymer composition the clearest trends to emerge from the literature on pfaa removal by aer is greater removal of sulfonate over carboxylate pfaa functional groups and greater removal with increasing pfaa chain length du et al 2015 franke et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 this research was designed to fill key gaps in the literature with an obvious gap being the comparison of polystyrene and polyacrylic aer for removal of short and long chain pfaas previous ion exchange studies have shown that polystyrene aer is more selective than polyacrylic aer for hydrophobic organic ionizable compounds gustafson and lirio 1968 kanazawa et al 2004 landry and boyer 2013 li and sengupta 1998 whereas polyacrylic aer exhibits greater removal of nom than polystyrene aer bolto et al 2002 boyer and singer 2008 shuang et al 2015 for example 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid had higher selectivity for polystyrene type i aer than polyacrylic type i aer gustafson and lirio 1968 and benzoic acid had similar selectivity for polystyrene type i and type ii aers which was greater than polyacrylic type ii aer kanazawa et al 2004 hence resin polymer composition is expected to impact pfaa removal by aer in addition many of the previous studies on pfaa removal by aer have been conducted in test waters in the absence of nom with the exception of a few studies dixit et al 2019 du et al 2015 franke et al 2019 kothawala et al 2017 so new experimental data on pfaa removal by aer in the presence of nom will contribute to the literature finally all aer studies have used chloride as the mobile counterion which presumes nacl based regeneration and hence pfaa oxidation in nacl based solution is problematic due to formation of perchlorate azizi et al 2011 jawando et al 2015 yang et al 2019 chloride free regeneration solutions could facilitate alternative approaches to pfaa destruction such as sulfate radical or persulfate oxidation farhat et al 2015 matzek et al 2018 radjenovic and petrovic 2016 alternative regeneration solutions must be compatible with ion exchange stoichiometry and not pose an adverse impact in the treated water e g corrosion human health a short list of possible mobile counterions includes bicarbonate and sulfate i e non corrosive safe for human consumption because aers have a high affinity for pfaas the counterion will need to have a strong affinity for the resin to displace the pfaas hence sulfate was selected over bicarbonate because of its higher separation factor clifford et al 2011 and the possibility of residual sulfate from destruction technologies based on strongly oxidizing sulfate radicals or persulfate the goal of this research was to provide new insights on the use of aer for water treatment or remediation considering separate and combined removal of nom and pfaas the specific objectives of this research were to evaluate the following aer and solution conditions on solute removal by ion exchange 1 impact of polymer composition specifically polystyrene versus polyacrylic 2 impact of mobile counterion specifically chloride versus sulfate 3 presence of pfaas on nom removal and 4 presence of nom on pfaas removal batch experiments were conducted to evaluate separate and combined removal of nom and pfaas by aer all tests used natural groundwater spiked with nom and or pfaas the pfaa concentrations used in this research represent the high end of realistic such as encountered in groundwater near pfas contamination source zones backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 likewise the nom concentration was also on the high end of realistic for groundwater obolensky et al 2007 hence the pfaa to nom ratio in this research is expected to be realistic 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a520e and a860 purolite aers were used in this work both resins possess strong base quaternary ammonium functional groups and macroporous structure the resins differ in the nature of the quaternary ammonium groups and polymer composition a520e has triethyl ammonium functional groups total capacity 0 9 eq l and polystyrene composition a860 has trimethyl ammonium functional groups total capacity 0 8 eq l and polyacrylic composition although polymer composition was the focus of resin properties in this research the differing functional groups between a520e and a860 does present a confounding factor nevertheless the influence of polymer composition on the removal of ionizable organic compounds is well documented in the literature gustafson and lirio 1968 kanazawa et al 2004 li and sengupta 1998 and previous research showed similar pfaa removal by a520e resin and a strong base polystyrene resin with trimethyl ammonium functional groups zaggia et al 2016 the resins were received from the supplier in the chloride form i e chloride present as mobile counterion a portion of the resins were converted to the sulfate form by mixing resins in a highly concentrated solution of sodium sulfate i e sulfate ion was present at 32 excess relative to aer on equivalent basis the conversion of chloride form resin to sulfate form resin was assumed based on the knowledge from previous research hu et al 2016 rokicki and boyer 2011 mixing occurred in a jar test apparatus at 200 rpm for 24 h resins were separated from solution by filtration rinsed with deionized di water and placed in a desiccator to dry resin density was calculated by measuring five 1 ml wet resin samples in a graduated cylinder and then dried at room temperature in a desiccator for both types of resin in both the chloride and sulfate forms resins were measured and added to test waters as dry mass resin densities are reported in table s1 in electronic supplementary information esi resin doses are reported as volume of wet settled resin per volume of test water i e ml l to allow for comparison with other published studies alternatively resin dose can be expressed on equivalent concentration basis e g meq l when there is significant difference in ion exchange capacities between resins all test waters were composed of natural groundwater spiked with nom and or pfaa mixture the groundwater was collected from a single groundwater well in tempe arizona the groundwater composition is reported in table s2 in esi real groundwater was used as the test water for all experiments because of the prevalence of pfas contamination in groundwater there was no detectable pfas in the groundwater the doc concentration was 2 mg l and the concentration of inorganic ions was high as indicated by sodium chloride etc see table s2 in esi the pfaa mixture used in this research included perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos cas 1763 23 1 potassium perfluorohexanesulfonate k pfhxs cas 3871 99 6 potassium perfluorobutanesulfonate k pfbs cas 29 420 49 3 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa cas 335 67 1 perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa cas 307 24 4 perfluorobutanoic acid pfba cas 375 22 4 purchased from sigma aldrich at acs grade individual concentrated pfaa solutions were prepared in 10 by volume methanol in di water to ensure complete dissolution of pfaas the individual pfaa stock solutions were combined and diluted in groundwater for each batch experiment the residual methanol in the test water was 0 1 by volume measured concentrations are listed in table 1 the pfaa concentrations in this research are in line with pfaa concentrations in groundwater near pfas contamination souse zones backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 suwannee river natural organic matter srnom isolate 2r101n international humic substances society was used as the source of doc in this work srnom isolate was added to the groundwater at a dose of approximately 20 mg l as nom with doc concentrations given in table 1 because each batch of test water was made prepared separately there is some variation in initial doc concentration the doc concentration is representative of a high doc groundwater comstock and boyer 2014 obolensky et al 2007 the test water was not filtered but aer treated samples were filtered or centrifuged prior to analysis 2 2 experimental methods table 1 shows the experimental design including the measured concentrations of doc and pfaas in the untreated test waters batch tests were conducted with various doses of aer in 125 ml amber glass bottles containing 100 ml of test water all samples were tested in triplicate sample bottles were placed on shaker tables thermo scientific maxq 2000 and 3000 benchtop orbital shakers at 200 rpm for 24 h at room temperature approx 22 c the mixing speed was selected to ensure that the aer was well mixed throughout the bottle the mixing speed and equilibrium time were selected based on investigations in previous literature control samples of test water with no aer were included with each test condition afterwards all samples without pfaas were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and those containing pfaas were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min filtration through 0 45 μm filter is the standard definition for doc and standard approach for measurement of uv absorbance however previous research has shown that pfas such as pfoa can adsorb to filters lath et al 2019 therefore it was decided to filter samples that did not contain pfaas and centrifuge samples that did contain pfaas to support this approach uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and doc were measured in both filtered and centrifuged test water i e groundwater plus srnom the relative difference between filtered and centrifuged samples was 2 4 for uva254 and 4 5 for doc 2 3 analytical methods doc was measured on a shimadzu toc vch total organic carbon analyzer following non purgeable organic carbon method doc standards ricca chemical company were analyzed every 15 samples with relative difference less than 15 uva254 was measured using a hach dr6000 uv visible spectrophotometer using a 1 cm quartz cuvette pfaas were analyzed on an agilent hplc 1200 using gradient elution and a phenomenex gemini c18 column 110 å 100 3 mm 5 μm equipped with a c18 guard column and agilent diol guard column 12 5 4 6 mm 6 μm coupled to a sciex 3200 triple quadruple spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring and negative electrospray ionization mode the injection volume was 10 μl to eliminate background pfas contamination optima grade lc ms water and methanol fisher were used for mobile phase and a delay column luna c18 100 å 30 3 mm 5 μm was placed between the pump and autosampler the flow rate was 0 8 ml min and the gradient mobile phase consisted of 20 mm of ammonium acetate in water a and in methanol b starting at 5 b increased to 60 b in 0 75 min increased to 100 b for 4 min and maintained for 3 min decreased to 5 b in 1 min and maintained at 5 b for 2 min all pfas standard compounds were purchased from wellington laboratory inc ontario canada acceptance criterion of analytical replicates prepared in triplicate was relative standard deviation 30 this acceptance criterion encompasses sample preparation precision in the lab plus instrument analysis precision table s3 lists analysis parameters and the limit of quantitation loq for the pfaas analyzed in this research along with the isotope analytical standards 2 4 data analysis results for doc are presented as the mean concentration of triplicate samples with error bars showing one standard deviation results for pfaas are single measurements and for calculations and plotting the loq was used for individual pfaa concentrations less than the loq the precision for pfaa analysis is within 30 of true value two factor anova with replication was conducted for doc removal by aer to investigate the significance of resin polymer composition and mobile counterion form of the resin the null hypotheses were that doc removal was the same for i a520e vs a860 resin ii chloride vs sulfate counterion and iii interaction between polymer composition and mobile counterion at significance level α 0 05 doc removal was expressed as normalized concentration i e c c0 to account for variability in initial concentration post hoc analysis was conducted using paired t tests following bonferroni correction the results are presented in esi tables s4 and s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of doc by anion exchange fig 1 shows the reductions in doc by anion exchange highlighting differences in resin polymer composition and mobile counterion form of the resin fig s1 in esi shows the corresponding results for uva254 as well as uva254 and doc results normalized by initial concentration the doc and uva254 measurements represent the combination of nom from both the natural groundwater and the suwannee river nom isolate polystyrene a520e and polyacrylic a860 resins are compared within each subplot the impact of changing the mobile counterion form of the resin i e chloride vs sulfate is compared between the subplots table s4 presents the anova results corresponding to fig 1 the major results encompassing fig 1 fig s1 and table s4 are as follows uva254 was reduced to a greater extent than doc for all aer conditions except sulfate form a520e resin at 0 25 and 0 5 ml l because uva254 is correlated with aromatic rich and higher molecular weight sub fraction of doc weishaar et al 2003 it explains why previous studies and this study show that uva254 is reduced to a greater extent than overall doc by aer humbert et al 2005 polyacrylic a860 resin in both the chloride and sulfate forms showed greater reductions in doc and uva254 than polystyrene a520e resin in both mobile counterion forms the greater reductions in doc by a860 resin than a520e resin were statistically significant with p value 2 2 10 7 table s4 which suggests that resin polymer composition affects doc removal and polyacrylic resin is preferred over polystyrene resin for doc removal previous comparisons of resin polymer composition have reported greater doc removal by polyacrylic resin than polystyrene resin which was attributed to the hydrophilic nature of polyacrylic resins and higher water content of the resin that facilitates intraparticle pore diffusion of the doc and more favorable conformation of doc within the resin bolto et al 2002 boyer and singer 2008 cornelissen et al 2008 shuang et al 2015 a860 and a520e resins in both the chloride and sulfate forms showed similar reductions in doc and uva254 at the highest resin dose of 4 ml l furthermore for both resins in both mobile counterion forms the doc concentration in the 4 ml l sample was approximately equal to the doc concentration in the natural groundwater before suwannee river nom was added meaning the srnom was highly favorable for removal by aer anion exchange experiments using natural groundwater without srnom showed low doc removal approx 20 regardless of resin dose or resin conditions see fig s2 in esi hence the doc present in the natural groundwater was not amenable to removal by aer previous studies have documented that portions of doc can be non removable by aer graf et al 2014 however only 20 removal of doc by aer is very low and likely attributable to competition by inorganic anions such as sulfate see table s2 due to low removal of groundwater doc by aer no further results or discussion are presented for the groundwater only the most important result in fig 1 is the greater reduction in doc by aer when the resin was in the sulfate form compared with the chloride form the difference in doc removal by chloride form and sulfate form resins was statistically significant regardless of resin polymer composition p value 1 0 10 5 table s4 which indicates that the mobile counterion form of the resin influences doc removal and specifically sulfate can increase doc removal previous research on altering the mobile counterion form of aer has overlooked the potential benefits of sulfate form resin for example most research has focused on bicarbonate form resin as an alternative to chloride form resin hu et al 2016 ness and boyer 2017 rokicki and boyer 2011 with the main benefit being easier disposal of waste regeneration solution for bicarbonate than chloride it is important to emphasize that this benefit pertains to doc removal by aer in the absence of pfas the other benefit of bicarbonate form resin relative to chloride form resin is less corrosive water following aer treatment due to lower chloride concentration in the treated water edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 nguyen et al 2010 in the few studies that have evaluated sulfate form aer the results did not suggest the benefits of sulfate form resin observed in this study for example rokicki and boyer 2011 compared aer in the chloride bicarbonate nitrate and sulfate forms and did not show increased contaminant removal by sulfate form resin possible reasons for the increased doc removal by sulfate form resin than chloride form resin are discussed after considering additional results fig 2 shows the reductions in doc by anion exchange in an identical format as fig 1 with the key difference being the addition of pfaas to the natural groundwater spiked with srnom fig s3 in esi shows the corresponding results for uva254 as well as uva254 and doc results normalized by initial concentration table s5 presents the anova results corresponding to fig 2 most of the trends described in fig 1 hold for fig 2 for example doc reduction was statistically greater for a860 resin than a520e resin p value 0 022 table s5 again suggesting that resin polymer composition affects doc removal with greater doc removal for polyacrylic resin than polystyrene resin the most important result from fig 1 of the greater reduction in doc by anion exchange when the resin was in the sulfate form compared with the chloride form was also statistically significant in fig 2 regardless of resin polymer composition p value 7 1 10 5 table s5 this further supports that changing the mobile counterion of the resin from chloride to sulfate can increase doc removal for the experiments shown in figs 1 and 2 the test waters only varied due to the absence or presence of pfaas both test waters were based on tempe groundwater matrix with addition of srnom looking collectively at the results in figs 1 and 2 and tables s4 and s5 it appears that changing the mobile counterion form of a resin from chloride to sulfate had a greater impact on a520e resin than a860 resin considering the mean difference in doc removal between resin conditions the difference between a520e and a860 resins decreases in going from chloride form resins to sulfate form resins and the difference between chloride and sulfate forms of a520e resin is greater than the corresponding difference for a860 resin see summary of interaction results in table s4 although a520e and a860 resins differ in polymer composition they also differ in the identity of the quaternary ammonium functional group being triethyl ammonium vs trimethyl ammonium respectively a520e resin is designed to be selective for nitrate over sulfate by increasing the size and spacing of the quaternary ammonium functional groups to favor monovalent anions over divalent anions hu et al 2016 subramonian and clifford 1988 therefore it is possible that converting a520e resin from the chloride form to the sulfate form results in unfavorable conditions for the mobile counterion in the resin in turn this results in a greater driving force for exchanging the counterion in the resin with the counterion in solution in this case doc the different functional groups could also impact uptake kinetics but it was not studied here comparing doc removal by aer between figs 1 and 2 the noteworthy change is the presence of six pfaas in the test water in fig 2 because a different separation method was applied prior to doc analysis see section 2 2 a statistical comparison was not conducted on the results in figs 1 and 2 that said the results in figs 1 and 2 follow the same trends which suggests that the presence of pfaas did not impact doc removal by anion exchange for the resin conditions mentioned for example in both figs 1 and 2 a860 resin removed more doc than a520e resin regardless of mobile counterion and sulfate form resin removed more doc than chloride form resin regardless of polymer composition see tables s4 and s5 there is limited previous research on the impact of pfaas on doc removal by aer kothawala et al 2017 studied a single polystyrene aer and showed minimal impact of doc on pfaa removal by aer dixit et al 2019 studied a single polyacrylic aer and evaluated the impact of different types of nom on removal of pfos and pfoa by anion exchange neither study evaluated the impact of pfaas i e absence vs presence on doc removal by aer in general trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides are present at orders of magnitude lower concentrations than doc and are not expected to interfere with doc removal dixit et al 2018 humbert et al 2008 the main competitor of doc removal by aer is typically inorganic anions such as sulfate hu et al 2016 in the context of this research with average pfaa to doc mass ratio of 0 056 and average pfaa to doc equivalent ratio of 0 086 see table s2 the results suggest that the presence of pfaas did not interfere with doc removal by aer 3 2 removal of pfaas by anion exchange fig 3 shows the reductions in pfaas by polystyrene a520e resin and evaluates the impact of doc absence vs presence of srnom and mobile counterion form of the resin chloride vs sulfate because the pfaas were present at different initial concentrations see table 1 the results in fig 3 show normalized concentrations to facilitate comparisons the general trend for pfaa removal by aer was sulfonates removed to a greater extent than carboxylates and c6 and c8 pfaas removed to greater extent than c4 pfaas previous studies show similar trends with removal of pfaas by aer increasing with increasing carbon chain length and greater removal of sulfonate functional groups than carboxylate functional groups franke et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 the clearest consensus among previous studies is the greatest removal of pfos and lowest removal of pfba by aer this is hypothesized to be due to the combination of electrostatic and van der waals forces of attraction contributing to pfos removal versus electrostatic attraction only for pfba removal to elaborate li and sengupta 1998 showed that it is favorable to transfer hydrophobic organic ionizable compound from water to non polar phase such as aer regardless of polymer composition however there are additional favorable interactions i e van der waals between the hydrophobic organic ionizable compound and polystyrene resin matrix that are not present with the polyacrylic resin matrix li and sengupta 1998 the results of rahmani and mohseni 2017 support the first assertion whereby adsorption to polyacrylic resin increases for more hydrophobic organic compounds the results of landry and boyer 2013 support the second assertion whereby the anionic pharmaceutical diclofenac exhibited greater adsorption to polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin regarding pfaa removal by aer pfaas become more hydrophobic less favorable interactions with water as carbon chain length increases which translates to greater aer adsorption of c8 pfaa than c4 pfaa regardless of polymer composition in addition adsorption is expected be greater to polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin because of stronger van der waals forces of attraction that increase with increasing carbon chain length i e increasing polarizability a statistical analysis was not conducted on the results in fig 3 because only one sample out of the triplicate samples for each resin dose was analyzed for pfaas comparing the results in fig 3 on average subplot b shows lower c c0 bars than subplot a and subplot d shows lower c c0 bars than subplot c this trend is most noticeable at aer doses on 0 25 and 0 5 ml l and for pfba at all resin doses this was a similar result as doc removal which supports the conjecture of enhanced contaminant removal using a divalent counterion with a monovalent ion selective resin e g a520e to confirm this conjecture additional comparisons of divalent vs monovalent counterions would be needed the results in fig 3 did not show an obvious impact of the presence of srnom on pfaa removal by aer meaning that the presence of srnom did not interfere with pfaa removal although limited data are available previous studies also show minimal impact of nom on pfaa removal by aer dixit et al 2019 kothawala et al 2017 this indicates that aer a520e in this case is highly selective for pfaas because the average doc to pfaa equivalent ratio was 11 6 meaning there was 10 more nom than pfaas competing for ion exchange sites fig 4 shows the reductions in pfaas by polyacrylic a860 resin and evaluates the impact of doc absence vs presence of srnom and mobile counterion form of the resin chloride vs sulfate in the identical format as fig 3 the main result in fig 4 is the higher normalized pfaa concentrations by polyacrylic a860 resin than polystyrene a520e resin for all resin and solution conditions meaning that polyacrylic a860 resin was less effective for pfaa removal only pfos was consistently removed greater than 50 by polyacrylic a860 resin pfba showed the least removal due to the low removals of pfaas by polyacrylic a860 resin there was not a major impact of changing the mobile counterion form of the resin or evaluating the absence or presence of srnom the lower removal of pfaas by polyacrylic a860 resin than polystyrene a520e resin is hypothesized to be due to weaker van der waals forces of attraction between pfaas and polyacrylic resin than pfaas and polystyrene resin as described above for example the same trend has been observed for removal of pharmaceuticals by aer with higher removal by polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin landry and boyer 2013 and more selective removal of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals than hydrophilic pharmaceuticals by polystyrene resin landry et al 2015 a860 polyacrylic resin was shown by dixit et al 2019 to effectively remove pfos and pfoa in the presence of srnom however their results did not include a comparison with polystyrene resin or consider short chain pfaas such as pfba and pfbs the impact of nom in figs 3 and 4 is limited to srnom where it is known that nom hydrophobicity and molecular weight can influence the ion exchange process finkbeiner et al 2020 the results in figs 3 and 4 illustrate the importance of evaluating pfaa removal by aer considering short and long chain carboxylates and sulfonates to obtain a more complete understanding of removal performance for example both polystyrene a520e and polyacrylic a860 resins showed high removal of pfos however only a520e resin achieved 50 removal of shorter chain pfaas 3 3 implications for aer treatment the results of this research have several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results regarding the aer experiments there was some variability in initial doc and pfaas concentrations that make exact comparison difficult however all test waters were based on the same groundwater matrix although comparison of resin polymer composition was an important aspect of this research it could be not conclusively separated from the different functional group chemistry and ion exchange capacity however previous research comparing polystyrene resins with different functional groups wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2009 zaggia et al 2016 shows smaller differences in resin selectivity than comparing polystyrene and polyacrylic resins kanazawa et al 2004 landry and boyer 2013 li and sengupta 1998 the results of this research show that changing the mobile counterion form of the resin from chloride to sulfate can increase contaminant removal especially for a520e resin which is designed to be selective for monovalent anions over divalent anions the benefits of sulfate form aer go beyond contaminant removal to include less corrosive treated water i e higher sulfate concentration in treated water decreases the chloride to sulfate mass ratio more disposal options for sulfate based waste regeneration solution when hazardous contaminants are not present and expanded options for treatment of hazardous contaminants in waste regeneration solution e g sulfate based regeneration solution is expected to eliminate the potential for perchlorate formation during electrochemical treatment studies on the destruction of pfaas in sulfate based regeneration solutions the use strongly oxidizing sulfate radical or persulfate are the next logical step in this research 4 conclusions the polymer composition of aer has a significant impact on contaminant removal and can be used to target specific contaminants although it was minimal in this study the influence functional group chemistry needs to be considered along with polymer composition on adsorption capacity that said ionizable organic contaminants such as pfaas show higher removal with polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin due to the hypothesized favorable combination of electrostatic and van der waals forces of attraction higher molecular weight contaminants such as srnom show higher removal with polyacrylic resin than polystyrene resin due the higher water content of polyacrylic resin and ability for intraparticle pore diffusion when contaminants and resins have unique and favorable interactions such as srnom with polyacrylic resin and pfaas with polystyrene resin interference by co contaminants is minimized specific to this research the presence of pfaas had a minimal impact on srnom removal by anion exchange using polyacrylic resin and likewise the presence of srnom had a minimal impact on pfaas removal by anion exchange using polystyrene resin this conclusion is limited to srnom and the six pfaas evaluated in this work so additional research is needed to extend its applicability changing the mobile counterion form of the resin from chloride to an alternative anion can have multiple benefits for sulfate form resin the benefits include higher contaminant removal especially for resin with triethyl ammonium functional groups less corrosive treated water and expanded options for brine disposal and treatment of contaminants in the waste regeneration solution the higher contaminant removal for sulfate form resin is believed to be more pronounced for resins with functional groups that are selective for monovalent anions over divalent ions e g triethyl ammonium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17928,anion exchange resin aer adsorption is an established technology for water treatment and groundwater remediation two contaminants amenable to aer treatment are natural organic matter nom and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas specifically anionic perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas such as perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and is often targeted for removal pfas occurrence in water resources is a human health concern accordingly the goal of this research was to provide new insights on the use of aer for water treatment considering separate and combined removal of nom and pfaas batch experiments were conducted comparing polystyrene and polyacrylic aer in both chloride and sulfate forms using natural groundwater spiked with suwannee river natural organic matter srnom and or six pfaas the polymer composition of the aer had a significant impact on contaminant removal with polystyrene resin more effective for pfaa removal and polyacrylic resin more effective for srnom removal both resins had type i quaternary ammonium functional groups however the polyacrylic resin had trimethyl ammonium whereas the polystyrene resin had triethyl ammonium therefore the influence of polymer composition could not be isolated conclusively from functional group chemistry polystyrene aer showed greater removal of pfaas with sulfonate than carboxylate head group and 8 carbon than 4 carbon chain length removal of srnom and pfaas by both resin polymer compositions were greater when sulfate was the mobile counterion ion than chloride the results of this research have important implications for using aer for water treatment and remediation foremost polymer composition and mobile counterion form of the resin can be selected to target specific contaminants and maximize contaminant removal when contaminants have unique interactions with aer such as srnom and polyacrylic resin and pfaas and polystyrene resin the presence of one contaminant does not impact removal of the other contaminant keywords ion exchange per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas perfluorooctanoate pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos polyacrylic polystyrene 1 introduction the presence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in water resources is of growing concern globally due to low removal by conventional treatment processes and the adverse impacts of pfas contaminated water on human health appleman et al 2014 banzhaf et al 2017 toms et al 2019 whether for drinking water treatment or groundwater remediation granular activated carbon gac adsorption is the most studied process for treatment of pfas contaminated water and shows effective removal of long chain pfas such as perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos liu et al 2019 park et al 2020 an alternative adsorption process to gac is anion exchange resin aer which is well established for removal of natural organic matter nom and inorganic contaminants from natural waters boyer 2015 levchuk et al 2018 plummer et al 2018 and has emerged as a viable process for removal of pfas from contaminated waters emery et al 2019 woodard et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the adsorption mechanism for aer is stoichiometric exchange between mobile counterions in the resin with contaminant ions in water boyer and singer 2008 rahmani and mohseni 2017 with the potential for van der waals hydrophobic interactions between the resin and contaminant landry and boyer 2013 landry et al 2015 li and sengupta 1998 with respect to pfas the perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa category which includes pfoa and pfos is amenable to aer treatment because pfaas have pka 1 and hence are deprotonated anionic in water zhang et al 2019 the literature on pfaa removal by aer is growing in scope appleman et al 2014 carter and farrell 2010 chularueangaksorn et al 2013 2014 conte et al 2015 deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2019 du et al 2015 franke et al 2019 gao et al 2017 kothawala et al 2017 lampert et al 2007 maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 schaefer et al 2019 senevirathna et al 2010a 2010b woodard et al 2017 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 the main emphasis is aer removal of pfoa and pfos since 2014 many of the studies have expanded the list of pfaas to include the shorter chain c8 analogs of pfoa and pfos previous studies have compared aer and gac for pfaa removal explored the impact of resin properties functional group polymer composition and pore structure on pfaa removal and investigated the impact of solution composition on pfaa removal by aer the main results from previous studies are highlighted here to place this research in the proper context based on the experimental conditions tested aer exhibited equal or greater adsorption capacity or removal of pfaas than gac considering batch isotherms and column studies kothawala et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 senevirathna et al 2010b yu et al 2009 there is not a clear consensus on the impact of resin properties on removal of pfaas due to limited data available for example one study showed the highest pfhxs adsorption capacity for strong base polystyrene macroporous resin maimaiti et al 2018 whereas another study showed the highest pfos adsorption capacity for weak base polyacrylic gel resin deng et al 2010 both studies showed that strong base polystyrene gel resin had the lowest adsorption capacity for pfaas meanwhile competition from the background water matrix explains absence of the best resin properties for all around pfaa removal several studies have evaluated the impact of nom or dissolved organic carbon doc on pfaa removal by aer kothawala et al 2017 showed that the addition of 2 8 mg l doc resulted in approximately 10 percentage point reduction in pfaa removal by polystyrene aer dixit et al 2019 showed a greater impact of doc with pfoa and pfos removal by polyacrylic aer reduced by 25 percentage points or more the differing impacts of nom on pfaa removal by aer is due to the combination of nom characteristics e g aromaticity molecular weight and aer properties e g polymer composition the clearest trends to emerge from the literature on pfaa removal by aer is greater removal of sulfonate over carboxylate pfaa functional groups and greater removal with increasing pfaa chain length du et al 2015 franke et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 this research was designed to fill key gaps in the literature with an obvious gap being the comparison of polystyrene and polyacrylic aer for removal of short and long chain pfaas previous ion exchange studies have shown that polystyrene aer is more selective than polyacrylic aer for hydrophobic organic ionizable compounds gustafson and lirio 1968 kanazawa et al 2004 landry and boyer 2013 li and sengupta 1998 whereas polyacrylic aer exhibits greater removal of nom than polystyrene aer bolto et al 2002 boyer and singer 2008 shuang et al 2015 for example 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid had higher selectivity for polystyrene type i aer than polyacrylic type i aer gustafson and lirio 1968 and benzoic acid had similar selectivity for polystyrene type i and type ii aers which was greater than polyacrylic type ii aer kanazawa et al 2004 hence resin polymer composition is expected to impact pfaa removal by aer in addition many of the previous studies on pfaa removal by aer have been conducted in test waters in the absence of nom with the exception of a few studies dixit et al 2019 du et al 2015 franke et al 2019 kothawala et al 2017 so new experimental data on pfaa removal by aer in the presence of nom will contribute to the literature finally all aer studies have used chloride as the mobile counterion which presumes nacl based regeneration and hence pfaa oxidation in nacl based solution is problematic due to formation of perchlorate azizi et al 2011 jawando et al 2015 yang et al 2019 chloride free regeneration solutions could facilitate alternative approaches to pfaa destruction such as sulfate radical or persulfate oxidation farhat et al 2015 matzek et al 2018 radjenovic and petrovic 2016 alternative regeneration solutions must be compatible with ion exchange stoichiometry and not pose an adverse impact in the treated water e g corrosion human health a short list of possible mobile counterions includes bicarbonate and sulfate i e non corrosive safe for human consumption because aers have a high affinity for pfaas the counterion will need to have a strong affinity for the resin to displace the pfaas hence sulfate was selected over bicarbonate because of its higher separation factor clifford et al 2011 and the possibility of residual sulfate from destruction technologies based on strongly oxidizing sulfate radicals or persulfate the goal of this research was to provide new insights on the use of aer for water treatment or remediation considering separate and combined removal of nom and pfaas the specific objectives of this research were to evaluate the following aer and solution conditions on solute removal by ion exchange 1 impact of polymer composition specifically polystyrene versus polyacrylic 2 impact of mobile counterion specifically chloride versus sulfate 3 presence of pfaas on nom removal and 4 presence of nom on pfaas removal batch experiments were conducted to evaluate separate and combined removal of nom and pfaas by aer all tests used natural groundwater spiked with nom and or pfaas the pfaa concentrations used in this research represent the high end of realistic such as encountered in groundwater near pfas contamination source zones backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 likewise the nom concentration was also on the high end of realistic for groundwater obolensky et al 2007 hence the pfaa to nom ratio in this research is expected to be realistic 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a520e and a860 purolite aers were used in this work both resins possess strong base quaternary ammonium functional groups and macroporous structure the resins differ in the nature of the quaternary ammonium groups and polymer composition a520e has triethyl ammonium functional groups total capacity 0 9 eq l and polystyrene composition a860 has trimethyl ammonium functional groups total capacity 0 8 eq l and polyacrylic composition although polymer composition was the focus of resin properties in this research the differing functional groups between a520e and a860 does present a confounding factor nevertheless the influence of polymer composition on the removal of ionizable organic compounds is well documented in the literature gustafson and lirio 1968 kanazawa et al 2004 li and sengupta 1998 and previous research showed similar pfaa removal by a520e resin and a strong base polystyrene resin with trimethyl ammonium functional groups zaggia et al 2016 the resins were received from the supplier in the chloride form i e chloride present as mobile counterion a portion of the resins were converted to the sulfate form by mixing resins in a highly concentrated solution of sodium sulfate i e sulfate ion was present at 32 excess relative to aer on equivalent basis the conversion of chloride form resin to sulfate form resin was assumed based on the knowledge from previous research hu et al 2016 rokicki and boyer 2011 mixing occurred in a jar test apparatus at 200 rpm for 24 h resins were separated from solution by filtration rinsed with deionized di water and placed in a desiccator to dry resin density was calculated by measuring five 1 ml wet resin samples in a graduated cylinder and then dried at room temperature in a desiccator for both types of resin in both the chloride and sulfate forms resins were measured and added to test waters as dry mass resin densities are reported in table s1 in electronic supplementary information esi resin doses are reported as volume of wet settled resin per volume of test water i e ml l to allow for comparison with other published studies alternatively resin dose can be expressed on equivalent concentration basis e g meq l when there is significant difference in ion exchange capacities between resins all test waters were composed of natural groundwater spiked with nom and or pfaa mixture the groundwater was collected from a single groundwater well in tempe arizona the groundwater composition is reported in table s2 in esi real groundwater was used as the test water for all experiments because of the prevalence of pfas contamination in groundwater there was no detectable pfas in the groundwater the doc concentration was 2 mg l and the concentration of inorganic ions was high as indicated by sodium chloride etc see table s2 in esi the pfaa mixture used in this research included perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos cas 1763 23 1 potassium perfluorohexanesulfonate k pfhxs cas 3871 99 6 potassium perfluorobutanesulfonate k pfbs cas 29 420 49 3 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa cas 335 67 1 perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa cas 307 24 4 perfluorobutanoic acid pfba cas 375 22 4 purchased from sigma aldrich at acs grade individual concentrated pfaa solutions were prepared in 10 by volume methanol in di water to ensure complete dissolution of pfaas the individual pfaa stock solutions were combined and diluted in groundwater for each batch experiment the residual methanol in the test water was 0 1 by volume measured concentrations are listed in table 1 the pfaa concentrations in this research are in line with pfaa concentrations in groundwater near pfas contamination souse zones backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 suwannee river natural organic matter srnom isolate 2r101n international humic substances society was used as the source of doc in this work srnom isolate was added to the groundwater at a dose of approximately 20 mg l as nom with doc concentrations given in table 1 because each batch of test water was made prepared separately there is some variation in initial doc concentration the doc concentration is representative of a high doc groundwater comstock and boyer 2014 obolensky et al 2007 the test water was not filtered but aer treated samples were filtered or centrifuged prior to analysis 2 2 experimental methods table 1 shows the experimental design including the measured concentrations of doc and pfaas in the untreated test waters batch tests were conducted with various doses of aer in 125 ml amber glass bottles containing 100 ml of test water all samples were tested in triplicate sample bottles were placed on shaker tables thermo scientific maxq 2000 and 3000 benchtop orbital shakers at 200 rpm for 24 h at room temperature approx 22 c the mixing speed was selected to ensure that the aer was well mixed throughout the bottle the mixing speed and equilibrium time were selected based on investigations in previous literature control samples of test water with no aer were included with each test condition afterwards all samples without pfaas were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and those containing pfaas were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min filtration through 0 45 μm filter is the standard definition for doc and standard approach for measurement of uv absorbance however previous research has shown that pfas such as pfoa can adsorb to filters lath et al 2019 therefore it was decided to filter samples that did not contain pfaas and centrifuge samples that did contain pfaas to support this approach uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and doc were measured in both filtered and centrifuged test water i e groundwater plus srnom the relative difference between filtered and centrifuged samples was 2 4 for uva254 and 4 5 for doc 2 3 analytical methods doc was measured on a shimadzu toc vch total organic carbon analyzer following non purgeable organic carbon method doc standards ricca chemical company were analyzed every 15 samples with relative difference less than 15 uva254 was measured using a hach dr6000 uv visible spectrophotometer using a 1 cm quartz cuvette pfaas were analyzed on an agilent hplc 1200 using gradient elution and a phenomenex gemini c18 column 110 å 100 3 mm 5 μm equipped with a c18 guard column and agilent diol guard column 12 5 4 6 mm 6 μm coupled to a sciex 3200 triple quadruple spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring and negative electrospray ionization mode the injection volume was 10 μl to eliminate background pfas contamination optima grade lc ms water and methanol fisher were used for mobile phase and a delay column luna c18 100 å 30 3 mm 5 μm was placed between the pump and autosampler the flow rate was 0 8 ml min and the gradient mobile phase consisted of 20 mm of ammonium acetate in water a and in methanol b starting at 5 b increased to 60 b in 0 75 min increased to 100 b for 4 min and maintained for 3 min decreased to 5 b in 1 min and maintained at 5 b for 2 min all pfas standard compounds were purchased from wellington laboratory inc ontario canada acceptance criterion of analytical replicates prepared in triplicate was relative standard deviation 30 this acceptance criterion encompasses sample preparation precision in the lab plus instrument analysis precision table s3 lists analysis parameters and the limit of quantitation loq for the pfaas analyzed in this research along with the isotope analytical standards 2 4 data analysis results for doc are presented as the mean concentration of triplicate samples with error bars showing one standard deviation results for pfaas are single measurements and for calculations and plotting the loq was used for individual pfaa concentrations less than the loq the precision for pfaa analysis is within 30 of true value two factor anova with replication was conducted for doc removal by aer to investigate the significance of resin polymer composition and mobile counterion form of the resin the null hypotheses were that doc removal was the same for i a520e vs a860 resin ii chloride vs sulfate counterion and iii interaction between polymer composition and mobile counterion at significance level α 0 05 doc removal was expressed as normalized concentration i e c c0 to account for variability in initial concentration post hoc analysis was conducted using paired t tests following bonferroni correction the results are presented in esi tables s4 and s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of doc by anion exchange fig 1 shows the reductions in doc by anion exchange highlighting differences in resin polymer composition and mobile counterion form of the resin fig s1 in esi shows the corresponding results for uva254 as well as uva254 and doc results normalized by initial concentration the doc and uva254 measurements represent the combination of nom from both the natural groundwater and the suwannee river nom isolate polystyrene a520e and polyacrylic a860 resins are compared within each subplot the impact of changing the mobile counterion form of the resin i e chloride vs sulfate is compared between the subplots table s4 presents the anova results corresponding to fig 1 the major results encompassing fig 1 fig s1 and table s4 are as follows uva254 was reduced to a greater extent than doc for all aer conditions except sulfate form a520e resin at 0 25 and 0 5 ml l because uva254 is correlated with aromatic rich and higher molecular weight sub fraction of doc weishaar et al 2003 it explains why previous studies and this study show that uva254 is reduced to a greater extent than overall doc by aer humbert et al 2005 polyacrylic a860 resin in both the chloride and sulfate forms showed greater reductions in doc and uva254 than polystyrene a520e resin in both mobile counterion forms the greater reductions in doc by a860 resin than a520e resin were statistically significant with p value 2 2 10 7 table s4 which suggests that resin polymer composition affects doc removal and polyacrylic resin is preferred over polystyrene resin for doc removal previous comparisons of resin polymer composition have reported greater doc removal by polyacrylic resin than polystyrene resin which was attributed to the hydrophilic nature of polyacrylic resins and higher water content of the resin that facilitates intraparticle pore diffusion of the doc and more favorable conformation of doc within the resin bolto et al 2002 boyer and singer 2008 cornelissen et al 2008 shuang et al 2015 a860 and a520e resins in both the chloride and sulfate forms showed similar reductions in doc and uva254 at the highest resin dose of 4 ml l furthermore for both resins in both mobile counterion forms the doc concentration in the 4 ml l sample was approximately equal to the doc concentration in the natural groundwater before suwannee river nom was added meaning the srnom was highly favorable for removal by aer anion exchange experiments using natural groundwater without srnom showed low doc removal approx 20 regardless of resin dose or resin conditions see fig s2 in esi hence the doc present in the natural groundwater was not amenable to removal by aer previous studies have documented that portions of doc can be non removable by aer graf et al 2014 however only 20 removal of doc by aer is very low and likely attributable to competition by inorganic anions such as sulfate see table s2 due to low removal of groundwater doc by aer no further results or discussion are presented for the groundwater only the most important result in fig 1 is the greater reduction in doc by aer when the resin was in the sulfate form compared with the chloride form the difference in doc removal by chloride form and sulfate form resins was statistically significant regardless of resin polymer composition p value 1 0 10 5 table s4 which indicates that the mobile counterion form of the resin influences doc removal and specifically sulfate can increase doc removal previous research on altering the mobile counterion form of aer has overlooked the potential benefits of sulfate form resin for example most research has focused on bicarbonate form resin as an alternative to chloride form resin hu et al 2016 ness and boyer 2017 rokicki and boyer 2011 with the main benefit being easier disposal of waste regeneration solution for bicarbonate than chloride it is important to emphasize that this benefit pertains to doc removal by aer in the absence of pfas the other benefit of bicarbonate form resin relative to chloride form resin is less corrosive water following aer treatment due to lower chloride concentration in the treated water edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 nguyen et al 2010 in the few studies that have evaluated sulfate form aer the results did not suggest the benefits of sulfate form resin observed in this study for example rokicki and boyer 2011 compared aer in the chloride bicarbonate nitrate and sulfate forms and did not show increased contaminant removal by sulfate form resin possible reasons for the increased doc removal by sulfate form resin than chloride form resin are discussed after considering additional results fig 2 shows the reductions in doc by anion exchange in an identical format as fig 1 with the key difference being the addition of pfaas to the natural groundwater spiked with srnom fig s3 in esi shows the corresponding results for uva254 as well as uva254 and doc results normalized by initial concentration table s5 presents the anova results corresponding to fig 2 most of the trends described in fig 1 hold for fig 2 for example doc reduction was statistically greater for a860 resin than a520e resin p value 0 022 table s5 again suggesting that resin polymer composition affects doc removal with greater doc removal for polyacrylic resin than polystyrene resin the most important result from fig 1 of the greater reduction in doc by anion exchange when the resin was in the sulfate form compared with the chloride form was also statistically significant in fig 2 regardless of resin polymer composition p value 7 1 10 5 table s5 this further supports that changing the mobile counterion of the resin from chloride to sulfate can increase doc removal for the experiments shown in figs 1 and 2 the test waters only varied due to the absence or presence of pfaas both test waters were based on tempe groundwater matrix with addition of srnom looking collectively at the results in figs 1 and 2 and tables s4 and s5 it appears that changing the mobile counterion form of a resin from chloride to sulfate had a greater impact on a520e resin than a860 resin considering the mean difference in doc removal between resin conditions the difference between a520e and a860 resins decreases in going from chloride form resins to sulfate form resins and the difference between chloride and sulfate forms of a520e resin is greater than the corresponding difference for a860 resin see summary of interaction results in table s4 although a520e and a860 resins differ in polymer composition they also differ in the identity of the quaternary ammonium functional group being triethyl ammonium vs trimethyl ammonium respectively a520e resin is designed to be selective for nitrate over sulfate by increasing the size and spacing of the quaternary ammonium functional groups to favor monovalent anions over divalent anions hu et al 2016 subramonian and clifford 1988 therefore it is possible that converting a520e resin from the chloride form to the sulfate form results in unfavorable conditions for the mobile counterion in the resin in turn this results in a greater driving force for exchanging the counterion in the resin with the counterion in solution in this case doc the different functional groups could also impact uptake kinetics but it was not studied here comparing doc removal by aer between figs 1 and 2 the noteworthy change is the presence of six pfaas in the test water in fig 2 because a different separation method was applied prior to doc analysis see section 2 2 a statistical comparison was not conducted on the results in figs 1 and 2 that said the results in figs 1 and 2 follow the same trends which suggests that the presence of pfaas did not impact doc removal by anion exchange for the resin conditions mentioned for example in both figs 1 and 2 a860 resin removed more doc than a520e resin regardless of mobile counterion and sulfate form resin removed more doc than chloride form resin regardless of polymer composition see tables s4 and s5 there is limited previous research on the impact of pfaas on doc removal by aer kothawala et al 2017 studied a single polystyrene aer and showed minimal impact of doc on pfaa removal by aer dixit et al 2019 studied a single polyacrylic aer and evaluated the impact of different types of nom on removal of pfos and pfoa by anion exchange neither study evaluated the impact of pfaas i e absence vs presence on doc removal by aer in general trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides are present at orders of magnitude lower concentrations than doc and are not expected to interfere with doc removal dixit et al 2018 humbert et al 2008 the main competitor of doc removal by aer is typically inorganic anions such as sulfate hu et al 2016 in the context of this research with average pfaa to doc mass ratio of 0 056 and average pfaa to doc equivalent ratio of 0 086 see table s2 the results suggest that the presence of pfaas did not interfere with doc removal by aer 3 2 removal of pfaas by anion exchange fig 3 shows the reductions in pfaas by polystyrene a520e resin and evaluates the impact of doc absence vs presence of srnom and mobile counterion form of the resin chloride vs sulfate because the pfaas were present at different initial concentrations see table 1 the results in fig 3 show normalized concentrations to facilitate comparisons the general trend for pfaa removal by aer was sulfonates removed to a greater extent than carboxylates and c6 and c8 pfaas removed to greater extent than c4 pfaas previous studies show similar trends with removal of pfaas by aer increasing with increasing carbon chain length and greater removal of sulfonate functional groups than carboxylate functional groups franke et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 the clearest consensus among previous studies is the greatest removal of pfos and lowest removal of pfba by aer this is hypothesized to be due to the combination of electrostatic and van der waals forces of attraction contributing to pfos removal versus electrostatic attraction only for pfba removal to elaborate li and sengupta 1998 showed that it is favorable to transfer hydrophobic organic ionizable compound from water to non polar phase such as aer regardless of polymer composition however there are additional favorable interactions i e van der waals between the hydrophobic organic ionizable compound and polystyrene resin matrix that are not present with the polyacrylic resin matrix li and sengupta 1998 the results of rahmani and mohseni 2017 support the first assertion whereby adsorption to polyacrylic resin increases for more hydrophobic organic compounds the results of landry and boyer 2013 support the second assertion whereby the anionic pharmaceutical diclofenac exhibited greater adsorption to polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin regarding pfaa removal by aer pfaas become more hydrophobic less favorable interactions with water as carbon chain length increases which translates to greater aer adsorption of c8 pfaa than c4 pfaa regardless of polymer composition in addition adsorption is expected be greater to polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin because of stronger van der waals forces of attraction that increase with increasing carbon chain length i e increasing polarizability a statistical analysis was not conducted on the results in fig 3 because only one sample out of the triplicate samples for each resin dose was analyzed for pfaas comparing the results in fig 3 on average subplot b shows lower c c0 bars than subplot a and subplot d shows lower c c0 bars than subplot c this trend is most noticeable at aer doses on 0 25 and 0 5 ml l and for pfba at all resin doses this was a similar result as doc removal which supports the conjecture of enhanced contaminant removal using a divalent counterion with a monovalent ion selective resin e g a520e to confirm this conjecture additional comparisons of divalent vs monovalent counterions would be needed the results in fig 3 did not show an obvious impact of the presence of srnom on pfaa removal by aer meaning that the presence of srnom did not interfere with pfaa removal although limited data are available previous studies also show minimal impact of nom on pfaa removal by aer dixit et al 2019 kothawala et al 2017 this indicates that aer a520e in this case is highly selective for pfaas because the average doc to pfaa equivalent ratio was 11 6 meaning there was 10 more nom than pfaas competing for ion exchange sites fig 4 shows the reductions in pfaas by polyacrylic a860 resin and evaluates the impact of doc absence vs presence of srnom and mobile counterion form of the resin chloride vs sulfate in the identical format as fig 3 the main result in fig 4 is the higher normalized pfaa concentrations by polyacrylic a860 resin than polystyrene a520e resin for all resin and solution conditions meaning that polyacrylic a860 resin was less effective for pfaa removal only pfos was consistently removed greater than 50 by polyacrylic a860 resin pfba showed the least removal due to the low removals of pfaas by polyacrylic a860 resin there was not a major impact of changing the mobile counterion form of the resin or evaluating the absence or presence of srnom the lower removal of pfaas by polyacrylic a860 resin than polystyrene a520e resin is hypothesized to be due to weaker van der waals forces of attraction between pfaas and polyacrylic resin than pfaas and polystyrene resin as described above for example the same trend has been observed for removal of pharmaceuticals by aer with higher removal by polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin landry and boyer 2013 and more selective removal of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals than hydrophilic pharmaceuticals by polystyrene resin landry et al 2015 a860 polyacrylic resin was shown by dixit et al 2019 to effectively remove pfos and pfoa in the presence of srnom however their results did not include a comparison with polystyrene resin or consider short chain pfaas such as pfba and pfbs the impact of nom in figs 3 and 4 is limited to srnom where it is known that nom hydrophobicity and molecular weight can influence the ion exchange process finkbeiner et al 2020 the results in figs 3 and 4 illustrate the importance of evaluating pfaa removal by aer considering short and long chain carboxylates and sulfonates to obtain a more complete understanding of removal performance for example both polystyrene a520e and polyacrylic a860 resins showed high removal of pfos however only a520e resin achieved 50 removal of shorter chain pfaas 3 3 implications for aer treatment the results of this research have several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results regarding the aer experiments there was some variability in initial doc and pfaas concentrations that make exact comparison difficult however all test waters were based on the same groundwater matrix although comparison of resin polymer composition was an important aspect of this research it could be not conclusively separated from the different functional group chemistry and ion exchange capacity however previous research comparing polystyrene resins with different functional groups wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2009 zaggia et al 2016 shows smaller differences in resin selectivity than comparing polystyrene and polyacrylic resins kanazawa et al 2004 landry and boyer 2013 li and sengupta 1998 the results of this research show that changing the mobile counterion form of the resin from chloride to sulfate can increase contaminant removal especially for a520e resin which is designed to be selective for monovalent anions over divalent anions the benefits of sulfate form aer go beyond contaminant removal to include less corrosive treated water i e higher sulfate concentration in treated water decreases the chloride to sulfate mass ratio more disposal options for sulfate based waste regeneration solution when hazardous contaminants are not present and expanded options for treatment of hazardous contaminants in waste regeneration solution e g sulfate based regeneration solution is expected to eliminate the potential for perchlorate formation during electrochemical treatment studies on the destruction of pfaas in sulfate based regeneration solutions the use strongly oxidizing sulfate radical or persulfate are the next logical step in this research 4 conclusions the polymer composition of aer has a significant impact on contaminant removal and can be used to target specific contaminants although it was minimal in this study the influence functional group chemistry needs to be considered along with polymer composition on adsorption capacity that said ionizable organic contaminants such as pfaas show higher removal with polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin due to the hypothesized favorable combination of electrostatic and van der waals forces of attraction higher molecular weight contaminants such as srnom show higher removal with polyacrylic resin than polystyrene resin due the higher water content of polyacrylic resin and ability for intraparticle pore diffusion when contaminants and resins have unique and favorable interactions such as srnom with polyacrylic resin and pfaas with polystyrene resin interference by co contaminants is minimized specific to this research the presence of pfaas had a minimal impact on srnom removal by anion exchange using polyacrylic resin and likewise the presence of srnom had a minimal impact on pfaas removal by anion exchange using polystyrene resin this conclusion is limited to srnom and the six pfaas evaluated in this work so additional research is needed to extend its applicability changing the mobile counterion form of the resin from chloride to an alternative anion can have multiple benefits for sulfate form resin the benefits include higher contaminant removal especially for resin with triethyl ammonium functional groups less corrosive treated water and expanded options for brine disposal and treatment of contaminants in the waste regeneration solution the higher contaminant removal for sulfate form resin is believed to be more pronounced for resins with functional groups that are selective for monovalent anions over divalent ions e g triethyl ammonium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17929,in this study the adsorption capacities of two common odor compounds 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and dimethyl disulfide dmds onto nine common types of powdered activated carbon pac were comprehensively compared to screen the critical surface chemical properties affecting the adsorption performance the results showed that the adsorption capacities of all the pacs for dmds were generally lower than those for 2 mib the spearman s rank correlation analysis indicated that the adsorption capacity for 2 mib did not have any correlation with the pac surface sites while the dmds adsorption capacity was positively related to the number of basic sites the effect of the pac basic sites on the dmds adsorption was further verified by density functional theory dft calculation in two adsorption modes facial mode and edge mode the graphene structure in the edge mode was the most favorable for dmds adsorption with the lowest adsorption enthalpy followed by the ketone doped structure under the facial mode an independent gradient model indicated that van der waals forces were dominant in the dmds adsorption moreover thermal modification was conducted to further prove the relationship between the basic sites and the dmds adsorption after thermal modification the pac with more basic sites and graphene structures was found to be more effective for dmds adsorption overall

aiming at more efficient odor removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords pac properties adsorption odor compounds 2 methylisobornel dimethyl disulfide 1 introduction taste and odor t o problem is one of the most serious challenges associated with drinking water treatment dietrich and burlingame 2015 among various odor compounds geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib are the most common and they emit a musty earthy odor previous studies have demonstrated that the musty earthy odor in china most likely originates from 2 mib rather than geosmin as geosmin is detected less frequently and in relatively low concentrations 0 69 ng l 1 and 0 85 ng l 1 in source and finished water samples on average respectively in china moreover it is easy to remove geosmin by pre or post carbon adsorption kim et al 2014 lin et al 2002 matsui et al 2015 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zamyadi et al 2015 in addition thioethers represent another class of common odor compounds in drinking water they have a strong swampy septic odor and are highly toxic however they have received little attention yang et al 2008z talaiekhozani et al 2016 yang et al found that dimethyl trisulfide dmts and related alkyl sulfide compounds not 2 mib and geosmin were the main odor causing compounds in wuxi s water supply in 2007 yang et al 2008 in a recently published work it was reported that high concentrations of thioethers primarily dimethyl disulfide dmds and dmts were detected in the eastern and southern parts of china wang et al 2019 in addition to china dmds has also been detected in river dee in north west england possibly as a result of industrial discharge campbell et al 1994 several treatment methods including adsorption oxidation and biodegradation have been applied to address t o problems summers et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 antonopoulou et al 2014 doederer et al 2019 among them adsorption using activated carbon ac is one of the most widely used strategies for odor treatment because of the high efficiency convenient operation and low cost bunmahotama et al 2017 tennant and mazyck 2007 pendleton et al 1997 many previous studies have shown that the internal particle pore structure and particle size are the main factors affecting 2 mib adsorption tennant and mazyck 2007 yu et al 2007 matsui et al 2013 and many researchers have suggested that the micropores 20 å on carbon are critical for 2 mib adsorption newcombe et al 2002 the mesopores could supply a tunnel for 2 mib and thus influence its adsorption process regarding the chemical properties associated with 2 mib adsorption previous studies have suggested that the removal of low polarity 2 mib is a physical process that occurs through non specific sorption although previous studies have suggested that carbon with many oxygen groups demonstrates a relatively low 2 mib adsorption this is primarily because an oxygen rich carbon has more affinity to the water and this reduction is not evident in water containing natural organic matter tennant and mazyck 2007 considine et al 2001 concerning thioethers such as dmds and dmts only a very limited number of studies have focused on their adsorption behaviors as a small molecule micropollutant dmds is also assumed to be adsorbed onto the micropores of ac in our previous study only three thioethers dmds dmts and diethyl disulfide were found to be unsuitable for treatment by powdered activated carbon pac adsorption among 14 common odor compounds huang et al 2019 however this study only used coal based pac to evaluate the absorbability it is not clear whether or not other types of pac are efficient for the adsorption of thioethers or which properties are critical in the adsorption process previous study have suggested that the hydrophobic properties of the adsorbate would favor its adsorption matsui et al 2015 compared to 2 mib dmds is less hydrophobic according to the calculated octanol water partition coefficient log kow values of 2 mib and dmds as shown in table 1 and the adsorption of dmds is supposedly very difficult ferrari et al 2018 however if hydrophobicity is the only factor affecting the adsorption the pac which has a relatively low oxygen content would have a high adsorption capacity for thioethers on the contrary previous studies have demonstrated that modified ac contains additional oxygen functional groups that provide more adsorption sites and consequently increase the sulfur adsorption capacity of ac cui et al 2009 lee et al 2010 cui et al 2009 found that the ac oxidized by hno3 h2o2 or impregnated with alkali exhibited a higher dmds adsorption capacity than pristine ac lee et al 2010 modified coconut based ac with acids and bases and found that the dmds adsorption capacities were increased by acid treatment and decreased by base treatment further vega et al 2015 increased the oxygen content of ac by gamma irradiation however this modification could not improve the dmds adsorption although it increased ethyl mercaptan adsorption overall the effects of the ac chemical surface functional groups on the adsorption behavior regarding dmds odor problems are somewhat conflicting and have caused confusion in the selection and modification of carbon for its treatment therefore the main objective of this study is to comprehensively investigate the effects of the chemical surface properties of activated carbon on the adsorption behaviors with respect to dmds and 2 mib adsorption experiments using nine common pacs including three coal based pacs three wood based pacs and three coconut based pacs were conducted to determine the principal functional groups affecting the adsorptions of dmds and 2 mib onto pac density functional theory dft calculations and an independent gradient model igm were used to further examine the adsorption behavior of dmds finally thermal modification was applied to further improve the adsorption capacity of dmds onto pac based on the above analysis the results of this work may inform the selection and modification of ac for addressing various odor problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the odor compounds 2 mib and dmds were purchased from o2si america nacl was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and was calcined at 450 c for 2 h before it was used for the measurement of the odor compounds stock solutions of the two odor compounds were prepared in methanol hplc grade j t baker and center valley pa usa all other solutions were prepared using deionized di water nine commonly used pacs were obtained from ningxia guanghua co ltd china these selected 9 pacs were produced from the three most commonly used raw materials coal wood and coconut shell with three different iodine values as shown in table 2 and similar sizes 200 325 mesh the iodine values were provided by the manufacturer and were determined according to chinese national standards gb t 7702 7 2008 for coal based pacs and gb t 12496 8 2015 for wood based and coconut based pacs which are widely used methods li et al 2014 liang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the pac stock solutions were prepared by dispersing 1 g of pac in 1 l of di water 2 2 adsorption experiments prior to the adsorption experiments the pac was washed with di water to clean the carbon surface the adsorption experiments were conducted with a predetermined pac dosage in 40 ml glass bottles and the adsorption time was set to 24 h water collected from jinze reservoir shanghai china was used to prepare the water samples and the main characteristics of the raw water are shown in table s1 the initial concentration for experiment was 250 ng l 1 for both 2 mib and dmds for these compounds this concentration is high relative to the concentrations detected in lakes at the end of the adsorption experiment the suspension was withdrawn using an injection syringe and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane prior to the odor compound measurement the odor compound concentration was determined immediately using headspace solid phase microextraction spme combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan the limit of quantitation loq values for 2 mib and dmds were 3 ng l 1 and 6 ng l 1 respectively koziel et al 2017 yu et al 2007 each adsorption experiment was conducted three times in this study the adsorption ratio q ng mg 1 at a set dosage was calculated using the following equation 1 q c i n i t i a l c f i n a l d p a c here c inital is the initial concentration of the odor compound ng l 1 c final is the final concentration of the odor compound after 24 h of adsorption ng l 1 and d pac is the pac dosage mg l 1 2 3 characterization of pac the surface area and pore size distribution of the pac samples were characterized using an autsorb quantachrome usa computer controlled surface analyzer fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the pac samples were obtained using a nexus 670 ftir spectrophotometer nicolet usa the carbon samples were mixed with kbr 1 300 to form kbr pellets the ftir spectra of the samples were recorded from 4000 to 500 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 with 200 scans for each sample the numbers of basic and acidic sites on the carbon internal surfaces were determined by boehm titration boehm 1994 the acidic sites were also divided into three categories carboxylic lactonic and phenolic according to boehm titration the pac was reacted with three different bases to determine the total acidity i nahco3 which neutralizes the carboxylic acid groups ii na2co3 which neutralizes the lactonic and carboxylic acid groups and iii naoh which neutralizes the phenolic lactonic and carboxylic groups the number of basic sites was estimated by neutralization with hcl solution the procedure consisted of adding 0 1 g of the pac in 25 ml of each different neutralization solution 0 1 m nahco3 0 1 m na2co3 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl afterward the samples were bubbled in n2 sealed and kept under shaking for 5 days to guarantee equilibrium later the solutions were filtered and titrated with a 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution 2 4 data analysis since most of the data about the carbon surface properties do not follow the gaussian distribution the spearman s rank correlation which is a non parametric analysis rather than the pearson s correlation was used in this study the spearman s rank correlation can describe the relationship between two variables without making any assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables it assesses monotonic relationships whether linear or not and the coefficient r is calculated as follows 2 r 1 6 i 1 n u i v i 2 n n 2 1 where ui and vi are the orders of the two samples the r value is generally between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a totally positive linear correlation 0 indicates no linear correlation and 1 denotes a totally negative linear correlation 2 5 dft calculation and igm dft calculations were carried out using gaussian program1 at m06 2x def2 tzvp m06 2x def2 svp level2 4 igm wave function analysis was performed using multiwfn program5 lefebvre et al 2018 zhao et al 2006 2 6 thermal modification of the pac to further investigate the effect of the surface chemical properties on the adsorption of dmds onto the pac carbon samples were heated in a tube furnace to 500 or 1000 c under n2 to modify their surface characteristics without significantly changing their textural structures pereira et al 2010 the temperature increased from ambient temperature to 500 or 1000 c at a rate of 50 c min in a n2 atmosphere and was then maintained at 500 1000 c for 2 h finally it was allowed to decrease to room temperature the dmds adsorption performances of these modified pacs were tested using a procedure similar to that described in section 2 2 the only difference was that the test water was synthesized using dmds with an initial concentration of 350 ng l 1 in di water each adsorption experiment was repeated three times 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption capacities of dmds and 2 mib onto the nine pacs the adsorption ratios of dmds and 2 mib onto various pacs are illustrated in fig 1 and the effects of the pac dosage on the removal of dmds and 2 mib are shown in fig s1 the adsorption capacities for dmds were generally smaller than those for 2 mib although pac7 exhibited the best adsorption performance for both dmds and 2 mib the adsorption capacity sequences for dmds and 2 mib were completely different for dmds pac7 achieved the highest adsorption ratio while pac4 exhibited the lowest adsorption ratio for 2 mib pac7 exhibited the best adsorption performance while pac6 showed the lowest adsorption capacity previous studies have shown that the micropores and particle size of pac will significantly affect its adsorption capacity for low molecular weight substances including odor compounds matsui et al 2015 yu et al 2007 therefore before analysis of the effect of surface chemical properties the pore structure and particle size of the nine pacs were characterized the micropore volume vm and median particle size d 0 5 are shown in fig 1 and other results of the pore structure and particle size are listed in tables s2 and s4 respectively their correlations were also determined by spearman s rank correlation analysis and the results are displayed in fig 1 table s3 and table s5 the adsorption capacities for both compounds had significant positive correlations with their vm values as shown in fig 1 and table s3 the d 0 5 values showed significant negative correlations with the adsorption capacities as shown in fig 1 and table s5 which suggested that the pac with the relatively small particle size may exhibit enhanced adsorption performance the highest adsorption by pac7 for both dmds and 2 mib may be due to its abundant micropores and small particle size nonetheless the dmds and 2 mib adsorption capacities showed different variation trends and the 2 mib adsorption capacity correlated better with the vm and d 0 5 than the dmds adsorption capacity as shown in fig 1 and table s2 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the dmds adsorption capacity and vm d 0 5 was 0 67 0 72 which is smaller than that of the 2 mib adsorption capacity and vm d 0 5 0 73 0 80 thus it could be concluded that although the physical character including the micropore volume and particle size of the pac is a crucial factor for both dmds and 2 mib adsorption there are other important factors such as the surface chemical properties that affect their adsorption which may be stronger for dmds than for 2 mib as the correlation between dmds and the micropore volume particle size was significantly weaker than that for 2 mib 3 2 effects of the pac chemical properties on the adsorption capacity 3 2 1 infrared spectrum characterization ftir was applied to analyze the surface functional groups for the 9 pacs and the spectra are shown in fig 2 the assignments of the bonds at different wavenumbers are given in table 3 very similar ftir spectra were obtained for various pacs except for pac7 and pac8 whose spectra did not indicate the stretching of the cc bonds however the two pacs pac7 and pac8 without the cc bonds exhibited the best and the second best adsorption performances for dmds respectively for 2 mib pac7 also achieved the highest adsorption capacity whereas pac8 had a median adsorption capacity as discussed above the physical character of pac also affects the dmds and 2 mib adsorptions the highest vm and the smallest size d 0 1 d 0 5 and d 0 9 of pac7 may promote excellent adsorption for both dmds and 2 mib pac8 has abundant micropores and a medium d 0 5 value while its d 0 9 value is rather large indicating that its particle size is not uniform which could explain its mediocre 2 mib adsorption performance however pac8 exhibited superior dmds adsorption performance compared to other pacs it is assumed that a pac with relatively few cc bonds might exhibit enhanced dmds adsorption however pac9 even with the presence of the cc bond also exhibited good dmds as well as 2 mib adsorption performance additionally pac2 pac3 and pac4 achieved high 2 mib adsorptions but low dmds adsorptions pac9 had more abundant micropores and a relatively small size evidently these beneficial physical properties may counter the inhibiting effect of cc on pac9 from the ftir spectra it can be inferred that the absence of the cc functional groups might result in improved dmds adsorption although further demonstration is required 3 2 2 functional groups measured by boehm titration considering that the surface groups of the pacs cannot be quantitatively characterized by ftir the boehm titration method was applied for the quantification of the basic and acidic sites as shown in table 4 regarding the number of acidic sites the wood based pac4 had the highest while other wood and coconut based pacs had similar numbers evidently the coconut based pacs had the highest number of basic sites the coconut based pacs exhibited better dmds adsorption performance than the wood and coal based pacs which may be attributed to the abundant basic sites to further analyze the relationship between the pac adsorption ability and the basic acidic properties spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied the results are shown in table 5 only the dmds adsorption capacity displayed a significant positive correlation with the basic sites other groups including the acidic group did not show any significant correlation with the adsorption capacities for dmds and 2 mib the correlation results indicated that the adsorption capacity for 2 mib was independent of any functional group on the surface of pac which is in agreement with previous studies that suggested the 2 mib adsorption is independent of the oxygen content of the ac yu et al 2007 matsui et al 2015 for dmds the adsorption capacity increased with the number of basic sites while other groups did not display any correlation with the dmds adsorption capacity this result can explain the opposing trends for dmds and 2 mib adsorptions onto wood based pacs although the micropore volume of wood based pacs pac4 6 decreased from pac4 to pac6 the dmds adsorption capacity increased owing to the increase in the number of basic sites however the adsorption capacity of 2 mib increased from pac4 to pac6 simply due to the micropore volume jana and sarkar found similar results in that alkali functionalized acs had a high adsorption ability for selected malodorous compounds containing sulfides such as methyl mercaptan ethyl mercaptan dimethyl sulfide and carbon disulfide jana and sarkar 2018 however vega et al 2013 found that the dmds adsorption capacity was not affected by the oxygen functional groups in ac because they did not analyze the oxygen functional groups individually moreover the total number of oxygen functional groups of ac were not relevant to the adsorption capacity this fact could be the reason for the contradictory results obtained in previous studies 3 3 dmds adsorption mechanism analysis to further investigate the effects of the cc bonds and pac basic sites on the adsorption behavior of dmds onto pac a series of dft calculations was conducted to compute the adsorption enthalpy to simplify the simulation calculations a simple graphene structure composed of seventeen aromatic rings was adopted as the pac model according to a previous study the basic properties of pac are mostly derived from the graphene structure and three typical basic functional groups ketone pyrone and chromene as shown in fig s2 montes morán et al 2004 in addition two active adsorption sites were considered one on the edge of the structure denoted as the graphene functional group edge and the other on the facial part of the structure denoted as graphene functional group facial the adsorption process would occur in the low energy mode therefore five structures as shown in fig s2 and ten adsorption models were constructed and the results are shown in table 6 all the adsorption enthalpies for the various structures are negative this result indicates that the adsorption process for dmds is exothermic weigend and ahlrichs 2005 notably compared to the undoped graphene the cc structure in the doped graphene layer would significantly increase the adsorption enthalpy thus making dmds adsorption more difficult this could further prove the above inference that the cc structure in the carbon layer was unfavorable for the dmds adsorption comparing different structures the undoped graphene and chromene doped graphene structures favor the dmds adsorption in the edge mode while for other structures ketone and pyrone doped graphene the adsorption enthalpy in the facial mode was more negative weigend and ahlrichs 2005 in addition the edge site of the undoped graphene structure had the lowest adsorption enthalpy followed by the facial mode for the ketone doped graphene structure and the edge mode for the chromene doped graphene structure while the facial mode of the undoped graphene structure was the fourth overall the undoped graphene structure was generally outstanding regarding dmds adsorption which suggests that the adsorption of dmds primarily relies on the weak chemical binding π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions weigend and ahlrichs 2005 combined with the ftir results it can be inferred that relatively few cc bonds and more graphene c structures are favorable for dmds adsorption the igm analysis was applied to investigate the non covalent interactions between the different structures and dmds and the results are shown in fig 3 in this model the nature of the interaction can be distinguished directly by color codes related to the electron density derivatives red for strongly repulsive green for van der waals forces and blue for strongly attractive interactions lefebvre et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 3 van der waals forces played a major role in the adsorption of dmds in various configurations additionally the igm method can provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of an atom or several atoms on the total interaction between two or more molecules from the igm figures it can be observed that in the facial mode the two s atoms contributed to the adsorption behavior while in the edge mode the two ch3 groups contributed more to the adsorption behavior the oxygen containing basic sites did not play critical roles in the adsorption of dmds the π π interactions by the graphene structure may dominate the dmds adsorption previous studies have shown that an increase in the graphene structure will lead to an increase in the basicity of pac montes morán et al 2004 pereira et al 2010 therefore the graphene structure is more favorable to adsorb dmds than the oxygen containing basic sites 3 4 effect of thermal modification of pac on its adsorption for dmds the thermal modification of pac could reduce the surface acidic sites and contribute to the exposure of basic sites with minimal change to the textural structure of the pac pereira et al 2010 therefore the thermal modification of pac9 was conducted to further verify the correlations between the basic properties of the pac and the dmds adsorption capacity pac9 was selected for the thermal modification due to its large number of basic sites and because it contains cc bonds after the thermal modification the pacs were employed for dmds adsorption as illustrated in fig 4 a and b the adsorption capacity and adsorption rate were improved by thermal modification and pac 1000 was the most effective in terms of dmds adsorption the surface basic and acidic sites were characterized by boehm titration and raman spectroscopy as shown in table 7 and fig 4 c respectively the pore size distribution was also characterized to indicate that the change in the dmds adsorption capacity was not due to the variation in the pore size as shown in fig 4 d the numbers of the basic sites of pac 1000 and pac 500 increased significantly compared to those of the initial pac particularly pac 1000 while the numbers of the acidic sites of pac 1000 and pac 500 were similar and less than that of the initial pac the result agreed with that in section 3 2 2 which demonstrated that the basic property of pac has a positive correlation with the dmds adsorption in addition according to the raman results the intensity ratio of d band and g band of pac initial pac 500 and pac 1000 were 1 20 1 17 and 1 10 respectively indicating that the degree in the disorder decreased after thermal modification barranco et al 2010 it can also be inferred that carbon was graphitized after thermal modification as evidenced by the enhanced adsorption capacity for dmds which agrees with the dft calculations 4 conclusions in this work the adsorption capacities of two distinct odor compounds dmds and 2 mib onto 9 pacs with different characteristics was compared and the effects of the pacs surface chemical properties on the adsorption performance were fully investigated the results indicated that all the nine pacs exhibited weaker adsorption performances for dmds than for 2 mib the spearman s rank correlation analysis results showed that the dmds adsorption capacity correlated significantly with basic sites while no significant correlations were observed between the 2 mib adsorption capacities and the surface sites dft calculations indicated that graphene structure in the edge mode significantly favored dmds adsorption followed by the ketone doped graphene structure in the facial mode the igm model indicated that van der waals forces played certain role in the dmds adsorption the results also suggested that thermal modification could enhance the basicity and graphene content thus increasing the dmds adsorption performance overall it could be concluded that the pac with more basic sites particularly the graphene structure demonstrated a relatively higher adsorption for dmds the results could direct the modification of pacs to improve their efficiency for the removal of some special

relatively low concentrations 0 69 ng l 1 and 0 85 ng l 1 in source and finished water samples on average respectively in china moreover it is easy to remove geosmin by pre or post carbon adsorption kim et al 2014 lin et al 2002 matsui et al 2015 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zamyadi et al 2015 in addition thioethers represent another class of common odor compounds in drinking water they have a strong swampy septic odor and are highly toxic however they have received little attention yang et al 2008z talaiekhozani et al 2016 yang et al found that dimethyl trisulfide dmts and related alkyl sulfide compounds not 2 mib and geosmin were the main odor causing compounds in wuxi s water supply in 2007 yang et al 2008 in a recently published work it was reported that high concentrations of thioethers primarily dimethyl disulfide dmds and dmts were detected in the eastern and southern parts of china wang et al 2019 in addition to china dmds has also been detected in river dee in north west england possibly as a result of industrial discharge campbell et al 1994 several treatment methods including adsorption oxidation and biodegradation have been applied to address t o problems summers et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 antonopoulou et al 2014 doederer et al 2019 among them adsorption using activated carbon ac is one of the most widely used strategies for odor treatment because of the high efficiency convenient operation and low cost bunmahotama et al 2017 tennant and mazyck 2007 pendleton et al 1997 many previous studies have shown that the internal particle pore structure and particle size are the main factors affecting 2 mib adsorption tennant and mazyck 2007 yu et al 2007 matsui et al 2013 and many researchers have suggested that the micropores 20 å on carbon are critical for 2 mib adsorption newcombe et al 2002 the mesopores could supply a tunnel for 2 mib and thus influence its adsorption process regarding the chemical properties associated with 2 mib adsorption previous studies have suggested that the removal of low polarity 2 mib is a physical process that occurs through non specific sorption although previous studies have suggested that carbon with many oxygen groups demonstrates a relatively low 2 mib adsorption this is primarily because an oxygen rich carbon has more affinity to the water and this reduction is not evident in water containing natural organic matter tennant and mazyck 2007 considine et al 2001 concerning thioethers such as dmds and dmts only a very limited number of studies have focused on their adsorption behaviors as a small molecule micropollutant dmds is also assumed to be adsorbed onto the micropores of ac in our previous study only three thioethers dmds dmts and diethyl disulfide were found to be unsuitable for treatment by powdered activated carbon pac adsorption among 14 common odor compounds huang et al 2019 however this study only used coal based pac to evaluate the absorbability it is not clear whether or not other types of pac are efficient for the adsorption of thioethers or which properties are critical in the adsorption process previous study have suggested that the hydrophobic properties of the adsorbate would favor its adsorption matsui et al 2015 compared to 2 mib dmds is less hydrophobic according to the calculated octanol water partition coefficient log kow values of 2 mib and dmds as shown in table 1 and the adsorption of dmds is supposedly very difficult ferrari et al 2018 however if hydrophobicity is the only factor affecting the adsorption the pac which has a relatively low oxygen content would have a high adsorption capacity for thioethers on the contrary previous studies have demonstrated that modified ac contains additional oxygen functional groups that provide more adsorption sites and consequently increase the sulfur adsorption capacity of ac cui et al 2009 lee et al 2010 cui et al 2009 found that the ac oxidized by hno3 h2o2 or impregnated with alkali exhibited a higher dmds adsorption capacity than pristine ac lee et al 2010 modified coconut based ac with acids and bases and found that the dmds adsorption capacities were increased by acid treatment and decreased by base treatment further vega et al 2015 increased the oxygen content of ac by gamma irradiation however this modification could not improve the dmds adsorption although it increased ethyl mercaptan adsorption overall the effects of the ac chemical surface functional groups on the adsorption behavior regarding dmds odor problems are somewhat conflicting and have caused confusion in the selection and modification of carbon for its treatment therefore the main objective of this study is to comprehensively investigate the effects of the chemical surface properties of activated carbon on the adsorption behaviors with respect to dmds and 2 mib adsorption experiments using nine common pacs including three coal based pacs three wood based pacs and three coconut based pacs were conducted to determine the principal functional groups affecting the adsorptions of dmds and 2 mib onto pac density functional theory dft calculations and an independent gradient model igm were used to further examine the adsorption behavior of dmds finally thermal modification was applied to further improve the adsorption capacity of dmds onto pac based on the above analysis the results of this work may inform the selection and modification of ac for addressing various odor problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the odor compounds 2 mib and dmds were purchased from o2si america nacl was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and was calcined at 450 c for 2 h before it was used for the measurement of the odor compounds stock solutions of the two odor compounds were prepared in methanol hplc grade j t baker and center valley pa usa all other solutions were prepared using deionized di water nine commonly used pacs were obtained from ningxia guanghua co ltd china these selected 9 pacs were produced from the three most commonly used raw materials coal wood and coconut shell with three different iodine values as shown in table 2 and similar sizes 200 325 mesh the iodine values were provided by the manufacturer and were determined according to chinese national standards gb t 7702 7 2008 for coal based pacs and gb t 12496 8 2015 for wood based and coconut based pacs which are widely used methods li et al 2014 liang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the pac stock solutions were prepared by dispersing 1 g of pac in 1 l of di water 2 2 adsorption experiments prior to the adsorption experiments the pac was washed with di water to clean the carbon surface the adsorption experiments were conducted with a predetermined pac dosage in 40 ml glass bottles and the adsorption time was set to 24 h water collected from jinze reservoir shanghai china was used to prepare the water samples and the main characteristics of the raw water are shown in table s1 the initial concentration for experiment was 250 ng l 1 for both 2 mib and dmds for these compounds this concentration is high relative to the concentrations detected in lakes at the end of the adsorption experiment the suspension was withdrawn using an injection syringe and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane prior to the odor compound measurement the odor compound concentration was determined immediately using headspace solid phase microextraction spme combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan the limit of quantitation loq values for 2 mib and dmds were 3 ng l 1 and 6 ng l 1 respectively koziel et al 2017 yu et al 2007 each adsorption experiment was conducted three times in this study the adsorption ratio q ng mg 1 at a set dosage was calculated using the following equation 1 q c i n i t i a l c f i n a l d p a c here c inital is the initial concentration of the odor compound ng l 1 c final is the final concentration of the odor compound after 24 h of adsorption ng l 1 and d pac is the pac dosage mg l 1 2 3 characterization of pac the surface area and pore size distribution of the pac samples were characterized using an autsorb quantachrome usa computer controlled surface analyzer fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the pac samples were obtained using a nexus 670 ftir spectrophotometer nicolet usa the carbon samples were mixed with kbr 1 300 to form kbr pellets the ftir spectra of the samples were recorded from 4000 to 500 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 with 200 scans for each sample the numbers of basic and acidic sites on the carbon internal surfaces were determined by boehm titration boehm 1994 the acidic sites were also divided into three categories carboxylic lactonic and phenolic according to boehm titration the pac was reacted with three different bases to determine the total acidity i nahco3 which neutralizes the carboxylic acid groups ii na2co3 which neutralizes the lactonic and carboxylic acid groups and iii naoh which neutralizes the phenolic lactonic and carboxylic groups the number of basic sites was estimated by neutralization with hcl solution the procedure consisted of adding 0 1 g of the pac in 25 ml of each different neutralization solution 0 1 m nahco3 0 1 m na2co3 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl afterward the samples were bubbled in n2 sealed and kept under shaking for 5 days to guarantee equilibrium later the solutions were filtered and titrated with a 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution 2 4 data analysis since most of the data about the carbon surface properties do not follow the gaussian distribution the spearman s rank correlation which is a non parametric analysis rather than the pearson s correlation was used in this study the spearman s rank correlation can describe the relationship between two variables without making any assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables it assesses monotonic relationships whether linear or not and the coefficient r is calculated as follows 2 r 1 6 i 1 n u i v i 2 n n 2 1 where ui and vi are the orders of the two samples the r value is generally between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a totally positive linear correlation 0 indicates no linear correlation and 1 denotes a totally negative linear correlation 2 5 dft calculation and igm dft calculations were carried out using gaussian program1 at m06 2x def2 tzvp m06 2x def2 svp level2 4 igm wave function analysis was performed using multiwfn program5 lefebvre et al 2018 zhao et al 2006 2 6 thermal modification of the pac to further investigate the effect of the surface chemical properties on the adsorption of dmds onto the pac carbon samples were heated in a tube furnace to 500 or 1000 c under n2 to modify their surface characteristics without significantly changing their textural structures pereira et al 2010 the temperature increased from ambient temperature to 500 or 1000 c at a rate of 50 c min in a n2 atmosphere and was then maintained at 500 1000 c for 2 h finally it was allowed to decrease to room temperature the dmds adsorption performances of these modified pacs were tested using a procedure similar to that described in section 2 2 the only difference was that the test water was synthesized using dmds with an initial concentration of 350 ng l 1 in di water each adsorption experiment was repeated three times 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption capacities of dmds and 2 mib onto the nine pacs the adsorption ratios of dmds and 2 mib onto various pacs are illustrated in fig 1 and the effects of the pac dosage on the removal of dmds and 2 mib are shown in fig s1 the adsorption capacities for dmds were generally smaller than those for 2 mib although pac7 exhibited the best adsorption performance for both dmds and 2 mib the adsorption capacity sequences for dmds and 2 mib were completely different for dmds pac7 achieved the highest adsorption ratio while pac4 exhibited the lowest adsorption ratio for 2 mib pac7 exhibited the best adsorption performance while pac6 showed the lowest adsorption capacity previous studies have shown that the micropores and particle size of pac will significantly affect its adsorption capacity for low molecular weight substances including odor compounds matsui et al 2015 yu et al 2007 therefore before analysis of the effect of surface chemical properties the pore structure and particle size of the nine pacs were characterized the micropore volume vm and median particle size d 0 5 are shown in fig 1 and other results of the pore structure and particle size are listed in tables s2 and s4 respectively their correlations were also determined by spearman s rank correlation analysis and the results are displayed in fig 1 table s3 and table s5 the adsorption capacities for both compounds had significant positive correlations with their vm values as shown in fig 1 and table s3 the d 0 5 values showed significant negative correlations with the adsorption capacities as shown in fig 1 and table s5 which suggested that the pac with the relatively small particle size may exhibit enhanced adsorption performance the highest adsorption by pac7 for both dmds and 2 mib may be due to its abundant micropores and small particle size nonetheless the dmds and 2 mib adsorption capacities showed different variation trends and the 2 mib adsorption capacity correlated better with the vm and d 0 5 than the dmds adsorption capacity as shown in fig 1 and table s2 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the dmds adsorption capacity and vm d 0 5 was 0 67 0 72 which is smaller than that of the 2 mib adsorption capacity and vm d 0 5 0 73 0 80 thus it could be concluded that although the physical character including the micropore volume and particle size of the pac is a crucial factor for both dmds and 2 mib adsorption there are other important factors such as the surface chemical properties that affect their adsorption which may be stronger for dmds than for 2 mib as the correlation between dmds and the micropore volume particle size was significantly weaker than that for 2 mib 3 2 effects of the pac chemical properties on the adsorption capacity 3 2 1 infrared spectrum characterization ftir was applied to analyze the surface functional groups for the 9 pacs and the spectra are shown in fig 2 the assignments of the bonds at different wavenumbers are given in table 3 very similar ftir spectra were obtained for various pacs except for pac7 and pac8 whose spectra did not indicate the stretching of the cc bonds however the two pacs pac7 and pac8 without the cc bonds exhibited the best and the second best adsorption performances for dmds respectively for 2 mib pac7 also achieved the highest adsorption capacity whereas pac8 had a median adsorption capacity as discussed above the physical character of pac also affects the dmds and 2 mib adsorptions the highest vm and the smallest size d 0 1 d 0 5 and d 0 9 of pac7 may promote excellent adsorption for both dmds and 2 mib pac8 has abundant micropores and a medium d 0 5 value while its d 0 9 value is rather large indicating that its particle size is not uniform which could explain its mediocre 2 mib adsorption performance however pac8 exhibited superior dmds adsorption performance compared to other pacs it is assumed that a pac with relatively few cc bonds might exhibit enhanced dmds adsorption however pac9 even with the presence of the cc bond also exhibited good dmds as well as 2 mib adsorption performance additionally pac2 pac3 and pac4 achieved high 2 mib adsorptions but low dmds adsorptions pac9 had more abundant micropores and a relatively small size evidently these beneficial physical properties may counter the inhibiting effect of cc on pac9 from the ftir spectra it can be inferred that the absence of the cc functional groups might result in improved dmds adsorption although further demonstration is required 3 2 2 functional groups measured by boehm titration considering that the surface groups of the pacs cannot be quantitatively characterized by ftir the boehm titration method was applied for the quantification of the basic and acidic sites as shown in table 4 regarding the number of acidic sites the wood based pac4 had the highest while other wood and coconut based pacs had similar numbers evidently the coconut based pacs had the highest number of basic sites the coconut based pacs exhibited better dmds adsorption performance than the wood and coal based pacs which may be attributed to the abundant basic sites to further analyze the relationship between the pac adsorption ability and the basic acidic properties spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied the results are shown in table 5 only the dmds adsorption capacity displayed a significant positive correlation with the basic sites other groups including the acidic group did not show any significant correlation with the adsorption capacities for dmds and 2 mib the correlation results indicated that the adsorption capacity for 2 mib was independent of any functional group on the surface of pac which is in agreement with previous studies that suggested the 2 mib adsorption is independent of the oxygen content of the ac yu et al 2007 matsui et al 2015 for dmds the adsorption capacity increased with the number of basic sites while other groups did not display any correlation with the dmds adsorption capacity this result can explain the opposing trends for dmds and 2 mib adsorptions onto wood based pacs although the micropore volume of wood based pacs pac4 6 decreased from pac4 to pac6 the dmds adsorption capacity increased owing to the increase in the number of basic sites however the adsorption capacity of 2 mib increased from pac4 to pac6 simply due to the micropore volume jana and sarkar found similar results in that alkali functionalized acs had a high adsorption ability for selected malodorous compounds containing sulfides such as methyl mercaptan ethyl mercaptan dimethyl sulfide and carbon disulfide jana and sarkar 2018 however vega et al 2013 found that the dmds adsorption capacity was not affected by the oxygen functional groups in ac because they did not analyze the oxygen functional groups individually moreover the total number of oxygen functional groups of ac were not relevant to the adsorption capacity this fact could be the reason for the contradictory results obtained in previous studies 3 3 dmds adsorption mechanism analysis to further investigate the effects of the cc bonds and pac basic sites on the adsorption behavior of dmds onto pac a series of dft calculations was conducted to compute the adsorption enthalpy to simplify the simulation calculations a simple graphene structure composed of seventeen aromatic rings was adopted as the pac model according to a previous study the basic properties of pac are mostly derived from the graphene structure and three typical basic functional groups ketone pyrone and chromene as shown in fig s2 montes morán et al 2004 in addition two active adsorption sites were considered one on the edge of the structure denoted as the graphene functional group edge and the other on the facial part of the structure denoted as graphene functional group facial the adsorption process would occur in the low energy mode therefore five structures as shown in fig s2 and ten adsorption models were constructed and the results are shown in table 6 all the adsorption enthalpies for the various structures are negative this result indicates that the adsorption process for dmds is exothermic weigend and ahlrichs 2005 notably compared to the undoped graphene the cc structure in the doped graphene layer would significantly increase the adsorption enthalpy thus making dmds adsorption more difficult this could further prove the above inference that the cc structure in the carbon layer was unfavorable for the dmds adsorption comparing different structures the undoped graphene and chromene doped graphene structures favor the dmds adsorption in the edge mode while for other structures ketone and pyrone doped graphene the adsorption enthalpy in the facial mode was more negative weigend and ahlrichs 2005 in addition the edge site of the undoped graphene structure had the lowest adsorption enthalpy followed by the facial mode for the ketone doped graphene structure and the edge mode for the chromene doped graphene structure while the facial mode of the undoped graphene structure was the fourth overall the undoped graphene structure was generally outstanding regarding dmds adsorption which suggests that the adsorption of dmds primarily relies on the weak chemical binding π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions weigend and ahlrichs 2005 combined with the ftir results it can be inferred that relatively few cc bonds and more graphene c structures are favorable for dmds adsorption the igm analysis was applied to investigate the non covalent interactions between the different structures and dmds and the results are shown in fig 3 in this model the nature of the interaction can be distinguished directly by color codes related to the electron density derivatives red for strongly repulsive green for van der waals forces and blue for strongly attractive interactions lefebvre et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 3 van der waals forces played a major role in the adsorption of dmds in various configurations additionally the igm method can provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of an atom or several atoms on the total interaction between two or more molecules from the igm figures it can be observed that in the facial mode the two s atoms contributed to the adsorption behavior while in the edge mode the two ch3 groups contributed more to the adsorption behavior the oxygen containing basic sites did not play critical roles in the adsorption of dmds the π π interactions by the graphene structure may dominate the dmds adsorption previous studies have shown that an increase in the graphene structure will lead to an increase in the basicity of pac montes morán et al 2004 pereira et al 2010 therefore the graphene structure is more favorable to adsorb dmds than the oxygen containing basic sites 3 4 effect of thermal modification of pac on its adsorption for dmds the thermal modification of pac could reduce the surface acidic sites and contribute to the exposure of basic sites with minimal change to the textural structure of the pac pereira et al 2010 therefore the thermal modification of pac9 was conducted to further verify the correlations between the basic properties of the pac and the dmds adsorption capacity pac9 was selected for the thermal modification due to its large number of basic sites and because it contains cc bonds after the thermal modification the pacs were employed for dmds adsorption as illustrated in fig 4 a and b the adsorption capacity and adsorption rate were improved by thermal modification and pac 1000 was the most effective in terms of dmds adsorption the surface basic and acidic sites were characterized by boehm titration and raman spectroscopy as shown in table 7 and fig 4 c respectively the pore size distribution was also characterized to indicate that the change in the dmds adsorption capacity was not due to the variation in the pore size as shown in fig 4 d the numbers of the basic sites of pac 1000 and pac 500 increased significantly compared to those of the initial pac particularly pac 1000 while the numbers of the acidic sites of pac 1000 and pac 500 were similar and less than that of the initial pac the result agreed with that in section 3 2 2 which demonstrated that the basic property of pac has a positive correlation with the dmds adsorption in addition according to the raman results the intensity ratio of d band and g band of pac initial pac 500 and pac 1000 were 1 20 1 17 and 1 10 respectively indicating that the degree in the disorder decreased after thermal modification barranco et al 2010 it can also be inferred that carbon was graphitized after thermal modification as evidenced by the enhanced adsorption capacity for dmds which agrees with the dft calculations 4 conclusions in this work the adsorption capacities of two distinct odor compounds dmds and 2 mib onto 9 pacs with different characteristics was compared and the effects of the pacs surface chemical properties on the adsorption performance were fully investigated the results indicated that all the nine pacs exhibited weaker adsorption performances for dmds than for 2 mib the spearman s rank correlation analysis results showed that the dmds adsorption capacity correlated significantly with basic sites while no significant correlations were observed between the 2 mib adsorption capacities and the surface sites dft calculations indicated that graphene structure in the edge mode significantly favored dmds adsorption followed by the ketone doped graphene structure in the facial mode the igm model indicated that van der waals forces played certain role in the dmds adsorption the results also suggested that thermal modification could enhance the basicity and graphene content thus increasing the dmds adsorption performance overall it could be concluded that the pac with more basic sites particularly the graphene structure demonstrated a relatively higher adsorption for dmds the results could direct the modification of pacs to improve their efficiency for the removal of some special
