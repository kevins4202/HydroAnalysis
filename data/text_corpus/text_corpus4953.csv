24765,in his paper on net primary productivity of terrestrial communities predicted from climatological data rosenzweig 1968 argued that variability in productivity is well accounted for by evapo transpiration and that water from transpiration is on global scales the most variable component in the photosynthesis reaction the goal of this paper is to investigate whether variability in plant growth on local scales and within species is primarily related to transpiration under several scenarios including different terrain curvature slope aspect soil characteristics and climate ranges we test the hypothesis that this relationship exists because root growth into the surface soil layers 0 2 m tends to follow paths with minima in resistance which in turn maximizes water flow and nutrient delivery rates that regulate growth the set of all connected paths with individual pore to pore flow resistances less than a critical percolating value forms a cluster with mass fractal dimensionality d f we propose that roots follow paths through the 2d percolation cluster defining the set of all optimal flow paths making the 2d value of d f from percolation relevant to root fractal dimensionality the tortuosity of such optimal paths as defined in percolation theory should then relate root length to root radial extent linking the parameters of root tortuosity and plant productivity our analysis of large data sets across species implies that root radial extent and tree height are both proportional to cumulative transpiration until trees approached maximum height and their growth rates are proportional to the transpiration rate not to the moisture content local variations in tree height as functions of the variables investigated appear generally consistent with deduced variations in transpiration here this correlation is investigated more closely in the context of studies addressing individual tree species 1 introduction plant growth and productivity are influenced by many factors such as nutrient and light availability adaptation competition soil substrate variability grazing by herbivores attacks by various pathogens and climate variables mechanisms that explain observed differences in maximum tree height at different locations and patterns in height growth have eluded ecologists and plant physiologists ryan and yoder 1997 clearly the growth of trees can be restricted by any conditions that limit productivity we suggest however that it may be possible that any of these limiting conditions is expressed through or reflected by a reduction in actual transpiration already more than a half a century ago rosenzweig 1968 argued that variability in productivity is well accounted for by evapo transpiration rosenzweig s argument is elegant though difficult to use predictively on account of the many interacting factors that influence how much water is actually transpired by any individual plant although the physiological responses of plants to water stress and the associated effects on plant growth are well studied on easy to access aboveground tissues i e stems branches and leaves zhu 2002 jaleel et al 2009 venturas et al 2017 there still remains a paucity of information on how plant growth is modulated by fundamental constraints over plant available soil water that arise from the interaction between roots and soil physical properties while this interaction provides a basis for our guiding hypothesis our goal here is to probe available literature for evidence that limitations in transpiration due to variability in a variety of local conditions such as microclimate soil conditions and slope aspect or curvature are reflected in corresponding reductions in tree height with this investigation we hope then to provide motivation for more detailed experimental studies that can isolate the dependence of growth rate on transpiration the basis for the application of percolation theory approach for explaining how root soil interactions regulate transpiration was laid by considering limitations on root growth imposed by network properties of the soil hunt 2017 and an interfacial constraint between the directed network of a plant and the random network of the soil hunt and manzoni 2016 two recent large scale studies of world data sets on tree growth confirmed the importance of percolation theoretical values of a the two dimensional optimal path exponent in the time dependence of tree height and b root radial extent growth rates and the two dimensional value of the percolation mass fractal dimensionality d f to root fractal mass the goal of the current paper is to investigate whether variability in plant growth on local scales and within species is in part related to constraints placed on transpiration by soil structure that can be explained by percolation theory the scope of the paper is to present the results of testing several scenarios including different terrain curvature slope aspect soil characteristics and climate ranges particularly we addressed the possibility that variability in tree height cited by ryan and yoder 1997 as well as several other cases may be accounted for by a single analytical result for the growth of plants suggested to be governed by root radial extent rre but also shown to account for plant height hunt and manzoni 2016 hunt 2017 note that the same result for extensional growth rates used here generates as well hunt 2017 the quoted relationship of net primary productivity npp to transpiration the problem that originally interested rosenzweig 1968 2 critical literature review a literature review of publications on the variability of tree growth showed that multiple factors and processes can affect transpiration such as soil moisture content compaction and hydrophobicity climate slope aspect and slope curvature for example popova et al 2016 found that the optimal path selection by roots in the soil is fundamental for resource acquisition popova et al 2016 stated that root apices may direct their growth through cracks or generally follow paths with a low impedance to penetration darwin and darwin 1897 hart 1990 brown 1993 migliaccio and piconese 2001 blancaflor and masson 2003 gilroy and masson 2008 migliaccio et al 2013 these authors provided only empirical data with no theoretical background although we can evaluate the overall bending response by analyzing the tortuosity quantitative estimates of the contribution of active growth responses relative to passive deflection during root bending in the soil remain lacking the root radial extent is related to root length by the tortuosity of the root path through the soil hunt and manzoni 2016 argued that the basis for the prediction of the root radial extent is an analytical result describing the tortuosity of paths in random networks whose total impedance to flow or equivalently growth is minimized this constraint constitutes the chief root soil interaction considered here in addition to minimizing direct metabolic energy expenditure in the search for water and nutrients such an optimization also tends to maximize nutrient access clausnitzer and hopmans 1994 and somma et al 1998 performed 3 d modeling of the root growth as a function of mechanical soil strength soil temperature and solute concentration as well as soil water flow hunt et al 2014 and hunt and sahimi 2017 indicated that the root tortuosity is based on percolation theory while percolation theory can be applied to generate flow rates in disordered media hunt and manzoni 2016 the application of percolation theory in this paper is to evaluate the tortuosity of the optimal paths to this purpose the physical soil network is represented as a network of bonds that describe the ease of passage of fluid or a root tip from each pore to its neighbors in the limit of a strongly heterogeneous medium optimal paths are defined as having the smallest value of their cumulative resistance the resulting paths are fractal with length dependent tortuosity such fractal paths hunt 2017 are compatible with measurements made on root systems levang brilz and biondini 2002 whose results imply that the root length rl is proportional to the rre to a power larger than 1 the tortuosity can be defined explicitly by writing rl rre γ with γ 1 for γ 1 a path is always tortuous for γ 1 paths may still be tortuous but tortuosity is given by a numerical constant independent of scale levang brilz and biondini 2002 reported directly rl in terms of root biomass m to a non integral power δ while rre was given as m to a different power β in their notation rl rreδ β and γ δ β this formula is lacking the consideration of the dimensionality of flow in the root zone although transient soil water flow in the vadose zone is commonly simulated as one two or three dimensional spatial pattern the root water uptake is generally considered simply in the vertical dimension only vrugt et al 2001 indicated that for row crops and tree lines a 2 d representation would be better and for isolated trees the water uptake can be considered a 3 d pattern a root s search for nutrients will largely be confined to the top meter or so of soil because horizonation of the soil at this length scale tends to accompany preferred sequestration of nutrients such as n and more importantly p within this layer lynch 1995 thus hunt and manzoni 2016 chose the quantitative description of optimal paths within a two dimensional network and the value of d opt for 2d networks not surprisingly whenever plant growth is not strongly water limited as it is in desert environments root growth is indeed mostly confined to the top two meters or so of soil fan et al 2017 or to an even thinner layer on the order of a meter hillel 2005 or half a meter gentine et al 2012 evapotranspiration is generally a function of the aridity and precipitation p budyko 1958 1974 increasing precipitation p tends to increase evapotranspiration in a water limited environment until the limit when further increases in precipitation may bring an ecosystem into energy limiting conditions leading to no further increase in transpiration competing with transpiration is the direct evaporation of water from the earth s surface or from vegetation interception what is neither evaporated nor transpired may run off or infiltrate into the subsurface thus p run on e t i run off where e is evaporation and t is transpiration the actual evapotranspiration aet is then just the sum of e and t one can use the combined aet global average approximately 65 of precipitation lvovitch 1973 to estimate the fraction of the precipitation that infiltrates and runs off with this approximation a 10 error in an estimation of aet leads to a 19 error in the combined fraction that runs off and infiltrates however the focus of this paper is the transpiration if transpiration is estimated from aet and evaporation since on average transpiration represents 61 of aet schlesinger and jasechko 2014 an error of 10 in evaporation will typically lead to an error of only 6 in transpiration however local conditions will vary and the guidance developed from the average conditions may fail in particular cases moreover variability in the fractions of precipitation infiltrating or running off particularly due to local topographic effects will be difficult to ascertain introducing unknown variability into estimates of the transpiration based on the conservation equation 3 phenomenological model the hypothesis of the relevance of percolation theory to root growth would imply that the exponent γ should be the optimal paths exponent d opt i e γ δ β d opt or rl rre dopt for a relatively shallow soil layer for a 2d flow pattern the value of γ 1 21 can be used and rl rre 1 21 implies that rre rl 0 83 where 0 83 1 1 21 since rl is proportional to time t rre becomes proportional to t 0 83 watt et al 2006 hunt 2016 using the experimental data reported by levang brilz and biondini 2002 table a1 hunt 2017 determined that δ β 1 25 0 41 for 55 species of grasses and grassland forbs after removing 10 outliers differing from 1 by more than a factor 2 which is in accord with the value of γ 1 21 for 2 d flow however multiple values of δ β were near 1 43 which corresponds to γ 1 43 for a 3 d flow pattern accordingly hunt 2016 2017 hunt and manzoni 2016 proposed to express the tree height x equal to rre versus time as 1 x x 0 t t 0 0 83 parameters x 0 and t 0 are empirical parameters characterizing the smallest length and time scales in the pore network in eq 1 x 0 is the smaller value of the characteristic pore or plant xylem diameter and the ratio x 0 t 0 is defined as the rate of water flow through a pore values for the flow parameters used are also compatible hunt and manzoni 2016 with root tip extension rates measured by watt et al 2006 and others thus the root radial extent x is less than the product of the root tip extension rate x 0 t 0 and the time because the paths followed by the roots through the soil are fractal for comparison with large databases such as biometric and allometric database baad falster et al 2015 which do not provide root xylem diameters a geometric mean root xylem diameter of 10 μm watt et al 2006 hunt and manzoni 2016 can be estimated for x 0 moreover a pore diameter of 10 μm produces the most common soil hydraulic conductivity values measured under near saturated conditions hunt and manzoni 2016 since xylem diameters watt et al 2006 and typical pore diameters each range over two orders of magnitude hunt and manzoni 2016 the uncertainty in length scale is quite large the growth curve is often assumed to have a universal functional form modulated by a factor that reflects the characteristic height reached after a standard time typically 50 100 years at a given site while growth curves are not generally given in the form of power laws applying the more commonly used exponential functions for example see lappi and bailey 1988 fig 1 biging 1985 fig 3 gonzales et al 2005 fig 5 is reasonably consistent with eq 1 except at periods of less than about 6 months the sigmoidal shape of typical growth curves not reflected in our scaling relationship is explained by the tendency for root growth to outpace height growth in the first 6 months or so hunt and manzoni 2016 subsequently up to a height of up to about 40 m tree heights and root radial extents are nearly equal to each other kalliokoski et al 2008 phillips et al 2014 2015 an upscaled version of eq 1 can be used to present the relationship of eq 1 in terms of a plant growing season t g and associated transpiration depth t g hunt 2017 given by 2 x t g t t g 0 83 on a bilogarithmic plot a power law has two parameters the power that is its slope and the coefficient e g t g t g 0 83 its intercept note however that the transpiration rate given in e g mm yr is the ratio t g t g whenever x 0 t 0 0 83 t g t g 0 83 eq 1 and eq 2 are identical hunt 2017 the largest and smallest reasonable values for pore scale flow times t 0 x 0 v 0 were shown to predict nearly identical values for x t as calculated from t g t t g 0 83 using smallest and largest known values for t g when the growing season t g was fixed at 6 months hunt et al 2017 this comparison between eq 2 and observation was found to hold over time scales consistent with a range of heights of about 1 m to 40 m hunt and manzoni 2016 hunt 2017 and for rre to much greater length scales up to 10 km in the case of posidonia oceanica thus pore scale percolation constraints on root growth from the structure of optimal paths through networks constrain growth of individual plants over a significant portion of their lifetimes but the specific connection between rre and transpiration implies a key role of the magnitude of transpiration in plant growth since eq 2 is a power law with power less than 1 the growth rate dx dt must decline in time which can be given by 3 d x d t 0 83 x 0 t 0 t t 0 0 17 0 83 t g t g t t g 0 17 where the distinction between the two expressions is less than 20 in the upper and lower bounds using maximum and minimum transpiration values of 1650 mm and 20 mm respectively insignificantly larger than uncertainty in knowledge of transpiration or typical pore scale flow rates eq 2 implies that plant height is proportional to the growing season transpiration which coincides with a universal power law form for the growth curve of trees and which is modulated by a factor t g strongly dependent on a suite of climatic biological and edaphic variables these two features are in general accord with a century s worth of research into tree growth rates as summarized in the concepts of the growth curve and its companion site index si e g biging 1985 lappi and bailey 1988 gonzales et al 2005 aertsen et al 2010 weisskittel et al 2011 thus the present prediction with the universal power 0 83 providing the shape of the growth curve and its magnitude may ultimately replace the traditional formulation for tree growth indeed we show below that 1 growth rates adhere to an exponential function until trees emerge from the canopy with an upper limit on the exponent of 0 83 and 2 the variability of t g with topography soil conditions slope aspect and climate may account for a wide range of intra specific tree growth variability reported in the literature direct measurements needed for the evaluation of the root production are transpiration tree height xylem diameter pore size and hydraulic conductivity the direct dependence of eq 1 on pore or xylem diameter is only to the power of 1 0 83 0 17 thus an order of magnitude error in pore diameter produces an error in predicted height only 17 as large or altogether 50 the dependence of height in eq 2 on transpiration is linear and relative errors in transpiration translate to equal errors in predicted heights however t g is better constrained than pore sizes though its value is mostly inferred indirectly tree height measurements have been a source of significant error with many experimenters preferring to infer tree heights from allometry and tree diameter measurements however due to significant discrepancies between predictions of allometry and observations feldpausch et al 2011 muller landau et al 2006 hunt and manzoni 2016 we restrict our attention to cases where tree height is measured directly since eq 1 does not include such variables as the xylem diameter and the pore size we have not addressed their uncertainty directly but provided some general arguments below in the percolation theory of flow through random networks sheppard et al 1999 the tortuosity of such paths is not described by a constant rather it is scale dependent and described by a fractal exponent defined as d opt the value of this exponent depends only on the dimensionality of the medium that constrains the path selection sheppard et al 1999 we will be analyzing the effectiveness of eqs 1 3 when compared with actual data for tree heights and growth rates as functions of time according to these equations most of the variability in growth rate can be traced to the quantity of water transported even though the variations in both transpiration across biomes box et al al 1989 and the variation in xylem diameter across species watt et al 2006 amount to about two orders of magnitude since in eq 1 the pore scale t 0 is equal to x o v o x o appears both in the numerator and the denominator generating x o x o 0 83 x o 0 17 but even when x o varies over two orders of magnitude this generates a variability of only a factor 2 2 1000 17 in growth rate in contrast v 0 appears only in the ratio x o v o producing the dependence v o 0 83 1000 83 the corresponding variability in growth rate is equal to 46 much larger than 2 2 equivalently when the upscaled version eq 2 is applied it is the total water transport t g which provides the greatest influence on plant growth since growing seasons are typically measured in months whereas t g can vary over nearly two orders of magnitude box et al 1989 although we do not ordinarily have any information regarding either pore or xylem diameters it is seen that in our phenomenology the effects of variation in these quantities is secondary to that of the quantity of water transported conceptually in individual cases we expect x 0 to be given by whichever diameter pore or xylem that limits water flow the most thomas 1996 noted a proportionality of growth rates to final tree height this is understandable if within a species with the same genetic controls the time for following maximum growth rates does not change from one geographic region to another but the rate of transformation of solar energy to sugar does from theory this is consistent with applying eq 3 to different individuals for the same though variable t values and the same t g values but with distinct values of t g as long as each tree follows eq 3 the ratio of their heights will be the ratio of their t g values if height growth for both trees ceases at the same time the ratio of their final heights will also be the same value of course there is individual variability not accounted for by such a formula i e the loss of height of a sapling caused by a branch falling from another tree clark and clark 2001 such cases were omitted thus water fluxes available to trees should be equally relevant in determining both their growth rates and final heights here we highlight examples of how transpiration growth and stand structure are phenomenologically related to eq 1 or eq 2 we also address how tree growth rates relate to eq 3 in each of the subsections below we will address the role of total water transport in helping to predict plant growth except for the first two the actual time dependence is neglected where the time dependence is neglected the height of either the dominant or the typical trees accessed is given along a gradient in some quantity i e soil hydrophobicity climate curvature that can be related quantitatively or semi quantitatively to the transpiration where the time dependence is included explicitly we seek either pore scale flow rates or total transpiration values that are appropriate to the comparison for the entire meta data set in the first case investigated this corresponds to a range of relevant flow rates across climate zones for the exceptionally fast growing trees in the second case the transpiration value used is the largest documented by box et al 1989 here as elsewhere hunt and manzoni 2016 we note that the predictive capability of eq 1 or eq 2 for tree height breaks down at larger time scales from 30 years to 100 years one limiting factor is the hydraulic limit koch et al 2004 of about 125 m however rapidly growing trees may approach the canopy in a much shorter time frame and we suggest that the chief limitation on growth for trees that have neared or exceeded the canopy is likely not the influence of the physical characteristics of the medium on the roots but can be a combination of many factors such as wind lightning or co adaptation to regional characteristics reducing advantages of greater heights 4 results implications of the phenomenological model in this section we address a number of published studies where our model of tree growth may find support as no investigations were actually conducted with the purpose of testing our specific model though some investigators indeed investigated related hypotheses we cannot in general exclude ambiguity of understanding a model of the tree growth nevertheless the evidence compiled appears to relate to our predictions with regard to both the temporal and transpiration dependences of the tree growth rate 4 1 cumulative growth as a function of time our first comparison fig 1 is with an entire meta data set baad falster et al 2015 the data give plant heights over periods of weeks to roughly a century for a range of plant species and climates in accord with eq 1 we use bounds on the typical pore scale water flux bounds across climate zones from about 240 mm yr to 20 m yr to account for the variability of the entire meta data set for plant heights and ages over the time period of record hunt and manzoni 2016 attributing the major variability to flow rates rather than directly to the plant xylem characteristics we use for all the data the same length scale chosen equal to a geometric mean xylem diameter of about 10 µm a range of xylem diameters from 1 µm to 100 µm is given by watt et al 2006 the value of 20 m yr is roughly consistent with a maximum precipitation 10 m divided by a typical porosity of about 0 4 at the shortest time scales measurements for root tip extension rates are accessed and at time scales larger than hundreds of years it is the rre associated with large clones as evidenced by the existence of surface shoots and confirmed by genetic comparison at intermediate time scales the comparison was with tree heights in comparison with baad the growing season representation eq 2 provides a more transparent standard using for a growing season t g 0 5 yr and a range of transpirations 20 mm namibian desert seeley 1978 to a maximum of 1650 mm t g tropical savannahs and rainforests box et al 1989 generates essentially the same range of plant heights as a function of time as the pore scale flow rates above and equally bounds hunt et al 2017 the heights of woody plants falster et al 2015 as a function of time from time scales of weeks to hundreds of years 4 2 comparison with populus deltoides and eucalyptus regnans here by comparing data with eq 2 we address height growth of two specific species within an optimal environment for growth this allows choice of a single transpiration value rather than a range of transpiration values populus deltoides and eucalyptus regnans may be the two fastest growing tree species in the world over a period of decades fig 2 provides a comparison of predictions using eq 2 with the upper limit of tg 1 65 m with specific tree height and age data for deltoides taken from johnson and burkhardt 1976 and for regnans from van der meer et al 1999 p j 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 and givnish et al 2014 note that 1 65 m is roughly equal to the total precipitation between 1 5 m yr and 2 m yr australian bureau of meteorology 2015 in the region of australia where e regnans grows most rapidly but this tree species is known to take advantage of virtually all the water available to it the populus deltoides individuals were measured in the mississippi flood plain in years following floods that removed all vegetation thus these measurements likely detected transpiration values near an upper known limit for eucalyptus regnans with xylem diameter of 200 µm petit et al 2010 using eq 2 yields the corresponding pore scale flow velocity of 0 76 µm s for populus deltoides with xylem diameter 37 µm the same calculation yields 1 1 µm s bloeschl and sivapalan 1996 present a figure showing a typical pore scale flow velocity of ca 1 µm s both inferred values are also in line with the median hydraulic conductivity for soils about 1 µm s freeze and cherry 1979 clapp and hornberger 1978 these values correspond to yearly pore scale fluxes 30 m yr similar to the climatic maximum values of 20 m yr given above for both comparisons simultaneously we used a fundamental length scale of 100 µm very close to the geometric mean of 87 µm a second comparison is with data from walsh et al 2008 for which the authors provided a portion of the cumulative height growth curves fig 3 4 3 comparison with growth rates of eucalyptus according to eq 3 tree growth rates should not be constant in time as assumed in allometric scaling e g enquist et al 1998 b j 2007 but correspond to a small negative power a distinction which should be readily distinguished when comparing with real data the purpose here is dual 1 to establish which relationship is more nearly in accord with data trends and 2 to see whether the coefficients assumed for assessing the cumulative height growth as a function of time in the previous section also generate reasonable explicit predictions for the growth rate as a function of time when assuming a growing season of 6 months and an upper limit on transpired water of around 1650 mm box et al 1989 predictions by eq 3 compare well with observed growth rates for rapidly growing tree species such as eucalyptus regnans sequoia sempervirens sequoiadendron giganteum or metasequoia glyptostroboides fig 4 hunt and manzoni 2016 based on publications by enquist et al 1998 b j 2007 showed that existing constant growth rate predictions from allometric scaling underestimate short term growth rates by a factor of 10 note that like eq 2 the growth rate given by eq 3 does not hold indefinitely for tree height though it appears to do so for the rre of clones hunt 2017 where its predictions generate the size of aspen spruce seagrass as well as growth rates of armillaria fungi and other underground root systems of clonal bodies out to length scales of 10 km over 100 000 years when individuals reach the height of the canopy the competition for light no longer dominates and growth slows more precipitously or ceases hunt and manzoni 2016 further there appears to be a physiological limit of about 125 m on the height of trees due to hydraulic limitations such as cavitation koch et al 2004 the latter limit is visible in the baad database in fig 1 and the former is evident for populus deltoides in fig 2 4 4 evaluation of the growing rate of the same tree species in different geographic regions we evaluated the growing rate of the same tree species in different geographic regions using proxy variables of climate substrate type soil or rock soil characteristics slope curvature slope aspect and tree hydraulic conductivity along a rainfall gradient in southeastern australia givnish et al 2012 demonstrate that the heights of the tallest individuals of e regnans are linearly proportional to the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration et 0 since the transect studied was mostly at equal latitudes with roughly uniform et 0 a budyko 1958 1974 representation of et et 0 implies that et may be approximately substituted for p though the fraction of et represented by transpiration may vary more significantly we found that growth curves of eucalyptus in various locations conform to our scaling prediction fig 3 and the ratio of tallest tree heights from distinct tree populations at any age is the same compatible with the results of givnish et al 2012 the uncertainty in this comparison stems mainly from the inexact correspondence of the ratio of transpiration to et 0 to the ratio of p to et 0 ryan and yoder 1997 stated on the eastern slope of the cascade mountains in oregon ponderosa pine soar to 50 m 30 km farther east in a drier climate the same species struggles to attain 10 m if soils do not vary significantly and topography is relatively consistent the proposed change in climate is due to lowest order to a contrast in precipitation according to the prism precipitation map of oregon daly et al 1994 the rainfall along the cascade crest ranges from 175 cm yr to 400 cm yr 25 km to the east the rainfall contour is 50 cm yr the ratio is thus constrained to lie between 3 5 1 and 8 1 as measured along the crest from well south of bend or almost to the columbia river a distance of roughly 200 km the geometric mean of 3 5 and 8 is 5 3 a discrepancy of 6 from the ratio 5 of the heights of mature ponderosa pines from just east of the crest to 25 km further east the arithmetic mean is 5 75 only 15 off the observed ratio oberhuber et al 1998 studied the response of tree growth to dryness response function analysis indicates that at most sites wide rings are significantly associated with high precipitation in april to june and cool conditions in may of the current year limited water availability causes a homogeneous relationship of radial tree growth to climate at all habitats though site characteristics slope magnitude slope aspect soil depth vegetation cover differ substantially cool conditions in late spring reduce water loss to direct evaporation with the associated tendency therefore to increase transpiration by allometric scaling arguments enquist et al 1998 b j 2007 increased diameters correlate strongly with increased tree height implying that increased transpiration increases height growth murphy and lugo 1986 indicated that in tropical forests with precipitation between 500 mm and 2000 mm per year geometric mean 1000 mm tree heights ranged from 10 m to 40 m geometric mean of 20 m and tree growth at 1 yr from 1 m to 3 m geometric mean 1 7 m but in tropical forests with greater than 2000 mm precipitation per year roughly twice as great the tree heights varied from 20 m to 84 m geometric mean 41 m and the growth at 1 yr from 2 m to 5 m geometric mean 3 2 m as precipitation increases by a factor 2 so do growth at one year a factor 1 88 and the final tree heights a factor 2 05 the general conclusions are independent of comparison scheme arithmetic or geometric mean two data points or three though the exact numbers will vary of course these authors cited such a wide spread in values because their work was a meta study reviewing many separate studies 4 5 effect of substrate soil or rock trees growing on bare rock present an unusual sight normally crevices can be located which the trees have exploited for their roots yet even where crevices serve as root pathways the growth of such trees is typically stunted is this also a product of a reduced transpiration ryan and yoder 1997 state in particular that in the front range of the colorado rocky mountains a seed from a 25 m tall ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa may fall into a rocky crevice and never grow more than 1 2 m the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity of unconsolidated sediments at http www aqtesolv com aquifer tests aquifer properties htm with source domenico and schwartz 1990 is 1 35 10 7 m s the geometric mean for each sediment type calculated from its maximum and minimum value the overall geometric mean calculated over the seven sediment types given likewise for sedimentary and crystalline rocks but the geometric mean of all the sedimentary rock values cited is 3 03 10 9 m s smaller by a factor of 44 contrarily the geometric mean for crystalline rock types is 1 63 10 7 m s slightly larger than for unconsolidated sediments however this sampling includes permeable basalt and fractured rocks with high permeability due to fractures since it is primarily the rock matrix from which transpired water must come these two categories should be excluded as high fracture permeability transports water away from roots excluding those two categories the ratio of the geometric mean of unconsolidated sediments to crystalline rock hydraulic conductivity is 7 the geometric mean of 44 and 7 is 18 the ratio of 25 m to 1 m 2 m 0 5 is also 18 thus a reasonable ratio of hydraulic conductivities for permeability limited flow is the ratio of observed heights which is consistent with attributing growth variability to variability in permeability limited transpiration significantly freeze and cherry 1979 report nearly the same spreads of hydraulic conductivity values as quoted above thus trees grow faster and taller on soil than on rock because of its higher hydraulic conductivity and consequent greater transpiration 4 6 effect of soil characteristics hydrophobicity russel and woolhouse 2012 investigated variability in the height of sequoia sempervirens along a soil characteristic gradient near cape mendocino california usa our assertion that hydrophobicity may constrain water uptake and thus growth contrasts with that of the authors who attribute the variation in growth to variable soil chemistry evinced by the ph gradient trees grow shorter on more acidic soils because they are more hydrophobic thus reducing water fluxes our interpretation is based on the reported correlation between hydrophobicity and soil ph value the authors state the youngest terrace vi has well drained soils rich in organic matter and nutrients the older i e i iii terraces where pygmy forest s are found contain highly acidic extremely podzolized soils with a hydrophobic hardpan however the authors do not report hydraulic conductivity at their site making it necessary to find data for broadly analogous conditions while the quoted range of ph values correlates well with height soil ph correlates equally strongly with hydrophobicity lozano et al 2013 lower ph values being associated with more hydrophobic soils moreover de bano 1971 concluded horizontal infiltration was 25 times slower in water repellent soil than in wettable soil similarly rowe 1941 found that vertical infiltration was reduced from 8 9 cm hr to 0 304 cm hr by a factor of 29 through periodic chaparral burning a hydrophobicity interpreted by de bano and krammes 2000 as due to coatings of organics on particles both values 25 and 29 are compatible with the ratio 28 of the tree heights in zone vi to that in zone i these growth ratios are similar to the maximum regnans height range 20 as well as the ratio of precipitation to pan evaporation along the rainfall gradient in southeastern australia givnish et al 2014 further wallis et al 1990 found that infiltration rates varied by a factor 6 over a horizontal distance 10 m between strongly and moderately water repellent agricultural himatangi sands this smaller ratio 6 compared with 28 derived from soils differing only in the degree of water repellency and is similar to the height ratio nearly 6 in soils i iii of russel and woolhouse 2012 of course other aspects of podzolization or high acidity may also inhibit growth of redwoods in zones 1 3 compaction tardieu et al 1991 showed that compaction reduced stomatal conductance even though plants on compacted soil showed water relations comparable to those of plants on uncompacted soils reductions in stomatal conductance reduce transpiration e g motzer et al 2005 in accord with kozlowski 1999 who noted that the deleterious effects on the hydraulic properties of soil could be responsible for the diminished plant growth we hypothesize that the stronger dependence of hydraulic conductivity on pore size distributions than that of a characteristic pressure is the likely cause of reduced growth rates of plants on compacted soils thus plants grow more slowly on compacted soils because the reduction in pore sizes strongly inhibits flow 4 7 topography surface curvature plant growth rates should be positively correlated with local topographic curvature particularly in areas with more arid climates because surface run off tends to collect in hollows increasing infiltration and thus also transpiration mcnabb 1989 found that yellow poplar tulipifera liriodendron trees in the southeastern usa averaged 50 m in zones of convergent topography i e valley bottoms but only 35 m in divergent topography ridgetops this distinction may be due to variation in water fluxes entering the soil which provides a limit to water volumes extracted from the soil dunne et al 1991 modeled effects of microtopography on stormwater infiltration in fig 16 these authors showed uniform infiltration rates of about 2 5 cm hr along steeper slopes independent of position but with less steep topography the infiltration rate could increase from 2 5 cm hr along the ridge to over 4 cm hr towards the bottom of the slope a ratio exceeding 1 6 the ratio 50 m 35 m is 1 43 our conclusion is compatible with that of berges et al 2005 although these authors interpreted topographic variability in terms of soil water the effect of topography on site index was consistent with the effect of soil water capacity and concluded that most site index variance was related to local soil factors and corroborated the hypothesis that sessile oak growth was regulated by the combined influence of soil water and nutrient budgets the example regarding slope aspect below shows difficulties in general interpretation in terms of water content however oberhuber and koffler 2000 these authors studied small scale variability in the growth of trees in a water limited montane elevation 750 m region and produced the following table for tree heights of a post glacial rockslide region in a dry valley of the swiss alps tree ages except for k135 92 years were between 105 and 153 years with mean value 125 years and typical variability 15 thus to first order one can neglect age as a primary factor behind variation in tree height sites in hollows and at the toe of the slope have positive curvature plateaus and mid slope near zero curvature ridgetops negative tree height decreases with increasing slope from about 8 m to 6 m for slopes changing from 0 to 50 but r 2 is only 0 15 slope curvature is likely more important since regression not shown of height on curvature index 1 if positive 1 if negative and 0 otherwise has r 2 0 7 here the ratio of maximum to minimum tree heights excluding k137 at the toe of the slope is consistently a factor 2 inclusion of the site at the toe of the slope which will also have a significant positive curvature but intercept even more water increases the ratio further either way 2 is larger than the tree height ratio 1 43 from mcnabb 1989 and the ratio of infiltration rates 1 6 of dunne et al 1991 however the large slopes and slope differences and the proclivity to landslides suggest a greater curvature than observed by mcnabb 1989 or modeled by dunne et al 1991 slope aspect tree growth should be inhibited in the northern hemisphere on southward and westward facing slopes because a greater fraction of et is lost to direct evaporation fekedulegn et al 2003 determined that in a mixed hardwood forest in west virginia at mean elevation about 224 m and with precipitation 130 cm yr there is a strong correlation between the slope aspect and tree height aspect affects the amount and daily cycle of solar radiation received at different times of the year and has a strong influence on the microclimate especially air temperature humidity and soil moisture rosenberg et al al 1983 net radiation on southwestern slopes was 24 higher than on northeastern slopes lee and sypolt 1974 while tree heights of the four species investigated averaged 17 lower on the southwestern slope however the correlation between aspect and soil water content was imperfect although it is generally believed that south facing slopes are drier and soil moisture deficits limit tree growth on these sites a study by lee and sypolt 1974 has shown that in some years available soil moisture was not significantly different by aspect in west virginia even when soil moisture content does not vary across aspect however increased solar radiation impinging on a southwestern slope will increase evaporation if the soil moisture content is unchanged transpiration was less mu et al 2011 showed that worldwide mean evaporation typically makes up 39 of evapotranspiration a mean value obtained also for precipitation about 130 cm yr appropriate to the site mu et al 2011 also state that for temperate deciduous forests evaporation is only 33 of evapotranspiration in the first case the observed increase of 24 would bring evaporation to 48 3 decreasing transpiration from 61 to 51 6 a reduction of 15 quite close to the height reductions for yellow poplar 17 northern red oak 14 and red maple 15 though smaller than for chestnut oak 24 if evaporation is only 33 of evapotranspiration a 24 increase in evaporation would decrease transpiration by only 12 liang et al 2006 studied growth of spruce and junipers at the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau soil depths on east and west facing slopes were the same junipers on the east facing slope reached a height of 10 m but only 8 5 m on the west whereas spruce grew to 14 m on the east and 12 m on the west these authors stated the west facing slope experiences a drier microclimate since it receives more solar radiation and hence stronger evaporation of soil water than the east facing slope rosenberg et al 1983 whether the results match predictions quantitatively is not addressed in this case as there is an even greater lack of relevant information for assessment than in the previous case 4 8 xylem characteristics and plant hydraulic conductivity larger xylem diameters should promote faster growth rates from a reduction in hydraulic resistance and increased transpiration rates zach et al 2010 found in humid environments where trees rarely experience severe soil water limitation the hydraulic system of trees requires a functional architecture for effectively transporting water to the crown despite a comparably low atmospheric evaporative demand for most of the year zach et al 2010 fig 5 digitized from zach et al 2010 demonstrates clear correlation of xylem diameter with tree height in this case the strong dependence of hydraulic conductance on xylem diameter together with minimal soil water limitations implies a strong correlation of growth with tree water transport as well from fan et al 2012 in this study we found xylem anatomical traits were much better predictors of growth rate and stature than wood density which is consistent with their more direct and stronger correlation with hydraulic conductivity hubbard et al 2001 offered as title stomatal conductance and photosynthesis vary linearly with plant hydraulic conductance in ponderosa pine a linear variance of photosynthesis with plant hydraulic conductance i e water transport is consistent with eq 2 which implies a linear dependence of height on transpiration discussion and conclusions a possible application of the present results is to enhanced drought susceptibility of trees in the western continental usa and diminution of water resources the recent increase in drought mortality may be partly due to higher temperatures but it certainly also has a component related to higher tree density brought on by a century of fire suppression at higher densities less water is available per tree drought weakened trees are also more susceptible to pathogens the increased dead tree density is then linked to higher intensity fires with higher risks to encroaching populations any theory capable of predicting both tree growth rates in time and the dependence of npp on transpiration should have relevance to the water balance in a changing environment and thus water resources if one can reliably predict tree growth patterns on the basis of their water consumption it should be possible to analyze patterns of fire tree growth and health and water resources in concert consider that biological productivity has relevance for potential feedbacks to climate change in view of the complex interaction between water resources transpiration and productivity thus increases in productivity due to fire suppression practices should contribute to longer term shallow subsurface water shortages with correspondingly reduced streamflow and greater susceptibility of forests to inter annual to decadal scale climatic fluctuations which according to models should be enhanced in a warming climate making such relationships more predictive should help to discern how tree population changes introduced by suppression are responsible for an increased risk of larger conflagrations as well as how best to reverse impacts of suppression in order to address the specific input of a forest changing with time it is necessary to expand the analysis at the beginning eq 2 for rre and thus also tree height as a function of time yields for t t g rre t g this result is for a single tree and a single growing season and was used equally for individuals as for ecosystems first address complications from advancing age of individual trees and then use this result as a basis to consider entire tree populations using the predicted percolation mass fractal dimensionality in 2d of d f 1 9 hunt 2017 suggested that npp should then be expressed as npp c et 1 9 where c is an as yet unknown constant extended to longer time intervals one can write rre1 9 t g 1 year age years 0 17 1 9 this is a decreasing function of time an additional factor that produces a decrease in time may come from tree thinning with increasing stand age if tree density is inversely proportional to the square of the rre then ecosystem npp is proportional to rre 0 1 producing a diminishing productivity with increasing tree size however in contrast to canopies tree roots may overlap implying that the density may be greater than rre 2 further above ground biomass is likely proportional to a larger power of rre and tree height than root biomass since above ground tree structures are more nearly expressed in 3d than in 2d finally as trees age apportionment of transpiration to various functions changes nevertheless the current analysis is generally compatible with ryan s observation regarding the diminution of productivity of forests with increasing age in the intermountain west suppression of fires tends to allow the growth of younger trees and an increased stand density simultaneously according to the present analysis both the tendency to a higher density of trees and a translation to a younger population should increase both npp and thus et demands increased et will strain water resources and long term water storage while increasing demand during drought all of which would be expected to increase drought susceptibility of trees thus extensions of the present framework to address more fully the specific conditions of the western usa may help to quantify drought stresses in a changing climate and thus assess the magnitudes of risks associated with particular management strategies a single relationship from the scaling of optimal paths from percolation theory accounts for nutrient and transpiration limits on woody plant growth the conceptual bases of this relationship are consistent with inferences of other recent studies e g popova et al 2016 any such spatio temporal scaling relationship relating tree height to its age from germination requires two site specific parameters one a spatial scale and one a temporal scale here the length scale is considered the smaller of the soil pore or plant xylem diameter while the time scale is the ratio of the length scale to the pore scale flow rate since the relationship is a power law its fundamental constants may be referred to larger scales such as a growing season and the transpiration during the growing season the relevance of the transpiration allows reasonable prediction of tree height variability as function of climate substrate soil characteristics including compaction and water repellency and topography slope curvature and aspect while the sublinear power law explains why tree growth slows with age these predictions work quite well across a variety of factors that limit tree growth thus the present results may help formulation of more accurate and general plant growth models and help to understand a number of seemingly unrelated puzzles in the ecology literature but note that a similar hypothesis of hydraulic limitations on tree height was already formulated by ryan and yoder 1997 the relative success of the model suggests that it is not directly the soil water potential or the soil water content that governs growth rates but that water flow and coupled transpiration rate determine plant growth of course rapid increase in hydraulic conductivity of a soil with increasing water content provides an important link between these two variables and the decrease in water potential with increasing water content also makes it easier for plants to draw water from the soil thus the two concepts and their related variables are often well correlated one system studied aspect variations of tree height in pennsylvania showed a clearer correlation between transpiration and tree growth than between soil water content and tree growth while a location may have too much water it is difficult for a tree to transpire too much since excess soil moisture implies water storage that exceeds the capacity of a

24765,in his paper on net primary productivity of terrestrial communities predicted from climatological data rosenzweig 1968 argued that variability in productivity is well accounted for by evapo transpiration and that water from transpiration is on global scales the most variable component in the photosynthesis reaction the goal of this paper is to investigate whether variability in plant growth on local scales and within species is primarily related to transpiration under several scenarios including different terrain curvature slope aspect soil characteristics and climate ranges we test the hypothesis that this relationship exists because root growth into the surface soil layers 0 2 m tends to follow paths with minima in resistance which in turn maximizes water flow and nutrient delivery rates that regulate growth the set of all connected paths with individual pore to pore flow resistances less than a critical percolating value forms a cluster with mass fractal dimensionality d f we propose that roots follow paths through the 2d percolation cluster defining the set of all optimal flow paths making the 2d value of d f from percolation relevant to root fractal dimensionality the tortuosity of such optimal paths as defined in percolation theory should then relate root length to root radial extent linking the parameters of root tortuosity and plant productivity our analysis of large data sets across species implies that root radial extent and tree height are both proportional to cumulative transpiration until trees approached maximum height and their growth rates are proportional to the transpiration rate not to the moisture content local variations in tree height as functions of the variables investigated appear generally consistent with deduced variations in transpiration here this correlation is investigated more closely in the context of studies addressing individual tree species 1 introduction plant growth and productivity are influenced by many factors such as nutrient and light availability adaptation competition soil substrate variability grazing by herbivores attacks by various pathogens and climate variables mechanisms that explain observed differences in maximum tree height at different locations and patterns in height growth have eluded ecologists and plant physiologists ryan and yoder 1997 clearly the growth of trees can be restricted by any conditions that limit productivity we suggest however that it may be possible that any of these limiting conditions is expressed through or reflected by a reduction in actual transpiration already more than a half a century ago rosenzweig 1968 argued that variability in productivity is well accounted for by evapo transpiration rosenzweig s argument is elegant though difficult to use predictively on account of the many interacting factors that influence how much water is actually transpired by any individual plant although the physiological responses of plants to water stress and the associated effects on plant growth are well studied on easy to access aboveground tissues i e stems branches and leaves zhu 2002 jaleel et al 2009 venturas et al 2017 there still remains a paucity of information on how plant growth is modulated by fundamental constraints over plant available soil water that arise from the interaction between roots and soil physical properties while this interaction provides a basis for our guiding hypothesis our goal here is to probe available literature for evidence that limitations in transpiration due to variability in a variety of local conditions such as microclimate soil conditions and slope aspect or curvature are reflected in corresponding reductions in tree height with this investigation we hope then to provide motivation for more detailed experimental studies that can isolate the dependence of growth rate on transpiration the basis for the application of percolation theory approach for explaining how root soil interactions regulate transpiration was laid by considering limitations on root growth imposed by network properties of the soil hunt 2017 and an interfacial constraint between the directed network of a plant and the random network of the soil hunt and manzoni 2016 two recent large scale studies of world data sets on tree growth confirmed the importance of percolation theoretical values of a the two dimensional optimal path exponent in the time dependence of tree height and b root radial extent growth rates and the two dimensional value of the percolation mass fractal dimensionality d f to root fractal mass the goal of the current paper is to investigate whether variability in plant growth on local scales and within species is in part related to constraints placed on transpiration by soil structure that can be explained by percolation theory the scope of the paper is to present the results of testing several scenarios including different terrain curvature slope aspect soil characteristics and climate ranges particularly we addressed the possibility that variability in tree height cited by ryan and yoder 1997 as well as several other cases may be accounted for by a single analytical result for the growth of plants suggested to be governed by root radial extent rre but also shown to account for plant height hunt and manzoni 2016 hunt 2017 note that the same result for extensional growth rates used here generates as well hunt 2017 the quoted relationship of net primary productivity npp to transpiration the problem that originally interested rosenzweig 1968 2 critical literature review a literature review of publications on the variability of tree growth showed that multiple factors and processes can affect transpiration such as soil moisture content compaction and hydrophobicity climate slope aspect and slope curvature for example popova et al 2016 found that the optimal path selection by roots in the soil is fundamental for resource acquisition popova et al 2016 stated that root apices may direct their growth through cracks or generally follow paths with a low impedance to penetration darwin and darwin 1897 hart 1990 brown 1993 migliaccio and piconese 2001 blancaflor and masson 2003 gilroy and masson 2008 migliaccio et al 2013 these authors provided only empirical data with no theoretical background although we can evaluate the overall bending response by analyzing the tortuosity quantitative estimates of the contribution of active growth responses relative to passive deflection during root bending in the soil remain lacking the root radial extent is related to root length by the tortuosity of the root path through the soil hunt and manzoni 2016 argued that the basis for the prediction of the root radial extent is an analytical result describing the tortuosity of paths in random networks whose total impedance to flow or equivalently growth is minimized this constraint constitutes the chief root soil interaction considered here in addition to minimizing direct metabolic energy expenditure in the search for water and nutrients such an optimization also tends to maximize nutrient access clausnitzer and hopmans 1994 and somma et al 1998 performed 3 d modeling of the root growth as a function of mechanical soil strength soil temperature and solute concentration as well as soil water flow hunt et al 2014 and hunt and sahimi 2017 indicated that the root tortuosity is based on percolation theory while percolation theory can be applied to generate flow rates in disordered media hunt and manzoni 2016 the application of percolation theory in this paper is to evaluate the tortuosity of the optimal paths to this purpose the physical soil network is represented as a network of bonds that describe the ease of passage of fluid or a root tip from each pore to its neighbors in the limit of a strongly heterogeneous medium optimal paths are defined as having the smallest value of their cumulative resistance the resulting paths are fractal with length dependent tortuosity such fractal paths hunt 2017 are compatible with measurements made on root systems levang brilz and biondini 2002 whose results imply that the root length rl is proportional to the rre to a power larger than 1 the tortuosity can be defined explicitly by writing rl rre γ with γ 1 for γ 1 a path is always tortuous for γ 1 paths may still be tortuous but tortuosity is given by a numerical constant independent of scale levang brilz and biondini 2002 reported directly rl in terms of root biomass m to a non integral power δ while rre was given as m to a different power β in their notation rl rreδ β and γ δ β this formula is lacking the consideration of the dimensionality of flow in the root zone although transient soil water flow in the vadose zone is commonly simulated as one two or three dimensional spatial pattern the root water uptake is generally considered simply in the vertical dimension only vrugt et al 2001 indicated that for row crops and tree lines a 2 d representation would be better and for isolated trees the water uptake can be considered a 3 d pattern a root s search for nutrients will largely be confined to the top meter or so of soil because horizonation of the soil at this length scale tends to accompany preferred sequestration of nutrients such as n and more importantly p within this layer lynch 1995 thus hunt and manzoni 2016 chose the quantitative description of optimal paths within a two dimensional network and the value of d opt for 2d networks not surprisingly whenever plant growth is not strongly water limited as it is in desert environments root growth is indeed mostly confined to the top two meters or so of soil fan et al 2017 or to an even thinner layer on the order of a meter hillel 2005 or half a meter gentine et al 2012 evapotranspiration is generally a function of the aridity and precipitation p budyko 1958 1974 increasing precipitation p tends to increase evapotranspiration in a water limited environment until the limit when further increases in precipitation may bring an ecosystem into energy limiting conditions leading to no further increase in transpiration competing with transpiration is the direct evaporation of water from the earth s surface or from vegetation interception what is neither evaporated nor transpired may run off or infiltrate into the subsurface thus p run on e t i run off where e is evaporation and t is transpiration the actual evapotranspiration aet is then just the sum of e and t one can use the combined aet global average approximately 65 of precipitation lvovitch 1973 to estimate the fraction of the precipitation that infiltrates and runs off with this approximation a 10 error in an estimation of aet leads to a 19 error in the combined fraction that runs off and infiltrates however the focus of this paper is the transpiration if transpiration is estimated from aet and evaporation since on average transpiration represents 61 of aet schlesinger and jasechko 2014 an error of 10 in evaporation will typically lead to an error of only 6 in transpiration however local conditions will vary and the guidance developed from the average conditions may fail in particular cases moreover variability in the fractions of precipitation infiltrating or running off particularly due to local topographic effects will be difficult to ascertain introducing unknown variability into estimates of the transpiration based on the conservation equation 3 phenomenological model the hypothesis of the relevance of percolation theory to root growth would imply that the exponent γ should be the optimal paths exponent d opt i e γ δ β d opt or rl rre dopt for a relatively shallow soil layer for a 2d flow pattern the value of γ 1 21 can be used and rl rre 1 21 implies that rre rl 0 83 where 0 83 1 1 21 since rl is proportional to time t rre becomes proportional to t 0 83 watt et al 2006 hunt 2016 using the experimental data reported by levang brilz and biondini 2002 table a1 hunt 2017 determined that δ β 1 25 0 41 for 55 species of grasses and grassland forbs after removing 10 outliers differing from 1 by more than a factor 2 which is in accord with the value of γ 1 21 for 2 d flow however multiple values of δ β were near 1 43 which corresponds to γ 1 43 for a 3 d flow pattern accordingly hunt 2016 2017 hunt and manzoni 2016 proposed to express the tree height x equal to rre versus time as 1 x x 0 t t 0 0 83 parameters x 0 and t 0 are empirical parameters characterizing the smallest length and time scales in the pore network in eq 1 x 0 is the smaller value of the characteristic pore or plant xylem diameter and the ratio x 0 t 0 is defined as the rate of water flow through a pore values for the flow parameters used are also compatible hunt and manzoni 2016 with root tip extension rates measured by watt et al 2006 and others thus the root radial extent x is less than the product of the root tip extension rate x 0 t 0 and the time because the paths followed by the roots through the soil are fractal for comparison with large databases such as biometric and allometric database baad falster et al 2015 which do not provide root xylem diameters a geometric mean root xylem diameter of 10 μm watt et al 2006 hunt and manzoni 2016 can be estimated for x 0 moreover a pore diameter of 10 μm produces the most common soil hydraulic conductivity values measured under near saturated conditions hunt and manzoni 2016 since xylem diameters watt et al 2006 and typical pore diameters each range over two orders of magnitude hunt and manzoni 2016 the uncertainty in length scale is quite large the growth curve is often assumed to have a universal functional form modulated by a factor that reflects the characteristic height reached after a standard time typically 50 100 years at a given site while growth curves are not generally given in the form of power laws applying the more commonly used exponential functions for example see lappi and bailey 1988 fig 1 biging 1985 fig 3 gonzales et al 2005 fig 5 is reasonably consistent with eq 1 except at periods of less than about 6 months the sigmoidal shape of typical growth curves not reflected in our scaling relationship is explained by the tendency for root growth to outpace height growth in the first 6 months or so hunt and manzoni 2016 subsequently up to a height of up to about 40 m tree heights and root radial extents are nearly equal to each other kalliokoski et al 2008 phillips et al 2014 2015 an upscaled version of eq 1 can be used to present the relationship of eq 1 in terms of a plant growing season t g and associated transpiration depth t g hunt 2017 given by 2 x t g t t g 0 83 on a bilogarithmic plot a power law has two parameters the power that is its slope and the coefficient e g t g t g 0 83 its intercept note however that the transpiration rate given in e g mm yr is the ratio t g t g whenever x 0 t 0 0 83 t g t g 0 83 eq 1 and eq 2 are identical hunt 2017 the largest and smallest reasonable values for pore scale flow times t 0 x 0 v 0 were shown to predict nearly identical values for x t as calculated from t g t t g 0 83 using smallest and largest known values for t g when the growing season t g was fixed at 6 months hunt et al 2017 this comparison between eq 2 and observation was found to hold over time scales consistent with a range of heights of about 1 m to 40 m hunt and manzoni 2016 hunt 2017 and for rre to much greater length scales up to 10 km in the case of posidonia oceanica thus pore scale percolation constraints on root growth from the structure of optimal paths through networks constrain growth of individual plants over a significant portion of their lifetimes but the specific connection between rre and transpiration implies a key role of the magnitude of transpiration in plant growth since eq 2 is a power law with power less than 1 the growth rate dx dt must decline in time which can be given by 3 d x d t 0 83 x 0 t 0 t t 0 0 17 0 83 t g t g t t g 0 17 where the distinction between the two expressions is less than 20 in the upper and lower bounds using maximum and minimum transpiration values of 1650 mm and 20 mm respectively insignificantly larger than uncertainty in knowledge of transpiration or typical pore scale flow rates eq 2 implies that plant height is proportional to the growing season transpiration which coincides with a universal power law form for the growth curve of trees and which is modulated by a factor t g strongly dependent on a suite of climatic biological and edaphic variables these two features are in general accord with a century s worth of research into tree growth rates as summarized in the concepts of the growth curve and its companion site index si e g biging 1985 lappi and bailey 1988 gonzales et al 2005 aertsen et al 2010 weisskittel et al 2011 thus the present prediction with the universal power 0 83 providing the shape of the growth curve and its magnitude may ultimately replace the traditional formulation for tree growth indeed we show below that 1 growth rates adhere to an exponential function until trees emerge from the canopy with an upper limit on the exponent of 0 83 and 2 the variability of t g with topography soil conditions slope aspect and climate may account for a wide range of intra specific tree growth variability reported in the literature direct measurements needed for the evaluation of the root production are transpiration tree height xylem diameter pore size and hydraulic conductivity the direct dependence of eq 1 on pore or xylem diameter is only to the power of 1 0 83 0 17 thus an order of magnitude error in pore diameter produces an error in predicted height only 17 as large or altogether 50 the dependence of height in eq 2 on transpiration is linear and relative errors in transpiration translate to equal errors in predicted heights however t g is better constrained than pore sizes though its value is mostly inferred indirectly tree height measurements have been a source of significant error with many experimenters preferring to infer tree heights from allometry and tree diameter measurements however due to significant discrepancies between predictions of allometry and observations feldpausch et al 2011 muller landau et al 2006 hunt and manzoni 2016 we restrict our attention to cases where tree height is measured directly since eq 1 does not include such variables as the xylem diameter and the pore size we have not addressed their uncertainty directly but provided some general arguments below in the percolation theory of flow through random networks sheppard et al 1999 the tortuosity of such paths is not described by a constant rather it is scale dependent and described by a fractal exponent defined as d opt the value of this exponent depends only on the dimensionality of the medium that constrains the path selection sheppard et al 1999 we will be analyzing the effectiveness of eqs 1 3 when compared with actual data for tree heights and growth rates as functions of time according to these equations most of the variability in growth rate can be traced to the quantity of water transported even though the variations in both transpiration across biomes box et al al 1989 and the variation in xylem diameter across species watt et al 2006 amount to about two orders of magnitude since in eq 1 the pore scale t 0 is equal to x o v o x o appears both in the numerator and the denominator generating x o x o 0 83 x o 0 17 but even when x o varies over two orders of magnitude this generates a variability of only a factor 2 2 1000 17 in growth rate in contrast v 0 appears only in the ratio x o v o producing the dependence v o 0 83 1000 83 the corresponding variability in growth rate is equal to 46 much larger than 2 2 equivalently when the upscaled version eq 2 is applied it is the total water transport t g which provides the greatest influence on plant growth since growing seasons are typically measured in months whereas t g can vary over nearly two orders of magnitude box et al 1989 although we do not ordinarily have any information regarding either pore or xylem diameters it is seen that in our phenomenology the effects of variation in these quantities is secondary to that of the quantity of water transported conceptually in individual cases we expect x 0 to be given by whichever diameter pore or xylem that limits water flow the most thomas 1996 noted a proportionality of growth rates to final tree height this is understandable if within a species with the same genetic controls the time for following maximum growth rates does not change from one geographic region to another but the rate of transformation of solar energy to sugar does from theory this is consistent with applying eq 3 to different individuals for the same though variable t values and the same t g values but with distinct values of t g as long as each tree follows eq 3 the ratio of their heights will be the ratio of their t g values if height growth for both trees ceases at the same time the ratio of their final heights will also be the same value of course there is individual variability not accounted for by such a formula i e the loss of height of a sapling caused by a branch falling from another tree clark and clark 2001 such cases were omitted thus water fluxes available to trees should be equally relevant in determining both their growth rates and final heights here we highlight examples of how transpiration growth and stand structure are phenomenologically related to eq 1 or eq 2 we also address how tree growth rates relate to eq 3 in each of the subsections below we will address the role of total water transport in helping to predict plant growth except for the first two the actual time dependence is neglected where the time dependence is neglected the height of either the dominant or the typical trees accessed is given along a gradient in some quantity i e soil hydrophobicity climate curvature that can be related quantitatively or semi quantitatively to the transpiration where the time dependence is included explicitly we seek either pore scale flow rates or total transpiration values that are appropriate to the comparison for the entire meta data set in the first case investigated this corresponds to a range of relevant flow rates across climate zones for the exceptionally fast growing trees in the second case the transpiration value used is the largest documented by box et al 1989 here as elsewhere hunt and manzoni 2016 we note that the predictive capability of eq 1 or eq 2 for tree height breaks down at larger time scales from 30 years to 100 years one limiting factor is the hydraulic limit koch et al 2004 of about 125 m however rapidly growing trees may approach the canopy in a much shorter time frame and we suggest that the chief limitation on growth for trees that have neared or exceeded the canopy is likely not the influence of the physical characteristics of the medium on the roots but can be a combination of many factors such as wind lightning or co adaptation to regional characteristics reducing advantages of greater heights 4 results implications of the phenomenological model in this section we address a number of published studies where our model of tree growth may find support as no investigations were actually conducted with the purpose of testing our specific model though some investigators indeed investigated related hypotheses we cannot in general exclude ambiguity of understanding a model of the tree growth nevertheless the evidence compiled appears to relate to our predictions with regard to both the temporal and transpiration dependences of the tree growth rate 4 1 cumulative growth as a function of time our first comparison fig 1 is with an entire meta data set baad falster et al 2015 the data give plant heights over periods of weeks to roughly a century for a range of plant species and climates in accord with eq 1 we use bounds on the typical pore scale water flux bounds across climate zones from about 240 mm yr to 20 m yr to account for the variability of the entire meta data set for plant heights and ages over the time period of record hunt and manzoni 2016 attributing the major variability to flow rates rather than directly to the plant xylem characteristics we use for all the data the same length scale chosen equal to a geometric mean xylem diameter of about 10 µm a range of xylem diameters from 1 µm to 100 µm is given by watt et al 2006 the value of 20 m yr is roughly consistent with a maximum precipitation 10 m divided by a typical porosity of about 0 4 at the shortest time scales measurements for root tip extension rates are accessed and at time scales larger than hundreds of years it is the rre associated with large clones as evidenced by the existence of surface shoots and confirmed by genetic comparison at intermediate time scales the comparison was with tree heights in comparison with baad the growing season representation eq 2 provides a more transparent standard using for a growing season t g 0 5 yr and a range of transpirations 20 mm namibian desert seeley 1978 to a maximum of 1650 mm t g tropical savannahs and rainforests box et al 1989 generates essentially the same range of plant heights as a function of time as the pore scale flow rates above and equally bounds hunt et al 2017 the heights of woody plants falster et al 2015 as a function of time from time scales of weeks to hundreds of years 4 2 comparison with populus deltoides and eucalyptus regnans here by comparing data with eq 2 we address height growth of two specific species within an optimal environment for growth this allows choice of a single transpiration value rather than a range of transpiration values populus deltoides and eucalyptus regnans may be the two fastest growing tree species in the world over a period of decades fig 2 provides a comparison of predictions using eq 2 with the upper limit of tg 1 65 m with specific tree height and age data for deltoides taken from johnson and burkhardt 1976 and for regnans from van der meer et al 1999 p j 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 and givnish et al 2014 note that 1 65 m is roughly equal to the total precipitation between 1 5 m yr and 2 m yr australian bureau of meteorology 2015 in the region of australia where e regnans grows most rapidly but this tree species is known to take advantage of virtually all the water available to it the populus deltoides individuals were measured in the mississippi flood plain in years following floods that removed all vegetation thus these measurements likely detected transpiration values near an upper known limit for eucalyptus regnans with xylem diameter of 200 µm petit et al 2010 using eq 2 yields the corresponding pore scale flow velocity of 0 76 µm s for populus deltoides with xylem diameter 37 µm the same calculation yields 1 1 µm s bloeschl and sivapalan 1996 present a figure showing a typical pore scale flow velocity of ca 1 µm s both inferred values are also in line with the median hydraulic conductivity for soils about 1 µm s freeze and cherry 1979 clapp and hornberger 1978 these values correspond to yearly pore scale fluxes 30 m yr similar to the climatic maximum values of 20 m yr given above for both comparisons simultaneously we used a fundamental length scale of 100 µm very close to the geometric mean of 87 µm a second comparison is with data from walsh et al 2008 for which the authors provided a portion of the cumulative height growth curves fig 3 4 3 comparison with growth rates of eucalyptus according to eq 3 tree growth rates should not be constant in time as assumed in allometric scaling e g enquist et al 1998 b j 2007 but correspond to a small negative power a distinction which should be readily distinguished when comparing with real data the purpose here is dual 1 to establish which relationship is more nearly in accord with data trends and 2 to see whether the coefficients assumed for assessing the cumulative height growth as a function of time in the previous section also generate reasonable explicit predictions for the growth rate as a function of time when assuming a growing season of 6 months and an upper limit on transpired water of around 1650 mm box et al 1989 predictions by eq 3 compare well with observed growth rates for rapidly growing tree species such as eucalyptus regnans sequoia sempervirens sequoiadendron giganteum or metasequoia glyptostroboides fig 4 hunt and manzoni 2016 based on publications by enquist et al 1998 b j 2007 showed that existing constant growth rate predictions from allometric scaling underestimate short term growth rates by a factor of 10 note that like eq 2 the growth rate given by eq 3 does not hold indefinitely for tree height though it appears to do so for the rre of clones hunt 2017 where its predictions generate the size of aspen spruce seagrass as well as growth rates of armillaria fungi and other underground root systems of clonal bodies out to length scales of 10 km over 100 000 years when individuals reach the height of the canopy the competition for light no longer dominates and growth slows more precipitously or ceases hunt and manzoni 2016 further there appears to be a physiological limit of about 125 m on the height of trees due to hydraulic limitations such as cavitation koch et al 2004 the latter limit is visible in the baad database in fig 1 and the former is evident for populus deltoides in fig 2 4 4 evaluation of the growing rate of the same tree species in different geographic regions we evaluated the growing rate of the same tree species in different geographic regions using proxy variables of climate substrate type soil or rock soil characteristics slope curvature slope aspect and tree hydraulic conductivity along a rainfall gradient in southeastern australia givnish et al 2012 demonstrate that the heights of the tallest individuals of e regnans are linearly proportional to the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration et 0 since the transect studied was mostly at equal latitudes with roughly uniform et 0 a budyko 1958 1974 representation of et et 0 implies that et may be approximately substituted for p though the fraction of et represented by transpiration may vary more significantly we found that growth curves of eucalyptus in various locations conform to our scaling prediction fig 3 and the ratio of tallest tree heights from distinct tree populations at any age is the same compatible with the results of givnish et al 2012 the uncertainty in this comparison stems mainly from the inexact correspondence of the ratio of transpiration to et 0 to the ratio of p to et 0 ryan and yoder 1997 stated on the eastern slope of the cascade mountains in oregon ponderosa pine soar to 50 m 30 km farther east in a drier climate the same species struggles to attain 10 m if soils do not vary significantly and topography is relatively consistent the proposed change in climate is due to lowest order to a contrast in precipitation according to the prism precipitation map of oregon daly et al 1994 the rainfall along the cascade crest ranges from 175 cm yr to 400 cm yr 25 km to the east the rainfall contour is 50 cm yr the ratio is thus constrained to lie between 3 5 1 and 8 1 as measured along the crest from well south of bend or almost to the columbia river a distance of roughly 200 km the geometric mean of 3 5 and 8 is 5 3 a discrepancy of 6 from the ratio 5 of the heights of mature ponderosa pines from just east of the crest to 25 km further east the arithmetic mean is 5 75 only 15 off the observed ratio oberhuber et al 1998 studied the response of tree growth to dryness response function analysis indicates that at most sites wide rings are significantly associated with high precipitation in april to june and cool conditions in may of the current year limited water availability causes a homogeneous relationship of radial tree growth to climate at all habitats though site characteristics slope magnitude slope aspect soil depth vegetation cover differ substantially cool conditions in late spring reduce water loss to direct evaporation with the associated tendency therefore to increase transpiration by allometric scaling arguments enquist et al 1998 b j 2007 increased diameters correlate strongly with increased tree height implying that increased transpiration increases height growth murphy and lugo 1986 indicated that in tropical forests with precipitation between 500 mm and 2000 mm per year geometric mean 1000 mm tree heights ranged from 10 m to 40 m geometric mean of 20 m and tree growth at 1 yr from 1 m to 3 m geometric mean 1 7 m but in tropical forests with greater than 2000 mm precipitation per year roughly twice as great the tree heights varied from 20 m to 84 m geometric mean 41 m and the growth at 1 yr from 2 m to 5 m geometric mean 3 2 m as precipitation increases by a factor 2 so do growth at one year a factor 1 88 and the final tree heights a factor 2 05 the general conclusions are independent of comparison scheme arithmetic or geometric mean two data points or three though the exact numbers will vary of course these authors cited such a wide spread in values because their work was a meta study reviewing many separate studies 4 5 effect of substrate soil or rock trees growing on bare rock present an unusual sight normally crevices can be located which the trees have exploited for their roots yet even where crevices serve as root pathways the growth of such trees is typically stunted is this also a product of a reduced transpiration ryan and yoder 1997 state in particular that in the front range of the colorado rocky mountains a seed from a 25 m tall ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa may fall into a rocky crevice and never grow more than 1 2 m the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity of unconsolidated sediments at http www aqtesolv com aquifer tests aquifer properties htm with source domenico and schwartz 1990 is 1 35 10 7 m s the geometric mean for each sediment type calculated from its maximum and minimum value the overall geometric mean calculated over the seven sediment types given likewise for sedimentary and crystalline rocks but the geometric mean of all the sedimentary rock values cited is 3 03 10 9 m s smaller by a factor of 44 contrarily the geometric mean for crystalline rock types is 1 63 10 7 m s slightly larger than for unconsolidated sediments however this sampling includes permeable basalt and fractured rocks with high permeability due to fractures since it is primarily the rock matrix from which transpired water must come these two categories should be excluded as high fracture permeability transports water away from roots excluding those two categories the ratio of the geometric mean of unconsolidated sediments to crystalline rock hydraulic conductivity is 7 the geometric mean of 44 and 7 is 18 the ratio of 25 m to 1 m 2 m 0 5 is also 18 thus a reasonable ratio of hydraulic conductivities for permeability limited flow is the ratio of observed heights which is consistent with attributing growth variability to variability in permeability limited transpiration significantly freeze and cherry 1979 report nearly the same spreads of hydraulic conductivity values as quoted above thus trees grow faster and taller on soil than on rock because of its higher hydraulic conductivity and consequent greater transpiration 4 6 effect of soil characteristics hydrophobicity russel and woolhouse 2012 investigated variability in the height of sequoia sempervirens along a soil characteristic gradient near cape mendocino california usa our assertion that hydrophobicity may constrain water uptake and thus growth contrasts with that of the authors who attribute the variation in growth to variable soil chemistry evinced by the ph gradient trees grow shorter on more acidic soils because they are more hydrophobic thus reducing water fluxes our interpretation is based on the reported correlation between hydrophobicity and soil ph value the authors state the youngest terrace vi has well drained soils rich in organic matter and nutrients the older i e i iii terraces where pygmy forest s are found contain highly acidic extremely podzolized soils with a hydrophobic hardpan however the authors do not report hydraulic conductivity at their site making it necessary to find data for broadly analogous conditions while the quoted range of ph values correlates well with height soil ph correlates equally strongly with hydrophobicity lozano et al 2013 lower ph values being associated with more hydrophobic soils moreover de bano 1971 concluded horizontal infiltration was 25 times slower in water repellent soil than in wettable soil similarly rowe 1941 found that vertical infiltration was reduced from 8 9 cm hr to 0 304 cm hr by a factor of 29 through periodic chaparral burning a hydrophobicity interpreted by de bano and krammes 2000 as due to coatings of organics on particles both values 25 and 29 are compatible with the ratio 28 of the tree heights in zone vi to that in zone i these growth ratios are similar to the maximum regnans height range 20 as well as the ratio of precipitation to pan evaporation along the rainfall gradient in southeastern australia givnish et al 2014 further wallis et al 1990 found that infiltration rates varied by a factor 6 over a horizontal distance 10 m between strongly and moderately water repellent agricultural himatangi sands this smaller ratio 6 compared with 28 derived from soils differing only in the degree of water repellency and is similar to the height ratio nearly 6 in soils i iii of russel and woolhouse 2012 of course other aspects of podzolization or high acidity may also inhibit growth of redwoods in zones 1 3 compaction tardieu et al 1991 showed that compaction reduced stomatal conductance even though plants on compacted soil showed water relations comparable to those of plants on uncompacted soils reductions in stomatal conductance reduce transpiration e g motzer et al 2005 in accord with kozlowski 1999 who noted that the deleterious effects on the hydraulic properties of soil could be responsible for the diminished plant growth we hypothesize that the stronger dependence of hydraulic conductivity on pore size distributions than that of a characteristic pressure is the likely cause of reduced growth rates of plants on compacted soils thus plants grow more slowly on compacted soils because the reduction in pore sizes strongly inhibits flow 4 7 topography surface curvature plant growth rates should be positively correlated with local topographic curvature particularly in areas with more arid climates because surface run off tends to collect in hollows increasing infiltration and thus also transpiration mcnabb 1989 found that yellow poplar tulipifera liriodendron trees in the southeastern usa averaged 50 m in zones of convergent topography i e valley bottoms but only 35 m in divergent topography ridgetops this distinction may be due to variation in water fluxes entering the soil which provides a limit to water volumes extracted from the soil dunne et al 1991 modeled effects of microtopography on stormwater infiltration in fig 16 these authors showed uniform infiltration rates of about 2 5 cm hr along steeper slopes independent of position but with less steep topography the infiltration rate could increase from 2 5 cm hr along the ridge to over 4 cm hr towards the bottom of the slope a ratio exceeding 1 6 the ratio 50 m 35 m is 1 43 our conclusion is compatible with that of berges et al 2005 although these authors interpreted topographic variability in terms of soil water the effect of topography on site index was consistent with the effect of soil water capacity and concluded that most site index variance was related to local soil factors and corroborated the hypothesis that sessile oak growth was regulated by the combined influence of soil water and nutrient budgets the example regarding slope aspect below shows difficulties in general interpretation in terms of water content however oberhuber and koffler 2000 these authors studied small scale variability in the growth of trees in a water limited montane elevation 750 m region and produced the following table for tree heights of a post glacial rockslide region in a dry valley of the swiss alps tree ages except for k135 92 years were between 105 and 153 years with mean value 125 years and typical variability 15 thus to first order one can neglect age as a primary factor behind variation in tree height sites in hollows and at the toe of the slope have positive curvature plateaus and mid slope near zero curvature ridgetops negative tree height decreases with increasing slope from about 8 m to 6 m for slopes changing from 0 to 50 but r 2 is only 0 15 slope curvature is likely more important since regression not shown of height on curvature index 1 if positive 1 if negative and 0 otherwise has r 2 0 7 here the ratio of maximum to minimum tree heights excluding k137 at the toe of the slope is consistently a factor 2 inclusion of the site at the toe of the slope which will also have a significant positive curvature but intercept even more water increases the ratio further either way 2 is larger than the tree height ratio 1 43 from mcnabb 1989 and the ratio of infiltration rates 1 6 of dunne et al 1991 however the large slopes and slope differences and the proclivity to landslides suggest a greater curvature than observed by mcnabb 1989 or modeled by dunne et al 1991 slope aspect tree growth should be inhibited in the northern hemisphere on southward and westward facing slopes because a greater fraction of et is lost to direct evaporation fekedulegn et al 2003 determined that in a mixed hardwood forest in west virginia at mean elevation about 224 m and with precipitation 130 cm yr there is a strong correlation between the slope aspect and tree height aspect affects the amount and daily cycle of solar radiation received at different times of the year and has a strong influence on the microclimate especially air temperature humidity and soil moisture rosenberg et al al 1983 net radiation on southwestern slopes was 24 higher than on northeastern slopes lee and sypolt 1974 while tree heights of the four species investigated averaged 17 lower on the southwestern slope however the correlation between aspect and soil water content was imperfect although it is generally believed that south facing slopes are drier and soil moisture deficits limit tree growth on these sites a study by lee and sypolt 1974 has shown that in some years available soil moisture was not significantly different by aspect in west virginia even when soil moisture content does not vary across aspect however increased solar radiation impinging on a southwestern slope will increase evaporation if the soil moisture content is unchanged transpiration was less mu et al 2011 showed that worldwide mean evaporation typically makes up 39 of evapotranspiration a mean value obtained also for precipitation about 130 cm yr appropriate to the site mu et al 2011 also state that for temperate deciduous forests evaporation is only 33 of evapotranspiration in the first case the observed increase of 24 would bring evaporation to 48 3 decreasing transpiration from 61 to 51 6 a reduction of 15 quite close to the height reductions for yellow poplar 17 northern red oak 14 and red maple 15 though smaller than for chestnut oak 24 if evaporation is only 33 of evapotranspiration a 24 increase in evaporation would decrease transpiration by only 12 liang et al 2006 studied growth of spruce and junipers at the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau soil depths on east and west facing slopes were the same junipers on the east facing slope reached a height of 10 m but only 8 5 m on the west whereas spruce grew to 14 m on the east and 12 m on the west these authors stated the west facing slope experiences a drier microclimate since it receives more solar radiation and hence stronger evaporation of soil water than the east facing slope rosenberg et al 1983 whether the results match predictions quantitatively is not addressed in this case as there is an even greater lack of relevant information for assessment than in the previous case 4 8 xylem characteristics and plant hydraulic conductivity larger xylem diameters should promote faster growth rates from a reduction in hydraulic resistance and increased transpiration rates zach et al 2010 found in humid environments where trees rarely experience severe soil water limitation the hydraulic system of trees requires a functional architecture for effectively transporting water to the crown despite a comparably low atmospheric evaporative demand for most of the year zach et al 2010 fig 5 digitized from zach et al 2010 demonstrates clear correlation of xylem diameter with tree height in this case the strong dependence of hydraulic conductance on xylem diameter together with minimal soil water limitations implies a strong correlation of growth with tree water transport as well from fan et al 2012 in this study we found xylem anatomical traits were much better predictors of growth rate and stature than wood density which is consistent with their more direct and stronger correlation with hydraulic conductivity hubbard et al 2001 offered as title stomatal conductance and photosynthesis vary linearly with plant hydraulic conductance in ponderosa pine a linear variance of photosynthesis with plant hydraulic conductance i e water transport is consistent with eq 2 which implies a linear dependence of height on transpiration discussion and conclusions a possible application of the present results is to enhanced drought susceptibility of trees in the western continental usa and diminution of water resources the recent increase in drought mortality may be partly due to higher temperatures but it certainly also has a component related to higher tree density brought on by a century of fire suppression at higher densities less water is available per tree drought weakened trees are also more susceptible to pathogens the increased dead tree density is then linked to higher intensity fires with higher risks to encroaching populations any theory capable of predicting both tree growth rates in time and the dependence of npp on transpiration should have relevance to the water balance in a changing environment and thus water resources if one can reliably predict tree growth patterns on the basis of their water consumption it should be possible to analyze patterns of fire tree growth and health and water resources in concert consider that biological productivity has relevance for potential feedbacks to climate change in view of the complex interaction between water resources transpiration and productivity thus increases in productivity due to fire suppression practices should contribute to longer term shallow subsurface water shortages with correspondingly reduced streamflow and greater susceptibility of forests to inter annual to decadal scale climatic fluctuations which according to models should be enhanced in a warming climate making such relationships more predictive should help to discern how tree population changes introduced by suppression are responsible for an increased risk of larger conflagrations as well as how best to reverse impacts of suppression in order to address the specific input of a forest changing with time it is necessary to expand the analysis at the beginning eq 2 for rre and thus also tree height as a function of time yields for t t g rre t g this result is for a single tree and a single growing season and was used equally for individuals as for ecosystems first address complications from advancing age of individual trees and then use this result as a basis to consider entire tree populations using the predicted percolation mass fractal dimensionality in 2d of d f 1 9 hunt 2017 suggested that npp should then be expressed as npp c et 1 9 where c is an as yet unknown constant extended to longer time intervals one can write rre1 9 t g 1 year age years 0 17 1 9 this is a decreasing function of time an additional factor that produces a decrease in time may come from tree thinning with increasing stand age if tree density is inversely proportional to the square of the rre then ecosystem npp is proportional to rre 0 1 producing a diminishing productivity with increasing tree size however in contrast to canopies tree roots may overlap implying that the density may be greater than rre 2 further above ground biomass is likely proportional to a larger power of rre and tree height than root biomass since above ground tree structures are more nearly expressed in 3d than in 2d finally as trees age apportionment of transpiration to various functions changes nevertheless the current analysis is generally compatible with ryan s observation regarding the diminution of productivity of forests with increasing age in the intermountain west suppression of fires tends to allow the growth of younger trees and an increased stand density simultaneously according to the present analysis both the tendency to a higher density of trees and a translation to a younger population should increase both npp and thus et demands increased et will strain water resources and long term water storage while increasing demand during drought all of which would be expected to increase drought susceptibility of trees thus extensions of the present framework to address more fully the specific conditions of the western usa may help to quantify drought stresses in a changing climate and thus assess the magnitudes of risks associated with particular management strategies a single relationship from the scaling of optimal paths from percolation theory accounts for nutrient and transpiration limits on woody plant growth the conceptual bases of this relationship are consistent with inferences of other recent studies e g popova et al 2016 any such spatio temporal scaling relationship relating tree height to its age from germination requires two site specific parameters one a spatial scale and one a temporal scale here the length scale is considered the smaller of the soil pore or plant xylem diameter while the time scale is the ratio of the length scale to the pore scale flow rate since the relationship is a power law its fundamental constants may be referred to larger scales such as a growing season and the transpiration during the growing season the relevance of the transpiration allows reasonable prediction of tree height variability as function of climate substrate soil characteristics including compaction and water repellency and topography slope curvature and aspect while the sublinear power law explains why tree growth slows with age these predictions work quite well across a variety of factors that limit tree growth thus the present results may help formulation of more accurate and general plant growth models and help to understand a number of seemingly unrelated puzzles in the ecology literature but note that a similar hypothesis of hydraulic limitations on tree height was already formulated by ryan and yoder 1997 the relative success of the model suggests that it is not directly the soil water potential or the soil water content that governs growth rates but that water flow and coupled transpiration rate determine plant growth of course rapid increase in hydraulic conductivity of a soil with increasing water content provides an important link between these two variables and the decrease in water potential with increasing water content also makes it easier for plants to draw water from the soil thus the two concepts and their related variables are often well correlated one system studied aspect variations of tree height in pennsylvania showed a clearer correlation between transpiration and tree growth than between soil water content and tree growth while a location may have too much water it is difficult for a tree to transpire too much since excess soil moisture implies water storage that exceeds the capacity of a

24766,consideration of scale is essential when examining structural relationships in forests in this study we present a parameterization of the formind individual based forest model for old growth atlantic lowland rainforest in la selva costa rica results show that the simulated forest reproduces the structural complexity of costa rican rainforest within 2 3 of aboveground biomass values based on comparisons with carbono inventory plot data the costa rica formind simulation was then used to investigate the relationship between canopy height and aboveground biomass agb leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp at different spatial scales 20 20 m 60 60 m 100mx100m the relationship between aboveground biomass and height is of particular importance toward the calibration of various remote sensing products including lidar and radar whereas the lai and gpp relationships are understudied in this context we found that the relationship between all three variables and height varies considerably the relationship is stronger at finer scales and weaker at coarser resolution however in all three comparisons rmse also decreased as scales coarsened with the largest difference shown between 100 m and 10 m resolutions in relating agb to lorey s height r2 decreased by 0 3 rmse decreased by 114 5 mg ha this suggests that a trade off between accuracy and precision exists and further highlights the importance of spatial scale in determining the relatability of forest structure variables 1 introduction the accurate measurement of forest structure variables is essential in understanding forest function at multiple spatial scales forest attributes like aboveground biomass agb are crucial components of studies in global change and carbon cycling chave et al 2003 dixon et

achieved at either the individual tree or the plot level whereas forest attribute variables e g aboveground biomass net primary productivity etc can only be estimated from these direct measurements by applying equations and in some cases through time to calculate rates forest models aid in understanding these relationships between forest structure and other forest variables since the 1970s

in indirect measures such as forest productivity and carbon flux particularly in the tropics where ecosystem complexity is high and the forests themselves are often hard to reach there is a general lack of long term repeated forest inventory datasets this has hindered the advancement in the understanding of the dynamic floral and structural complexities found in these ecosystems over recent decades ibgms have been used to fill this knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms that underlie growth mortality and recruitment within tropical forest ecosystems fischer et al 2016 fischer et

costa rican rainforests are among 25 global biodiversity hotspots that comprise 44 of the world s plant species within 1 4 of the land area myers et al 2000 la selva is a notable exception to the lack of long term datasets that have hampered research efforts elsewhere the core of the research station property was purchased by the organization for tropical studies ots in 1968 and surrounding parcels

100 m these estimate become more reliable but the fine scale details of forest structure cannot taken into account the choice of a suitable spatial scale is an important question especially in remote sensing therefore our study addressed the following research question how does the crucial relationship between canopy height metrics and forest stand biomass agb leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp change at different spatial resolutions this question should be answered by linking extensive field data with a forest model given the substantial knowledge base la selva s rainforest is ideal for examining the use of individual based gap models and the veracity of remote sensing derived structure variables the model formind was applied in the study to reproduce the patterns found in old growth tropical forest at la selva biological station specifically we compared distributions in the number of trees basal area aboveground biomass and the stem size distribution of the modeled forest to that of the la selva forest inventory dataset to ensure that our analysis was not biased by how we defined canopy height we made comparisons based on four standard height definitions including the mean tree height mean lidar derived maximum height rh100 canopy height canopy as defined by kohler and huth p 2010 and mean height weighted by basal area lorey s height in this manuscript we present our three forest variables agb lai and gpp compared to lorey s height the same comparisons to rh100 canopy height and mean tree height can be found in the supplementary appendices 2 methods 2 1 field site description la selva biological station is located in the atlantic lowlands of northeastern costa rica 10 26 n 83 59 w elevation range 37 150 m the 1600 ha site is located at the northwestern edge of 100 000 ha of continuous forest that is comprised of a national park national forests and private reserves clark et al 2013 classified as a tropical wet forest the average daytime temperatures range from 24 7 to 27 1 c la selva receives 3824 mm of rainfall annually with slightly lower rainfall occurring from january to april mcdade et al 1994 one of the most extensively studied rainforest sites in the tropics la selva has 18 0 5 ha forest inventory plots measured annually since 1997 fig 1 the plots are located within old la selva which is bounded to the west by the sarapiquí annex and to the south by braulio carrillo national park these plots follow the anpp aboveground npp measurement methodology developed based on clark and clark 2001 and huston and wolverton 2009 the repeat plots sample old growth forest on the three different site conditions that dominate la selva with 6 plots on each younger oxisol terrace older oxisol plateau older oxisol slope following the carbono description all 18 plots were combined to one dataset representing la selva old growth rainforest for more on plot location and sampling design see d b clark and clark 2000 or the carbono website http www ots ac cr carbonoproject for an in depth explanation of anpp methodology see clark et al 2013 2 2 formind model description for this study we used the forest gap model formind fischer et al 2016 it is an individual and process based model designed especially for tropical forests considering the complex age and size structure with this model it is possible to investigate different forest attributes e g biomass leaf area productivity on user defined spatial and temporal scales the main processes in the model are the establishment of young trees tree mortality tree growth and competition for light and space as with the classic individual based gap models seeding mortality and treefall are stochastic processes that through time lead to a mixed age mixed species forest that reaches a stable equilibrium the biomass growth of each tree is determined on the basis of a carbon balance which includes photosynthesis and respiration aboveground biomass btree mg of a tree is calculated in relation to its stem diameter d m and height htree m by 1 b t r e e π 4 d 2 h t r e e f ρ σ whereby the calculation simply represents the volume of the tree stem according to its geometry multiplied by three factors which describe the biomass content more concisely fischer et al 2016 the form factor f accounts for deviations of the stem from a cylindrical shape the parameter ρ mg m3 is the wood density and the parameter σ represents the fraction of total aboveground biomass attributed to the stem tree height htree m of a tree relates to its stem diameter d m by 2 h t r e e h 0 d h 1 where h0 and h1 are species specific parameters the sum of the biomass of all trees within a certain area gives the biomass of a forest stand in formind tree growth is determined by a closed biomass balance which is calculated for each tree depending on its photosynthesis and respiration fischer et al 2016 3 δ b 1 r g p t r e e r m where rg is a factor for growth respiration and rm the maintenance respiration the photosynthesis ptree of each tree is calculated depending on the shading and its geometry fischer et al 2016 as 4 p t r e e p m a x k ln α k i i n d p m a x 1 m α k i i n d e k l a i p m a x 1 m where α is the quantum efficiency also known as the initial slope of the light response curve and pmax is the maximum leaf gross photosynthetic rate the light extinction coefficient is k m represents the transmission coefficient and iind denotes the available incoming irradiance on top of the tree the sum of ptree for all trees gives gpp of the forest stand finally the lai m2 m2 can be calculated per tree as the one sided leaf area per unit of crown projection area i e the individual s leaf area index this individual tree lai relates functionally to its stem diameter d cm by 5 l a i l 0 d l 1 where l0 and l1 are type specific parameters fischer et al 2016 the simulated forest area is divided into 20 20 m patches according to the typical size of tree fall gaps however because these traits are calculated on an individual tree basis the 20 m patches can be downscaled or upscaled according to the desired study area tree species with similar traits were grouped into plant functional types pft according to physiological attributes such as maximum attainable height and light requirements fischer et al 2018 a detailed description of the model can be found in fischer et al 2016 for this study we parameterized formind for the la selva old growth forest amalgamating plot data collected across the three dominant site conditions mentioned in the previous section it is important to note that not all formind model parameters could be derived from the available carbono dataset and from the literature where la selva specific data was not available general parameters for rainforests for this region barro colorado island for example were used see appendix b a general formind model description and the species grouping for la selva can be found in appendix a a full listing of model parameters both calculated from carbono and found in literature as well as calibration metrics can be found in appendix b 2 3 model parameterization and species grouping the forest inventory 18 plot dataset representing the old growth forest in la selva measured from 1997 through 2012 was downloaded from the carbono website this dataset included species where known and dbh for each individual tree within the plot measured annually maximum tree height per species was estimated from separate carbono data that included tree heights per some focal species but was not included in the inventory plot dataset clark and clark 1992 2001 r o dubayah et al 2010 and king and clark 2011 we calculated formind parameters from maximum diameter growth increments per species and maximum dbh from years 1997 to 2005 and 2005 to 2012 based on maximum dbh and diameter growth increment as calculated from the carbono dataset the 190 species were grouped into six plant functional types pfts a listing of this grouping can be found in appendix a see table a 3 for each of the six pfts we then calculated based on carbono dataset the following variables stem counts aboveground biomass average diameter growth increment and mortality a list of species group parameters can be found in table 1 below 2 4 model calibration when the model parameters were calculated and entered into the formind parameter file simulations were run to calibrate some unknown parameter values see above section we performed a manual calibration to optimize a subsequent auto calibration the manual calibration was accomplished by running the model 250 times systematically changing a few unknown parameters in small increments to achieve the best simulation of the study site forest see lehmann and huth 2015 seed production and establishment of seedlings were high priority calibration variables as there was little information in the literature and we relied on general values for the tropics in addition mortality and light response curves were also optimized when the manual calibration for each of these variables determined ideal ranges for each pft remaining unknown parameters were numerically calibrated e g global number of seeds with a calibration process by comparing the aboveground biomass species composition and tree density of a simulated mature forest with field data from the study region following lehmann and huth 2015 the parameterization was then verified by comparison of stem numbers per diameter size classes aboveground biomass basal area and other structural variables see fig 3 in results 2 5 simulation settings we analyzed forest succession over 1000 years starting with bare ground conditions in order to ensure that the simulation encompassed the full life history of the rainforest to assess the full structural variability in the forest model we simulated forest stands with a size of 16 hectares first for a comparison of the model output with field data we calculated the mean of simulated forest attributes over the last 300 1000 years based on the assumption that the forest is in the equilibrium state for this entire period in particular we included aboveground biomass basal area and stem numbers for trees with a dbh greater than 10 cm second we analyzed the relationship between lorey s height and agb lai and gpp at four different resolutions 10 m 20 m 50 m 100 m all simulated forest stands between simulation years 300 to 1000 were aggregated into one large dataset the dataset was then divided into 10 m plots 20 m plots 50 m plots and 100 m plots in order to collect the height variables and the agb lai and gpp at each of the resolutions for comparison the agb lai and gpp were recorded per varied plot size e g 10 m 20 m 50 m and 100 m and then scaled to a per hectare measurement in order to avoid biasing our comparisons with uneven numbers of data points between each of the resolutions 8000 random plot data points were collected for each of the variables at each resolution similar methodologies have been undertaken by mascaro et al 2012 and knapp et al 2018 for the forest height calculation we investigated four different common height definitions including mean tree height mean maximum height as also derived by lidar rh100 canopy height canopy and lorey s height the mean tree height is the average of all tree heights with dbh 10 cm within the plot size 10 m to 100 m the maximum height is the height of the tallest tree within the plot canopy height is the mean of all tree heights within the canopy as defined by kohler and huth p 2010 lorey s height is the basal area weighted average tree height of trees in the plot lorey 1878 3 results 3 1 forest model vs field data to test the parameterization for la selva rainforest we compared simulated basal area aboveground biomass and stem numbers to forest inventory data scaled to one hectare forest height was also compared to kellner et al s 2009 findings see appendix b comparisons were made on the level of pft we found that when the forest reaches equilibrium after year 200 large intermediate trees pft 2 are dominant followed by large shade tolerant trees pft 1 shade intolerant pft 3 sub canopy shade tolerant pft 4 sub canopy intermediate pft 5 and understory shade tolerant pft 6 trees together make up only about 5 of the total forest aboveground biomass there is an initial large increase of biomass with the colonization by pioneer shade intolerant trees pft 3 cf fig 3c shade intermediate trees pft 2 quickly compete with shade intolerant trees followed by shade tolerant canopy pft 1 shade tolerant sub canopy trees pft 4 and intermediate sub canopy trees pft 5 as the shade tolerant pft 1 canopy shade tolerant sub canopy pft 4 and intermediate sub canopy pft 5 trees colonize the understory ca year 40 shade intolerant trees reach maturity and quickly decline in numbers and biomass by year 200 of the simulated forest life history the forest reaches a stable equilibrium fig 3a 3c intermediate canopy and emergent trees make up the dominant proportion of biomass 61 6 followed by shade tolerant canopy and emergent trees 24 3 shade tolerant sub canopy trees pft4 account for about 7 0 of the total aboveground biomass the remaining plant functional type groups pft 3 pft 5 and pft 6 are responsible for only a small percentage of the aboveground biomass 8 4 in comparing field data to the simulation aboveground biomass for the simulated forest was ca 200 megagrams of organic try matter per ha mgodm ha which was 2 3 lower than observed in the field data 204 61 mg ha fig 3d the model slightly underestimates aboveground biomass for pft 1 and overestimates for pft 4 1 for each the total basal area of the forest was slightly underestimated by formind with values of 20 5 m2 ha compared to 21 5 m2 ha measured in the actual forest fig 3b also underestimated was basal area of pft2 which had the largest biomass of all the pfts and accounted for most of the total difference 11 3 m2 ha simulated compared with 12 3 m2 ha field measured the simulated basal area for pft4 was the only overestimation by the model it accounted for 14 1 of the total simulated basal area as compared to 12 3 of the total la selva measured basal area basal area of pfts 1 and 3 were exactly the same when comparing simulated and measured values while pfts 5 and 6 were underestimated by the model with differences of 0 33 m2 ha and 0 16 m2 ha respectively a detailed evaluation of stem number distributions can be found in appendix b 3 2 forest height vs aboveground biomass in the forest structure analysis comparing four measures of height to aboveground biomass averaged at four different plot resolutions we found that the relationship was weaker at larger scales but the strength of the relationship also depends on the height definition the comparison of maximum height rh100 and canopy height to agb at 10mx10m plot resolution both had the overall strongest relationship see appendix c with each of the height definitions used in our study the relationship with agb was best described using a power law function for the relationship between biomass and height on the 10 m scale the r2 values for mean height rh100 canopy height and lorey s height was found to be 0 6 0 91 0 91 and 0 83 respectively detailed results for the rh100 canopy height and mean height correlations with agb are found in appendix c when lorey s height is compared to agb at 20 20 m resolution fig 4 b the predictive capability of the agb height relationship decreases to an r2 of 0 70 this decreasing trend continues at coarser resolutions r2 decreases at the 50 m resolution to 0 59 and 0 54 at 100 m resolution fig 4 c 4 d conversely the rmse of the lorey s height agb relationship improves drastically as the resolution coarsens from 135 3 mg ha at 10 m resolution to 15 9 mg ha at 100 m resolution this inverse relationship between r2 and rmse is explained by the behavior of the plots in fig 4 a d at the 10 m resolution fig 4 a the points spread throughout the entire height range of the equation that is produced by the best fit line however the distances of the points to the best fit line rmse is overall much larger than the distances of the points to the 100 m resolution best fit line fig 4 d which does not extend over the full range of lorey s height 3 3 forest height vs leaf area index lai we compared how lai varies among the four measures of canopy height at different plot scales fig 5 lorey s height related best to lai at the 10 m resolution r2 0 75 with decreasing r2 values as the plot size increased to 100 m 0 27 as with agb the r2 values decrease with increasing resolution coarseness however with lai the strength of the relationship decreases more rapidly indeed at 20 m plot resolution the r2 value is 0 52 and the relationship between lai and lorey s height at 50 m and 100 m resolutions cannot be considered meaningful 0 35 and 0 27 respectively when lorey s height is compared to lai the rmse also decreases with coarsening resolution from 0 8 to 0 1 lai is commonly defined as the maximum projected leaf area per unit ground surface this inherently includes all leaf material from the top of the canopy downward through the vertical leaf profile so it necessitates a height measure that is reflective of the top height of the plot canopy which is a possible source of error with respect to fit of the relationship mixed heterogeneous forests like that of la selva have a large variation in lai values when measured at fine scales variation that would be averaged out at large plot scales an in depth comparison of each of the different height measurements to lai at each plot resolution is found in appendix d 3 4 forest height vs gross primary productivity gpp the relationship between simulated height and gross primary productivity gpp is also best described using a power law function as shown in fig 6 ryan et al 1994 measured gpp in la selva to be around 50 mg ha year which is in the same order as our simulated gpp values 40 mg ha year the correlation of lorey s height to gpp was most clear at the highest resolution with r2 values of 0 78 at 10 m resolution and 0 61 at 20 m resolution at the 50 m resolution however the correlation was weaker and had an r2 of 0 5 and was most weak when measured at the 100 m resolution r2 0 43 as with the abg and lai comparisons the rmse of the lorey s height to gpp relationship decrease with increasing plot size at the 10 m plot resolution rmse is 20 05 mg ha but decreases by almost half for each successive plot size from 12 07 mg ha at 20 m plot resolution to 5 17 mg ha at 50 m plot resolution and 2 63 mg ha at 100 m plot resolution the comparisons of each of the different height measurements to gpp at each plot resolution is found in appendix e 3 5 error the root mean squared error rmse was calculated for each correlation at all scales and for each height definition as shown in appendix f in all correlations rmse was highest at 10 m resolution and decreased as the resolution coarsened to 100 m when the rmse and r2 values were plotted for each resolution the high rmse values declined sharply between 10 m and 20 m resolution whereas the r2 values decreased less sharply see appendix c d e and f figures these differences in values between resolutions and the directionality of their trends suggest that though the data at the smallest resolutions is the noisiest their r2 high value indicates the ranges of points fit best the power equation 4 discussion overall our study shows that the strength of the height to agb lai and gpp relationships are the best at the smaller spatial scales however this comes with an increase in error at coarser scales the error becomes smaller but the relationship between the forest variables become less precise fig 1a using formind model simulations helped to quantify this trade off between accuracy and precision across the plot resolutions toward informing the initial research question of how does the crucial relationship between canopy height metrics and forest stand biomass agb leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp change at different spatial resolutions relating height variables to this study s focal productivity variables is best at the scale of a very small plot given that the average width of the crown of a canopy emergent tree in la selva rainforests typically exceeds 10 m in diameter king and clark 2011 obrien et al 1995 and the 10 m plots size revealed the largest rmse across each of the compared variables a plot size of 20 m affords the most reliable and robust comparison data from la selva forest inventory plots was used to successfully create a parameterization of the formind model this parameterization is the first for this specific type of fine scaled individual and process based gap model for la selva biological station that includes fine scale structural realism the dataset used to parameterize formind for la selva is exceptional compared to many tropical rainforest datasets in terms of longevity and replication only a handful of other tropical rainforest sites e g barro colorado island panama and paracou french guiana within this region have a similar study area inventoried and are repeated over decades given the robustness of the inventory data in situ measurement error is not likely the source of any significant model parameterization uncertainty it is more likely that the main source of uncertainty with respect to the discrepancies found between the simulated forest and the inventory dataset is due to uncertainties in grouping the la selva species into plant functional types and due to prominence of palms and other growth forms in general that are not simulated by formind similarly using the maximum diameter growth increment could result in a few placement errors for example a rarely occurring shade tolerant tree species that is released from canopy suppression might have a large maximum diameter growth increment for a short period of time that more closely resembles a shade intolerant pioneer species and would result in an uncharacteristically high maximum diameter growth increment for that particular species over the timespan that was used to calculate it either of these scenarios could have resulted in a few of the less common tree species being placed into incorrect pfts ideally the modeled forest should be compared to a validation dataset in order to more thoroughly investigate the causes of uncertainty as presented in fischer et al 2016 and also in rodig et al e 2018 the formind model has been shown to be a useful tool in studies that aim to understand relationships between numerous forest structure variables and other measurable ecosystem functions including forest biomass and forest productivity we used the costa rican formind model to investigate how four definitions of tree height vary with agb lai and gpp at plot resolutions as was shown by the simulation results height is relatable to agb lai and gpp using a power law in costa rican rainforest a taller forest has higher aboveground biomass more leaves and thus a higher lai and is overall more productive then smaller stands though the relationship varied with resolution the simulated lai was comparable to values found by clark et al 2008 in their study directly measuring lai across numerous plant functional groups in la selva biological station their study found a total lai of 6 for old growth forest however the total included lianas palms herbaceous climbers herbs ferns and epiphytes as formind includes only trees greater than 10 cm dbh it compares well to the mean lai for trees only which was measured to be 3 29 by clark et al 2008 and 3 30 4 79 median by loedscher et al h w 2003 one study by tang et al in 2012 which created vertical lai profiles from canopy waveform lidar lvis and a radiative transfer model gort found slightly higher forest lai values when subtracting out the non tree forest constituents the lai in this study is consistent within a reasonable range of all three existing studies the values for gpp as calculated by the model output are also congruent with the literature h w loescher et al 2003 calculated gross ecosystem productivity gep values between 28 4 and 30 6 from tower measurements taken in 1998 and 1999 respectively luyssaert et al 2007 reported a gpp value of 35 5 1 60 tcha 1yr 1 for tropical humid evergreen forest in a study comparing gpp across forest types this study highlights the capability of individual based modeling as the appropriate model platform to investigate forest structure and scale directly our study did not attempt to define the best height definition to use because different height definitions are widely accepted among forest ecologists and across the different remote sensing platforms see appendices instead we sought to understand how fine scale characterization of height is more accurate than at coarser scales while fine scale measurements tend to add some noise overall they provided a clearer picture of height with less error in addition canopy height rh100 and then lorey s height tended to relate best to aboveground biomass leaf area index and gross primary productivity respectively advances in remote sensing data processing have facilitated calibration of variables of interest with forest inventory plot datasets for scaling to landscape level estimations of aboveground biomass and carbon flux baccini et al 2012 saatchi et al 2011a morel et al 2011 additionally many of the recent change maps of agb and carbon flux rely on classification and calibration of remotely sensed datasets with measured or leveraged fine scale forest structure ground truth data points asner et al 2009 hansen et al 2013 hansen et al 2016 hudak et al 2012 remote sensing approaches are among the solutions for a large scale systematic vegetation monitoring though they are often limited by sensor footprint in these applications typically in situ field inventory measurements are used to calibrate the remote sensing dataset but due to the lack of data temporal coverage and long term monitoring plots constitute only a snapshot of the forest and are constrained to imagery collected during the same time period or risk introduction of additional uncertainty with the advancement of super computing and cloud based processors scaling of high resolution datasets across landscapes has never been easier it is therefore crucial to gain knowledge of how to minimize error and uncertainty when applying high resolution datasets across landscapes particularly in the tropics where aboveground biomass is based largely on broad allometric relationships calculated from stem diameters and wood density chave et al 2014 chave et al 2005 chave et al 2004 error estimates are often higher than in temperate forests for which allometric equations are more robust malhi et al 1999 ketterings et al 2001 chave et al 2004 this study also highlights the importance of realizing and accounting for the differences of measuring forest structure using top down versus bottom up approaches in meyer et al s 2013 study using repeated lidar lvis and drl to detect tropical forest biomass dynamics across the same la selva study site they found a reduction of error and uncertainty rmse as resolution coarsened tree height is an important forest structure variable that can be both directly measured in situ and obtained remotely as canopy height using various methods with lidar and radar interferometry popescu 2007 hyde et al 2007 lefsky et al 2005 zheng et al 2004 dubayah et al 1997 either directly measured from the ground up during forest inventories or calculated through allometric equations tree height has become widely used as a predictor of aboveground biomass as well as other indirectly measured forest variables this study also highlights the importance of realizing and accounting for the differences of measuring forest structure using top down versus bottom up approaches canopy height in addition to other vertical canopy variables relating top of the canopy to the ground have been used to characterize vertical structure across numerous forest types from the top down drake et al 2002 dubayah et al 1997 2000 blair et al 1999 lefsky et al 1999 weishampel et al 1996 as noted by kohler and huth p 2010 the height of the canopy in forests is a key variable which can be obtained using air or space borne remote sensing techniques such as radar interferometry or lidar the wide variety of sensors has greatly increased resolution over the past decades for example most lidar footprints range in diameter including lvis 25 m uavsar 6 m in 100kmx20km transects gedi 20 m and icesat 60 m aboard glas however recently some sensors have even higher resolution e g g liht with its 1 m resolution cook et al 2013 various studies set in tropical ecosystems have successfully used remote sensing to characterize forest structure variables e g r o dubayah et al 2010 potter et al 2009 frolking et al 2009 garrigues et al 2008 and by application of plot data to infer regional estimates of agb forest characterization e g malhi et al 2006 saatchi et al 2007 according to drake et al 2002 because many remote sensing studies estimate forest biomass using empirical correlations of energy and different wavelengths the approach and sensors are sensitive to biomass changes in relatively young forests but tend to saturate and become less predictable in older growth and heterogeneous forests in meyer et al s 2013 study using repeated lidar lvis and drl to detect tropical forest biomass dynamics across the same la selva study site they found a reduction of error and uncertainty rmse as resolution coarsened from 10 m x 10 m plots to 100 m x 100 m plots this difference in findings can be accounted for in two fundamental ways first meyer et al used a pixel based approach with a 1 m fixed resolution chm which was averaged to the target pixel size from 0 4 ha to 10 ha our study uses height values based on individual trees within a plot whereby the plot heights were obtained according to which trees grew in a given plot during a given year with the size of the plot varying from 0 01 ha to 1 ha essentially the resolution of our chm was variable and congruous to plot resolution second our study is more theoretical we used a sampling approach to construct our analyses so that an equal number of points was plotted regardless of the resolution this was done to ensure that our analysis was not subjected to sample bias in comparing plots with an unequal number of points between resolutions influencing the fit of the relationship r2 or the error rmse 5 conclusion individual based models like formind can be used to further the capabilities of remote sensing through modeling applications aimed at drawing empirical relationships at scales that are too fine to be measured with sensors but that could be scaled up to be applied in remote sensing studies the results of our study can shed light on why forest height cannot accurately predict aboveground biomass at coarser scales when measuring from the ground up we show that regardless of how height is defined the empirical relationship breaks down when trees are scaled to 60 meter and 100 meter plots because lidar and radar interferometry are well suited to determine forest height from the top down there exists a natural synergism with individual based models like formind however because of the difference in methodology with which high resolution models and remote sensing methods obtain height metrics it is important to consider and resolve resolution where possible when the height is based on per tree values the accuracy of prediction of agb lai and gpp is higher but there is a trade off with precision with respect to high resolution modeling the aim should therefore be to first define the intended error margins then scale the resolution of the study accordingly

24766,consideration of scale is essential when examining structural relationships in forests in this study we present a parameterization of the formind individual based forest model for old growth atlantic lowland rainforest in la selva costa rica results show that the simulated forest reproduces the structural complexity of costa rican rainforest within 2 3 of aboveground biomass values based on comparisons with carbono inventory plot data the costa rica formind simulation was then used to investigate the relationship between canopy height and aboveground biomass agb leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp at different spatial scales 20 20 m 60 60 m 100mx100m the relationship between aboveground biomass and height is of particular importance toward the calibration of various remote sensing products including lidar and radar whereas the lai and gpp relationships are understudied in this context we found that the relationship between all three variables and height varies considerably the relationship is stronger at finer scales and weaker at coarser resolution however in all three comparisons rmse also decreased as scales coarsened with the largest difference shown between 100 m and 10 m resolutions in relating agb to lorey s height r2 decreased by 0 3 rmse decreased by 114 5 mg ha this suggests that a trade off between accuracy and precision exists and further highlights the importance of spatial scale in determining the relatability of forest structure variables 1 introduction the accurate measurement of forest structure variables is essential in understanding forest function at multiple spatial scales forest attributes like aboveground biomass agb are crucial components of studies in global change and carbon cycling chave et al 2003 dixon et

achieved at either the individual tree or the plot level whereas forest attribute variables e g aboveground biomass net primary productivity etc can only be estimated from these direct measurements by applying equations and in some cases through time to calculate rates forest models aid in understanding these relationships between forest structure and other forest variables since the 1970s

in indirect measures such as forest productivity and carbon flux particularly in the tropics where ecosystem complexity is high and the forests themselves are often hard to reach there is a general

of long term datasets that have hampered research efforts elsewhere the core of the research station property was purchased by the organization for tropical studies ots in 1968 and surrounding parcels were purchased into the early 1990s to form the current 1536 ha protected area there exist much knowledge about the history of human intervention and inhabitance for this region up to 3000 y b p as confirmed by carbon dating buried charcoal mcdade et al 1994 the successional state of the forests within the research area is therefore relatively well known launched in 1996 by d a clark d b clark and s f oberbauer the carbono project has carried out annual forest measurements in 18 0 5 ha plots located across the biological station including relatively fertile flat sites on old alluvial soils infertile flat sites on ridge tops and infertile steep slopes d b clark and clark 2000 additionally studies scaling structural dynamics and productivity to the landscape level utilizing techniques combining long term plot data remote sensing and forest modeling have contributed to an in depth knowledge of la selva s rainforest drake et al 2002 dubayah r o 2010 hurtt 2004 tang 2012 drake et al 2002 validated the use of a large scale footprint lidar lvis to capture forest structure variables across multiple landcover types including pasture secondary and primary tropical forests lvis metrics were able to predict field derived quadratic mean stem diameter basal area and agb similarly r o dubayah et al 2010 and tang et al 2012 used lvis to detect changes in canopy structure over la selva between 1998 and 2005 by relating observed changes in canopy height other height metrics and biomass to field derived changes dubayah and vertical transects of leaf area index tang hurtt et al 2004 used airborne lidar observations to initialize the ecosystem demography model their results produced 1ha resolution biomass maps that showed increased model prediction accuracy when initialized with lvis and compared findings to known forest types within la selva utilizing a higher resolution modeling framework e g ibgms provides the potential for directly connecting with high resolution remotely sensed datasets at a user defined scale with the advances of supercomputer capabilities during the last decade igbms are poised to not only be initialized with high resolution remote sensing datasets as with hurtt et al s study but to produce maps that broaden the spatial and temporal scale from existing satellite imagery with unprecedented accuracy however when using satellite imagery field based studies and igbms to answer scientific questions it is important to consider the spatial scale at which each operates as well as how each measures structure variables it is not yet fully understood how strongly forest structure correlates with other desired forest variables e g agb and how strong the influence of the spatial scale is on this relationship on a finer scale e g 20 m the forest structure can be better described but the estimation of forest variables like aboveground biomass becomes very uncertain e g due to edge effects and uncertainties in allometries on coarser scales e g 100 m these estimate become more reliable but the fine scale details of forest structure cannot taken into account the choice of a suitable spatial scale is an important question especially in remote sensing therefore our study addressed the following research question how does the crucial relationship between canopy height metrics and forest stand biomass agb leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp change at different spatial resolutions this question should be answered by linking extensive field data with a forest model given the substantial knowledge base la selva s rainforest is ideal for examining the use of individual based gap models and the veracity of remote sensing derived structure variables the model formind was applied in the study to reproduce the patterns found in old growth tropical forest at la selva biological station specifically we compared distributions in the number of trees basal area aboveground biomass and the stem size distribution of the modeled forest to that of the la selva forest inventory dataset to ensure that our analysis was not biased by how we defined canopy height we made comparisons based on four standard height definitions including the mean tree height mean lidar derived maximum height rh100 canopy height canopy as defined by kohler and huth p 2010 and mean height weighted by basal area lorey s height in this manuscript we present our three forest variables agb lai and gpp compared to lorey s height the same comparisons to rh100 canopy height and mean tree height can be found in the supplementary appendices 2 methods 2 1 field site description la selva biological station is located in the atlantic lowlands of northeastern costa rica 10 26 n 83 59 w elevation range 37 150 m the 1600 ha site is located at the northwestern edge of 100 000 ha of continuous forest that is comprised of a national park national forests and private reserves clark et al 2013 classified as a tropical wet forest the average daytime temperatures range from 24 7 to 27 1 c la selva receives 3824 mm of rainfall annually with slightly lower rainfall occurring from january to april mcdade et al 1994 one of the most extensively studied rainforest sites in the tropics la selva has 18 0 5 ha forest inventory plots measured annually since 1997 fig 1 the plots are located within old la selva which is bounded to the west by the sarapiquí annex and to the south by braulio carrillo national park these plots follow the anpp aboveground npp measurement methodology developed based on clark and clark 2001 and huston and wolverton 2009 the repeat plots sample old growth forest on the three different site conditions that dominate la selva with 6 plots on each younger oxisol terrace older oxisol plateau older oxisol slope following the carbono description all 18 plots were combined to one dataset representing la selva old growth rainforest for more on plot location and sampling design see d b clark and clark 2000 or the carbono website http www ots ac cr carbonoproject for an in depth explanation of anpp methodology see clark et al 2013 2 2 formind model description for this study we used the forest gap model formind fischer et al 2016 it is an individual and process based model designed especially for tropical forests considering the complex age and size structure with this model it is possible to investigate different forest attributes e g biomass leaf area productivity on user defined spatial and temporal scales the main processes in the model are the establishment of young trees tree mortality tree growth and competition for light and space as with the classic individual based gap models seeding mortality and treefall are stochastic processes that through time lead to a mixed age mixed species forest that reaches a stable equilibrium the biomass growth of each tree is determined on the basis of a carbon balance which includes photosynthesis and respiration aboveground biomass btree mg of a tree is calculated in relation to its stem diameter d m and height htree m by 1 b t r e e π 4 d 2 h t r e e f ρ σ whereby the calculation simply represents the volume of the tree stem according to its geometry multiplied by three factors which describe the biomass content more concisely fischer et al 2016 the form factor f accounts for deviations of the stem from a cylindrical shape the parameter ρ mg m3 is the wood density and the parameter σ represents the fraction of total aboveground biomass attributed to the stem tree height htree m of a tree relates to its stem diameter d m by 2 h t r e e h 0 d h 1 where h0 and h1 are species specific parameters the sum of the biomass of all trees within a certain area gives the biomass of a forest stand in formind tree growth is determined by a closed biomass balance which is calculated for each tree depending on its photosynthesis and respiration fischer et al 2016 3 δ b 1 r g p t r e e r m where rg is a factor for growth respiration and rm the maintenance respiration the photosynthesis ptree of each tree is calculated depending on the shading and its geometry fischer et al 2016 as 4 p t r e e p m a x k ln α k i i n d p m a x 1 m α k i i n d e k l a i p m a x 1 m where α is the quantum efficiency also known as the initial slope of the light response curve and pmax is the maximum leaf gross photosynthetic rate the light extinction coefficient is k m represents the transmission coefficient and iind denotes the available incoming irradiance on top of the tree the sum of ptree for all trees gives gpp of the forest stand finally the lai m2 m2 can be calculated per tree as the one sided leaf area per unit of crown projection area i e the individual s leaf area index this individual tree lai relates functionally to its stem diameter d cm by 5 l a i l 0 d l 1 where l0 and l1 are type specific parameters fischer et al 2016 the simulated forest area is divided into 20 20 m patches according to the typical size of tree fall gaps however because these traits are calculated on an individual tree basis the 20 m patches can be downscaled or upscaled according to the desired study area tree species with similar traits were grouped into plant functional types pft according to physiological attributes such as maximum attainable height and light requirements fischer et al 2018 a detailed description of the model can be found in fischer et al 2016 for this study we parameterized formind for the la selva old growth forest amalgamating plot data collected across the three dominant site conditions mentioned in the previous section it is important to note that not all formind model parameters could be derived from the available carbono dataset and from the literature where la selva specific data was not available general parameters for rainforests for this region barro colorado island for example were used see appendix b a general formind model description and the species grouping for la selva can be found in appendix a a full listing of model parameters both calculated from carbono and found in literature as well as calibration metrics can be found in appendix b 2 3 model parameterization and species grouping the forest inventory 18 plot dataset representing the old growth forest in la selva measured from 1997 through 2012 was downloaded from the carbono website this dataset included species where known and dbh for each individual tree within the plot measured annually maximum tree height per species was estimated from separate carbono data that included tree heights per some focal species but was not included in the inventory plot dataset clark and clark 1992 2001 r o dubayah et al 2010 and king and clark 2011 we calculated formind parameters from maximum diameter growth increments per species and maximum dbh from years 1997 to 2005 and 2005 to 2012 based on maximum dbh and diameter growth increment as calculated from the carbono dataset the 190 species were grouped into six plant functional types pfts a listing of this grouping can be found in appendix a see table a 3 for each of the six pfts we then calculated based on carbono dataset the following variables stem counts aboveground biomass average diameter growth increment and mortality a list of species group parameters can be found in table 1 below 2 4 model calibration when the model parameters were calculated and entered into the formind parameter file simulations were run to calibrate some unknown parameter values see above section we performed a manual calibration to optimize a subsequent auto calibration the manual calibration was accomplished by running the model 250 times systematically changing a few unknown parameters in small increments to achieve the best simulation of the study site forest see lehmann and huth 2015 seed production and establishment of seedlings were high priority calibration variables as there was little information in the literature and we relied on general values for the tropics in addition mortality and light response curves were also optimized when the manual calibration for each of these variables determined ideal ranges for each pft remaining unknown parameters were numerically calibrated e g global number of seeds with a calibration process by comparing the aboveground biomass species composition and tree density of a simulated mature forest with field data from the study region following lehmann and huth 2015 the parameterization was then verified by comparison of stem numbers per diameter size classes aboveground biomass basal area and other structural variables see fig 3 in results 2 5 simulation settings we analyzed forest succession over 1000 years starting with bare ground conditions in order to ensure that the simulation encompassed the full life history of the rainforest to assess the full structural variability in the forest model we simulated forest stands with a size of 16 hectares first for a comparison of the model output with field data we calculated the mean of simulated forest attributes over the last 300 1000 years based on the assumption that the forest is in the equilibrium state for this entire period in particular we included aboveground biomass basal area and stem numbers for trees with a dbh greater than 10 cm second we analyzed the relationship between lorey s height and agb lai and gpp at four different resolutions 10 m 20 m 50 m 100 m all simulated forest stands between simulation years 300 to 1000 were aggregated into one large dataset the dataset was then divided into 10 m plots 20 m plots 50 m plots and 100 m plots in order to collect the height variables and the agb lai and gpp at each of the resolutions for comparison the agb lai and gpp were recorded per varied plot size e g 10 m 20 m 50 m and 100 m and then scaled to a per hectare measurement in order to avoid biasing our comparisons with uneven numbers of data points between each of the resolutions 8000 random plot data points were collected for each of the variables at each resolution similar methodologies have been undertaken by mascaro et al 2012 and knapp et al 2018 for the forest height calculation we investigated four different common height definitions including mean tree height mean maximum height as also derived by lidar rh100 canopy height canopy and lorey s height the mean tree height is the average of all tree heights with dbh 10 cm within the plot size 10 m to 100 m the maximum height is the height of the tallest tree within the plot canopy height is the mean of all tree heights within the canopy as defined by kohler and huth p 2010 lorey s height is the basal area weighted average tree height of trees in the plot lorey 1878 3 results 3 1 forest model vs field data to test the parameterization for la selva rainforest we compared simulated basal area aboveground biomass and stem numbers to forest inventory data scaled to one hectare forest height was also compared to kellner et al s 2009 findings see appendix b comparisons were made on the level of pft we found that when the forest reaches equilibrium after year 200 large intermediate trees pft 2 are dominant followed by large shade tolerant trees pft 1 shade intolerant pft 3 sub canopy shade tolerant pft 4 sub canopy intermediate pft 5 and understory shade tolerant pft 6 trees together make up only about 5 of the total forest aboveground biomass there is an initial large increase of biomass with the colonization by pioneer shade intolerant trees pft 3 cf fig 3c shade intermediate trees pft 2 quickly compete with shade intolerant trees followed by shade tolerant canopy pft 1 shade tolerant sub canopy trees pft 4 and intermediate sub canopy trees pft 5 as the shade tolerant pft 1 canopy shade tolerant sub canopy pft 4 and intermediate sub canopy pft 5 trees colonize the understory ca year 40 shade intolerant trees reach maturity and quickly decline in numbers and biomass by year 200 of the simulated forest life history the forest reaches a stable equilibrium fig 3a 3c intermediate canopy and emergent trees make up the dominant proportion of biomass 61 6 followed by shade tolerant canopy and emergent trees 24 3 shade tolerant sub canopy trees pft4 account for about 7 0 of the total aboveground biomass the remaining plant functional type groups pft 3 pft 5 and pft 6 are responsible for only a small percentage of the aboveground biomass 8 4 in comparing field data to the simulation aboveground biomass for the simulated forest was ca 200 megagrams of organic try matter per ha mgodm ha which was 2 3 lower than observed in the field data 204 61 mg ha fig 3d the model slightly underestimates aboveground biomass for pft 1 and overestimates for pft 4 1 for each the total basal area of the forest was slightly underestimated by formind with values of 20 5 m2 ha compared to 21 5 m2 ha measured in the actual forest fig 3b also underestimated was basal area of pft2 which had the largest biomass of all the pfts and accounted for most of the total difference 11 3 m2 ha simulated compared with 12 3 m2 ha field measured the simulated basal area for pft4 was the only overestimation by the model it accounted for 14 1 of the total simulated basal area as compared to 12 3 of the total la selva measured basal area basal area of pfts 1 and 3 were exactly the same when comparing simulated and measured values while pfts 5 and 6 were underestimated by the model with differences of 0 33 m2 ha and 0 16 m2 ha respectively a detailed evaluation of stem number distributions can be found in appendix b 3 2 forest height vs aboveground biomass in the forest structure analysis comparing four measures of height to aboveground biomass averaged at four different plot resolutions we found that the relationship was weaker at larger scales but the strength of the relationship also depends on the height definition the comparison of maximum height rh100 and canopy height to agb at 10mx10m plot resolution both had the overall strongest relationship see appendix c with each of the height definitions used in our study the relationship with agb was best described using a power law function for the relationship between biomass and height on the 10 m scale the r2 values for mean height rh100 canopy height and lorey s height was found to be 0 6 0 91 0 91 and 0 83 respectively detailed results for the rh100 canopy height and mean height correlations with agb are found in appendix c when lorey s height is compared to agb at 20 20 m resolution fig 4 b the predictive capability of the agb height relationship decreases to an r2 of 0 70 this decreasing trend continues at coarser resolutions r2 decreases at the 50 m resolution to 0 59 and 0 54 at 100 m resolution fig 4 c 4 d conversely the rmse of the lorey s height agb relationship improves drastically as the resolution coarsens from 135 3 mg ha at 10 m resolution to 15 9 mg ha at 100 m resolution this inverse relationship between r2 and rmse is explained by the behavior of the plots in fig 4 a d at the 10 m resolution fig 4 a the points spread throughout the entire height range of the equation that is produced by the best fit line however the distances of the points to the best fit line rmse is overall much larger than the distances of the points to the 100 m resolution best fit line fig 4 d which does not extend over the full range of lorey s height 3 3 forest height vs leaf area index lai we compared how lai varies among the four measures of canopy height at different plot scales fig 5 lorey s height related best to lai at the 10 m resolution r2 0 75 with decreasing r2 values as the plot size increased to 100 m 0 27 as with agb the r2 values decrease with increasing resolution coarseness however with lai the strength of the relationship decreases more rapidly indeed at 20 m plot resolution the r2 value is 0 52 and the relationship between lai and lorey s height at 50 m and 100 m resolutions cannot be considered meaningful 0 35 and 0 27 respectively when lorey s height is compared to lai the rmse also decreases with coarsening resolution from 0 8 to 0 1 lai is commonly defined as the maximum projected leaf area per unit ground surface this inherently includes all leaf material from the top of the canopy downward through the vertical leaf profile so it necessitates a height measure that is reflective of the top height of the plot canopy which is a possible source of error with respect to fit of the relationship mixed heterogeneous forests like that of la selva have a large variation in lai values when measured at fine scales variation that would be averaged out at large plot scales an in depth comparison of each of the different height measurements to lai at each plot resolution is found in appendix d 3 4 forest height vs gross primary productivity gpp the relationship between simulated height and gross primary productivity gpp is also best described using a power law function as shown in fig 6 ryan et al 1994 measured gpp in la selva to be around 50 mg ha year which is in the same order as our simulated gpp values 40 mg ha year the correlation of lorey s height to gpp was most clear at the highest resolution with r2 values of 0 78 at 10 m resolution and 0 61 at 20 m resolution at the 50 m resolution however the correlation was weaker and had an r2 of 0 5 and was most weak when measured at the 100 m resolution r2 0 43 as with the abg and lai comparisons the rmse of the lorey s height to gpp relationship decrease with increasing plot size at the 10 m plot resolution rmse is 20 05 mg ha but decreases by almost half for each successive plot size from 12 07 mg ha at 20 m plot resolution to 5 17 mg ha at 50 m plot resolution and 2 63 mg ha at 100 m plot resolution the comparisons of each of the different height measurements to gpp at each plot resolution is found in appendix e 3 5 error the root mean squared error rmse was calculated for each correlation at all scales and for each height definition as shown in appendix f in all correlations rmse was highest at 10 m resolution and decreased as the resolution coarsened to 100 m when the rmse and r2 values were plotted for each resolution the high rmse values declined sharply between 10 m and 20 m resolution whereas the r2 values decreased less sharply see appendix c d e and f figures these differences in values between resolutions and the directionality of their trends suggest that though the data at the smallest resolutions is the noisiest their r2 high value indicates the ranges of points fit best the power equation 4 discussion overall our study shows that the strength of the height to agb lai and gpp relationships are the best at the smaller spatial scales however this comes with an increase in error at coarser scales the error becomes smaller but the relationship between the forest variables become less precise fig 1a using formind model simulations helped to quantify this trade off between accuracy and precision across the plot resolutions toward informing the initial research question of how does the crucial relationship between canopy height metrics and forest stand biomass agb leaf area index lai and gross primary productivity gpp change at different spatial resolutions relating height variables to this study s focal productivity variables is best at the scale of a very small plot given that the average width of the crown of a canopy emergent tree in la selva rainforests typically exceeds 10 m in diameter king and clark 2011 obrien et al 1995 and the 10 m plots size revealed the largest rmse across each of the compared variables a plot size of 20 m affords the most reliable and robust comparison data from la selva forest inventory plots was used to successfully create a parameterization of the formind model this parameterization is the first for this specific type of fine scaled individual and process based gap model for la selva biological station that includes fine scale structural realism the dataset used to parameterize formind for la selva is exceptional compared to many tropical rainforest datasets in terms of longevity and replication only a handful of other tropical rainforest sites e g barro colorado island panama and paracou french guiana within this region have a similar study area inventoried and are repeated over decades given the robustness of the inventory data in situ measurement error is not likely the source of any significant model parameterization uncertainty it is more likely that the main source of uncertainty with respect to the discrepancies found between the simulated forest and the inventory dataset is due to uncertainties in grouping the la selva species into plant functional types and due to prominence of palms and other growth forms in general that are not simulated by formind similarly using the maximum diameter growth increment could result in a few placement errors for example a rarely occurring shade tolerant tree species that is released from canopy suppression might have a large maximum diameter growth increment for a short period of time that more closely resembles a shade intolerant pioneer species and would result in an uncharacteristically high maximum diameter growth increment for that particular species over the timespan that was used to calculate it either of these scenarios could have resulted in a few of the less common tree species being placed into incorrect pfts ideally the modeled forest should be compared to a validation dataset in order to more thoroughly investigate the causes of uncertainty as presented in fischer et al 2016 and also in rodig et al e 2018 the formind model has been shown to be a useful tool in studies that aim to understand relationships between numerous forest structure variables and other measurable ecosystem functions including forest biomass and forest productivity we used the costa rican formind model to investigate how four definitions of tree height vary with agb lai and gpp at plot resolutions as was shown by the simulation results height is relatable to agb lai and gpp using a power law in costa rican rainforest a taller forest has higher aboveground biomass more leaves and thus a higher lai and is overall more productive then smaller stands though the relationship varied with resolution the simulated lai was comparable to values found by clark et al 2008 in their study directly measuring lai across numerous plant functional groups in la selva biological station their study found a total lai of 6 for old growth forest however the total included lianas palms herbaceous climbers herbs ferns and epiphytes as formind includes only trees greater than 10 cm dbh it compares well to the mean lai for trees only which was measured to be 3 29 by clark et al 2008 and 3 30 4 79 median by loedscher et al h w 2003 one study by tang et al in 2012 which created vertical lai profiles from canopy waveform lidar lvis and a radiative transfer model gort found slightly higher forest lai values when subtracting out the non tree forest constituents the lai in this study is consistent within a reasonable range of all three existing studies the values for gpp as calculated by the model output are also congruent with the literature h w loescher et al 2003 calculated gross ecosystem productivity gep values between 28 4 and 30 6 from tower measurements taken in 1998 and 1999 respectively luyssaert et al 2007 reported a gpp value of 35 5 1 60 tcha 1yr 1 for tropical humid evergreen forest in a study comparing gpp across forest types this study highlights the capability of individual based modeling as the appropriate model platform to investigate forest structure and scale directly our study did not attempt to define the best height definition to use because different height definitions are widely accepted among forest ecologists and across the different remote sensing platforms see appendices instead we sought to understand how fine scale characterization of height is more accurate than at coarser scales while fine scale measurements tend to add some noise overall they provided a clearer picture of height with less error in addition canopy height rh100 and then lorey s height tended to relate best to aboveground biomass leaf area index and gross primary productivity respectively advances in remote sensing data processing have facilitated calibration of variables of interest with forest inventory plot datasets for scaling to landscape level estimations of aboveground biomass and carbon flux baccini et al 2012 saatchi et al 2011a morel et al 2011 additionally many of the recent change maps of agb and carbon flux rely on classification and calibration of remotely sensed datasets with measured or leveraged fine scale forest structure ground truth data points asner et al 2009 hansen et al 2013 hansen et al 2016 hudak et al 2012 remote sensing approaches are among the solutions for a large scale systematic vegetation monitoring though they are often limited by sensor footprint in these applications typically in situ field inventory measurements are used to calibrate the remote sensing dataset but due to the lack of data temporal coverage and long term monitoring plots constitute only a snapshot of the forest and are constrained to imagery collected during the same time period or risk introduction of additional uncertainty with the advancement of super computing and cloud based processors scaling of high resolution datasets across landscapes has never been easier it is therefore crucial to gain knowledge of how to minimize error and uncertainty when applying high resolution datasets across landscapes particularly in the tropics where aboveground biomass is based largely on broad allometric relationships calculated from stem diameters and wood density chave et al 2014 chave et al 2005 chave et al 2004 error estimates are often higher than in temperate forests for which allometric equations are more robust malhi et al 1999 ketterings et al 2001 chave et al 2004 this study also highlights the importance of realizing and accounting for the differences of measuring forest structure using top down versus bottom up approaches in meyer et al s 2013 study using repeated lidar lvis and drl to detect tropical forest biomass dynamics across the same la selva study site they found a reduction of error and uncertainty rmse as resolution coarsened tree height is an important forest structure variable that can be both directly measured in situ and obtained remotely as canopy height using various methods with lidar and radar interferometry popescu 2007 hyde et al 2007 lefsky et al 2005 zheng et al 2004 dubayah et al 1997 either directly measured from the ground up during forest inventories or calculated through allometric equations tree height has become widely used as a predictor of aboveground biomass as well as other indirectly measured forest variables this study also highlights the importance of realizing and accounting for the differences of measuring forest structure using top down versus bottom up approaches canopy height in addition to other vertical canopy variables relating top of the canopy to the ground have been used to characterize vertical structure across numerous forest types from the top down drake et al 2002 dubayah et al 1997 2000 blair et al 1999 lefsky et al 1999 weishampel et al 1996 as noted by kohler and huth p 2010 the height of the canopy in forests is a key variable which can be obtained using air or space borne remote sensing techniques such as radar interferometry or lidar the wide variety of sensors has greatly increased resolution over the past decades for example most lidar footprints range in diameter including lvis 25 m uavsar 6 m in 100kmx20km transects gedi 20 m and icesat 60 m aboard glas however recently some sensors have even higher resolution e g g liht with its 1 m resolution cook et al 2013 various studies set in tropical ecosystems have successfully used remote sensing to characterize forest structure variables e g r o dubayah et al 2010 potter et al 2009 frolking et al 2009 garrigues et al 2008 and by application of plot data to infer regional estimates of agb forest characterization e g malhi et al 2006 saatchi et al 2007 according to drake et al 2002 because many remote sensing studies estimate forest biomass using empirical correlations of energy and different wavelengths the approach and sensors are sensitive to biomass changes in relatively young forests but tend to saturate and become less predictable in older growth and heterogeneous forests in meyer et al s 2013 study using repeated lidar lvis and drl to detect tropical forest biomass dynamics across the same la selva study site they found a reduction of error and uncertainty rmse as resolution coarsened from 10 m x 10 m plots to 100 m x 100 m plots this difference in findings can be accounted for in two fundamental ways first meyer et al used a pixel based approach with a 1 m fixed resolution chm which was averaged to the target pixel size from 0 4 ha to 10 ha our study uses height values based on individual trees within a plot whereby the plot heights were obtained according to which trees grew in a given plot during a given year with the size of the plot varying from 0 01 ha to 1 ha essentially the resolution of our chm was variable and congruous to plot resolution second our study is more theoretical we used a sampling approach to construct our analyses so that an equal number of points was plotted regardless of the resolution this was done to ensure that our analysis was not subjected to sample bias in comparing plots with an unequal number of points between resolutions influencing the fit of the relationship r2 or the error rmse 5 conclusion individual based models like formind can be used to further the capabilities of remote sensing through modeling applications aimed at drawing empirical relationships at scales that are too fine to be measured with sensors but that could be scaled up to be applied in remote sensing studies the results of our study can shed light on why forest height cannot accurately predict aboveground biomass at coarser scales when measuring from the ground up we show that regardless of how height is defined the empirical relationship breaks down when trees are scaled to 60 meter and 100 meter plots because lidar and radar interferometry are well suited to determine forest height from the top down there exists a natural synergism with individual based models like formind however because of the difference in methodology with which high resolution models and remote sensing methods obtain height metrics it is important to consider and resolve resolution where possible when the height is based on per tree values the accuracy of prediction of agb lai and gpp is higher but there is a trade off with precision with respect to high resolution modeling the aim should therefore be to first define the intended error margins then scale the resolution of the study accordingly

stream networks regularization multiplier tuning 1 introduction advancements in remote sensing and geographic information systems gis methodologies have enabled ecologists to transition from qualitative accounts of species occurrence on local to regional scales to more complicated nuanced and highly quantitative predictions of species distributions on local to global scales elith and leathwick 2009 species distribution models sdms compare known species occurrence locations with corresponding environmental conditions and estimate the potential distribution of that species over space and time franklin 2010 under ideal circumstances sdms are developed using a rigorous sampling design that includes representative sampling the collection of presence absence occurrences and related environmental predictors cawsey et al 2002 since ideal circumstances do not always exist sdm methods have been developed that account for the use of biased sampling methods and presence only datasets phillips et al 2009 maximum entropy maxent phillips et al 2006 2017 phillips and dudík 2008 is a type of sdm that can utilize highly collinear data and presence only datasets and can continue to perform well when given very few presences pearson et al 2007 van proosdij et al 2016 maxent is able to utilize presence only datasets because absence points traditionally defined by sampling efforts are replaced with randomly selected background points sometimes referred to as pseudoabsences these background points are supplied from anywhere within the landscape potentially including presence locations and are associated with covariate values i e environmental conditions at that point by default maxent samples 10 000 background points from the landscape when represented as a raster however the number of points and the randomness of their selection can be modified yates et al 2010 while maxent continues to be used extensively there remains a lack of understanding of how to best parameterize the models maxent is based on the maximum entropy principle jaynes 1957 and has been used in machine learning and statistical contexts jessop 1995 and more recently ecological contexts elith et al 2011 frans et al 2018 merow et al 2013 oppel et al 2012 phillips et al 2006 although forecasting has been conducted using maxent kharouba et al 2009 slater and michael 2012 yates et al 2010 the more traditional use has been with datasets with static time periods that utilize points to indicate species locations elith et al 2011 however maxent and other sdms relying on pseudoabsences face two challenges when applied to predicting species in riverine ecosystems 1 how to characterize watershed environments and 2 accounting for the temporally dynamic environments of riverine ecosystems species distribution models developed for terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems generally rely on species occurrence points and raster data for characterizing the environment elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2017 riaz et al 2019 however it is difficult to capture geographic variability of lotic environments in the context of a spatial grid turner 1990 there have been studies in freshwater systems that utilized sdm techniques e g logistic mixed models random forests over stream reaches filipe et al 2017 treglia et al 2015 there have also been limited applications of maxent in freshwater systems that model on landscape or continental scales using raster data lois et al 2015 h m poulos et al 2012a h m poulos et al 2012b although these coarser scale grids may be roughly the same scale as watersheds these methods do not enable finer scale modeling that explicitly compares watersheds there have also been some freshwater applications developed using catchment scale data that account for local uphill influences on a stream bouska et al 2015 cao et al 2013 labay et al 2011 however none of these approaches explicitly consider upstream watershed effects stream environmental characteristics that influence aquatic biota like water chemistry or channel substrate are often a function of watershed characteristics hunsaker and levine 1995 hynes 1975 olson and hawkins 2012 making it problematic to depend on local characteristics to predict the distributions of stream and river species elith et al 2011 show it is possible to conduct analyses in maxent using watershed environmental data using a samples with data approach rather than raster environmental data in this case raster environmental data are summarized in gis by watershed before being joined with occurrence locations and provided to maxent as an array however because delineating the watersheds needed to summarize environmental data is time consuming usually only a limited number of catchments or watersheds are included in these analyses for example bouska et al 2015 utilized a watershed approach but only quantified environmental data for those stream segments that contained a sampling event and therefore only used a subset of available watersheds the stream catchment dataset streamcat hill et al 2016 has enabled the development of summaries of catchment or watershed environments for every individual stream segment over entire regions the ability to measure watershed environmental characteristics for every watershed in a region now allows maxent models to be developed with much better representations of background conditions for lotic systems than have been used in the past while all environments experience change lotic environments are especially dynamic so much that the disturbance regime of a river is an important aspect of its environment poff and allan 1995 resh et al 1988 data from different time periods have been used in maxent however their main purpose has been to hindcast distributions to understand current or future patterns carnaval and moritz 2008 cordellier and pfenninger 2009 or to forecast distributions under climate change scenarios elith et al 2010 kharouba et al 2009 yates et al 2010 to our knowledge no studies have been conducted that utilize ecologically relevant temporal scales i e seasonal inter annual variation to understand current species distributions in freshwater systems although such work has been completed in marine systems olden and neff 2001 wang et al 2018 remotely sensed data can provide a snapshot of environmental conditions at numerous points in time this high temporal resolution has the potential to account for upstream activities on ecologically relevant timescales and allow the building of models that explicitly account for both spatial and temporal variation we hypothesize that accounting for both spatial and temporal variation will improve model performance and result in more precise predictions of species distributions that can be useful to resource managers predictions of species distributions provided by watershed and landscape scale sdms are critical for managers to make informed decisions this is especially true in areas that are developing rapidly but that are still data poor the bureau of land management blm is tasked with managing oil and gas leasing exploration and operations within the national petroleum reserve in alaska usa npr a while sustaining the health diversity and productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations blm 2019 this involves the consideration of the multiple anthropogenic land uses as well as the environmental and habitat needs of a broad suite of species specifically the blm would like to consider the spatial distributions of multiple freshwater fishes in making leasing and management decisions however the npr a is almost entirely roadless making the collection of data extremely difficult and resulting in decisions made with minimal data of fish occurrences or distributions an sdm approach like maxent that can combine remotely sensed watershed characteristics with traditional observations has potential to provide managers with robust estimates of fish distributions and allow better land management decisions these models would be improved if more observations could be made in less sampled areas so we also collected environmental dna edna in these areas riaz et al 2019 showed that utilizing edna in their sdms substantially improved model performance 9 3 increase in true skill statistic tss values we investigated whether and to what extent the combination of edna landscape characterizations from streamcat and the maxent modeling framework can be used to produce reliable predictions of species distributions in this difficult to access and therefore data poor region our primary objective was to apply these advances in landscape analysis and modeling to provide improved estimates of distributions for 19 fish species occurring on the north slope of alaska to managers specifically we sought to 1 develop sdms that predict fish occurrences over the entire landscape using edna streamcat remotely sensed data and maxent 2 compare maxent model performance when characterizing the environment at only a subset of watersheds that contained a sampling event referred to as presence absence pa locations to providing the model with presence locations and watershed data from all possible stream segments referred to as presence background pb locations 3 determine if accounting for seasonal or inter annual temporal variability could improve model performance secondarily we wanted to examine the efficacy of model tuning in maxent by testing the sensitivity of the sdms to different regularization parameters which control the parsimony of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the national petroleum reserve in alaska usa npr a is 95 506 km2 23 5 million acres located on the remote north slope of alaska and contains thousands of miles of streams fig 1 the occurrence presence or absence of 19 fish species table 1 was collected through traditional fish surveys between 1979 and 2016 by numerous federal and state agencies as well as industry the state s dataset was downloaded from the alaska freshwater fish inventory complementary edna surveys began in 2015 bush et al 2017 rodgers et al 2019 2018 these complementary edna surveys were faster and less expensive than traditional surveys and were concentrated in areas that were more data sparse fig 2 a the combined observations did exhibit some amount of spatial clumping thinning clumped observations using a strictly spatial approach i e aiello lammens et al 2015 would likely remove observations that are geographically near each other but are actually environmentally distinct e g sites on a mainstem river and on smaller tributary stream factoring out environmental bias phillips et al 2009 could also address this issue but it cannot be applied to the samples with data approach we used to input river environmental data into maxent so to address potential overrepresentation of sampled streams we collapsed all samples by stream segment which weredefined as stream flowlines between confluences in the national hydrography dataset and had an average length of 12 km stream segments were given a value of one if it had one or more presences during the time period and a zero if no presences were recorded during the time period environmental predictors were assembled from remotely sensed satellite measurements taken between 1979 and 2016 and included measurements of evapotranspiration temperature vegetation water chemistry model predictions and other spatial data table 2 fig 2a supplement a the raw environmental predictors were assembled as a static time series i e averages over the entire time period or as a dynamic time series in the dynamic series satellite data on dynamic scales were only available from 2000 to 2016 and were averaged in two week periods modis collection periods at different lags time of fish occurrence survey two weeks preceding survey four weeks preceding survey six weeks preceding survey and three months preceding survey these lags were used to capture changes in river environments which often lag changes in watersheds by weeks or months including responses of fish recruitment moraes et al 2012 reproduction andrade et al 2013 and water chemistry olson and cormier 2019 the assembled environmental predictors were then run through streamcat hill et al 2016 streamcat website which calculated zonal statistics for each predictor for each individual stream catchment and corresponding cumulative upstream watershed within the study area in total there were 96 static and 50 dynamic environmental predictors see supplement a for complete list 2 2 model development and evaluation species distribution models sdms were developed for each of the 19 species for which occurrence data was collected table 1 and for each dataset type static vs dynamic using a maxent modeling framework many species had a low number of presences five species had fewer than five presences preventing us from being able to withhold a meaningful dataset for external validation we therefore utilized all data to train models and validated models using ten fold cross validation models were built using two different environmental datasets the first used a subset of watersheds where presence and absence observations had been made referred to as presence absence data pa n 176 the second used presence only data in combination with watershed data calculated for every stream segment using streamcat referred to as presence background pb n 2642 because environmental data were provided to maxent in the unit of stream segments rather than as rasters background points also needed to be in the unit of stream segments we provided maxent with the streamcat outputs for all stream segments in the npr a landscape and maxent randomly selected background points i e stream segments from the landscape to use in the model according to maxent s default settings i e up to 10 000 background points to reduce overfitting and increase model parsimony we removed uninformative and correlated predictors from models using an iterative process fig 2b first all predictors were included in the model and their permutation importance and percent contribution were assessed predictors were removed before recalibration if both measures were zero indicating no predictive ability this process was repeated six times each time removing predictors that were not important in the model on the seventh iteration pearson correlations of the remaining predictors were compared for those predictors that had a correlation greater than 0 7 the predictor with the lower permutation importance was removed dormann et al 2013 leathwick et al 2006 maxent allows users to adjust the beta regularization parameter which controls the parsimony of the model by applying a penalty for including additional predictors in the model shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 the default regularization parameter setting is one values less than one reduce the penalty and can increase model complexity and values greater than one increase the penalty and can reduce model complexity following morales et al 2017 and radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we examined how model performance and parsimony changed with a range of regularization parameters 0 25 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 fig 2b each model underwent the aforementioned predictor selection process using each of the listed regularization parameters model performance was assessed by comparing a suite of metrics including area under the receiver operator curve auc pearson correlation coefficient cor maximum correct classification rate ccrmax true positive rate tpr sensitivity true negative rate tnr specificity false positive rate fpr false negative rate fnr true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 and the number of predictors included in the final model for those metrics that are threshold dependent e g tpr tnr fpr fnr the threshold at which sensitivity was equal to specificity i e tpr tnr for that model was used to calculate those metrics we used the threshold at which sensitivity was equal to specificity because we were using the same type of threshold for all 19 species and wanted to use a threshold that would be balanced in terms of optimizing for sensitivity or specificity and would be appropriate to use for all species for the final model we selected the most parsimonious model with an auc similar to or better than the full model if two or more models were similar in this respect their cor tpr tnr and tss were compared to determine which of the models in question was the best models with lower cor and higher tpr tnr and tss values were considered to be better performing once the best regularization parameter was selected response curves also known as partial dependence plots percent contribution and importance and jackknife tests of training testing and auc gains were manually compared to determine if any other predictor s should be removed from the model predictors were removed if the testing training or auc gains without the predictor was higher and the percent contribution and permutation importance for the predictor were less than three the remaining predictors and selected regularization parameter were used to develop the best model for that species model performance was assessed by comparing the number of predictors in the model auc cor ccrmax tpr tnr fpr fnr and tss values if there were fewer than 11 presences for a species the metrics from the final run during model training were used to for evaluation if there were greater than 11 presences for a species the model underwent ten fold cross validation and the average auc cor ccrmax tpr tnr fpr fnr and tss over all ten folds was used for evaluation fig 2b we chose to use ten fold cross validation since it is common practice suitable for both large and small datasets and is commonly recommended because it conservatively estimates performance and avoids the large computational burden of k fold cross validation hastie et al 2009 a priori we decided to use terminology based on delineations in mandrekar 2010 to describe the level of empirical support for a model using the terms poor acceptable excellent and outstanding to correspond to auc values less than 0 7 between 0 7 and 0 8 between 0 8 and 0 9 and greater than 0 9 respectively model performance of the different combinations of static dynamic and pa pb models were compared for the model type with the best overall performance for each species we analyzed the frequency of use direction of response permutation importance and percent contribution of the predictors used for each species model to determine which predictors were the most informative overall specifically we calculated the frequency at which a predictor was used and calculated the average rank of permutation importance and percent contribution for each predictor we summarized the general direction of the response curves i e positive negative none or some combination thereof for the top 12 predictors 2 3 predictions we predicted and mapped likely distributions of each species we made predictions for each stream segment by applying the relevant watershed predictor variables calculated for each stream segment to the best performing model predicted probability of species distributions were then mapped for all stream segments on the north slope of alaska producing maps depicting likely distributions suitable for inclusion in existing decision support tools used for land management decisions by the blm all maps were created using arcmap version 10 6 1 esri 2018 all analyses were executed using maxent version 3 4 1 phillips et al 2017 and r statistical software version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 including the dismo hijmans et al 2017 maxnet phillips 2017 raster hijmans 2017 and sp pebesma and bivand 2005 bivand et al 2013 packages 3 results over all species and datasets an average of 28 2 presences median of 14 range of 2 198 were used to develop excellent models auc 0 8 with relatively high ccrmax rates and satisfactory sensitivity and specificity table 3 supplement b as one would expect the species in question and dataset used impacted model performance and auc and tss values were in relative agreement static datasets utilizing pb data performed the best overall with outstanding model performance average auc 0 9 and average ccrmax sensitivity and specificity all above 0 9 static datasets utilizing pa data had excellent performance average auc between 0 8 and 0 9 average ccrmax above 0 9 and average sensitivity and specificity above 0 86 although the models built from dynamic datasets and utilizing pa occurrence data did not perform as well as the models built using the other two dataset configurations the models still performed well overall the dynamic models had excellent performance average auc between 0 8 and 0 9 and average ccrmax sensitivity and specificity all above 0 8 which consistently outperformed other model and dataset configurations fig 3 see table 3 for summarized model performance metrics by model type supplement b for detailed evaluation metrics of each model by species and supplement c for bean plots summarizing evaluation metrics by model and dataset type similar to anderson and gonzalez 2011 cao et al 2013 morales et al 2017 and shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 and unlike radosavljevic and anderson 2014 the best regularization parameter for nearly all the models developed was between 1 0 and 2 0 the best regularization parameter was 0 5 for 2 of models 1 model 1 0 for 65 of models 37 models 1 5 for 28 of models 16 models and 2 0 for 5 of models 2 models models with regularization parameters between 1 0 and 2 0 were similar in terms of the number of predictors used auc and ccrmax values as the regularization parameter increased the models generally had substantially fewer predictors lower auc values and slightly lower ccrmax values fig 4 the most consistently important and informative predictors related to elevation temperature slope land cover and potential evapotranspiration table 4 the predictors with the best permutation importance rank best percent contribution rank and highest frequency of use across models were catchment scale potential evapotranspiration estimates for 2000 to 2009 average rank 4 0 proportion of the watershed that is carex sedges average rank 3 0 and distance from the centroid of the stream segment to the coastal foothills frequency 13 respectively table 4 supplement e interestingly the most frequently used predictor distance from the centroid of the stream segment to the coastal foothills was among the top ten ranked predictors in terms of permutation importance but was not particularly important in terms of mean rank percent contribution although potential evapotranspiration predictors were not used frequently 2 to 3 models they appeared to be relatively and consistently important when they were included in the model best ranking for permutation importance and the only predictors among the top ones that had a consistently positive effect on the response it is important to note that although similar predictors e g two measures of temperature are present in table 4 that does not mean they were present in the same model rather both predictors were present in one of the best models for one or more of the 19 species for which models were developed additionally if similar predictors were present in the same model the predictor selection process ensured that predictors included in each model were not highly correlated as expected the predicted distributions using the model constructed with static pb data varied by species some species were predicted to occur across a large portion of the north slope of alaska e g ninespine stickleback pungitius pungitius chum salmon oncorhynchus keta see fig 5 a and 5b respectively whereas other species were predicted to occur in smaller regions within the study area e g coastal plain for least cisco coregonus sardinella foothills for dolly varden char salvelinus malma see fig 5c and 5d respectively see supplement f for maps of model predictions of static datasets utilizing pb data for all species and supplement g for descriptive statistics of all predictors used in the best model type i e models constructed with static datasets utilizing pb data 4 discussion using watershed characterizations of the environment from all stream segments as background instead of using watersheds only calculated for places where observations were made improves prediction accuracy for species occurring on the north slope of alaska this work also demonstrates how the utilization of landscape characterizations of stream networks via satellite imagery and streamcat in combination with maxent can result in informative sdms of freshwater ecosystems at the stream segment scale by using these methods to extrapolate from traditional or edna survey methods freshwater stream ecologists and managers can develop an understanding of species distributions over entire landscapes in a manner that is fiscally and temporally efficient spatially explicit predictions can illuminate which habitats in the landscape are the most suitable for species of ecological or economic interest and inform where development should be avoided temporally specific predictions can account for seasonal or inter annual variability of species distributions throughout the landscape using a more holistic understanding of species distributions can inform management decisions better than only using survey data that might be biased by climatic conditions e g wet cold or seasonal distribution factors at the time of the survey while using dynamic datasets did improve performance of pa models for some species the improvements were not substantial enough overall for us to pursue the implementation of dynamic datasets with pb models we recognize the potential for improvement in auc or tss values had we implemented models with dynamic datasets utilizing pb data however since we achieved more than satisfactory models for all species with static datasets the cost to develop pb models with dynamic datasets was deemed prohibitive calculating watershed averages for entire landscapes for a static dataset and pb model is non trivial the number of calculations being equal to the product of the number of variables of interest e g 96 in our case and the number of watersheds e g approximately 3000 on the north slope of alaska the cost to calculate watershed averages for entire landscapes for a dynamic dataset and pb model is quickly exacerbated the number of calculations for this study was the product of the number of variables of interest 50 variables the number of watersheds 3000 watersheds the number of time points 8 months representing the sampling season and the number of years in the dataset 15 years for this study producing pb models would require making 288 000 calculations to produce our static dataset and 18 000 000 calculations to produce a dynamic dataset a 6150 increase there is also the question of how to determine which background points should be selected over all time periods should locations be selected randomly over all time periods if so should random locations be equally distributed over all time periods with all of this in mind we recommend the use of dynamic datasets with pa models and considering their use with pb models in situations where traditional static datasets do not produce adequate models should we have employed methods that utilized raster datasets e g maps rather than arrays methods to generate background points based on geographical distance from occurrence locations and the potential habitat rather than random selection can be used hengl et al 2009 however employing such methods does not necessarily address the questions posed above related to selecting background points over multiple time periods ideally sdms would be developed from large comprehensive and representative sampling efforts over the entire study area maxent is very well suited for when the best case scenario does not exist here we show that using maxent as it was intended with background points in leu of absences resulted in models that outperformed those developed using presence absence datasets this finding supports the conclusion of guillera arroita et al 2014 that using absence data in maxent models is not best practice one reason for this could be that in our study the survey locations and therefore absence locations were not completely randomly distributed over the landscape the utilization of background points enables a better representation of the actual environment which is the key to developing superior performing models but depends on being able to characterize the environments of individual stream segments across the entire landscape of interest our approach which employed satellite imagery streamcat and maxent modeling can be implemented regardless of the terrain and is efficient and effective in terms of the cost of implementation and model performance it is also important to note the tendency of models with a small number of presences to have higher performance metrics the starkest example of this was for arctic lamprey lethenteron camtschaticum which had two presences and received both an auc and tss of 1 0 for the model that utilized static datasets and presence background data we acknowledge that there are serious limitations associated with models that are developed using so few presences according to van proosdij et al 2016 narrow ranged species should have an absolute minimum of three samples none of the arctic lamprey models were able to meet this minimum models of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and longnose sucker catostomus were also based on few presences 4 and 6 respectively but because these species are at low prevalence at the edges of their range these models are within the thresholds used by van proosdij et al 2016 we consider these models to be informative for the blm in that they are better than having nothing at all however our confidence in their predictions is substantially reduced we recommend these data poor models be used in combination with known biological information for those species as an additional line of evidence indicating the likelihood of a species being present criticisms of maxent include its propensity to overfitting and the lack of research on the sensitivity of maxent to adjustments in its regularization parameter merow et al 2013 morales et al 2017 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 our results suggest that for the species analyzed in this study accepting the default regularization parameter will likely result in the best performing model although the average output for one modeling framework may be better than the others the model results among species and between methods can be markedly different while our regularization parameter results may differ from anderson and gonzalez 2011 and radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we still encourage users to investigate the sensitivity of regularization parameters and go through the tuning process in their contexts as a form of best practice additionally renner and warton 2013 outline a number of additional criticism of maxent such as its lack of model based framework diagnostic tools and scale independence and recommend the use of poisson point process models in lieu of maxent since those methods can address said criticisms while producing similar results while a comparison of maxent and poisson point process models was outside the scope of this study the points renner and warton 2013 make are compelling future maxent studies should consider comparing these two methods with a variety of different datasets so we can better understand when it is most appropriate to use each method combining remotely sensed data and streamcat to estimate watershed environmental aspects influencing fish distributions such as average yearly maximum temperature and slope has important ecological implications and applications for example it is well established that temperature influences the behavior e g distribution migration sociality bartolini et al 2015 physiology e g growth jobling 1997 and reproduction pankhurst and munday 2011 of fish we demonstrated that these coarse landscape variables can effectively capture ecological processes and allow us to successfully predict fish distributions in remote landscapes without needing in situ measurements of environmental conditions the inclusion of temperature and slope among the most important predictors across all species supports well established ecological relationships jackson et al 2001 and the effectiveness of this novel combination of methods temperature and slope also had the greatest contribution to models of 28 fish species across southwestern france buisson et al 2008 the importance of potential evapotranspiration as a predictor also likely reflects the influence of hydrological mechanisms and demonstrates their utility as predictors in sdms the importance of predictors such as the proportion of the watershed that is arctophila arctic grass or the proportion of the catchment that is tussocks bunch grasses are less intuitive we currently do not have a mechanistic understanding of why these predictors are related to fish distributions but suspect they are likely surrogates for biotic interactions such as predation and competition jackson et al 2001 vezza et al 2015 or mechanistic factors we cannot measure more directly with remote sensing such as soil chemistry or groundwater influence amis et al 2007 bush et al 2017 5 conclusions the combination of edna landscape characterizations from streamcat and maxent modeling to develop sdms can produce reliable predictions of species distributions in data poor regions approaches like this have great potential for providing critically needed data in rapidly developing but data poor regions like the north slope of alaska africa and south america from the management perspective it is imperative to remember that one size certainly does not fit all it is crucial to consider management objectives modeling methods and modeling outputs for species on a case by case basis once models are developed utilizing predictions of species distributions over the entire landscape including previously inaccessible areas can and should be used to inform management decisions future work will include utilizing individual species models to estimate the richness of freshwater fishes over the entire landscape so managers can develop decisions using a more holistic view of species distributions over the landscape moreover bouska et al 2015 showed that ensemble modeling methods can outperform individual modeling methods although we did not pursue these methods here future work for the blm will investigate ensemble methods similar to riaz et al 2019 to determine which method will best suit their management needs and a comparison of these results with the results of other machine learning methods e g random forests that can better utilize absence data declaration of competing interest none

24767,the bureau of land management blm manages the national petroleum reserve alaska on the remote north slope but has limited data on fish distributions on which to base leasing and management decisions to address this we used environmental dna traditional sampling watershed landscape characterizations and maximum entropy modeling to develop species distribution models sdms for 19 fish species the difficulty of characterizing up stream environments for every stream reach has limited the development of sdms for riverine taxa to using either only local conditions or a small subset of potential watersheds we apply a new technique streamcat to characterize the background variation in watershed conditions we also assessed how including temporal variation in addition to spatial variation and how adjusting the parameters that controlled model parsimony would affect model performance the best models mean tss 0 87 across all 19 taxa used only static data regularization parameters between 1 0 default and 2 0 slightly more parsimonious and watershed background data important predictors in these models included temperature slope and land cover approaches like this have

qualitative accounts of species occurrence on local to regional scales to more complicated nuanced and highly quantitative predictions of species distributions on local to global scales elith and leathwick 2009 species distribution models sdms compare known species occurrence locations with corresponding environmental conditions and estimate the potential distribution of that species over space and time franklin 2010 under ideal circumstances sdms are developed using a rigorous sampling design that includes representative sampling the collection of presence absence occurrences and related environmental predictors cawsey et al 2002 since ideal circumstances do not always exist sdm methods have been developed that account for the use of biased sampling methods and presence only datasets phillips et al 2009 maximum entropy maxent phillips et al 2006 2017 phillips and dudík 2008 is a type of sdm that can utilize highly collinear data and presence only datasets and can continue to perform well when given very few presences pearson et al 2007 van proosdij et al 2016 maxent is able to utilize presence only datasets because absence points traditionally defined by sampling efforts are replaced with randomly selected background points sometimes referred to as pseudoabsences these background points are supplied from anywhere within the landscape potentially including presence locations and are associated with covariate values i e environmental conditions at that point by default maxent samples 10 000 background points from the landscape when represented as a raster however the number of points and the randomness of their selection can be modified yates et al 2010 while maxent continues to be used extensively there remains a lack of understanding of how to best parameterize the models maxent is based on the maximum entropy principle jaynes 1957 and has been used in machine learning and statistical contexts jessop 1995 and more recently ecological contexts elith et al 2011 frans et al 2018 merow et al 2013 oppel et al 2012 phillips et al 2006 although forecasting has been conducted using maxent kharouba et al 2009 slater and michael 2012 yates et al 2010 the more traditional use has been with datasets with static time periods that utilize points to indicate species locations elith et al 2011 however maxent and other sdms relying on pseudoabsences face two challenges when applied to predicting species in riverine ecosystems 1 how to characterize watershed environments and 2 accounting for the temporally dynamic environments of riverine ecosystems species distribution models developed for terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems generally rely on species occurrence points and raster data for characterizing the environment elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2017 riaz et al 2019 however it is difficult to capture geographic variability of lotic environments in the context of a spatial grid turner 1990 there have been studies in freshwater systems that utilized sdm techniques e g logistic mixed models random forests over stream reaches filipe et al 2017 treglia et al 2015 there have also been limited applications of maxent in freshwater systems that model on landscape or continental scales using raster data lois et al 2015 h m poulos et al 2012a h m poulos et al 2012b although these coarser scale grids may be roughly the same scale as watersheds these methods do not enable finer scale modeling that explicitly compares watersheds there have also been some freshwater applications developed using catchment scale data that account for local uphill influences on a stream bouska et al 2015 cao et al 2013 labay et al 2011 however none of these approaches explicitly consider upstream watershed effects stream environmental characteristics that influence aquatic biota like water chemistry or channel substrate are often a function of watershed characteristics hunsaker and levine 1995 hynes 1975 olson and hawkins 2012 making it problematic to depend on local characteristics to predict the distributions of stream and river species elith et al 2011 show it is possible to conduct analyses in maxent using watershed environmental data using a samples with data approach rather than raster environmental data in this case raster environmental data are summarized in gis by watershed before being joined with occurrence locations and provided to maxent as an array however because delineating the watersheds needed to summarize environmental data is time consuming usually only a limited number of catchments or watersheds are included in these analyses for example bouska et al 2015 utilized a watershed approach but only quantified environmental data for those stream segments that contained a sampling event and therefore only used a subset of available watersheds the stream catchment dataset streamcat hill et al 2016 has enabled the development of summaries of catchment or watershed environments for every individual stream segment over entire regions the ability to measure watershed environmental characteristics for every watershed in a region now allows maxent models to be developed with much better representations of background conditions for lotic systems than have been used in the past while all environments experience change lotic environments are especially dynamic so much that the disturbance regime of a river is an important aspect of its environment poff and allan 1995 resh et al 1988 data from different time periods have been used in maxent however their main purpose has been to hindcast distributions to understand current or future patterns carnaval and moritz 2008 cordellier and pfenninger 2009 or to forecast distributions under climate change scenarios elith et al 2010 kharouba et al 2009 yates et al 2010 to our knowledge no studies have been conducted that utilize ecologically relevant temporal scales i e seasonal inter annual variation to understand current species distributions in freshwater systems although such work has been completed in marine systems olden and neff 2001 wang et al 2018 remotely sensed data can provide a snapshot of environmental conditions at numerous points in time this high temporal resolution has the potential to account for upstream activities on ecologically relevant timescales and allow the building of models that explicitly account for both spatial and temporal variation we hypothesize that accounting for both spatial and temporal variation will improve model performance and result in more precise predictions of species distributions that can be useful to resource managers predictions of species distributions provided by watershed and landscape scale sdms are critical for managers to make informed decisions this is especially true in areas that are developing rapidly but that are still data poor the bureau of land management blm is tasked with managing oil and gas leasing exploration and operations within the national petroleum reserve in alaska usa npr a while sustaining the health diversity and productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations blm 2019 this involves the consideration of the multiple anthropogenic land uses as well as the environmental and habitat needs of a broad suite of species specifically the blm would like to consider the spatial distributions of multiple freshwater fishes in making leasing and management decisions however the npr a is almost entirely roadless making the collection of data extremely difficult and resulting in decisions made with minimal data of fish occurrences or distributions an sdm approach like maxent that can combine remotely sensed watershed characteristics with traditional observations has potential to provide managers with robust estimates of fish distributions and allow better land management decisions these models would be improved if more observations could be made in less sampled areas so we also collected environmental dna edna in these areas riaz et al 2019 showed that utilizing edna in their sdms substantially improved model performance 9 3 increase in true skill statistic tss values we investigated whether and to what extent the combination of edna landscape characterizations from streamcat and the maxent modeling framework can be used to produce reliable predictions of species distributions in this difficult to access and therefore data poor region our primary objective was to apply these advances in landscape analysis and modeling to provide improved estimates of distributions for 19 fish species occurring on the north slope of alaska to managers specifically we sought to 1 develop sdms that predict fish occurrences over the entire landscape using edna streamcat remotely sensed data and maxent 2 compare maxent model performance when characterizing the environment at only a subset of watersheds that contained a sampling event referred to as presence absence pa locations to providing the model with presence locations and watershed data from all possible stream segments referred to as presence background pb locations 3 determine if accounting for seasonal or inter annual temporal variability could improve model performance secondarily we wanted to examine the efficacy of model tuning in maxent by testing the sensitivity of the sdms to different regularization parameters which control the parsimony of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the national petroleum reserve in alaska usa npr a is 95 506 km2 23 5 million acres located on the remote north slope of alaska and contains thousands of miles of streams fig 1 the occurrence presence or absence of 19 fish species table 1 was collected through traditional fish surveys between 1979 and 2016 by numerous federal and state agencies as well as industry the state s dataset was downloaded from the alaska freshwater fish inventory complementary edna surveys began in 2015 bush et al 2017 rodgers et al 2019 2018 these complementary edna surveys were faster and less expensive than traditional surveys and were concentrated in areas that were more data sparse fig 2 a the combined observations did exhibit some amount of spatial clumping thinning clumped observations using a strictly spatial approach i e aiello lammens et al 2015 would likely remove observations that are geographically near each other but are actually environmentally distinct e g sites on a mainstem river and on smaller tributary stream factoring out environmental bias phillips et al 2009 could also address this issue but it cannot be applied to the samples with data approach we used to input river environmental data into maxent so to address potential overrepresentation of sampled streams we collapsed all samples by stream segment which weredefined as stream flowlines between confluences in the national hydrography dataset and had an average length of 12 km stream segments were given a value of one if it had one or more presences during the time period and a zero if no presences were recorded during the time period environmental predictors were assembled from remotely sensed satellite measurements taken between 1979 and 2016 and included measurements of evapotranspiration temperature vegetation water chemistry model predictions and other spatial data table 2 fig 2a supplement a the raw environmental predictors were assembled as a static time series i e averages over the entire time period or as a dynamic time series in the dynamic series satellite data on dynamic scales were only available from 2000 to 2016 and were averaged in two week periods modis collection periods at different lags time of fish occurrence survey two weeks preceding survey four weeks preceding survey six weeks preceding survey and three months preceding survey these lags were used to capture changes in river environments which often lag changes in watersheds by weeks or months including responses of fish recruitment moraes et al 2012 reproduction andrade et al 2013 and water chemistry olson and cormier 2019 the assembled environmental predictors were then run through streamcat hill et al 2016 streamcat website which calculated zonal statistics for each predictor for each individual stream catchment and corresponding cumulative upstream watershed within the study area in total there were 96 static and 50 dynamic environmental predictors see supplement a for complete list 2 2 model development and evaluation species distribution models sdms were developed for each of the 19 species for which occurrence data was collected table 1 and for each dataset type static vs dynamic using a maxent modeling framework many species had a low number of presences five species had fewer than five presences preventing us from being able to withhold a meaningful dataset for external validation we therefore utilized all data to train models and validated models using ten fold cross validation models were built using two different environmental datasets the first used a subset of watersheds where presence and absence observations had been made referred to as presence absence data pa n 176 the second used presence only data in combination with watershed data calculated for every stream segment using streamcat referred to as presence background pb n 2642 because environmental data were provided to maxent in the unit of stream segments rather than as rasters background points also needed to be in the unit of stream segments we provided maxent with the streamcat outputs for all stream segments in the npr a landscape and maxent randomly selected background points i e stream segments from the landscape to use in the model according to maxent s default settings i e up to 10 000 background points to reduce overfitting and increase model parsimony we removed uninformative and correlated predictors from models using an iterative process fig 2b first all predictors were included in the model and their permutation importance and percent contribution were assessed predictors were removed before recalibration if both measures were zero indicating no predictive ability this process was repeated six times each time removing predictors that were not important in the model on the seventh iteration pearson correlations of the remaining predictors were compared for those predictors that had a correlation greater than 0 7 the predictor with the lower permutation importance was removed dormann et al 2013 leathwick et al 2006 maxent allows users to adjust the beta regularization parameter which controls the parsimony of the model by applying a penalty for including additional predictors in the model shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 the default regularization parameter setting is one values less than one reduce the penalty and can increase model complexity and values greater than one increase the penalty and can reduce model complexity following morales et al 2017 and radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we examined how model performance and parsimony changed with a range of regularization parameters 0 25 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 fig 2b each model underwent the aforementioned predictor selection process using each of the listed regularization parameters model performance was assessed by comparing a suite of metrics including area under the receiver operator curve auc pearson correlation coefficient cor maximum correct classification rate ccrmax true positive rate tpr sensitivity true negative rate tnr specificity false positive rate fpr false negative rate fnr true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 and the number of predictors included in the final model for those metrics that are threshold dependent e g tpr tnr fpr fnr the threshold at which sensitivity was equal to specificity i e tpr tnr for that model was used to calculate those metrics we used the threshold at which sensitivity was equal to specificity because we were using the same type of threshold for all 19 species and wanted to use a threshold that would be balanced in terms of optimizing for sensitivity or specificity and would be appropriate to use for all species for the final model we selected the most parsimonious model with an auc similar to or better than the full model if two or more models were similar in this respect their cor tpr tnr and tss were compared to determine which of the models in question was the best models with lower cor and higher tpr tnr and tss values were considered to be better performing once the best regularization parameter was selected response curves also known as partial dependence plots percent contribution and importance and jackknife tests of training testing and auc gains were manually compared to determine if any other predictor s should be removed from the model predictors were removed if the testing training or auc gains without the predictor was higher and the percent contribution and permutation importance for the predictor were less than three the remaining predictors and selected regularization parameter were used to develop the best model for that species model performance was assessed by comparing the number of predictors in the model auc cor ccrmax tpr tnr fpr fnr and tss values if there were fewer than 11 presences for a species the metrics from the final run during model training were used to for evaluation if there were greater than 11 presences for a species the model underwent ten fold cross validation and the average auc cor ccrmax tpr tnr fpr fnr and tss over all ten folds was used for evaluation fig 2b we chose to use ten fold cross validation since it is common practice suitable for both large and small datasets and is commonly recommended because it conservatively estimates performance and avoids the large computational burden of k fold cross validation hastie et al 2009 a priori we decided to use terminology based on delineations in mandrekar 2010 to describe the level of empirical support for a model using the terms poor acceptable excellent and outstanding to correspond to auc values less than 0 7 between 0 7 and 0 8 between 0 8 and 0 9 and greater than 0 9 respectively model performance of the different combinations of static dynamic and pa pb models were compared for the model type with the best overall performance for each species we analyzed the frequency of use direction of response permutation importance and percent contribution of the predictors used for each species model to determine which predictors were the most informative overall specifically we calculated the frequency at which a predictor was used and calculated the average rank of permutation importance and percent contribution for each predictor we summarized the general direction of the response curves i e positive negative none or some combination thereof for the top 12 predictors 2 3 predictions we predicted and mapped likely distributions of each species we made predictions for each stream segment by applying the relevant watershed predictor variables calculated for each stream segment to the best performing model predicted probability of species distributions were then mapped for all stream segments on the north slope of alaska producing maps depicting likely distributions suitable for inclusion in existing decision support tools used for land management decisions by the blm all maps were created using arcmap version 10 6 1 esri 2018 all analyses were executed using maxent version 3 4 1 phillips et al 2017 and r statistical software version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 including the dismo hijmans et al 2017 maxnet phillips 2017 raster hijmans 2017 and sp pebesma and bivand 2005 bivand et al 2013 packages 3 results over all species and datasets an average of 28 2 presences median of 14 range of 2 198 were used to develop excellent models auc 0 8 with relatively high ccrmax rates and satisfactory sensitivity and specificity table 3 supplement b as one would expect the species in question and dataset used impacted model performance and auc and tss values were in relative agreement static datasets utilizing pb data performed the best overall with outstanding model performance average auc 0 9 and average ccrmax sensitivity and specificity all above 0 9 static datasets utilizing pa data had excellent performance average auc between 0 8 and 0 9 average ccrmax above 0 9 and average sensitivity and specificity above 0 86 although the models built from dynamic datasets and utilizing pa occurrence data did not perform as well as the models built using the other two dataset configurations the models still performed well overall the dynamic models had excellent performance average auc between 0 8 and 0 9 and average ccrmax sensitivity and specificity all above 0 8 which consistently outperformed other model and dataset configurations fig 3 see table 3 for summarized model performance metrics by model type supplement b for detailed evaluation metrics of each model by species and supplement c for bean plots summarizing evaluation metrics by model and dataset type similar to anderson and gonzalez 2011 cao et al 2013 morales et al 2017 and shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 and unlike radosavljevic and anderson 2014 the best regularization parameter for nearly all the models developed was between 1 0 and 2 0 the best regularization parameter was 0 5 for 2 of models 1 model 1 0 for 65 of models 37 models 1 5 for 28 of models 16 models and 2 0 for 5 of models 2 models models with regularization parameters between 1 0 and 2 0 were similar in terms of the number of predictors used auc and ccrmax values as the regularization parameter increased the models generally had substantially fewer predictors lower auc values and slightly lower ccrmax values fig 4 the most consistently important and informative predictors related to elevation temperature slope land cover and potential evapotranspiration table 4 the predictors with the best permutation importance rank best percent contribution rank and highest frequency of use across models were catchment scale potential evapotranspiration estimates for 2000 to 2009 average rank 4 0 proportion of the watershed that is carex sedges average rank 3 0 and distance from the centroid of the stream segment to the coastal foothills frequency 13 respectively table 4 supplement e interestingly the most frequently used predictor distance from the centroid of the stream segment to the coastal foothills was among the top ten ranked predictors in terms of permutation importance but was not particularly important in terms of mean rank percent contribution although potential evapotranspiration predictors were not used frequently 2 to 3 models they appeared to be relatively and consistently important when they were included in the model best ranking for permutation importance and the only predictors among the top ones that had a consistently positive effect on the response it is important to note that although similar predictors e g two measures of temperature are present in table 4 that does not mean they were present in the same model rather both predictors were present in one of the best models for one or more of the 19 species for which models were developed additionally if similar predictors were present in the same model the predictor selection process ensured that predictors included in each model were not highly correlated as expected the predicted distributions using the model constructed with static pb data varied by species some species were predicted to occur across a large portion of the north slope of alaska e g ninespine stickleback pungitius pungitius chum salmon oncorhynchus keta see fig 5 a and 5b respectively whereas other species were predicted to occur in smaller regions within the study area e g coastal plain for least cisco coregonus sardinella foothills for dolly varden char salvelinus malma see fig 5c and 5d respectively see supplement f for maps of model predictions of static datasets utilizing pb data for all species and supplement g for descriptive statistics of all predictors used in the best model type i e models constructed with static datasets utilizing pb data 4 discussion using watershed characterizations of the environment from all stream segments as background instead of using watersheds only calculated for places where observations were made improves prediction accuracy for species occurring on the north slope of alaska this work also demonstrates how the utilization of landscape characterizations of stream networks via satellite imagery and streamcat in combination with maxent can result in informative sdms of freshwater ecosystems at the stream segment scale by using these methods to extrapolate from traditional or edna survey methods freshwater stream ecologists and managers can develop an understanding of species distributions over entire landscapes in a manner that is fiscally and temporally efficient spatially explicit predictions can illuminate which habitats in the landscape are the most suitable for species of ecological or economic interest and inform where development should be avoided temporally specific predictions can account for seasonal or inter annual variability of species distributions throughout the landscape using a more holistic understanding of species distributions can inform management decisions better than only using survey data that might be biased by climatic conditions e g wet cold or seasonal distribution factors at the time of the survey while using dynamic datasets did improve performance of pa models for some species the improvements were not substantial enough overall for us to pursue the implementation of dynamic datasets with pb models we recognize the potential for improvement in auc or tss values had we implemented models with dynamic datasets utilizing pb data however since we achieved more than satisfactory models for all species with static datasets the cost to develop pb models with dynamic datasets was deemed prohibitive calculating watershed averages for entire landscapes for a static dataset and pb model is non trivial the number of calculations being equal to the product of the number of variables of interest e g 96 in our case and the number of watersheds e g approximately 3000 on the north slope of alaska the cost to calculate watershed averages for entire landscapes for a dynamic dataset and pb model is quickly exacerbated the number of calculations for this study was the product of the number of variables of interest 50 variables the number of watersheds 3000 watersheds the number of time points 8 months representing the sampling season and the number of years in the dataset 15 years for this study producing pb models would require making 288 000 calculations to produce our static dataset and 18 000 000 calculations to produce a dynamic dataset a 6150 increase there is also the question of how to determine which background points should be selected over all time periods should locations be selected randomly over all time periods if so should random locations be equally distributed over all time periods with all of this in mind we recommend the use of dynamic datasets with pa models and considering their use with pb models in situations where traditional static datasets do not produce adequate models should we have employed methods that utilized raster datasets e g maps rather than arrays methods to generate background points based on geographical distance from occurrence locations and the potential habitat rather than random selection can be used hengl et al 2009 however employing such methods does not necessarily address the questions posed above related to selecting background points over multiple time periods ideally sdms would be developed from large comprehensive and representative sampling efforts over the entire study area maxent is very well suited for when the best case scenario does not exist here we show that using maxent as it was intended with background points in leu of absences resulted in models that outperformed those developed using presence absence datasets this finding supports the conclusion of guillera arroita et al 2014 that using absence data in maxent models is not best practice one reason for this could be that in our study the survey locations and therefore absence locations were not completely randomly distributed over the landscape the utilization of background points enables a better representation of the actual environment which is the key to developing superior performing models but depends on being able to characterize the environments of individual stream segments across the entire landscape of interest our approach which employed satellite imagery streamcat and maxent modeling can be implemented regardless of the terrain and is efficient and effective in terms of the cost of implementation and model performance it is also important to note the tendency of models with a small number of presences to have higher performance metrics the starkest example of this was for arctic lamprey lethenteron camtschaticum which had two presences and received both an auc and tss of 1 0 for the model that utilized static datasets and presence background data we acknowledge that there are serious limitations associated with models that are developed using so few presences according to van proosdij et al 2016 narrow ranged species should have an absolute minimum of three samples none of the arctic lamprey models were able to meet this minimum models of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and longnose sucker catostomus were also based on few presences 4 and 6 respectively but because these species are at low prevalence at the edges of their range these models are within the thresholds used by van proosdij et al 2016 we consider these models to be informative for the blm in that they are better than having nothing at all however our confidence in their predictions is substantially reduced we recommend these data poor models be used in combination with known biological information for those species as an additional line of evidence indicating the likelihood of a species being present criticisms of maxent include its propensity to overfitting and the lack of research on the sensitivity of maxent to adjustments in its regularization parameter merow et al 2013 morales et al 2017 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 our results suggest that for the species analyzed in this study accepting the default regularization parameter will likely result in the best performing model although the average output for one modeling framework may be better than the others the model results among species and between methods can be markedly different while our regularization parameter results may differ from anderson and gonzalez 2011 and radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we still encourage users to investigate the sensitivity of regularization parameters and go through the tuning process in their contexts as a form of best practice additionally renner and warton 2013 outline a number of additional criticism of maxent such as its lack of model based framework diagnostic tools and scale independence and recommend the use of poisson point process models in lieu of maxent since those methods can address said criticisms while producing similar results while a comparison of maxent and poisson point process models was outside the scope of this study the points renner and warton 2013 make are compelling future maxent studies should consider comparing these two methods with a variety of different datasets so we can better understand when it is most appropriate to use each method combining remotely sensed data and streamcat to estimate watershed environmental aspects influencing fish distributions such as average yearly maximum temperature and slope has important ecological implications and applications for example it is well established that temperature influences the behavior e g distribution migration sociality bartolini et al 2015 physiology e g growth jobling 1997 and reproduction pankhurst and munday 2011 of fish we demonstrated that these coarse landscape variables can effectively capture ecological processes and allow us to successfully predict fish distributions in remote landscapes without needing in situ measurements of environmental conditions the inclusion of temperature and slope among the most important predictors across all species supports well established ecological relationships jackson et al 2001 and the effectiveness of this novel combination of methods temperature and slope also had the greatest contribution to models of 28 fish species across southwestern france buisson et al 2008 the importance of potential evapotranspiration as a predictor also likely reflects the influence of hydrological mechanisms and demonstrates their utility as predictors in sdms the importance of predictors such as the proportion of the watershed that is arctophila arctic grass or the proportion of the catchment that is tussocks bunch grasses are less intuitive we currently do not have a mechanistic understanding of why these predictors are related to fish distributions but suspect they are likely surrogates for biotic interactions such as predation and competition jackson et al 2001 vezza et al 2015 or mechanistic factors we cannot measure more directly with remote sensing such as soil chemistry or groundwater influence amis et al 2007 bush et al 2017 5 conclusions the combination of edna landscape characterizations from streamcat and maxent modeling to develop sdms can produce reliable predictions of species distributions in data poor regions approaches like this have great potential for providing critically needed data in rapidly developing but data poor regions like the north slope of alaska africa and south america from the management perspective it is imperative to remember that one size certainly does not fit all it is crucial to consider management objectives modeling methods and modeling outputs for species on a case by case basis once models are developed utilizing predictions of species distributions over the entire landscape including previously inaccessible areas can and should be used to inform management decisions future work will include utilizing individual species models to estimate the richness of freshwater fishes over the entire landscape so managers can develop decisions using a more holistic view of species distributions over the landscape moreover bouska et al 2015 showed that ensemble modeling methods can outperform individual modeling methods although we did not pursue these methods here future work for the blm will investigate ensemble methods similar to riaz et al 2019 to determine which method will best suit their management needs and a comparison of these results with the results of other machine learning methods e g random forests that can better utilize absence data declaration of competing interest none

24768,between 1980 and 2012 successive arrivals by three alien ecosystem engineers on a rocky shore community at marcus island on the west coast of south africa led to substantial changes in species composition and diversity an ecosystem analysis of this open intertidal system was developed using ecopath with ecosim to determine the impacts of these aliens and the services they provide on the native community a baseline ecopath model of the community in 2015 was generated using values of biomass production biomass consumption biomass and the dietary composition of 30 functional groups ecosim a time dynamic modelling routine was then used to simulate the changes in biomass of native species a 1980 model pre invasion was constructed and 22 simulations were run up to 2015 by systematically adding 1 biomass time series for non native species 2 relative biomass time series for native species 3 mediation functions that mimicked biomass impacts due to changes in substrate shelter and feeding grounds created by the alien ecosystem engineers and 4 the effects of wave action as a source of mortality positive or negative influences of these ecological processes on diversity and the final biomasses of all groups in 2015 were assessed trophic impacts by the alien species affected diversity and biomass at the end of all simulations but the addition of shelter or a combination of all three ecosystem services provided by ecosystem engineers shelter substrate and feeding grounds resulted in 2015 model ecosystems that most closely matched the diversity and individual group biomasses empirically measured on marcus island in 2015 wave action had only a minor impact marcus island s rocky shore community was therefore driven mainly by the fixed input of alien species biomass and made more realistic by the incorporation of their ecosystem services however structural complexity and zonation explored in a follow up paper invoking spatial modelling need to be represented for a more complete realisation of the ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords barnacles ecopath with ecosim ecosystem engineer intertidal invasive mussels 1 introduction structural complexity or the maximum amount of volumetric space available for individuals to inhabit is correlated with rocky shore invertebrate species richness and abundance tokeshi

2015 as ecosystem engineers can alter this complexity the arrival of alien species with this capability can alter the trophic dynamics of an ecosystem considerably three non native species that have invaded south africa s rocky shores in the western cape are ecosystem engineers that can affect the biodiversity of intertidal communities robinson et al 2020 this was clearly demonstrated by sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 and also proposed in previous studies of the effects of the alien mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis ruiz sebastián et al 2002 robinson et al 2007 the bisexual mussel semimytilus algosus tokeshi and romero 1995 and the pacific barnacle balanus glandula harley 2006 harley and o riley 2011 besides changes to native biodiversity due to modulation of access to resources ecosystem engineers may also alter 1 the amount of surface area or substrate beck 1998 kostylev and erlandsson 2001 frost et al 2005 kostylev et al 2005 gestoso et al 2013 2 the amount of empty space or shelter sadchatheeswaran et al 2019a b and 3 feeding ground available to other species all three services collectively can be ascribed to structural complexity related to interstitial gaps or substrate surface area when habitat plays such a notable role in shaping the biomass abundance and diversity of native species it is important to understand how changes induced by the arrival of habitat altering alien species can affect the major functional groups in the already harsh environment of intertidal shores marcus island on the west coast of south africa offers unique quantitative data on intertidal community composition prior to the invasion by three habitat altering alien species namely m galloprovincialis s algosus and b glandula using these data it is possible to explore the impacts of alien ecosystem engineers and the various services they provide the first set of data was collected in 1980 before any non native species were quantified on marcus island a second data set was gathered in 2001 when the abundance of m galloprovincialis was first quantified at this site robinson et al 2007 marcus island was then studied a third time in 2012 at which point the invasive s algosus and b glandula were detected sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 finally a biomonitoring programme sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 was undertaken quarter annually from 2014 to 2016 ecosystem engineering can increase or decrease the amount of protective space for prey which will increase or decrease their vulnerability to predators this relationship can be mimicked by way of mediation functions in the ecopath with ecosim ewe software mediation functions involve three groups two of which form a predator prey relationship and a third in this case ecosystem engineers that affects the feeding rate between the first two either by facilitating the availability of prey to the predator group or by protecting the prey from the predator group dill et al 2003 christensen and walters 2004 the mediation function thus changes the trophic flow rate or the amount of prey biomass consumed by the predator at each time step christensen et al 2008 espinosa romero et al 2011 in this paper an ecopath food web model was developed for the wave exposed rocky shore community at marcus island on the west coast of south africa the ecopath model provides a static snapshot baseline representation of an ecosystem using information about biomass production consumption migration and feeding relationships of species christensen and walters 2004 the first stage in model development was to find a sensible approach for quantitatively recreating an intertidal system dominated by ecosystem engineers two baseline models of marcus island in 2015 and 1980 were parameterized using data collected on site or available from literature thereafter the ecosim routine of ewe 6 5 was used to simulate firstly trophic and non trophic impacts of ecosystem engineers on marcus island s ecological structure and functioning and secondly extra mortality caused by wave action the former was done by forcing the biomass of alien invaders in the temporal model and invoking the mediation routine of ecosim in an attempt to capture the role of ecosystem engineers in structurally protecting prey from predators and by rendering prey less vulnerable to these predators thus increasing predators searching effort for their prey wave action was modelled i across the full rocky shore and ii only on vulnerable species that occupy certain zones of the rocky shore in this way non trophic spatial processes on this rocky shore were tackled within the capacity of the non spatial trophic model the objectives of our study were to 1 explore trophic processes associated with the arrival of the three alien species 2 examine the contributions of other ecological processes caused by alien ecosystem engineers and 3 determine whether the potential impacts of structural complexity could be fully simulated via non spatially explicit functions that mediate predator prey interactions in the modelled food web our paper is novel in two respects firstly it makes use of a unique data set that traces sequential invasion of an island rocky shore ecosystem by three alien species secondly it advances the normal application of ewe to trophic analyses by incorporating trophic effects and non trophic drivers provision of shelter substrate and feeding grounds consecutively and cumulatively to study the potential impacts of both ecosystem engineers and wave action on the ecosystem 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and trophic models the southern facing shore of marcus island in saldanha bay is a moderately exposed intertidal and rocky study area like all exposed rocky shores in south africa it is dominated largely by a community of filter feeders and predators are relatively scarce mcquaid and branch 1985 as demonstrated in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 invasions by m galloprovincialis and to a lesser degree b glandula and s algosus had large ecosystem engineering effects robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 particularly in the mid to low shore the shore is not subject to any harvesting as it falls in a national park and the island is not accessible to the public as a result we did not consider fishing among the stressors the system experiences two trophic models of the study site on marcus island s intertidal area were built using ecopath with ecosim version 6 5 ewe christensen et al 2005 details of the modelling approach can be found in appendices a1 and a2 these models represent marcus island s ecosystem 1 in 2015 post invasion to establish biomasses with which model simulations could be compared and 2 in 1980 pre invasion which served as a starting point for forward simulations using ecosim mediation functions run for 35 years 1980 2015 both models were limited to the same area of 452 m2 a 25 m stretch of rocky shore extending between low spring tide and the upper limit of wave splash with a maximum water depth at high tide of 2 42 m 2 2 parameterization of the 2015 ecopath model the baseline ecopath model of marcus island comprised 30 groups table 1 table a1 the same groups were incorporated in the 1980 model table a2 most of the groups are self explanatory but some are amplified in the following paragraph catch all groups were employed for a polychaete spp b other limpet spp c small arthropod spp and d other seaweed names of species involved are listed as a footnote to table a1 three species the alien mussel m galloprovincialis the native ribbed mussel aulacomya atra and the native granular limpet scutellastra granularis were split into two multi stanza groups each based on length of shell or age table a3 because these species were abundant their juveniles and adults were preyed upon by different predators and they contributed differently to complexity marcus island exhibits strong zonation robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 but in this baseline model functional groups were treated as if they were evenly spread throughout the study site for most consumer groups wet biomass estimates g m 2 were derived from measurements made on marcus island of the average fresh whole body mass of individuals or areas 10 cm 10 cm completely covered by colonial species which were then multiplied by the observed mean abundance or cover m 2 table a1 it was assumed that the two bird species in the model spend less than 100 of their feeding time on marcus island and so only 70 of haematopus moquini biomass and 30 of larus dominicanus biomass was used in the 2015 model although intertidal fish species mainly clinidae and gobiidae commonly occur on south african west coast shores prochazka and griffiths 1992 they have not been observed at the study site therefore they were included in this model as a generic fish group with a very low biomass estimate to capture potential predation by these fish as occurs on other rocky shores choromytilus meridionalis more commonly found subtidally used to occur as a dominant intertidal filter feeder on marcus island but since 2012 has not been found there and so biomass was estimated to be very low these estimates and others that were collected from literature or estimated by ecopath appear in table a1 production biomass p b values for all mollusc echinoderm arthropod and annelid species were calculated using artificial neural network models that can be downloaded from brey 2001 all other p b values year 1 and all consumption biomass q b values year 1 were sourced from published models shannon et al 2003 arbach leloup et al 2008 watermeyer et al 2008 ortiz et al 2013 or from an unpublished south african model of mussel beds stobie 2002 input values and the sources used to parameterize the baseline model are listed in supplementary tables a1 and a2 diet compositions for model groups were available from literature but were adjusted for prey availability on marcus island table a4 confidence in the values collected to create the baseline model i e biomass production biomass consumption biomass and diet composition was assessed with a pedigree index the overall pedigree index of the model represents the model s robustness and is calculated by assigning pre determined confidence intervals or parameter uncertainties to each input parameter data collected at the model site for specific model groups were given a parameter uncertainty of only 10 grading through to as much as 80 uncertainty if the data were estimated by ecopath the ecological roles of functional groups were analysed via mixed trophic impact and keystone analyses mixed trophic impact analysis graphically displays the net direct and indirect trophic impacts of all functional groups on one another ulanowicz and puccia 1990 keystone analyses compare relative total impact of each functional group using keystone indices of which we employed three ks1 libralato et al 2006 ks2 power et al 1996 and ks3 valls et al 2015 these indices all combine measures of the mixed trophic impact of each model group with estimates of its relative biomass valls et al 2015 the methods differ only in the way in which biomass contributions are incorporated in the index as indicated in the following equations ks 1 i log ε i 1 p i ks 2 i log ε i 1 p i ks 3 i log ε i drank b i ksi is the keystone index of the group or species i under consideration ε i is the overall impact of i on all other groups apart from itself derived from the mixed trophic impact analysis p i is the proportional contribution of group i to the total biomass in the foodweb and drank b i is the rank of the biomass of i in descending order 2 3 parameterization of the 1980 ecopath model the 1980 model incorporated the same predators filter feeders grazers zooplankton primary producers detritus catch all and multi stanza groups mentioned in section 2 2 table a2 it was again assumed that the two bird species in the model spend less than 100 of their feeding time on marcus island but given that h moquini in particular was less abundant on west coast islands in 1980 prior to the arrival of m galloprovincialis hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 only 45 of h moquini biomass was used in the model two detritus groups were generated from consumers and primary producers respectively table a2 dietary compositions for all groups were adjusted for prey availability on marcus island in 1980 table a5 import of consumer detritus in the 1980 model was set at 0 g m 2 year 1 but 50000 g m 2 year 1 of primary production pp detritus was imported table a6 this value required to balance the model amounted to approximately the flow to primary producer detritus 67386 80 g m 2 year 1 although alien species were not present on marcus island in 1980 they were included in this model with very low biomasses 0 01 g m 2 so that species invasion could be modelled over time as in the 2015 model all groups were treated as if they were evenly spread across the study site the 2015 values of production biomass p b consumption biomass q b and where required ecotrophic efficiencies ee of each functional group were used in the 1980 model p b and q b values were adjusted by a conversion factor of 0 98 to compensate for differences in sea surface temperature sst in 1980 15 66 c and 2015 16 63 c clark et al 2009 to balance the model plankton group ee values were set at 0 99 and net migration was calculated by ecopath to simulate the effects of waves a fishing fleet was created that could cause mortality by fishing out a certain percentage of each group the groups that were removed by wave action were those that predominantly occupy the low shore the magnitude of the removals per group by wave action was initially set low 0 00001 g m 2 year 1 so that fishing mortality was negligible until manually increased as desired 2 4 ecosim parameterization to investigate how trophic and non trophic impacts have changed the dynamics of the intertidal rocky shore at marcus island from 1980 pre invasion to 2015 post invasion 22 simulations were run using ecosim christensen and walters 2004 table 2 details of the ecosim modelling procedure are described in appendix a2 these explored the trophic impacts φ of each non native ecosystem engineer small and large mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis bisexual mussel s algosus and the barnacle b glandula and their combined effects all the trophic impacts x of 15 selected native groups the non trophic

simulation was run in which wave action removed 10 of the total biomass of select low shore groups every month between january 1980 and december 2015 ω1 to examine the possible impacts of large storms on different groups three ecosim simulations were run by once again removing 10 of the total biomass each month but with additional once off 30 ω2 40 ω3 and 50 ω4 losses of low shore biomass in each of the following known storm events june 1994 september 2001 august 2008 june 2009 and august 2012 2 4 1 time series of non native ecosystem engineers all three non native species are highly invasive along the length of the west coast of south africa and have outcompeted some species for food or space but have boosted the populations of others by increasing substrate shelter and or food to represent this annual biomass time series for each ecosystem engineer were created biomasses of species recorded on marcus island were available only for 1980 2001 and 2012 2015 however information on m galloprovincialis recruitment elsewhere along the coast was available from which recruitment patterns could be deduced in 1980 none of the non native species were recognized on the shore and so this time period was designated as pre invasion in 1984 m galloprovincialis experienced a recruitment boom of at least 1 5 million recruits m 2 on the west coast of south africa branch unpublished data reaugh flower et al 2011 this constituted a massive injection of recruitment that declined to approximately 79000 individuals m 2 in 1995 and 6150 individuals m 2 in 1998 fig a1 recruitment increased slightly to 29000 individuals m 2 in 1999 and then decreased to very small amounts in the 2012 2015 period approximately 2300 individuals m 2 branch unpublished data this recruitment information was used as input to the egg production variable in ecosim resulting in a varying biomass for small m galloprovincialis from 1980 to 2015 however the model outputs severely under estimated the abundance of m galloprovincialis adults observed on marcus island as a result the shape of the recruitment curve was instead used to influence estimates of mussel biomass with the peak recruitment in 1984 being set to correspond to a peak biomass estimate of 50000 g m 2 for small and large m galloprovincialis combined which realistically approximated the maximal biomass recorded on marcus island followed by a decline in biomass that tracked the progressive reduction in recruitment which was also realistic in terms of biomass values recorded at various times on marcus island fig 1 table a7 separate time series were generated for both small and large m galloprovincialis using the approximation that the biomass of large m galloprovincialis was 84 of the biomass of small m galloprovincialis at each time step prior to 2013 small and large m galloprovincialis were not measured separately and so their biomass ratio was calculated from the mean biomass of small 30 mm 3176 22 g m 2 and large 30 mm 2668 03 g m 2 mussels in 2015 as ecosim modelling was used to simulate the ecosystem dynamics resulting in the 2015 model ecosystem the 2015 biomass of large m galloprovincialis the non leading multi stanza of the m galloprovincialis group was set to the amount estimated by ecopath in the static 2015 model 4137 97 g m 2 recruitment data were not available for s algosus or b glandula and so historical population trends of biomass from 1980 to 2014 were constructed from abundance values collected in 2012 2015 with very low values 0 01 g m 2 allocated to the period 1980 2009 prior to the first records of these species on marcus island since the biomasses at specific dates 1980 2001 2012 2014 and 2015 were known all ecosystem engineer biomasses were input to ecosim as type 1 or forced biomass driving ecosim s temporal simulations from 1980 to 2015 for time steps where biomass data were not available biomass was linearly interpolated between the time steps with known biomasses table a7 2 4 2 time series of native groups time series biomass data included estimates for 15 native groups that were considered important indicator species or that had strong relative trophic impacts on other groups data from these were obtained during visits to marcus island between 1980 and 2015 table a7 and biomass values gathered from the 2015 ecopath model to fit the temporal simulations from 1980 to 2015 these values were denoted as type 0 or relative biomasses in ecosim and used as an input to simulation x see following section for notation superimposed on the combined effects of the alien species φ all therefore the trophic relationships between groups could change with the forced biomass of the engineers but could also be constrained by the time series of the native groups this was used to minimize the sum of squares between the model and observations because the time series of the native groups were denoted as relative biomass values could be omitted from the model in years for which we did not have biomass values for particular groups table a7 2 4 3 mediation using structural complexity the non trophic impacts provided by ecosystem engineers in this case mussel and barnacle groups were linked to changes in structural complexity which altered three habitat driven services on the rocky shores substrate surface area for attachment shelter gaps that house and protect species and feeding grounds efficiency with which consumers search for food as they become more or less abundant in complex habitats substrate and shelter affect the vulnerability of prey whereas feeding grounds in general affect the search rate of consumers these impacts were included in the experimental simulations ψ1 ψ4 with ecosim via mediation mediators were the non native ecosystem engineers categorised into three mussel groups small and large m galloprovincialis and s algosus barnacle and all which included all four groups as recommended by harvey 2014 two types of sigmoidal functions were used to modify the predator prey relationship with the mediation functions table a8 both are based on sigmoidal functions and use four parameters a minimum and maximum y value a scaling parameter and a parameter that determines the steepness of the slope harvey 2014 one set of functions m1 m3 m5 increased predator search rate as the biomass of the mediator increased fig 2 a whereas the other set m2 m4 m6 decreased prey vulnerability with an increase in mediator biomass fig 2b personal observations expert input and results from sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 helped to determine which function affected which predator prey relationship per ecosystem service table a9 one caveat is that the function that increased predator search rate with an increase in mussel m1 was also used to increase the vulnerability of c meridionalis this was done in an attempt to specifically drive c meridionalis to negligible levels within the model it was the only native species that had disappeared from marcus island by 2012 possibly because it was outcompeted from the primary substrate by the invasive m galloprovincialis and excluded from secondary substrate created by the alien mussels but also because of regular recruitment failure of c meridionalis in the intertidal zone griffiths 1981 for each group mediators were given a weight to represent their relative contribution to structural complexity and thus their relative impact on the vulnerability of prey or search rate of predators in the mussel mediator group all mussels were given a collective weight of 1 as sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 demonstrated that when all species of mussels were found together even where m galloprovincialis was dominant they form complex multi layer beds and contribute to structural complexity equally fig 2c b glandula was given a weight of 1 when it was the lone mediator in the mediator group barnacle however for the all group a weighted average was calculated via a set of tests in blender 2 74 a 3d modelling program blender foundation 2012 which showed that the average ratio of complexity created by mussels to that created by barnacles was 1 0 35 therefore the relative weights of each of the mussels in the all group were 1 whereas barnacles had a weight of 0 35 table a8 fig 2c 2 4 4 wave action personal observations and expert input indicated that normal levels of wave action can remove 10 of the background levels of the biomass of functional groups commonly associated with the low shore every month observations on marcus island on may 9 2016 demonstrated that a large winter storm can remove 30 to 50 of the biomass of low shore groups during a single event wave data for sites between cape point and saldanha bay were obtained from the council for scientific and industrial research csir stellenbosch rossouw et al unpublished data these data included the dates from 1980 to 2015 that had the five greatest significant wave heights which are a proxy for high energy storms june 21 1994 september 5 2001 august 31 2008 june 24 2009 and august 12 2012 these were set as large winter storm episodes in ecosim simulations described in section 2 5 2 5 ecosim simulation to determine best fit first an ecosim simulation was run without any forcing to see how the ecosystem would function without any non native species over a period of 35 years from 1980 to 2015 after this input data for trophic and non trophic interactions were added sequentially to the 1980 ecopath model in ecosim and also run for 35 years simulations χ and ψ required fitting to time series christensen and walters 2004 in which the vulnerabilities of all prey of the predators consumers with time series were adjusted table 3 for each of the 22 simulations table 2 the change in biomass over time was analysed for groups that had a relative total impact on all other groups greater than 0 5 in 1980 and for groups on which the ecosystem engineers had the most positive or negative impact in the final 2015 model according to the mixed trophic impact analysis to determine which simulation was best able to replicate the 2015 ecopath model biomass values of all functional groups for simulations in which all engineers were included were compared with the 2015 biomass values table 1 sum of squares ss akaike s information criterion aic and prey vulnerabilities v per predator were calculated where applicable following heymans et al 2016 values of the shannon wiener diversity index h and pielou s evenness index j were also calculated for each simulation 3 results 3 1 comparisons of the 1980 and 2015 models the 1980 pre invasion model and the 2015 post invasion baseline model fig 3 a b had much in common the pedigree indices of both were 0 27 indicating a low to medium level of confidence in parameter values compared to other models reported by coll et al 2006 which had indices of 0 16 to 0 68 both the 1980 and 2015 models spanned trophic levels tls from 1 00 to 3 03 primary producers and detritus groups comprised tl 1 00 grazers and micro zooplankton emerged as 2 00 to 2 06 filter feeders had a tl of 2 02 and predators occupied 2 16 to 3 03 the same top predators the oystercatcher h moquini dogwhelk n dubia and anemone b reynaudi were shared by both models the trophic arrangement was flat and linear rather than web like with very low tls overall and 23 30 functional groups were primary producers and detritus at the lowest tl or filter feeders and grazers at a tl of 2 1 ecotrophic efficiencies ee of most groups in the 1980 and 2015 models were low tables a1 a2 none of the groups production was exported from the system thus the ees were attributed to consumption by predators within the system of the 30 functional groups in the 2015 baseline model table a1 the five with the greatest ees estimated by ecopath and thus emerging as heavily utilized in the ecosystem were small mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis ee 0 99 small granular limpet s granularis 0 96 large ribbed mussel a atra 0 87 large m galloprovincialis 0 80 and phytoplankton 0 79 in the 1980 model phytoplankton and micro zooplankton ee values were set at 0 99 and net migration calculated by ecopath table a6 the five functional groups that sustained the greatest consumption by predators as estimated by ecopath table a2 were the small granular limpet s granularis ee 0 97 primary producer detritus 0 95 sea lettuce ulva 0 94 large ribbed mussel a atra 0 91 and large mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis 0 91 consumer detritus which was generated within the system not imported into it had a relatively low ee of 0 38 the net migration rate for micro zooplankton was estimated by ecopath to be 691 42 year 1 which exceeded by 50 the p b value of 472 36 year 1 for this group and 300 25 year 1 for phytoplankton which was double the p b value of 151 31 year 1 for phytoplankton tables a2 and a6 these negative migration values indicate imports i e immigration of plankton generated outside the system across the boundaries of the model the major differences between the two models emerged at intermediate tls as the 1980 model represented marcus island before invasion by non native groups small and large mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis bisexual mussel s algosus pacific barnacle b glandula these aliens were absent in the 1980 model and set at very low values of 0 01 g m 2 at the start the black mussel choromytilus meridionalis had the greatest biomass of all functional groups 17024 49 g m 2 in 1980 but had disappeared by 2015 other changes were the arrival of s algosus and b glandula a decline in the ribbed mussel a atra and increases in other seaweeds anemones and the granular limpet s granularis flows to the oystercatcher altered from predominantly c meridionalis to m galloprovincialis the dogwhelk nucella dubia changed from a diet of predominantly ribbed mussels a atra to one of small m galloprovincialis and the barnacle b glandula and the anemone b reynaudi switched from mainly consuming the indigenous mussels c meridionalis and a atra to a diet of largely small m galloprovincialis 3 2 trophic impact analyses in the 1980 model fig 4 a the five living groups with the greatest relative total impact were the anemone b reynaudi 1 00 oystercatcher h moquini 0 72 black mussel c meridionalis 0 72 gull l dominicanus 0 60 and polychaetes 0 54 through sit and wait predation b reynaudi had direct negative impacts on small arthropods 0 97 polychaetes 0 83 and the whelk b lagenaria 0 65 and by preying on polychaetes and to a smaller degree on the dogwhelk n dubia it had an indirect but positive impact on h perlevis 0 87 in the 2015 model fig 4b the five living groups with the greatest relative total impact again included h moquini 1 00 polychaetes 0 51 and b reynaudi 0 47 to which were added n dubia 0 50 and small m galloprovincialis 0 60 the most obvious change was the substantial influences of small and large m galloprovincialis largely replacing the previous effects of the indigenous mussels c meridionalis and a atra small m galloprovincialis had positive effects on b reynaudi 0 30 and l dominicanus 0 28 and through competition for particulates negative influences on all groups of mussels including itself 0 34 to 0 39 of the aliens large m galloprovincialis had a notable relative total impact 0 26 with negative effects on all limpet groups 0 10 for all groups but few strong positive impacts notably for h moquini 0 15 based on the above the functional groups that were included in temporal simulations were h moquini l dominicanus n dubia polychaetes b reynaudi small a atra c meridionalis large s granularis a knysnaensis and small arthropods 3 3 identification of keystone groups the relative total impacts of all functional groups present in 1980 and 2015 were compared using three keystone indicators power et al 1996 libralato et al 2006 valls et al 2015 which are described in section 2 2 in 1980 fig 5 a indicator ks1 libralato et al 2006 identified the oystercatcher h moquini anemone b reynaudi gull l dominicanus polychaetes and large s granularis as keystone groups but not the black mussel c meridionalis which was disqualified as its biomass was disproportionately large relative to its effect indicator ks2 power et al 1996 denoted h moquini polychaetes micro zooplankton the sponge h perlevis and small arthropods indicator ks3 valls et al 2015 demonstrated more expectedly that h moquini polychaetes b reynaudi the dogwhelk n dubia and l dominicanus in that order had the greatest keystone values thus h moquini and polychaetes were identified by all three keystone indicators as having high keystone values most of the groups singled out had multiple strong effects on other groups with the exception of micro zooplankton h perlevis and small arthropods which consistently had weak effects and were rated as keystone species only by indicator ks2 in the 2015 model fig 5b indicator ks1 identified h moquini polychaetes n dubia b reynaudi and despite its relatively large biomass small m galloprovincialis as keystone groups indicator ks2 singled out h moquini and n dubia among the top five keystone groups along with l dominicanus micro zooplankton and p angulosus indicator ks3 identified h moquini polychaetes n dubia small s granularis and l dominicanus overall groups that were most consistently identified were h moquini b reynaudi n dubia and l dominicanus and polychaetes and there were no striking differences between the pre and post invasion periods except for the addition of small m galloprovincialis by one indicator 3 4 temporal simulations 3 4 1 trophic impact of non native ecosystem engineers φ in the first temporal simulation only the biomass time series for small m galloprovincialis drove the model from 1980 to 2015 of the selected functional groups only the dogwhelk n dubia polychaetes and anemone b reynaudi increased quite rapidly in response before decreasing exhibiting maximum biomasses at the peak of small m galloprovincialis invasion fig a2 φ smm surprisingly the gull l dominicanus which preys on small m galloprovincialis was among the least affected groups which also included small ribbed mussels a atra and black mussels c meridionalis small arthropods reacted negatively initially but then returned to their 1980 biomass a knysnaensis and large s granularis biomasses scarcely changed but fluctuated from 1982 onwards fig a2 φ smm the same trends were demonstrated when the biomass of only large m galloprovincialis was forced except for the fact that the reactions were not as extreme fig a2 φ lmm only h moquini reacted more strongly to the change in large m galloprovincialis biomass increasing to a conservative maximum of 53 32 g m 2 in 1995 n dubia b reynaudi and polychaete spp tracked the rise and fall of m galloprovincialis most closely when the biomass of s algosus was forced b reynaudi and polychaete spp increased and decreased late in the time series coincident with the late arrival and decline of s algosus fig a2 φ bim but the response was much less than that associated with the increase and subsequent decrease of m galloprovincialis unsurprisingly large s granularis reacted to the invasion by b glandula by fluctuating in biomass post invasion but surprisingly so did a knysnaensis a group with no trophic connection to b glandula fig a2 φ bar in the simulation where the biomasses of all four alien ecosystem engineers were forced the trophic impacts of small m galloprovincialis and to a lesser extent large m galloprovincialis overwhelmed the effects of s algosus and b glandula fig a2 φ all however the arrival of s algosus appeared to create a slight increase in polychaete and b reynaudi biomass in 2012 in this simulation the 2015 biomasses generated from the φ all simulation were compared to the 2015 biomasses measured on marcus island table 4 φ 5b model biomasses were considered implausibly high if they were over triple the biomasses measured on the island and implausibly low if they were less than a quarter the measured biomasses of the 26 native functional groups six in the ecosim simulation had implausibly large biomasses while three had a lower than realistic biomass the group that differed most radically from acceptable levels c meridionalis should have decreased to negligible levels instead it increased slightly with an increase in small and large m galloprovincialis and then decreased to almost the same as its biomass in 1980 p angulosus also had excessively high biomasses 3 4 2 trophic impacts of native groups x this ecosim simulation x was run with the addition of the relative biomasses of 15 native functional groups to all the forced biomasses of the non native species the base sum of squares ss of this simulation was 530 10 and after fitting only decreased to 452 54 representing a 14 improvement in the model table 4 the groups that contributed the most to the final ss were c meridionalis n dubia and p angulosus i e the groups that had a particularly poor fit to the observed data fig a2 x when 2015 biomasses generated from this simulation were compared with those measured on marcus island in 2015 seven of the functional groups had an implausibly high biomass whereas three had unrealistically low biomasses table 4 x 5b in this run c meridionalis and p angulosus biomasses were once again the groups that differed the most from expectations compared to the previous simulation in which only the ecosystem engineer biomasses were utilized φ all the 2015 biomasses of the false limpet siphonaria capensis generated in this simulation x were considered low but came closer to the biomass measured on marcus island in 2015 table 4 3 4 3 non trophic impact of substrate ψ1 the time series of all ecosystem engineers and native groups was included in all subsequent simulations the first mediator examined in terms of substrate provision was mussel the mediation function was applied to small s granularis and all the primary producers except porphyra spp and phytoplankton table a9 when mussels acted as substrate only periwinkle a knysnaensis biomasses changed relative to the simulations of the trophic impacts described above and were a better fit to observed data fig a3 ψ1 mus the same was true when barnacle was set as the mediator fig a3 ψ1 bar as such there was no appreciable difference in change of biomass over time in any of the selected functional groups relative to trophic impacts of native groups compare fig a2 x and a3 ψ1 all when all of the ecosystem engineers were allowed to provide substrate ψ1 all ss decreased by only 4 60 after fitting the groups that contributed most to ss were as in most fitted simulations the black mussel c meridionalis dogwhelk n dubia and urchin p angulosus unsurprisingly the change in biomass over time for all select groups was similar to the simulation where only mussels or only barnacle provided substrate fig a3 compare ψ1 mus and ψ1 all the 2015 biomasses generated by this particular simulation resulted in six groups with unacceptably high biomasses and three groups that had biomasses that were implausibly low table 4 ψ1 5b 3 4 4 non trophic impact of shelter ψ2 in the simulation using shelter as mediation ψ2 10 of the 30 functional groups benefited from mussels table a9 there was little change compared to the substrate results fig a3 compare ψ1 mus vs ψ2 mus balanus glandula provides shelter for a knysnaensis and the simulation incorporating b glandula achieved a better fit of a knysnaensis to the data recorded on marcus island fig a3 ψ2 bar when all ecosystem engineers provide substrate the results were similar to when only b glandula provided shelter fig a3 ψ2 bar and ψ2 all after fitting ss decreased to 86 of the original fit from 529 08 to 450 90 table 3 as with the trophic and substrate simulations c meridionalis n dubia and p angulosus contributed the most to the final ss when compared to the 2015 ecopath model this simulation with all ecosystem engineers included resulted in seven groups with implausibly high biomasses and two with implausibly low biomasses table 4 as mediators decreased the vulnerability of multiple prey ψ2 5b the sponge h perlevis and false limpet s capensis increased to feasible amounts in 2015 table 4 3 4 5 non trophic impact of feeding grounds ψ3 in simulations concerning ψ3 considering the non trophic effects of mussels and or barnacles on feeding grounds an increase in mediator values increased the search rates of predators and thus their feeding grounds in addition the search rate of predators of the black mussel c meridionalis was increased using the mediation function m1 to represent exclusion of this mussel from primary substrate by m galloprovincialis making it easier for predators to locate c meridionalis as such when the mediator included mussels only c meridionalis biomass decreased to negligible levels and was the only simulation in which its modelled biomass fitted the observed data fig a4 ψ3 mus the anemone b reynaudi and dogwhelk n dubia experienced a spike in biomass in 1984 concurrent with the maximum biomass of m galloprovincialis when barnacles were the mediator however there was very little change from the substrate and shelter simulations compare figs a3 ψ1 bar ψ2 bar with fig a4 ψ3 bar for example when all the mediators were included ψ3 all the resulting change in biomass appeared to fit the observed data the best out of all the simulations particularly with regards to b reynaudi and a knysnaensis and to a lesser extent also c meridionalis fig a4 ψ3 all of the 30 groups nine had implausibly high biomasses at the end of the simulation whereas only two had implausible low values the false limpet s capensis and periwinkle a knysnaensis table 4 surprisingly the total biomass at the end of this simulation when all mediators were included was the greatest of all the simulations and departed most from the 2015 values the ss value decreased from the base value to the final value by 80 by far the largest change of all simulations in which time series data were fitted and had the smallest aic value of all simulations table 3 so this simulation had the greatest probability of minimizing information loss symonds and moussalli 2011 3 4 6 non trophic impact of all structural complexity services combined ψ4 when all services provided by mediators were combined fig a4 ψ4 the change in biomass over time demonstrated that in all cases effects of substrate ψ1 were overwhelmed by those of shelter ψ2 and feeding grounds ψ3 and only c meridionalis and a knysnaensis responses changed substantially as different mediators were used as in all previous simulations mussels proved to be the strongest ecosystem engineer regardless of whether this group was considered alone or acted with barnacles this was particularly true for the effects on a knysnaensis c meridionalis and large s granularis fig a4 ψ4 with regards to fitting the base ss was particularly high 2724 70 and even after fitting the final ss improved by only 34 to 1798 57 table 3 3 4 7 non trophic impact simulations of wave action ω the extra mortality of 10 biomass of low shore groups due to wave action and the additional mortalities of 30 50 of low shore biomass on the five dates with large winter storms did not have any obvious impact on the biomass associated with the non trophic impacts of structural complexity nor indeed were these various options noticeably different from each other fig a5 3 4 8 patterns of diversity among simulations if only the living functional groups included in the simulations are considered the biodiversity in 1980 was fairly low but biomass was spread quite evenly over the living groups table 5 these values were about 22 lower than those measured on marcus island in 2015 after the three alien species had arrived in the simulation adding the trophic impact of non native ecosystem engineers φ h and j were 5 less than in the 2015 model but around 21 greater than values in the 1980 model after introduction of the trophic impacts of native groups x both diversity and evenness increased even further compared to values measured in 2015 in the simulation involving the non trophic impacts of substrate ψ1 biodiversity was 17 higher than that measured from the 2015 ecopath model biodiversity values at the end of the simulation of the non trophic impact of shelter ψ2 closely approached those measured from the 2015 ecopath model being only around 3 less by contrast the simulation involving the non trophic impacts of feeding grounds ψ3 yielded the smallest values for diversity which also constituted the greatest departure from the 2015 value table 5 when the non trophic impacts of all structural complexity services were combined ψ4 the values for biodiversity came closest to those measured on the shore for the 2015 model exceeding them by only 2 3 biodiversity was scarcely affected by adding the effects of wave action ω1 4 producing values that were virtually constant among the four wave action simulations and only slightly greater than those measured in the non trophic impact of all ecosystem engineering services combined ψ4 all simulations for 2015 produced diversity values that exceeded those for 1980 by 17 6 to 23 5 for simulations φ x and ψ1 3 and by 31 3 to 33 5 for simulations ψ4 and ω1 4 4 discussion ecopath with ecosim has been used to investigate an enormous number of ecosystem perturbations including the effects of marine protected areas ortiz et al 2010 ramírez et al 2015 but by far the majority relate to the effects of fishing or climate change relatively few examine alien species and even fewer consider their effects in conjunction with other stressors corrales et al 2020 in the list of abstracts for the ecopath 30 years conference proceedings steenbeek et al 2014 only 5 of the 92 papers concern aliens the contributions of corrales et al 2017 2018 2020 significantly advance understanding by integrating the effects of fishing climate change and arrival of aliens because we had historical data prior to the arrival of aliens the focus of our study was on how community composition on marcus island s rocky shores altered with serial alien invasions by the mussels m galloprovincialis and s algosus and the barnacle b glandula between 1980 and 2012 robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 the 2015 ecopath model representing the recently invaded intertidal ecology of marcus island enabled discernment of trophic interactions among all groups and identification of keystone groups 4 1 comparing 1980 vs 2015 ecopath models trophic levels in the two ecopath models and the linearity in their flow diagram topologies were similar in 1980 and 2015 in both years the oystercatcher h moquini anemone b reynaudi and whelk n dubia were top predators while groups with the greatest ecotrophic efficiencies ee were small granular limpets s granularis in 1980 and small mediterranean mussels m galloprovincialis in 2015 haematopus moquini n dubia s granularis b reynaudi and the gull l dominicanus emerged as keystone species in both years as well as being groups with high relative impact strong empirical evidence exists for the roles of h moquini n dubia and s granularis in regulating limpets barnacles and algae respectively hockey and branch 1984 mcquaid 1985 branch 1985 all three species were identified by keystone index ks3 which valls et al 2015 consider is the most effective of the three indices a surprise inclusion was the polychaetes predominated by nereidids for which there are no known ecosystem effects suggesting a keystone role in 1980 the indigenous mussel c meridionalis dominated in terms of biomass and had a considerable relative impact on all other groups whereas its role in 2015 was usurped by small m galloprovincialis which had a substantial relative impact therefore the ecosystem did not change in terms of its filter feeder dominance but did change from being dominated by a native mussel that supports few epibionts personal observations to a non native mussel well known for enhancing structural complexity and supporting abundant epibiota branch and steffani 2004 branch et al 2010 gestoso et al 2013 sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2019a b an ecopath with ecosim analysis of the effects of the invasive zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha in mille lacs lake in minnesota usa kumar et al 2016 revealed that consumption of phytoplankton by the mussel led to a bottom up induced collapse of major predator populations this contrasts with our findings in which the alien mussel m galloprovincialis contributed positively to all predator populations in our system the role of tides currents and waves as a gateway supplying phytoplankton to the rocky shore field and griffiths 1991 is likely to have overwhelmed the effects of phytoplankton consumption by the three filter feeding aliens 4 2 evaluating simulations at the end of all 22 simulations the final total model biomass in year 2015 after the 1980 model had been run for 35 years represented almost double the total biomass measured in 1980 and almost triple that measured on the shore in 2015 these differences were largely due to the model dynamics for populations of the whelk b lagenaria urchin p angulosus and black mussel c meridionalis when only the trophic impacts of all non native and native groups were simulated φ plus x three of the seven predator groups ended with 2015 biomasses over 5x more than observed biomasses in particular b lagenaria increased to massive levels as much as 100x the expected biomass it is possible that with the large increase in m galloprovincialis as well as the increase in c meridionalis vulnerability the predators were able to feed more effectively and increase their biomass indeed a switch in diet composition from native mussels and limpets in 1980 to the non native m galloprovincialis in 2015 has been witnessed all along the west coast of south africa for h moquini griffiths et al 1992 coleman and hockey 2008 associated with an increase in the reproductive success of h moquini following the arrival of m galloprovincialis hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 nevertheless the model clearly over estimated the potential growth in some of the predator populations model b lagenaria and b reynaudi populations failed to decrease to more reasonable estimates even after non trophic impacts substrate shelter and feeding grounds were added successively to the simulations through mediation after the non trophic impacts of structural complexity were simulated wave action ω1 4 did not appear to have any further impact on the biomass of predators the biomass of c meridionalis which was not observed on the intertidal shores of marcus island after 2001 did not decrease at all at the end of the modelled trophic simulations despite simulations attempting to decrease the population the ribbed mussel a atra also had a greater modelled biomass than expected from empirical values 5 8x observed values therefore it is likely that trophic impacts such as predation and competition for food were not the only reasons for the disappearance of c meridionalis and the reduction in a atra it was only when the presence of alien mussels was employed as a mediating effect that directly increased the modelled vulnerability of c meridionalis thereby making it easier for predators of c meridionalis to find and feed on it that the biomass of this mussel decreased to negligible levels in the absence of this mediating effect when all the ecosystem services of both mussels and barnacles were combined with the effects of wave action c meridionalis modelled biomass in 2015 increased to levels comparable to the 2015 biomass of large m galloprovincialis the biomass of c meridionals was not even noticeably changed by the inclusion of five large storms from 1980 to 2015 unlike the predators and native filter feeders almost all the modelled grazers responded to the combination of all ecological processes largely as expected their final simulated biomasses closely matched those measured on marcus island in 2015 the major exception was p angulosus which generated a model biomass in 2015 that was more than 1000 times that observed and this effect was present from the very beginning of the trophic simulations at the end of all the simulations other seaweeds also deviated little from what was expected which indicates that like the grazers and zooplankton the change in algal biomass was mostly affected by trophic interactions shannon wiener and pielou s indices were used to evaluate the relative biodiversity and evenness generated by each simulation in 2015 against the 2015 ecopath model the ecosim model results matched these statistics most closely at the end of the simulation when either a only shelter was added ψ2 or b when all the ecosystem services were combined and added to the trophic interactions ψ4 however incorporating feeding grounds ψ3 was the only method in which the arrival of alien mussels was associated with the local extinction of c meridionalis in the model as observed in reality on marcus island adding wave action ω1 4 on top of trophic impacts by non native and native species and mediation did not appear to have any impact on diversity indices and little effect on the biomasses of the groups this was unexpected but was most likely due to simulated wave action removing a constant proportion of groups found on the low shore when in reality wave action will selectively remove species and individuals that are more weakly attached or present greater resistance to passing water denny 1987 1995 there are two additional possible explanations for the small effect of wave action first griffiths 1981 and griffiths and hockey 1987 found that mortality of adult mussels is largely caused by juveniles pushing beneath them so that the adults are then eliminated by wave action second wave action is a two edged sword ripping invertebrates and seaweeds off rocks while at the same time bringing in particulate material as food for filter feeders and boosting their biomass bustamante and branch 1996a a trade off that could not be explicitly included in the models 4 3 ecosim modelling studies on alien invasions we simulated the trophic impacts of non native invasions within the time dynamic model ecosim walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 by way of forced biomasses this approach was chosen because one objective was to determine how well the ecological processes could be simulated the actual biomasses of all the non native species were known for key years in addition a very specific trend was observed in which there was massive recruitment of mytilus galloprovincialis just after it invaded marcus island followed by a sharp increase in biomass that peaked after five to ten years and then a slow but steady decrease it would not have been possible to introduce this trend and specific numbers into ecosim without using forced biomasses however by using forced biomasses of non native species their biomass remained unchanged in response to any other ecological process subsequently added therefore it was not possible to use the model to assess if any changes in native competitors would have affected the biomass of non native functional groups corrales et al 2020 only one other published ecosim model has been created to study an intertidal rocky shore ecosystem that was invaded by an ecosystem engineer the occupation of antofagasta bay in chile by the tunicate pyura praeputialis ortiz et al 2013 the ecosim simulations undertaken did not describe how the tunicate was introduced to the model system but rather what would happen if it were placed under intense fishing effort similar modelling studies of invasions on open coast and pelagic systems have included temporal simulations within ecosim a number of which concentrated on scenarios in which already present invasive species were being harvested daskalov 2002 hossain et al 2010 ortiz et al 2013 wong and dowd 2014 corrales et al 2017 reviewed by corrales et al 2020 corrales et al 2018 for example showed that under the combined effects of intense fishing increased alien invasions and climate change that fishing regulations introduced to reduce fishing pressure would increase stocks but that this benefit would be offset by the negative effects of increased water temperature and alien species studies focused on the introduction of species into a time dynamic model have used a variety of strategies to assess their impact on other functional groups including forced biomass rogers et al 2014 a fitted time series to help force the biomass pinnegar et al 2014 artificial fisheries that set the initial biomass of the invasive species and then allow them to be fished out almost completely and then recover arias gonzález et al 2011 increased vulnerabilities of the prey of invasive species thereby increasing the invasive biomass pinnegar et al 2014 or combinations of these strategies langseth et al 2012 langseth et al 2012 compared all these methods when simulating the introduction of a non native water flea mussel and fish species into lakes huron and michigan of the great lakes system in north america overall they considered that the preferred method is to start with low initial biomass and force the biomass rather than use fitted data they also adopted this approach because time series of data were available and the objective of the study was to explore the ecological impact of the invasive functional groups mediation by one functional group of other predator prey interactions has been used in several previous studies to capture non trophic effects using the ecosim approach for a recent application see vilas et al 2020 however habitat alteration by ecosystem engineers has not been extensively modelled in this manner with the exception of protection provided by some marine plants in the form of shelter of prey species from predators or expansion of feeding areas and food availability for consumers such effects have been modelled to explore the mediating effects of kelp in relation to the reintroduction of sea otters to the west coast of canada where kelp increases the feeding areas and food availability for particular fish espinosa romero et al 2011 similarly seagrass habitat complexity reduces effective search rates by predators of juvenile blue crabs in chesapeake bay ma et al 2010 and offers shelter to juvenile pacific salmon harvey 2014 our study pushes the boundaries of mediation effects in ecosim by sequentially adding mediation by mussels and barnacles as ecosystem engineers providing habitat substrate shelter and feeding grounds to other rocky shore species in this way capturing three indirect non trophic processes prevalent within the rocky shore ecosystem that are subject to substantial change under invasion by alien species 5 conclusions a layered approach was utilized to explore ecological processes that were deemed the most relevant for an open invaded ecosystem including trophic impacts by non native ecosystem engineers and native species for which time series data existed non trophic impacts by changes in structural complexity and extra mortality caused by wave action unlike all the other impacts changes in structural complexity are technically a spatially driven effect of ecosystem engineering using mediation in a temporal model to introduce shelter on its own or substrate shelter and feeding grounds collectively was successful in that the approach resulted in end year biomasses and indices of species diversity close to those measured on marcus island in 2015 however the total biomass within the ecosystem was implausibly high due to some groups specifically p angulosus and c meridionalis having values that greatly exceeded those recorded on the shore in the case of p angulosus this is likely due to overestimation of the initial biomass as well as a lack of any intertidal predation on this species in the model ecosystem this functional group requires further careful parameterisation in trophic models of this and similar ecosystems developed in the future choromytilus meridionalis had a high biomass in 1980 and then progressively disappeared as the alien m galloprovincialis became established the decline of c meridionalis and the failure of most of the simulations to be able to simulate this has several possible explanations first recruitment of mussels is known to be highly variable and fails completely in some years reaugh flower et al 2011 choromytilus meridionalis may have arrived on the intertidal shores of marcus island in a sweepstake settlement that was not repeated and simply died out in the absence of further recruitment to the site as recruitment was not directly addressed in the model it would have failed to simulate such a decline only simulation ψ3 mus fig a4 in which an increase in the mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis was used to increase the vulnerability of c meridionalis to predation succeeded in reducing it to levels corresponding with its disappearance from the island second the starting biomass of c meridionalis was set high to reflect its domination in 1980 if competition for space with m galloprovincialis drove its demise the model would not have yielded a decline in c meridionalis because competition for space was not among the ecological processes simulated the simulations reported here focused on trophic interactions and processes related to interactions that are modified by structural complexity to fully explore the effects of structural complexity however spatially driven mediation is required despite not accommodating spatial effects the ecopath models of our study did yield several insights into the processes influencing communities on the rocky shore of marcus island first after its arrival the alien mediterranean mussel and particularly small individuals played the greatest role in influencing the responses of other groups in simulations examining trophic effects results from simulation φ smm trophic effects of small m galloprovincialis overwhelmingly influenced other simulations involving the effects of all alien ecosystem engineers φ all or the added effects of all native groups x second the addition of structural complexity to trophic interactions simulations ψ1 4 improved the fits of the data of many groups to the biomasses observed in 2015 in particular inclusion of feeding grounds ψ3 yielded the lowest sum of squares and akaike information criterion in most cases this was due to the incorporation of the effects of the alien mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis while the addition of the barnacle b glandula had little extra effect third the addition of disturbance in the form of wave action simulations ω1 4 had surprisingly little effect on the biomass of almost all groups except for predicted elimination of the periwinkle a knysnaensis within about 10 y this was unexpected as both empirical evidence and models have demonstrated that differences in disturbance frequency and intensity influence community dynamics and mediate species interactions e g dayton 1971 steffani and branch 2003 branch and steffani 2004 castorani and baskett 2019 explanations of this advanced above include intraspecific competition for space overpowering the effects of wave action and provision of food by wave action compensating for mortality fourth many of the strong interactions emerging from the mixed trophic group analysis are readily explicable in terms of direct predation of one group upon another falling into this category would be 1 consumption by anemones of small arthropods small mussels polychaetes and burnupena whelks kruger and griffiths 1998 2 predation by oystercatchers on limpets polychaetes and dogwhelks hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 coleman and hockey 2008 other interactions likely arose from competition for food resources most notably evident in negative effects among the various sizes and species of mussels a third group of interactions involved indirect effects consumption of dogwhelks and limpets by oystercatchers may respectively have promoted barnacles which are preyed upon by dogwhelks mcquaid 1985 and algae such as porphyra and ulva which are eaten by limpets bustamante and branch 1996b some interactions however remain inexplicable beyond simply recognising the complex interconnectedness of the intertidal foodweb described here the most glaring case is the negative effect of polychaetes on the sponge hymeniacidon perlevis for these groups share no obvious direct or indirect trophic links there are limitations to using ecopath with ecosim christensen and walters 2004 in particular using ecopath to model recently invaded intertidal ecosystems fails to account for non trophic relationships due to its static nature this was partially addressed with the use of ecosim temporal modelling and the implementation of mediation effects nevertheless in the process of undertaking this time dynamic modeling caveats emerged that could guide future modeling studies of alien invasions and or intertidal ecosystems adding to the list of ecological gaps that exist in modelling fulton et al 2019 1 forcing biomass of aliens by forcing the biomass of non native species any effect of other species or non trophic impacts on aliens is lost including effects on their recruitment nevertheless in this and a number of previous studies forcing the biomass of aliens was deemed the preferred method to introduce aliens into a temporal simulation where the effects of alien invasions on other species in the ecosystem are included 2 ecosystem engineering mediation was used to describe how structural complexity created by ecosystem engineers could either protect prey from predators or increase predator search rate each ecosystem engineer or mediator can have a very specific effect on each functional group to cover all of these interactions over 30 mediation functions would have had to have been created verified and applied in the mediation form this in turn would have added excessive uncertainties to the model by limiting the number of mediation functions and representing qualitative rather than quantitative relationships uncertainties could be minimized 3 wave action the removal of low shore species by wave action was constant for all selected groups when in reality species and individuals that are prone to removal will be more readily ripped off rocks and the effects of wave action will not be confined to the low shore 4 zonation all the species were spread equally over the entire study site in this non spatialized model the only simulations that included some zonation were the last four of 22 simulations which used wave action to create extra mortality of species most likely to occupy the low shore however this resolution of low shore versus high shore was crude as found in sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 zonation is an important factor governing community composition a review by corrales et al 2020 notes that most available modelling applications addressing the impacts of alien species are dynamic but non spatial 5 competition another limitation of the trophic modelling undertaken thus far is inadequate accommodation of competition for space and structural complexity to capture the full dynamics of intertidal systems simulations need to be spatially explicit to account for the fact that species occupy different zones and will interact directly only if they coexist in a zone or share resources that shift among zones a follow up paper will address some of these shortcomings using ecospace a spatial temporal dynamic modelling routine walters et al 1999 christensen and walters 2004 ecosystem engineers will be incorporated spatially either through mediation or through a new

24768,between 1980 and 2012 successive arrivals by three alien ecosystem engineers on a rocky shore community at marcus island on the west coast of south africa led to substantial changes in species composition and diversity an ecosystem analysis of this open intertidal system was developed using ecopath with ecosim to determine the impacts of these aliens and the services they provide on the native community a baseline ecopath model of the community in 2015 was generated using values of biomass production biomass consumption biomass and the dietary composition of 30 functional groups ecosim a time dynamic modelling routine was then used to simulate the changes in biomass of native species a 1980 model pre invasion was constructed and 22 simulations were run up to 2015 by systematically adding 1 biomass time series for non native species 2 relative biomass time series for native species 3 mediation functions that mimicked biomass impacts due to changes in substrate shelter and feeding grounds created by the alien ecosystem engineers and 4 the effects of wave action as a source of mortality positive or negative influences of these ecological processes on diversity and the final biomasses of all groups in 2015 were assessed trophic impacts by the alien species affected diversity and biomass at the end of all simulations but the addition of shelter or a combination of all three ecosystem services provided by ecosystem engineers shelter substrate and feeding grounds resulted in 2015 model ecosystems that most closely matched the diversity and individual group biomasses empirically measured on marcus island in 2015 wave action had only a minor impact marcus island s rocky shore community was therefore driven mainly by the fixed input of alien species biomass and made more realistic by the incorporation of their ecosystem services however structural complexity and zonation explored in a follow up paper invoking spatial modelling need

2015 as ecosystem engineers can alter this complexity the arrival of alien species with this capability can alter the trophic dynamics of an ecosystem considerably three non native species that have invaded south africa s rocky shores in the western cape are ecosystem engineers that can affect the biodiversity of intertidal communities robinson et al 2020 this was clearly demonstrated by sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 and also proposed in previous studies of the effects of the alien mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis ruiz sebastián et al 2002 robinson et al 2007 the bisexual mussel semimytilus algosus tokeshi and romero 1995 and the pacific barnacle balanus glandula harley 2006 harley and o riley 2011 besides changes to native biodiversity due to modulation of

amount of empty space or shelter sadchatheeswaran et al 2019a b and 3 feeding ground available to other species all three services collectively can be ascribed to structural complexity related to interstitial gaps or substrate surface area when habitat plays such a notable role in shaping the biomass abundance and diversity of native species it is important to understand how changes induced by the arrival of habitat altering alien species can affect the major functional groups in the already harsh environment of intertidal shores marcus island on the west coast of south africa offers unique quantitative data on intertidal community composition prior to the invasion by three habitat altering alien species namely m galloprovincialis s algosus and b glandula using these data it is possible to explore the impacts of alien ecosystem engineers and the various services they provide the first set of data was collected in 1980 before any non native species were quantified on marcus island a second data set was gathered in 2001 when the abundance of m galloprovincialis was first quantified at this site robinson et al 2007 marcus island was then studied a third time in 2012 at which point the invasive s algosus and b glandula were detected sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 finally a biomonitoring programme sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 was undertaken quarter annually from 2014 to 2016 ecosystem engineering can increase or decrease the amount of protective space for prey which will increase or decrease their vulnerability to predators this relationship can be mimicked by way of mediation functions in the ecopath with ecosim ewe software mediation functions involve three groups two of which form a predator prey relationship and a third in this case ecosystem engineers that affects the feeding rate between the first two either by facilitating the availability of prey to the predator group or by protecting the prey from the predator group dill et al 2003 christensen and walters 2004 the mediation function thus changes the trophic flow rate or the amount of prey biomass consumed by the predator at each time step christensen et al 2008 espinosa romero et al 2011 in this paper an ecopath food web model was developed for the wave exposed rocky shore community at marcus island on the west coast of south africa the ecopath model provides a static snapshot baseline representation of an ecosystem using information about biomass production consumption migration and feeding relationships of species christensen and walters 2004 the first stage in model development was to find a sensible approach for quantitatively recreating an intertidal system dominated by ecosystem engineers two baseline models of marcus island in 2015 and 1980 were parameterized using data collected on site or available from literature thereafter the ecosim routine of ewe 6 5 was used to simulate firstly trophic and non trophic impacts of ecosystem engineers on marcus island s ecological structure and functioning and secondly extra mortality caused by wave action the former was done by forcing the biomass of alien invaders in the temporal model and invoking the mediation routine of ecosim in an attempt to capture the role of ecosystem engineers in structurally protecting prey from predators and by rendering prey less vulnerable to these predators thus increasing predators searching effort for their prey wave action was modelled i across the full rocky shore and ii only on vulnerable species that occupy certain zones of the rocky shore in this way non trophic spatial processes on this rocky shore were tackled within the capacity of the non spatial trophic model the objectives of our study were to 1 explore trophic processes associated with the arrival of the three alien species 2 examine the contributions of other ecological processes caused by alien ecosystem engineers and 3 determine whether the potential impacts of structural complexity could be fully simulated via non spatially explicit functions that mediate predator prey interactions in the modelled food web our paper is novel in two respects firstly it makes use of a unique data set that traces sequential invasion of an island rocky shore ecosystem by three alien species secondly it advances the normal application of ewe to trophic analyses by incorporating trophic effects and non trophic drivers provision of shelter substrate and feeding grounds consecutively and cumulatively to study the potential impacts of both ecosystem engineers and wave action on the ecosystem 2 material

africa it is dominated largely by a community of filter feeders and predators are relatively scarce mcquaid and branch 1985 as demonstrated in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 invasions by m galloprovincialis and to a lesser degree b glandula and s algosus had large ecosystem engineering effects robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 particularly in the mid to low shore the shore is not subject to any harvesting as it falls in a national park and the island is not accessible to the public as a result we did not consider fishing among the stressors the system experiences two trophic models of the study site on marcus island s intertidal area were built using ecopath with ecosim version 6 5 ewe christensen et al 2005 details of the modelling approach can be found in appendices a1 and a2 these models represent marcus island s ecosystem 1 in 2015 post invasion to establish biomasses with which model simulations could be compared and 2 in 1980 pre invasion which served as a starting point for forward simulations using ecosim mediation functions run for 35 years 1980 2015 both models were limited to the same area of 452 m2 a 25 m stretch of rocky shore extending between low spring tide and the upper limit of wave splash with a maximum water depth at high tide of 2 42 m 2 2 parameterization of the 2015 ecopath model the baseline ecopath model of marcus island comprised 30 groups table 1 table a1 the same groups were incorporated in the 1980 model table a2 most of the groups are self explanatory but some are amplified in the following paragraph catch all groups were employed for a polychaete spp b other limpet spp c small arthropod spp and d other seaweed names of species involved are listed as a footnote to table a1 three species the alien mussel m galloprovincialis the native ribbed mussel aulacomya atra and the native granular limpet scutellastra granularis were split into two multi stanza groups each based on length of shell or age table a3 because these species were abundant their juveniles and adults were preyed upon by different predators and they contributed differently to complexity marcus island exhibits strong zonation robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 but in this baseline model functional groups were treated as if they were evenly spread throughout the study site for most consumer groups wet biomass estimates g m 2 were derived from measurements made on marcus island of the average fresh whole body mass of individuals or areas 10 cm 10 cm completely covered by colonial species which were then multiplied by the observed mean abundance or cover m 2 table a1 it was assumed that the two bird species in the model spend less than 100 of their feeding time on marcus island and so only 70 of haematopus moquini biomass and 30 of larus dominicanus biomass was used in the 2015 model although intertidal fish species mainly clinidae and gobiidae commonly occur on south african west coast shores prochazka and griffiths 1992 they have not been observed at the study site therefore they were included in this model as a generic fish group with a very low biomass estimate to capture potential predation by these fish as occurs on other rocky shores choromytilus meridionalis more commonly found subtidally used to occur as a dominant intertidal filter feeder on marcus island but since 2012 has not been found there and so biomass was estimated to be very low these estimates and others that were collected from literature or estimated by ecopath appear in table a1 production biomass p b values for all mollusc echinoderm arthropod and annelid species were calculated using artificial neural network models that can be downloaded from brey 2001 all other p b values year 1 and all consumption biomass q b values year 1 were sourced from published models shannon et al 2003 arbach leloup et al 2008 watermeyer et al 2008 ortiz et al 2013 or from an unpublished south african model of mussel beds stobie 2002 input values and the sources used to parameterize the baseline model are listed in supplementary tables a1 and a2 diet compositions for model groups were available from literature but were adjusted for prey availability on marcus island table a4 confidence in the values collected to create the baseline model i e biomass production biomass consumption biomass and diet composition was assessed with a pedigree index the overall pedigree index of the model represents the model s robustness and is calculated by assigning pre determined confidence intervals or parameter uncertainties to each input parameter data collected at the model site for specific model groups were given a parameter uncertainty of only 10 grading through to as much as 80 uncertainty if the data were estimated by ecopath the ecological roles of functional groups were analysed via mixed trophic impact and keystone analyses mixed trophic impact analysis graphically displays the net direct and indirect trophic impacts of all functional groups on one another ulanowicz and puccia 1990 keystone analyses compare relative total impact of each functional group using keystone indices of which we employed three ks1 libralato et al 2006 ks2 power et al 1996 and ks3 valls et al 2015 these indices all combine measures of the mixed trophic impact of each model group with estimates of its relative biomass valls et al 2015 the methods differ only in the way in which biomass contributions are incorporated in the index as indicated in the following equations ks 1 i log ε i 1 p i ks 2 i log ε i 1 p i ks 3 i log ε i drank b i ksi is the keystone index of the group or species i under consideration ε i is the overall impact of i on all other groups apart from itself derived from the mixed trophic impact analysis p i is the proportional contribution of group i to the total biomass in the foodweb and drank b i is the rank of the biomass of i in descending order 2 3 parameterization of the 1980 ecopath model the 1980 model incorporated the same predators filter feeders grazers zooplankton primary producers detritus catch all and multi stanza groups mentioned in section 2 2 table a2 it was again assumed that the two bird species in the model spend less than 100 of their feeding time on marcus island but given that h moquini in particular was less abundant on west coast islands in 1980 prior to the arrival of m galloprovincialis hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 only 45 of h moquini biomass was used in the model two detritus groups were generated from consumers and primary producers respectively table a2 dietary compositions for all groups were adjusted for prey availability on marcus island in 1980 table a5 import of consumer detritus in the 1980 model was set at 0 g m 2 year 1 but 50000 g m 2 year 1 of primary production pp detritus was imported table a6 this value required to balance the model amounted to approximately the flow to primary producer detritus 67386 80 g m 2 year 1 although alien species were not present on marcus island in 1980 they were included in this model with very low biomasses 0 01 g m 2 so that species invasion could be modelled over time as in the 2015 model all groups were treated as if they were evenly spread across the study site the 2015 values of production biomass p b consumption biomass q b and where required ecotrophic efficiencies ee of each functional group were used in the 1980 model p b and q b values were adjusted by a conversion factor of 0 98 to compensate for differences in sea surface temperature sst in 1980 15 66 c and 2015 16 63 c clark et al 2009 to balance the model plankton group ee values were set at 0 99 and net migration was calculated by ecopath to simulate the effects of waves a fishing fleet was created that could cause mortality by fishing out a certain percentage of each group the groups that were removed by wave action were those that predominantly occupy the low shore the magnitude of the removals per group by wave action was initially set low 0 00001 g m 2 year 1 so that fishing mortality was negligible until manually increased as desired 2 4 ecosim parameterization to investigate how trophic and non trophic impacts have changed the dynamics of the intertidal rocky shore at marcus island from 1980 pre invasion to 2015 post invasion 22 simulations were run using ecosim christensen and walters 2004 table 2 details of the ecosim modelling procedure are described in appendix a2 these explored the trophic impacts φ of each non native ecosystem engineer small and large mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis bisexual mussel s algosus and the barnacle b glandula and their combined effects all the trophic impacts x of 15 selected native groups the non trophic

simulation was run in which wave action removed 10 of the total biomass of select low shore groups every month between january 1980 and december 2015 ω1 to examine the possible impacts of large storms on different groups three ecosim simulations were run by once again removing 10 of the total biomass each month but with additional once off 30 ω2 40 ω3 and 50 ω4 losses of low shore biomass in each of the following known storm events june 1994 september 2001 august 2008 june 2009 and august 2012 2 4 1 time series of non native ecosystem engineers all three non native species are highly invasive along the length of the west coast of south africa and have outcompeted some species for food or space but have boosted the populations of others by increasing substrate shelter and or food to represent this annual biomass time series for each ecosystem engineer were created biomasses of species recorded on marcus island were available only for 1980 2001 and 2012 2015 however information on m galloprovincialis recruitment elsewhere along the coast was available from which recruitment patterns could be deduced in 1980 none of the non native species were recognized on the shore and so this time period was designated as pre invasion in 1984 m galloprovincialis experienced a recruitment boom of at least 1 5 million recruits m 2 on the west coast of south africa branch unpublished data reaugh flower et al 2011 this constituted a massive injection of recruitment that declined to approximately 79000 individuals m 2 in 1995 and 6150 individuals m 2 in 1998 fig a1 recruitment increased slightly to 29000 individuals m 2 in 1999 and then decreased to very small amounts in the 2012 2015 period approximately 2300 individuals m 2 branch unpublished data this recruitment information was used as input to the egg production variable in ecosim resulting in a varying biomass for small m galloprovincialis from 1980 to 2015 however the model outputs severely under estimated the abundance of m galloprovincialis adults observed on marcus island as a result the shape of the recruitment curve was instead used to influence estimates of mussel biomass with the peak recruitment in 1984 being set to correspond to a peak biomass estimate of 50000 g m 2 for small and large m galloprovincialis combined which realistically approximated the maximal biomass recorded on marcus island followed by a decline in biomass that tracked the progressive reduction in recruitment which was also realistic in terms of biomass values recorded at various times on marcus island fig 1 table a7 separate time series were generated for both small and large m galloprovincialis using the approximation that the biomass of large m galloprovincialis was 84 of the biomass of small m galloprovincialis at each time step prior to 2013 small and large m galloprovincialis were not measured separately and so their biomass ratio was calculated from the mean biomass of small 30 mm 3176 22 g m 2 and large 30 mm 2668 03 g m 2 mussels in 2015 as ecosim modelling was used to simulate the ecosystem dynamics resulting in the 2015 model ecosystem the 2015 biomass of large m galloprovincialis the non leading multi stanza of the m galloprovincialis group was set to the amount estimated by ecopath in the static 2015 model 4137 97 g m 2 recruitment data were not available for s algosus or b glandula and so historical population trends of biomass from 1980 to 2014 were constructed from abundance values collected in 2012 2015 with very low values 0 01 g m 2 allocated to the period 1980 2009 prior to the first records of these species on marcus island since the biomasses at specific dates 1980 2001 2012 2014 and 2015 were known all ecosystem engineer biomasses were input to ecosim as type 1 or forced biomass driving ecosim s temporal simulations from 1980 to 2015 for time steps where biomass data were not available biomass was linearly interpolated between the time steps with known biomasses table a7 2 4 2 time series of native groups time series biomass data included estimates for 15 native groups that were considered important indicator species or that had strong relative trophic impacts on other groups data from these were obtained during visits to marcus island between 1980 and 2015 table a7 and biomass values gathered from the 2015 ecopath model to fit the temporal simulations from 1980 to 2015 these values were denoted as type 0 or relative biomasses in ecosim and used as an input to simulation x see following section for notation superimposed on the combined effects of the alien species φ all therefore the trophic relationships between groups could change with the forced biomass of the engineers but could also be constrained by the time series of the native groups this was used to minimize the sum of squares between the model and observations because the time series of the native groups were denoted as relative biomass values could be omitted from the model in years for which we did not have biomass values for particular groups table a7 2 4 3 mediation using structural complexity the non trophic impacts provided by ecosystem engineers in this case mussel and barnacle groups were linked to changes in structural complexity which altered three habitat driven services on the rocky shores substrate surface area for attachment shelter gaps that house and protect species and feeding grounds efficiency with which consumers search for food as they become more or less abundant in complex habitats substrate and shelter affect the vulnerability of prey whereas feeding grounds in general affect the search rate of consumers these impacts were included in the experimental simulations ψ1 ψ4 with ecosim via mediation mediators were the non native ecosystem engineers categorised into three mussel groups small and large m galloprovincialis and s algosus barnacle and all which included all four groups as recommended by harvey 2014 two types of sigmoidal functions were used to modify the predator prey relationship with the mediation functions table a8 both are based on sigmoidal functions and use four parameters a minimum and maximum y value a scaling parameter and a parameter that determines the steepness of the slope harvey 2014 one set of functions m1 m3 m5 increased predator search rate as the biomass of the mediator increased fig 2 a whereas the other set m2 m4 m6 decreased prey vulnerability with an increase in mediator biomass fig 2b personal observations expert input and results from sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 helped to determine which function affected which predator prey relationship per ecosystem service table a9 one caveat is that the function that increased predator search rate with an increase in mussel m1 was also used to increase the vulnerability of c meridionalis this was done in an attempt to specifically drive c meridionalis to negligible levels within the model it was the only native species that had disappeared from marcus island by 2012 possibly because it was outcompeted from the primary substrate by the invasive m galloprovincialis and excluded from secondary substrate created by the alien mussels but also because of regular recruitment failure of c meridionalis in the intertidal zone griffiths 1981 for each group mediators were given a weight to represent their relative contribution to structural complexity and thus their relative impact on the vulnerability of prey or search rate of predators in the mussel mediator group all mussels were given a collective weight of 1 as sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 demonstrated that when all species of mussels were found together even where m galloprovincialis was dominant they form complex multi layer beds and contribute to structural complexity equally fig 2c b glandula was given a weight of 1 when it was the lone mediator in the mediator group barnacle however for the all group a weighted average was calculated via a set of tests in blender 2 74 a 3d modelling program blender foundation 2012 which showed that the average ratio of complexity created by mussels to that created by barnacles was 1 0 35 therefore the relative weights of each of the mussels in the all group were 1 whereas barnacles had a weight of 0 35 table a8 fig 2c 2 4 4 wave action personal observations and expert input indicated that normal levels of wave action can remove 10 of the background levels of the biomass of functional groups commonly associated with the low shore every month observations on marcus island on may 9 2016 demonstrated that a large winter storm can remove 30 to 50 of the biomass of low shore groups during a single event wave data for sites between cape point and saldanha bay were obtained from the council for scientific and industrial research csir stellenbosch rossouw et al unpublished data these data included the dates from 1980 to 2015 that had the five greatest significant wave heights which are a proxy for high energy storms june 21 1994 september 5 2001 august 31 2008 june 24 2009 and august 12 2012 these were set as large winter storm episodes in ecosim simulations described in section 2 5 2 5 ecosim simulation to determine best fit first an ecosim simulation was run without any forcing to see how the ecosystem would function without any non native species over a period of 35 years from 1980 to 2015 after this input data for trophic and non trophic interactions were added sequentially to the 1980 ecopath model in ecosim and also run for 35 years simulations χ and ψ required fitting to time series christensen and walters 2004 in which the vulnerabilities of all prey of the predators consumers with time series were adjusted table 3 for each of the 22 simulations table 2 the change in biomass over time was analysed for groups that had a relative total impact on all other groups greater than 0 5 in 1980 and for groups on which the ecosystem engineers had the most positive or negative impact in the final 2015 model according to the mixed trophic impact analysis to determine which simulation was best able to replicate the 2015 ecopath model biomass values of all functional groups for simulations in which all engineers were included were compared with the 2015 biomass values table 1 sum of squares ss akaike s information criterion aic and prey vulnerabilities v per predator were calculated where applicable following heymans et al 2016 values of the shannon wiener diversity index h and pielou s evenness index j were also calculated for each simulation 3 results 3 1 comparisons of the 1980 and 2015 models the 1980 pre invasion model and the 2015 post invasion baseline model fig 3 a b had much in common the pedigree indices of both were 0 27 indicating a low to medium level of confidence in parameter values compared to other models reported by coll et al 2006 which had indices of 0 16 to 0 68 both the 1980 and 2015 models spanned trophic levels tls from 1 00 to 3 03 primary producers and detritus groups comprised tl 1 00 grazers and micro zooplankton emerged as 2 00 to 2 06 filter feeders had a tl of 2 02 and predators occupied 2 16 to 3 03 the same top predators the oystercatcher h moquini dogwhelk n dubia and anemone b reynaudi were shared by both models the trophic arrangement was flat and linear rather than web like with very low tls overall and 23 30 functional groups were primary producers and detritus at the lowest tl or filter feeders and grazers at a tl of 2 1 ecotrophic efficiencies ee of most groups in the 1980 and 2015 models were low tables a1 a2 none of the groups production was exported from the system thus the ees were attributed to consumption by predators within the system of the 30 functional groups in the 2015 baseline model table a1 the five with the greatest ees estimated by ecopath and thus emerging as heavily utilized in the ecosystem were small mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis ee 0 99 small granular limpet s granularis 0 96 large ribbed mussel a atra 0 87 large m galloprovincialis 0 80 and phytoplankton 0 79 in the 1980 model phytoplankton and micro zooplankton ee values were set at 0 99 and net migration calculated by ecopath table a6 the five functional groups that sustained the greatest consumption by predators as estimated by ecopath table a2 were the small granular limpet s granularis ee 0 97 primary producer detritus 0 95 sea lettuce ulva 0 94 large ribbed mussel a atra 0 91 and large mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis 0 91 consumer detritus which was generated within the system not imported into it had a relatively low ee of 0 38 the net migration rate for micro zooplankton was estimated by ecopath to be 691 42 year 1 which exceeded by 50 the p b value of 472 36 year 1 for this group and 300 25 year 1 for phytoplankton which was double the p b value of 151 31 year 1 for phytoplankton tables a2 and a6 these negative migration values indicate imports i e immigration of plankton generated outside the system across the boundaries of the model the major differences between the two models emerged at intermediate tls as the 1980 model represented marcus island before invasion by non native groups small and large mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis bisexual mussel s algosus pacific barnacle b glandula these aliens were absent in the 1980 model and set at very low values of 0 01 g m 2 at the start the black mussel choromytilus meridionalis had the greatest biomass of all functional groups 17024 49 g m 2 in 1980 but had disappeared by 2015 other changes were the arrival of s algosus and b glandula a decline in the ribbed mussel a atra and increases in other seaweeds anemones and the granular limpet s granularis flows to the oystercatcher altered from predominantly c meridionalis to m galloprovincialis the dogwhelk nucella dubia changed from a diet of predominantly ribbed mussels a atra to one of small m galloprovincialis and the barnacle b glandula and the anemone b reynaudi switched from mainly consuming the indigenous mussels c meridionalis and a atra to a diet of largely small m galloprovincialis 3 2 trophic impact analyses in the 1980 model fig 4 a the five living groups with the greatest relative total impact were the anemone b reynaudi 1 00 oystercatcher h moquini 0 72 black mussel c meridionalis 0 72 gull l dominicanus 0 60 and polychaetes 0 54 through sit and wait predation b reynaudi had direct negative impacts on small arthropods 0 97 polychaetes 0 83 and the whelk b lagenaria 0 65 and by preying on polychaetes and to a smaller degree on the dogwhelk n dubia it had an indirect but positive impact on h perlevis 0 87 in the 2015 model fig 4b the five living groups with the greatest relative total impact again included h moquini 1 00 polychaetes 0 51 and b reynaudi 0 47 to which were added n dubia 0 50 and small m galloprovincialis 0 60 the most obvious change was the substantial influences of small and large m galloprovincialis largely replacing the previous effects of the indigenous mussels c meridionalis and a atra small m galloprovincialis had positive effects on b reynaudi 0 30 and l dominicanus 0 28 and through competition for particulates negative influences on all groups of mussels including itself 0 34 to 0 39 of the aliens large m galloprovincialis had a notable relative total impact 0 26 with negative effects on all limpet groups 0 10 for all groups but few strong positive impacts notably for h moquini 0 15 based on the above the functional groups that were included in temporal simulations were h moquini l dominicanus n dubia polychaetes b reynaudi small a atra c meridionalis large s granularis a knysnaensis and small arthropods 3 3 identification of keystone groups the relative total impacts of all functional groups present in 1980 and 2015 were compared using three keystone indicators power et al 1996 libralato et al 2006 valls et al 2015 which are described in section 2 2 in 1980 fig 5 a indicator ks1 libralato et al 2006 identified the oystercatcher h moquini anemone b reynaudi gull l dominicanus polychaetes and large s granularis as keystone groups but not the black mussel c meridionalis which was disqualified as its biomass was disproportionately large relative to its effect indicator ks2 power et al 1996 denoted h moquini polychaetes micro zooplankton the sponge h perlevis and small arthropods indicator ks3 valls et al 2015 demonstrated more expectedly that h moquini polychaetes b reynaudi the dogwhelk n dubia and l dominicanus in that order had the greatest keystone values thus h moquini and polychaetes were identified by all three keystone indicators as having high keystone values most of the groups singled out had multiple strong effects on other groups with the exception of micro zooplankton h perlevis and small arthropods which consistently had weak effects and were rated as keystone species only by indicator ks2 in the 2015 model fig 5b indicator ks1 identified h moquini polychaetes n dubia b reynaudi and despite its relatively large biomass small m galloprovincialis as keystone groups indicator ks2 singled out h moquini and n dubia among the top five keystone groups along with l dominicanus micro zooplankton and p angulosus indicator ks3 identified h moquini polychaetes n dubia small s granularis and l dominicanus overall groups that were most consistently identified were h moquini b reynaudi n dubia and l dominicanus and polychaetes and there were no striking differences between the pre and post invasion periods except for the addition of small m galloprovincialis by one indicator 3 4 temporal simulations 3 4 1 trophic impact of non native ecosystem engineers φ in the first temporal simulation only the biomass time series for small m galloprovincialis drove the model from 1980 to 2015 of the selected functional groups only the dogwhelk n dubia polychaetes and anemone b reynaudi increased quite rapidly in response before decreasing exhibiting maximum biomasses at the peak of small m galloprovincialis invasion fig a2 φ smm surprisingly the gull l dominicanus which preys on small m galloprovincialis was among the least affected groups which also included small ribbed mussels a atra and black mussels c meridionalis small arthropods reacted negatively initially but then returned to their 1980 biomass a knysnaensis and large s granularis biomasses scarcely changed but fluctuated from 1982 onwards fig a2 φ smm the same trends were demonstrated when the biomass of only large m galloprovincialis was forced except for the fact that the reactions were not as extreme fig a2 φ lmm only h moquini reacted more strongly to the change in large m galloprovincialis biomass increasing to a conservative maximum of 53 32 g m 2 in 1995 n dubia b reynaudi and polychaete spp tracked the rise and fall of m galloprovincialis most closely when the biomass of s algosus was forced b reynaudi and polychaete spp increased and decreased late in the time series coincident with the late arrival and decline of s algosus fig a2 φ bim but the response was much less than that associated with the increase and subsequent decrease of m galloprovincialis unsurprisingly large s granularis reacted to the invasion by b glandula by fluctuating in biomass post invasion but surprisingly so did a knysnaensis a group with no trophic connection to b glandula fig a2 φ bar in the simulation where the biomasses of all four alien ecosystem engineers were forced the trophic impacts of small m galloprovincialis and to a lesser extent large m galloprovincialis overwhelmed the effects of s algosus and b glandula fig a2 φ all however the arrival of s algosus appeared to create a slight increase in polychaete and b reynaudi biomass in 2012 in this simulation the 2015 biomasses generated from the φ all simulation were compared to the 2015 biomasses measured on marcus island table 4 φ 5b model biomasses were considered implausibly high if they were over triple the biomasses measured on the island and implausibly low if they were less than a quarter the measured biomasses of the 26 native functional groups six in the ecosim simulation had implausibly large biomasses while three had a lower than realistic biomass the group that differed most radically from acceptable levels c meridionalis should have decreased to negligible levels instead it increased slightly with an increase in small and large m galloprovincialis and then decreased to almost the same as its biomass in 1980 p angulosus also had excessively high biomasses 3 4 2 trophic impacts of native groups x this ecosim simulation x was run with the addition of the relative biomasses of 15 native functional groups to all the forced biomasses of the non native species the base sum of squares ss of this simulation was 530 10 and after fitting only decreased to 452 54 representing a 14 improvement in the model table 4 the groups that contributed the most to the final ss were c meridionalis n dubia and p angulosus i e the groups that had a particularly poor fit to the observed data fig a2 x when 2015 biomasses generated from this simulation were compared with those measured on marcus island in 2015 seven of the functional groups had an implausibly high biomass whereas three had unrealistically low biomasses table 4 x 5b in this run c meridionalis and p angulosus biomasses were once again the groups that differed the most from expectations compared to the previous simulation in which only the ecosystem engineer biomasses were utilized φ all the 2015 biomasses of the false limpet siphonaria capensis generated in this simulation x were considered low but came closer to the biomass measured on marcus island in 2015 table 4 3 4 3 non trophic impact of substrate ψ1 the time series of all ecosystem engineers and native groups was included in all subsequent simulations the first mediator examined in terms of substrate provision was mussel the mediation function was applied to small s granularis and all the primary producers except porphyra spp and phytoplankton table a9 when mussels acted as substrate only periwinkle a knysnaensis biomasses changed relative to the simulations of the trophic impacts described above and were a better fit to observed data fig a3 ψ1 mus the same was true when barnacle was set as the mediator fig a3 ψ1 bar as such there was no appreciable difference in change of biomass over time in any of the selected functional groups relative to trophic impacts of native groups compare fig a2 x and a3 ψ1 all when all of the ecosystem engineers were allowed to provide substrate ψ1 all ss decreased by only 4 60 after fitting the groups that contributed most to ss were as in most fitted simulations the black mussel c meridionalis dogwhelk n dubia and urchin p angulosus unsurprisingly the change in biomass over time for all select groups was similar to the simulation where only mussels or only barnacle provided substrate fig a3 compare ψ1 mus and ψ1 all the 2015 biomasses generated by this particular simulation resulted in six groups with unacceptably high biomasses and three groups that had biomasses that were implausibly low table 4 ψ1 5b 3 4 4 non trophic impact of shelter ψ2 in the simulation using shelter as mediation ψ2 10 of the 30 functional groups benefited from mussels table a9 there was little change compared to the substrate results fig a3 compare ψ1 mus vs ψ2 mus balanus glandula provides shelter for a knysnaensis and the simulation incorporating b glandula achieved a better fit of a knysnaensis to the data recorded on marcus island fig a3 ψ2 bar when all ecosystem engineers provide substrate the results were similar to when only b glandula provided shelter fig a3 ψ2 bar and ψ2 all after fitting ss decreased to 86 of the original fit from 529 08 to 450 90 table 3 as with the trophic and substrate simulations c meridionalis n dubia and p angulosus contributed the most to the final ss when compared to the 2015 ecopath model this simulation with all ecosystem engineers included resulted in seven groups with implausibly high biomasses and two with implausibly low biomasses table 4 as mediators decreased the vulnerability of multiple prey ψ2 5b the sponge h perlevis and false limpet s capensis increased to feasible amounts in 2015 table 4 3 4 5 non trophic impact of feeding grounds ψ3 in simulations concerning ψ3 considering the non trophic effects of mussels and or barnacles on feeding grounds an increase in mediator values increased the search rates of predators and thus their feeding grounds in addition the search rate of predators of the black mussel c meridionalis was increased using the mediation function m1 to represent exclusion of this mussel from primary substrate by m galloprovincialis making it easier for predators to locate c meridionalis as such when the mediator included mussels only c meridionalis biomass decreased to negligible levels and was the only simulation in which its modelled biomass fitted the observed data fig a4 ψ3 mus the anemone b reynaudi and dogwhelk n dubia experienced a spike in biomass in 1984 concurrent with the maximum biomass of m galloprovincialis when barnacles were the mediator however there was very little change from the substrate and shelter simulations compare figs a3 ψ1 bar ψ2 bar with fig a4 ψ3 bar for example when all the mediators were included ψ3 all the resulting change in biomass appeared to fit the observed data the best out of all the simulations particularly with regards to b reynaudi and a knysnaensis and to a lesser extent also c meridionalis fig a4 ψ3 all of the 30 groups nine had implausibly high biomasses at the end of the simulation whereas only two had implausible low values the false limpet s capensis and periwinkle a knysnaensis table 4 surprisingly the total biomass at the end of this simulation when all mediators were included was the greatest of all the simulations and departed most from the 2015 values the ss value decreased from the base value to the final value by 80 by far the largest change of all simulations in which time series data were fitted and had the smallest aic value of all simulations table 3 so this simulation had the greatest probability of minimizing information loss symonds and moussalli 2011 3 4 6 non trophic impact of all structural complexity services combined ψ4 when all services provided by mediators were combined fig a4 ψ4 the change in biomass over time demonstrated that in all cases effects of substrate ψ1 were overwhelmed by those of shelter ψ2 and feeding grounds ψ3 and only c meridionalis and a knysnaensis responses changed substantially as different mediators were used as in all previous simulations mussels proved to be the strongest ecosystem engineer regardless of whether this group was considered alone or acted with barnacles this was particularly true for the effects on a knysnaensis c meridionalis and large s granularis fig a4 ψ4 with regards to fitting the base ss was particularly high 2724 70 and even after fitting the final ss improved by only 34 to 1798 57 table 3 3 4 7 non trophic impact simulations of wave action ω the extra mortality of 10 biomass of low shore groups due to wave action and the additional mortalities of 30 50 of low shore biomass on the five dates with large winter storms did not have any obvious impact on the biomass associated with the non trophic impacts of structural complexity nor indeed were these various options noticeably different from each other fig a5 3 4 8 patterns of diversity among simulations if only the living functional groups included in the simulations are considered the biodiversity in 1980 was fairly low but biomass was spread quite evenly over the living groups table 5 these values were about 22 lower than those measured on marcus island in 2015 after the three alien species had arrived in the simulation adding the trophic impact of non native ecosystem engineers φ h and j were 5 less than in the 2015 model but around 21 greater than values in the 1980 model after introduction of the trophic impacts of native groups x both diversity and evenness increased even further compared to values measured in 2015 in the simulation involving the non trophic impacts of substrate ψ1 biodiversity was 17 higher than that measured from the 2015 ecopath model biodiversity values at the end of the simulation of the non trophic impact of shelter ψ2 closely approached those measured from the 2015 ecopath model being only around 3 less by contrast the simulation involving the non trophic impacts of feeding grounds ψ3 yielded the smallest values for diversity which also constituted the greatest departure from the 2015 value table 5 when the non trophic impacts of all structural complexity services were combined ψ4 the values for biodiversity came closest to those measured on the shore for the 2015 model exceeding them by only 2 3 biodiversity was scarcely affected by adding the effects of wave action ω1 4 producing values that were virtually constant among the four wave action simulations and only slightly greater than those measured in the non trophic impact of all ecosystem engineering services combined ψ4 all simulations for 2015 produced diversity values that exceeded those for 1980 by 17 6 to 23 5 for simulations φ x and ψ1 3 and by 31 3 to 33 5 for simulations ψ4 and ω1 4 4 discussion ecopath with ecosim has been used to investigate an enormous number of ecosystem perturbations including the effects of marine protected areas ortiz et al 2010 ramírez et al 2015 but by far the majority relate to the effects of fishing or climate change relatively few examine alien species and even fewer consider their effects in conjunction with other stressors corrales et al 2020 in the list of abstracts for the ecopath 30 years conference proceedings steenbeek et al 2014 only 5 of the 92 papers concern aliens the contributions of corrales et al 2017 2018 2020 significantly advance understanding by integrating the effects of fishing climate change and arrival of aliens because we had historical data prior to the arrival of aliens the focus of our study was on how community composition on marcus island s rocky shores altered with serial alien invasions by the mussels m galloprovincialis and s algosus and the barnacle b glandula between 1980 and 2012 robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 the 2015 ecopath model representing the recently invaded intertidal ecology of marcus island enabled discernment of trophic interactions among all groups and identification of keystone groups 4 1 comparing 1980 vs 2015 ecopath models trophic levels in the two ecopath models and the linearity in their flow diagram topologies were similar in 1980 and 2015 in both years the oystercatcher h moquini anemone b reynaudi and whelk n dubia were top predators while groups with the greatest ecotrophic efficiencies ee were small granular limpets s granularis in 1980 and small mediterranean mussels m galloprovincialis in 2015 haematopus moquini n dubia s granularis b reynaudi and the gull l dominicanus emerged as keystone species in both years as well as being groups with high relative impact strong empirical evidence exists for the roles of h moquini n dubia and s granularis in regulating limpets barnacles and algae respectively hockey and branch 1984 mcquaid 1985 branch 1985 all three species were identified by keystone index ks3 which valls et al 2015 consider is the most effective of the three indices a surprise inclusion was the polychaetes predominated by nereidids for which there are no known ecosystem effects suggesting a keystone role in 1980 the indigenous mussel c meridionalis dominated in terms of biomass and had a considerable relative impact on all other groups whereas its role in 2015 was usurped by small m galloprovincialis which had a substantial relative impact therefore the ecosystem did not change in terms of its filter feeder dominance but did change from being dominated by a native mussel that supports few epibionts personal observations to a non native mussel well known for enhancing structural complexity and supporting abundant epibiota branch and steffani 2004 branch et al 2010 gestoso et al 2013 sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2019a b an ecopath with ecosim analysis of the effects of the invasive zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha in mille lacs lake in minnesota usa kumar et al 2016 revealed that consumption of phytoplankton by the mussel led to a bottom up induced collapse of major predator populations this contrasts with our findings in which the alien mussel m galloprovincialis contributed positively to all predator populations in our system the role of tides currents and waves as a gateway supplying phytoplankton to the rocky shore field and griffiths 1991 is likely to have overwhelmed the effects of phytoplankton consumption by the three filter feeding aliens 4 2 evaluating simulations at the end of all 22 simulations the final total model biomass in year 2015 after the 1980 model had been run for 35 years represented almost double the total biomass measured in 1980 and almost triple that measured on the shore in 2015 these differences were largely due to the model dynamics for populations of the whelk b lagenaria urchin p angulosus and black mussel c meridionalis when only the trophic impacts of all non native and native groups were simulated φ plus x three of the seven predator groups ended with 2015 biomasses over 5x more than observed biomasses in particular b lagenaria increased to massive levels as much as 100x the expected biomass it is possible that with the large increase in m galloprovincialis as well as the increase in c meridionalis vulnerability the predators were able to feed more effectively and increase their biomass indeed a switch in diet composition from native mussels and limpets in 1980 to the non native m galloprovincialis in 2015 has been witnessed all along the west coast of south africa for h moquini griffiths et al 1992 coleman and hockey 2008 associated with an increase in the reproductive success of h moquini following the arrival of m galloprovincialis hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 nevertheless the model clearly over estimated the potential growth in some of the predator populations model b lagenaria and b reynaudi populations failed to decrease to more reasonable estimates even after non trophic impacts substrate shelter and feeding grounds were added successively to the simulations through mediation after the non trophic impacts of structural complexity were simulated wave action ω1 4 did not appear to have any further impact on the biomass of predators the biomass of c meridionalis which was not observed on the intertidal shores of marcus island after 2001 did not decrease at all at the end of the modelled trophic simulations despite simulations attempting to decrease the population the ribbed mussel a atra also had a greater modelled biomass than expected from empirical values 5 8x observed values therefore it is likely that trophic impacts such as predation and competition for food were not the only reasons for the disappearance of c meridionalis and the reduction in a atra it was only when the presence of alien mussels was employed as a mediating effect that directly increased the modelled vulnerability of c meridionalis thereby making it easier for predators of c meridionalis to find and feed on it that the biomass of this mussel decreased to negligible levels in the absence of this mediating effect when all the ecosystem services of both mussels and barnacles were combined with the effects of wave action c meridionalis modelled biomass in 2015 increased to levels comparable to the 2015 biomass of large m galloprovincialis the biomass of c meridionals was not even noticeably changed by the inclusion of five large storms from 1980 to 2015 unlike the predators and native filter feeders almost all the modelled grazers responded to the combination of all ecological processes largely as expected their final simulated biomasses closely matched those measured on marcus island in 2015 the major exception was p angulosus which generated a model biomass in 2015 that was more than 1000 times that observed and this effect was present from the very beginning of the trophic simulations at the end of all the simulations other seaweeds also deviated little from what was expected which indicates that like the grazers and zooplankton the change in algal biomass was mostly affected by trophic interactions shannon wiener and pielou s indices were used to evaluate the relative biodiversity and evenness generated by each simulation in 2015 against the 2015 ecopath model the ecosim model results matched these statistics most closely at the end of the simulation when either a only shelter was added ψ2 or b when all the ecosystem services were combined and added to the trophic interactions ψ4 however incorporating feeding grounds ψ3 was the only method in which the arrival of alien mussels was associated with the local extinction of c meridionalis in the model as observed in reality on marcus island adding wave action ω1 4 on top of trophic impacts by non native and native species and mediation did not appear to have any impact on diversity indices and little effect on the biomasses of the groups this was unexpected but was most likely due to simulated wave action removing a constant proportion of groups found on the low shore when in reality wave action will selectively remove species and individuals that are more weakly attached or present greater resistance to passing water denny 1987 1995 there are two additional possible explanations for the small effect of wave action first griffiths 1981 and griffiths and hockey 1987 found that mortality of adult mussels is largely caused by juveniles pushing beneath them so that the adults are then eliminated by wave action second wave action is a two edged sword ripping invertebrates and seaweeds off rocks while at the same time bringing in particulate material as food for filter feeders and boosting their biomass bustamante and branch 1996a a trade off that could not be explicitly included in the models 4 3 ecosim modelling studies on alien invasions we simulated the trophic impacts of non native invasions within the time dynamic model ecosim walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 by way of forced biomasses this approach was chosen because one objective was to determine how well the ecological processes could be simulated the actual biomasses of all the non native species were known for key years in addition a very specific trend was observed in which there was massive recruitment of mytilus galloprovincialis just after it invaded marcus island followed by a sharp increase in biomass that peaked after five to ten years and then a slow but steady decrease it would not have been possible to introduce this trend and specific numbers into ecosim without using forced biomasses however by using forced biomasses of non native species their biomass remained unchanged in response to any other ecological process subsequently added therefore it was not possible to use the model to assess if any changes in native competitors would have affected the biomass of non native functional groups corrales et al 2020 only one other published ecosim model has been created to study an intertidal rocky shore ecosystem that was invaded by an ecosystem engineer the occupation of antofagasta bay in chile by the tunicate pyura praeputialis ortiz et al 2013 the ecosim simulations undertaken did not describe how the tunicate was introduced to the model system but rather what would happen if it were placed under intense fishing effort similar modelling studies of invasions on open coast and pelagic systems have included temporal simulations within ecosim a number of which concentrated on scenarios in which already present invasive species were being harvested daskalov 2002 hossain et al 2010 ortiz et al 2013 wong and dowd 2014 corrales et al 2017 reviewed by corrales et al 2020 corrales et al 2018 for example showed that under the combined effects of intense fishing increased alien invasions and climate change that fishing regulations introduced to reduce fishing pressure would increase stocks but that this benefit would be offset by the negative effects of increased water temperature and alien species studies focused on the introduction of species into a time dynamic model have used a variety of strategies to assess their impact on other functional groups including forced biomass rogers et al 2014 a fitted time series to help force the biomass pinnegar et al 2014 artificial fisheries that set the initial biomass of the invasive species and then allow them to be fished out almost completely and then recover arias gonzález et al 2011 increased vulnerabilities of the prey of invasive species thereby increasing the invasive biomass pinnegar et al 2014 or combinations of these strategies langseth et al 2012 langseth et al 2012 compared all these methods when simulating the introduction of a non native water flea mussel and fish species into lakes huron and michigan of the great lakes system in north america overall they considered that the preferred method is to start with low initial biomass and force the biomass rather than use fitted data they also adopted this approach because time series of data were available and the objective of the study was to explore the ecological impact of the invasive functional groups mediation by one functional group of other predator prey interactions has been used in several previous studies to capture non trophic effects using the ecosim approach for a recent application see vilas et al 2020 however habitat alteration by ecosystem engineers has not been extensively modelled in this manner with the exception of protection provided by some marine plants in the form of shelter of prey species from predators or expansion of feeding areas and food availability for consumers such effects have been modelled to explore the mediating effects of kelp in relation to the reintroduction of sea otters to the west coast of canada where kelp increases the feeding areas and food availability for particular fish espinosa romero et al 2011 similarly seagrass habitat complexity reduces effective search rates by predators of juvenile blue crabs in chesapeake bay ma et al 2010 and offers shelter to juvenile pacific salmon harvey 2014 our study pushes the boundaries of mediation effects in ecosim by sequentially adding mediation by mussels and barnacles as ecosystem engineers providing habitat substrate shelter and feeding grounds to other rocky shore species in this way capturing three indirect non trophic processes prevalent within the rocky shore ecosystem that are subject to substantial change under invasion by alien species 5 conclusions a layered approach was utilized to explore ecological processes that were deemed the most relevant for an open invaded ecosystem including trophic impacts by non native ecosystem engineers and native species for which time series data existed non trophic impacts by changes in structural complexity and extra mortality caused by wave action unlike all the other impacts changes in structural complexity are technically a spatially driven effect of ecosystem engineering using mediation in a temporal model to introduce shelter on its own or substrate shelter and feeding grounds collectively was successful in that the approach resulted in end year biomasses and indices of species diversity close to those measured on marcus island in 2015 however the total biomass within the ecosystem was implausibly high due to some groups specifically p angulosus and c meridionalis having values that greatly exceeded those recorded on the shore in the case of p angulosus this is likely due to overestimation of the initial biomass as well as a lack of any intertidal predation on this species in the model ecosystem this functional group requires further careful parameterisation in trophic models of this and similar ecosystems developed in the future choromytilus meridionalis had a high biomass in 1980 and then progressively disappeared as the alien m galloprovincialis became established the decline of c meridionalis and the failure of most of the simulations to be able to simulate this has several possible explanations first recruitment of mussels is known to be highly variable and fails completely in some years reaugh flower et al 2011 choromytilus meridionalis may have arrived on the intertidal shores of marcus island in a sweepstake settlement that was not repeated and simply died out in the absence of further recruitment to the site as recruitment was not directly addressed in the model it would have failed to simulate such a decline only simulation ψ3 mus fig a4 in which an increase in the mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis was used to increase the vulnerability of c meridionalis to predation succeeded in reducing it to levels corresponding with its disappearance from the island second the starting biomass of c meridionalis was set high to reflect its domination in 1980 if competition for space with m galloprovincialis drove its demise the model would not have yielded a decline in c meridionalis because competition for space was not among the ecological processes simulated the simulations reported here focused on trophic interactions and processes related to interactions that are modified by structural complexity to fully explore the effects of structural complexity however spatially driven mediation is required despite not accommodating spatial effects the ecopath models of our study did yield several insights into the processes influencing communities on the rocky shore of marcus island first after its arrival the alien mediterranean mussel and particularly small individuals played the greatest role in influencing the responses of other groups in simulations examining trophic effects results from simulation φ smm trophic effects of small m galloprovincialis overwhelmingly influenced other simulations involving the effects of all alien ecosystem engineers φ all or the added effects of all native groups x second the addition of structural complexity to trophic interactions simulations ψ1 4 improved the fits of the data of many groups to the biomasses observed in 2015 in particular inclusion of feeding grounds ψ3 yielded the lowest sum of squares and akaike information criterion in most cases this was due to the incorporation of the effects of the alien mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis while the addition of the barnacle b glandula had little extra effect third the addition of disturbance in the form of wave action simulations ω1 4 had surprisingly little effect on the biomass of almost all groups except for predicted elimination of the periwinkle a knysnaensis within about 10 y this was unexpected as both empirical evidence and models have demonstrated that differences in disturbance frequency and intensity influence community dynamics and mediate species interactions e g dayton 1971 steffani and branch 2003 branch and steffani 2004 castorani and baskett 2019 explanations of this advanced above include intraspecific competition for space overpowering the effects of wave action and provision of food by wave action compensating for mortality fourth many of the strong interactions emerging from the mixed trophic group analysis are readily explicable in terms of direct predation of one group upon another falling into this category would be 1 consumption by anemones of small arthropods small mussels polychaetes and burnupena whelks kruger and griffiths 1998 2 predation by oystercatchers on limpets polychaetes and dogwhelks hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 coleman and hockey 2008 other interactions likely arose from competition for food resources most notably evident in negative effects among the various sizes and species of mussels a third group of interactions involved indirect effects consumption of dogwhelks and limpets by oystercatchers may respectively have promoted barnacles which are preyed upon by dogwhelks mcquaid 1985 and algae such as porphyra and ulva which are eaten by limpets bustamante and branch 1996b some interactions however remain inexplicable beyond simply recognising the complex interconnectedness of the intertidal foodweb described here the most glaring case is the negative effect of polychaetes on the sponge hymeniacidon perlevis for these groups share no obvious direct or indirect trophic links there are limitations to using ecopath with ecosim christensen and walters 2004 in particular using ecopath to model recently invaded intertidal ecosystems fails to account for non trophic relationships due to its static nature this was partially addressed with the use of ecosim temporal modelling and the implementation of mediation effects nevertheless in the process of undertaking this time dynamic modeling caveats emerged that could guide future modeling studies of alien invasions and or intertidal ecosystems adding to the list of ecological gaps that exist in modelling fulton et al 2019 1 forcing biomass of aliens by forcing the biomass of non native species any effect of other species or non trophic impacts on aliens is lost including effects on their recruitment nevertheless in this and a number of previous studies forcing the biomass of aliens was deemed the preferred method to introduce aliens into a temporal simulation where the effects of alien invasions on other species in the ecosystem are included 2 ecosystem engineering mediation was used to describe how structural complexity created by ecosystem engineers could either protect prey from predators or increase predator search rate each ecosystem engineer or mediator can have a very specific effect on each functional group to cover all of these interactions over 30 mediation functions would have had to have been created verified and applied in the mediation form this in turn would have added excessive uncertainties to the model by limiting the number of mediation functions and representing qualitative rather than quantitative relationships uncertainties could be minimized 3 wave action the removal of low shore species by wave action was constant for all selected groups when in reality species and individuals that are prone to removal will be more readily ripped off rocks and the effects of wave action will not be confined to the low shore 4 zonation all the species were spread equally over the entire study site in this non spatialized model the only simulations that included some zonation were the last four of 22 simulations which used wave action to create extra mortality of species most likely to occupy the low shore however this resolution of low shore versus high shore was crude as found in sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 zonation is an important factor governing community composition a review by corrales et al 2020 notes that most available modelling applications addressing the impacts of alien species are dynamic but non spatial 5 competition another limitation of the trophic modelling undertaken thus far is inadequate accommodation of competition for space and structural complexity to capture the full dynamics of intertidal systems simulations need to be spatially explicit to account for the fact that species occupy different zones and will interact directly only if they coexist in a zone or share resources that shift among zones a follow up paper will address some of these shortcomings using ecospace a spatial temporal dynamic modelling routine walters et al 1999 christensen and walters 2004 ecosystem engineers will be incorporated spatially either through mediation or through a new

24769,jellyfish behavior and physiology significantly influence spatial distribution and aggregations in the marine environment however current models used to study these transport patterns have a limited incorporation of these physiological and behavioral variables in this paper the life cycle and movement of the mauve stinger pelagia noctiluca is simulated from fertilized egg up to the adult

transport is solely governed by ocean currents but vertical distribution is controlled by diel vertical migration motility and stage of development particle agents are released along the submarine canyons in the spanish mediterranean waters during the spring reproduction period to later disperse and develop through an interplay between physical and biological processes when compared with a simpler model that omits behavior and physiology the biophysical model is able to qualitatively better predict stranding events in the balearic sea our results expose the potential for operational life stage and distribution modelling of jellyfish keywords pelagia noctiluca agent based model behavior balearic sea diurnal vertical migration development stage 1 introduction jellyfish are a known nuisance for tourism fisheries and water intakes graham et al 2014 purcell et al 2007 richardson et al 2009 although they are a natural feature of a healthy ecosystem an increasing trend in jellyfish blooms is caused by a combination of warmer waters eutrophication over fishing and disturbance to natural habitats mills 2001 pauly et al 2009 better prediction of these blooms and their area of impact will support the previously mentioned industries to mitigate their effect or alter their course of action jellyfish are gelatinous zooplankton present in a large variety of marine environments where their transport is controlled by the flow direction and velocity of their surrounding environment e g ocean and tidal currents graham et al 2001 however the biology of jellyfish can also strongly influence their vertical displacement fossette et al 2015 lilley et al 2014 which combined by environmental forces effects their horizontal movement werner et al 2015 in view of this understanding biophysical jellyfish displacement would improve knowledge on their biology dispersion and stranding locations one instance of jellyfish nuisance is the invading swarms of pelagia noctiluca cnidaria scyphozoa forskal 1775 which tend to form in the western mediterranean brotz and pauly 2012 mills 2001 and cause harm to the tourism and fishing industries through beach closures clogged fishing nets and economic harm to aquaculture aznar et al 2017 bosch belmar et al 2017 ghermandi et al 2015 pelagia noctiluca hereinafter referred to as p noctiluca also known as the mauve stinger resides offshore in deep waters and is characterized by a holoplanktonic life cycle diel vertical migrations and reproduction by direct development without a benthic stage ferraris et al 2012 mariottini et al 2008 to model biological impact on the horizontal displacement of p noctiluca one must consider the ontogenetic development and include the effects of life stages swimming speeds and behavioral patterns werner et al 2015 starting with non motile fertilized eggs free swimming planulae hatch to later develop into ephyrae and then adult medusae throughout these stages swimming capabilities develop due to increased pulsations and bell size and behavioral patterns are established shaping a well defined diel vertical migration pattern while horizontal transport is critically dependent on the physical environment currents chapman et al 2011 qiu et al 2010 p noctiluca can actively swim in the vertical direction diving during the day and surfacing at night in a pattern that reduces predation and provides a feeding advantage berline et al 2013 ferraris et al 2012 numerical modelling has been successfully applied to simulate i the spatial and temporal variations in

p noctiluca augustine et al 2014 avian 1986 rosa et al 2012 sandrini and avian 1983 the mediterranean coastal waters of spain including the balearic islands were selected for the biophysical modelling

activities two sectors impacted by p noctiluca blooms ghermandi et al 2015 the aim of this study is to improve jellyfish distribution and stranding modelling by including jellyfish specific behavior and development for this we developed an individual based lagrangian particle model for p noctiluca distribution based on life cycle motility and behavior applied to the spanish mediterranean coast

design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2020 2006 2 1 study area the mediterranean coastal waters of spain including the balearic islands were selected for the biophysical modelling approach to study the mauve stinger the predominant circulation patterns in the spanish mediterranean waters are a characteristic of the western mediterranean basin a semi isolated oceanic system exchanging water with the north atlantic ocean marine water from the atlantic flows through the strait of gibraltar into the basin and becomes denser because of the intense evaporation thus producing a stronger saline water layer near the sea bed robinson et al 2001 this results in weak stratification and deep vertical mixing of up to 2000 m schroeder 2018 on the surface the circulation is characterized by surface eddies along the african coast and a steady along shore current at the european coast buffett et al 2013 additionally seasonal storms and wind bursts can induce cross shore surface currents the marine topography of the area is characterized by a shallow continental shelf spanning up to 70 km with a depth of 100 m followed by deep waters of up to 3000 m connecting the two zones are marine canyons that act as vertical conveyor belts between deep and shallow waters enhancing marine biodiversity and function for marine species including p noctiluca allen and durrieu de madron 2009 flexas et al 2008 harris and whiteway 2011 würtz 2012 offshore model boundaries and the spanish coastline including the cities of barcelona and valencia in addition to the balearic islands are shown in fig 1 2 2 model description 2 2 1 purpose and patterns the purpose of our biophysical model is to improve the accuracy of stranding events predictions of p noctiluca through hydrodynamic forcing in combination with biophysical modelling features mainly life cycle motility and behavior we evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce the pattern of p noctiluca stranding events based on the assumption that hydrodynamic forcing the moment of spawning along the marine canyon ridge diurnal migration and the effect of biological growth on horizontal and vertical distribution all have major influence on the final outcome the resulting stranding events are compared spatially and temporally to in situ stranding as described in section 2 4 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the biophysical model is composed of two entities 1 the agents representing p noctiluca and 2 the 3 dimensional grid cells representing the host environment each agent is a super individual representing an equal percentage of the p noctiluca population agents are characterized by the state variables identification number nr stage nr time stage hr location x y swimming speed m d and depth m in turn each of these state variables is dependent on constant stage properties such as vertical swimming speed buoyancy and total stage time the host grid cell state variables include location x y z current velocity m s current direction water depth m luminosity simplified to time of sunrise and sunset time and landmask a boolean which returns true for coastline and false for water information about the environmental state variables is obtained through the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems http marine copernicus eu and communicated to our model through a structured grid consisting of discrete rectilinear cells and a z vertical grid the horizontal resolution is 1 24 ca 4 km and consists of 141 unevenly spaced vertical levels this feature provides enhanced vertical resolution that can handle steep topography and resolve deep water exchanges results are available at hourly intervals in a 3 dimensional domain covering the whole vertical profile clementi et al 2018 the biophysical model runs on spatial and temporal resolution of the input hydrodynamic model whereas the agents are traced by coordinated and therefore operate on a finer resolution 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the biophysical model runs in discrete time steps and in each step all entities and their corresponding state variables are updated the processes included are spawning development stage diurnal vertical migration horizontal transport and stranding the biophysical model is started with the release of particle agents representing fertilized eggs these agents will develop over time into planulae ephyrae and mature medusae each of these stages of development has a specified buoyancy and swimming velocity during development between stages the buoyancy and swimming velocity will be interpolated based on the agent s development time the progression of development time is affected by the water temperature which in extreme cases leads to a complete halt in development swimming velocity is affected by the agent s motility which is in turn affected by the experienced water temperature diurnal vertical migration is dependent on luminosity and stage development agents dive during the day and ascend during the night at a vertical swimming speed relative to the stage an ephyra swims slower than an adult with a maximum diving depth relative to the bathymetry the vertical transport is a result of the agents vertical direction of migration buoyancy and swimming velocity on the other hand horizontal transport depends exclusively on advection from horizontal currents agents that reach the land boundary of the hydrodynamic model are considered stranded and agents that reach the water boundary leave the domain during each time step the processes are executed in the following order 1 development stage and resulting buoyancy and swimming velocity 2 motility 3 vertical direction based on day or night time 4 maximum diving depth limit as a result state variables are updated and will thereby directly affect the movement of the entity particle agents transport of agents is based on flow velocity as experienced by the hydrodynamic forcing in addition to the vertical movement based on the diurnal vertical migration process the scheduling of these processes is depicted in fig 2 2 2 4 design concepts based on the description of the odd protocol grimm et al 2020 2006 the design concepts objectives learning prediction stochasticity and collectives do not apply to this model 2 2 4 1 basic principles the model uses a data driven approach to capture the growth and transport of p noctiluca particle agents which is influenced by an interaction of environmental variables temperature luminosity sea water depth on the vertical displacement of agents and hydrodynamic variables currents on the horizontal advection induced displacement of agents this is achieved through the several submodels presented in section 2 2 7 mortality effects of predation and grazing patters are not part of this model reproduction is also disregarded since sex is not a state variable of the agents and simulation time represents only one life cycle 2 2 4 2 emergence the variation in mobility patterns development stage and stranding events emerge from the adaptive traits of the particle agents and the environmental conditions different sea water temperatures will dictate how fast the agents will develop from one stage to another and build up their vertical swimming capabilities respectively 2 2 4 3 adaptation the vertical swimming pattern of the particle agents is an adaptive trait influenced by luminosity and development stage agents take decisions to dive or surface based on the time of the day and their ability to reach the surface or the limiting dive depth is function of their development in turn development stage is an adaptive trait influenced by the sea water temperature both traits do not explicitly seek to increase individual success for example particle agents will not actively migrate towards warmer waters to achieve faster development 2 2 4 4 sensing each particle agent is capable of locally sensing the environmental state variables of the 3 dimensional grid cell in which it is located the sensed variables are sea water temperature luminosity day or night and sea water depth each agent senses these values accurately hence the model does not represent the mechanism of sensing and the uncertainty associated 2 2 4 5 interaction p noctiluca swimming pattern is sometimes directed towards maintaining large aggregations or swarms dawson and hamner 2009 but this is not reproduced in our biophysical mode there is no interaction nor communication between particle agents and they do not affect each other s decisions 2 2 4 6 observation the three dimensional location of the particle agents is recorded at every time step this is also applicable to stranding events which are temporally and spatially logged to monitor biological growth stage development complemented by the water temperature and motility are also recorded at every time step this helps understand and analyze the link between spatial distribution development stage and temperature 2 2 5 initialization agents representing fertilized eggs are released into our model during the peak spawning period which occurs during spring and peaks at temperatures of 17 c augustine et al 2014 the spatial extent of this release is limited to the presence of marine canyons which provide a reproductive advantage by transporting jellyfish from deep to surface layers through enhanced upwelling benedetti cecchi et al 2015 thus fertilized eggs are released in our model top layer at a depth of 0 m evenly distributed within the spatial extent of the marine canyon ridge fig 3 release occurs over a period of 10 days after the first reproduction peak moment in spring and follows the warming of the mediterranean waters from south to north along the marine canyon ridge as detected in the cmems hydrodynamic wave model according to the monthly mean temperature data from cmems fig 3 peak spawning occurs sometime between march and april thus a total of 10 000 particles are continuously released during the 10 day period at a rate of 1000 particle per day from may 8 2018 until may 18 2018 2 2 6 input data our model is coupled offline with the cmems hydrodynamic wave model velocity vectors and temperature data at hourly intervals to supply the information needed to resolve the physical and behavioral effects on the agents horizontal current data and seawater temperature along the vertical grid provide information for all water depth in our model the exact time of sunrise and sunset are calculated using the astronomical computational package pyephem http rhodesmill org pyephem this information is provided to every agent 2 2 7 submodels 2 2 7 1 development the biophysical model is designed to capture the development stage and corresponding behavior throughout p noctiluca s life cycle field observations laboratory studies and deb dynamic energy budget simulations display a strong influence of temperature on development time augustine et al 2014 avian 1986 rosa et al 2012 sandrini and avian 1983 this link is shown in table 1 and the growth ratio is presented graphically in fig 4 by linearly interpolating the growth rates corresponding to the different temperatures growth ratio appears to increase exponentially before reaching a threshold and then declines this would be expected following principles of enzyme kinetics and is frequently modelled using an arrhenius equation boyd et al 2018 bueno pardo et al 2019 politikos et al 2015 nevertheless in this biophysical model a data driven approach has been applied to define the influence of temperature on development the linear interpolation equation for the growth factor is 1 g g 1 g 2 g 1 t 2 t 1 t t 1 where g growth factor of agent t water temperature detected by agent c and g1 and g2 are the growth factors at the theoretical temperatures t1 and t2 shown in table 2 maximum growth corresponds to fastest development which is equivalent to a development period of 1 day from fertilized egg to planula 2 days from planula to ephyra rosa et al 2012 and 2 months from ephyra to mature medusa augustine et al 2014 growth comes to a halt as water temperatures exceed 25 c malej 1989 or drop below 4 5 c avian 1986 the term mature medusa or adult jellyfish is used to refer to an individual with reproductive capabilities and is not established on anatomy following that p noctiluca can live for up to 12 months ferraris et al 2012 hence mortality will not be included into our model to describe this development numerically each released particle is characterized by two properties termed stage and time stage at the initial instance to the stage variable is set to the default value of 1 and time stage to 25 h corresponding to a fertilized egg afterwards with every numerical loop the variable time stage is reduced by a factored time step corrected by the growth factor which adds the influence of water temperature until it reaches a value of 0 at this point the variable stage is increased by one and time stage takes a new value analogous to the development time of a planula by doing so each particle develops independently with a development speed influenced by the water temperature the same process is applied to the planula which develops into an ephyra and then in turn into an adult jellyfish the contribution of development stage in the transport of particles is interpreted through the behavioral processes and effect on vertical swimming speed explained in section 2 7 2 2 2 7 2 vertical swimming speed vertical swimming speed is derived from the development stage of the agent and then adjusted to the temperature of the environment no studies thoroughly document the swimming speed of p noctiluca so estimations from other publications and studies performed on other jellyfish species were used conley and uye 2015 garaventa et al 2010 during the first stage fertilized eggs drift passively with currents afterwards during the second stage particles gradually develop swimming capabilities eventually achieving maximum speeds of 5 m h in agreement with reported swimming speeds of aurelia aurita moon jelly planulae conley and uye 2015 as they develop into ephyrae swimming capabilities are expected to further improve reaching a maximum of 100 m h in stage 4 adult stage this speed has been already used in a previously published p noctiluca model berline et al 2013 moreover it is coherent with the average swimming speed of 180 m h recorded by attaching an accelerometer to the much larger jellyfish rhizostoma octopus fossette et al 2015 the calculation of swimming speed is as follows 2 v i v i 1 v i 1 v i 1 s d where subscript i represents the stage of the agent vi is the swimming speed of the agent v i 1 is the swimming speed at stage i 1 vi 1 is the swimming speed at stage i 1 and sd is the stage development factor of agent i expressed in percentage sd values are between 0 and 100 and represent the status of development of the agent within a stage the influence of seawater temperature on vertical swimming speed is then added through the so called motility ratio obtained through a linear fit between percent motility relative to number of pulsations and water temperature values recorded in laboratory tests avian et al 1991 thus each particle has a swimming speed equivalent to an absolute speed relative to the biological development adjusted for the effect of temperature using the motility ratio trend shown in fig 4 the following equation is used for the calculation of the motility ratio 3 m m 1 m 2 m 1 t 2 t 1 t t 1 where m motility ratio of agent t water temperature detected by the agent c and m1 and m2 are the growth factors at the theoretical temperatures t1 and t2 shown in table 2 last the temperature adjusted agent swimming speed is obtained by multiplying the motility ratio m by the swimming speed vi eq 4 4 v v i m for the calculation of the vertical swimming speeds used in the diurnal vertical migration section 2 7 3 an additional buoyancy parameter is added buoyancy is calculated according to eq 5 and is factored by the stage development factor sd 5 b i b i 1 b i 1 b i 1 s d where subscript i represents the stage of the agent bi is the buoyancy of the agent v i 1 is the buoyancy at stage i 1 vi 1 is the buoyancy at stage i 1 and sd is the stage development factor of agent i expressed in percentage 2 2 7 3 diurnal vertical migration agents in the biophysical model are programmed to perform diurnal vertical migration a feature of p noctiluca berline et al 2013 ferraris et al 2012 this is translated into the numerical model by adding a diurnal function which prompts the particles to dive during the day and surface during the night in the water column luminosity dissolved oxygen turbidity and water density contribute in defining the boundaries of the vertical movement cartes et al 2013 graham et al 2003 jansson and källander 1968 macquart moulin and castelbon 1990 however in our model this is simplified into a positive correlation between bathymetry and dive limit in deep offshore waters exceeding 1500 m particles migrate until 350 m berline et al 2013 kanda et al 1989 and when bathymetry becomes shallower the dive limit decreases accordingly dafni et al 1987 kanda et al 1989 the maximum depth trend is shown in fig 4 agents are programmed to dive 1 h after sunrise and ascend 1 h after sunset anokhina 2006 at a rate equivalent to the vertical swimming speed adjusted to buoyancy the vertical swimming speed for diving and ascending is calculated by adding the influence of buoyancy according to the following equation 6 v z b i v for ascending agents 7 v z b i v for diving agents 2 2 7 4 stranding stranding events are recorded when the agents hit the coastline once agents are stranded they cannot become active again this approach does not take into consideration the transport patterns abundant in shallow waters like breaking waves and rip currents stranding is a default function that comes with the opendrift model at each time step the location of the agents is checked by the landmask function which then identifies the agents that are stranded 2 3 comparison with alternative model structures additionally and for comparison we developed a simple drift model and fixed diurnal vertical behavior model fixed diurnal behavior model hereafter berline et al 2013 the biophysical model and simple drift model were configured to run starting from the spring reproduction period for a total of 8 months while the fixed diurnal behavior model was configured to start when strong vertical behavior became present in the biophysical model a similar initial release along submarine canyons is used for the biophysical and simple drifting models 10 000 agents particles are released linearly in time starting on the 8th of may 2018 from the southern lon 0 388 lat 38 884 up to the northern edge lon 0 3819 lat 38 907 in the fixed diurnal behavior model initial release locations of agents are obtained from the positions of active agents in the biophysical model on the 1st of june this coupling procedure intends to disregard reproduction and early life stages when diurnal vertical migration is absent in all three simulations the models run until the 15th of december 2018 all models are summarized in table 3 the fixed diurnal behavior model starts later in the year and with fewer agents as the model is initialized on current locations of the biophysical model and a portion of the agents has moved across the model water boundary 2 4 model validation to validate the simulated stranding events online published sightings data are used the spatial and temporal distribution of these sightings were collected from the jellyfish monitoring program set up by the mediterranean science commission www ciesm org marine programs jellywatch htm and the citizen science jellyfish program www jellywatch org gathered information was classified according to location and time and then compiled into the georeferenced map shown in fig 1 for the time interval of may until december 2018 there are 8 stranding events recorded over 4 different administrative units 3 results in this section results of the biophysical model showing transport growth and stranding are presented and then confronted with simple drifting and fixed diurnal behavior berline et al 2013 a résumé of the results is presented in table 4 3 1 biophysical model output of the biophysical model focuses on transport biological growth and vertical behavior first the final spatial distribution of the agents by the end of the run time is presented in fig 5 more than half 58 8 of the released agents leave the model domain while the remaining agents either end up stranded on beaches 15 77 or active 25 43 active agents are mostly concentrated in the offshore deep waters between lon 2 and lon 5 with the remaining minority sparsely divided along the coasts while stranded agents are spread with a more complex pattern on the spatial level stranding events are evenly distributed along the coastlines of the three islands from south to north ibiza mallorca and menorca but unevenly spread along the spanish mainland coast stranding events are non existent north of barcelona while one single event is recorded just south of the city further south starting from lat 41 2 the frequency of stranding events increases and becomes geographically more consistent all the way until the southern border of the model with a peak along the coastal section in the vicinity of valencia lat 39 up to lat 40 the temporal distribution of the stranding events is variable throughout the simulation period fig 6 fewest events occur during the months of may and june with a significant increase in july followed by a steady sum of events in august and september following that is a spike resulting in the peak number of events during october 432 with a relatively small number of events during november 394 a steep decrease follows in the month of december with only 36 events all agents stranded in the period spanning from april to september are exclusively stage 3 ephyrae agents stranded in october are of stage 3 or stage 4 adults with exclusive adult stranding events during november and december 3 1 1 biological growth biological growth is interpreted through the different development stages shown in fig 6 for all 10 000 agents and fig 7 for 1 randomly selected agent during the initial release all agents representing fertilized eggs stage 1 quickly develop into planulae stage 2 which in turn become ephyrae stage 3 by the end of may for the majority of their lifecycle the agents remain in stage 3 with the first stage 4 agents emerging in the beginning of october the transition from stage 3 to stage 4 continues throughout october until all agents become adults in november growth ratio check fig 7b varies between a maximum of 100 an average somewhere between 75 and 50 and a minimum that drops to 0 during small intervals 3 1 2 diurnal vertical migration diurnal vertical migration is expressed through the variation in agent depth fig 7c and is function of biological growth ratio of motility and bathymetry during the first period through stage 1 and well into stage 2 the agent remains on the surface before sharply diving to deeper than 200 m during the initial phase of stage 3 afterwards a rebound phase in which the agent starts pushing more towards the surface initiates this phase ends around the mid end of june giving way to a new vertical swimming behavior characterized by well defined patterns of surface to bottom fluctuations an additional feature of the diving pattern is the difference in dive depth which varies from shallow dives of few tens of meters to maxima of 350 m 3 2 comparison across models 3 2 1 spatial distribution of agents in this section the results of the spatial distribution of the biophysical simple drift and fixed diurnal behavior models are compared the spatial occurrence probability maps of the different models are used to evaluate the likelihood of the presence of agents in a given grid cell the maps are generated by averaging the hourly occurrence data over the whole simulation period the purpose of this comparison is to identify the geographic areas with the highest occurrence probability across the different models therefore the results presented in fig 8 will be interpreted visually the biophysical model fig 8 a exhibits a strong probability of occurrence concentrated offshore in between latitudes 39 n and 40 n characterized by a clearly defined central eddy while the simple model fig 8b demonstrates a contrasting probability map which is spread out in space and indicates tracks that are similar in form to surface currents similarly a spatial probability map is produced for the fixed diurnal behavior model in fig 8 c and d displaying the occurrence probability starting from the 1st of june once again the results show divergent probabilities between the two models while the location of the high occurrence zone in the fixed diurnal behavior model matches that of the biophysical its size is significantly smaller and it does not show the spiral shape attributed to the local hydrodynamics 3 2 2 stranding events the total number of stranding events predicted in different administrative units see fig 1 are shown in table 5 the simple drifting model reports more than a thousand stranding events during the month of may zone es514 and more than 500 stranding events during the months of june and july zone es533 in contrast the biophysical and fixed diurnal behavior model report stranding events in the order of 10 the inconsistency in the spatial and temporal distribution of the results combined with the difference in the magnitude of the reported stranding events eliminate the option of producing meaningful statistical results the performance of models in terms of predicting stranding events will be further discussed in section 4 3 3 model validation with in situ stranding observations since data obtained through citizen science approaches relies on the contributions from volunteers the available data set of in situ observations is limited in number of stranding events and characterized by discrepancies in time and space the nature of this data set makes the validation process approximative hence a general qualitative analysis of stranding data obtained from all three simulations will be used in the following comparison data shown in table 5 shows the stranding events per geographic zone and not for a particular location starting with zones where in situ observations are available from north to south in es522 the biophysical model ii is the most accurate with the highest number of stranding events during august when compared to the other two models in zone es523 the simple drifting model iii provides the best approximation for the month of july followed by better results from the biophysical model for the months of august and september while the fixed diurnal model iv outputs no stranding events last in zone es521 all three models completely fail to capture the stranding in june and only the fixed diurnal behavior model partially captures stranding in august in july the simple drifting model gives better prediction while the biophysical model is the sole model to forecast stranding in september in short the biophysical model ranks first in capturing the spatial pattern of stranding events predicting 6 out of the 8 jellyfish sightings followed by the simple drift model with 4 out of 8 and last the fixed diurnal behavior model with 3 out of 8 4 discussion the purpose of this study is to include biological traits and assess the interaction between physical dispersion and physiological behavior the role of biological processes is believed to be crucial with significant effect on transport and population dynamics treml et al 2007 implementing these behavior regimes and growth stages requires information which is species specific thus creating a range of possibilities in the amount of influence biology has on dispersion regarding p noctiluca results of the simulations performed in this study expose the sensitivity of agents to biological behavior and the impact it has on spatial dispersion this is clearly visible in the contradicting transportation patterns followed by agents released in the biophysical and simple drifting models which reflects the importance of considering vertical movement in spatially predicting individual based particle tracking models for this jellyfish species additionally when comparing the results of the biophysical model to that of the fixed behavior model the impacts of variation in swimming speed and temperature in diurnal migration on the spatial distribution are exposed by including this variation in the biophysical model the accuracy of spatially predicting stranding events improved in comparison to the fixed diurnal behavior model within this study our aim was to develop a methodology for a temporally and spatially explicit p noctiluca stranding model including key behavioral processes to their distribution capable of supporting a screening level baseline assessment nevertheless there were several simplifications and limitations in our analyses it was necessary to select a single hydrodynamic year for the baseline assessment to reduce the amount of computational and postprocessing time required running multiple year cycles of our model maintaining a single spawning moment would provide insight in the influence of the hydrodynamic year on model results this would allow for inclusion of multiple years of in field data for comparison potentially enabling a statistical model evaluation through a sensitivity analysis the derived jellyfish model characteristics could be tested for their influence on the model result there are multiple methods to calibrate and evaluate individual based models macpherson and gras 2016 van der vaart et al 2016 nevertheless the lack of coherent and in field data and the quality and amount of in situ observations do no permit for any quantitative assessment this lack of in field data table 5 prohibits the possibility to derive a statistical based goodness of fit for our model as the data that is available 8 measurements appears to have a strong spatial correlation between stranding events es521 es522 es523 and recorded stranding amounts vary widely 100 or 1000 strandings the biophysical model results predict yearlong stranding events while observations are mainly available during summer period seasonality of these observations is potentially related to the activeness of observations along the coasts during the summer months or could be otherwise attributed to the theory of pitt and lucas 2014 that p noctiluca migrate to deeper waters during winter however observations in literature suggest otherwise as stranding events of p noctiluca are reported during the winter months fleming et al 2013 mariottini et al 2008 yahia et al 2003 thus justifying the yearlong stranding events in the biophysical model additionally and when data is available the biophysical model provides predictions with reasonable accuracy in qualitative terms and performs better than both the simple drifting and fixed diurnal behavior models looking into the spatial and temporal distribution of the stranding events another fact which stands out is the high number of stranding events along the three islands in all three models this is most likely related to the fact that islands are not shielded from the winds and currents from either direction thus cross shore forcing a major factor in stranding is more frequent keesing et al 2016 ourmieres et al 2018 temporally the simplistic model yields more stranding events in the first period first 2 months of simulation this exposes the intrinsic property of simplistic models susceptibility to temporal changes in meteorological conditions for example an interval of cross shore currents can cause a high number of beach stranding events over a small period of time this disturbance to realistic dispersion is surpassed by the biophysical model through an increased retention period and a reduction in the influence of hydraulic and environmental parameters another benefit of biophysical modelling is the information it delivers regarding growth and development stage this development of egg towards adult jellyfish seems to be accurate as agents reach the adult stage starting from october and peaking in number during november corresponding to the time window of the autumn reproduction period milisenda et al 2016 it requires notion that in this study the employed models only captured the spring reproduction period of one year 2018 this year has been selected for the availability of data in valencia since the port of valencia is a partner in this project whereas running these models over longer periods with multiple reproduction cycles is likely to give better results for stranding in the early spring and summer season moreover the spawning period used in our model corresponds to the peak release of eggs achieved at an optimum temperature the missing aspect of this approach is the non peak spawning events that occur throughout time at different temperatures and are not included in this work additionally the findings of this work give a strong indication about the population connectivity in the western mediterranean basin signalled by the large proportion of agents more than 50 that exit the model domain this implies that the local populations of p noctiluca in the spanish western mediterranean waters subsidize other sub populations in adjacent waters in turn adult jellyfish are also sourced adjoining waters into the spanish waters thus creating an interexchange of individuals in the western mediterranean as a whole aglieri et al 2014 nevertheless this does not abolish the connectivity driven through self recruitment attributed to the active agents present at the end of the simulation combined both self recruited and subsidized individuals are an indication of the reproductive connectivity that links one season to the other this link could be only revealed through biophysical modelling as the number of active particles by the end of the simulation is the most sensitive variable to agent behavior last population connectivity is not the main purpose of the study and a larger big scale model would be required to adequately represent the exchange between population sources this would be achievable through an additional identity letter state variable for the agents which would differentiate between jellyfish of different subpopulations and could be used to study genetic diversity e g individual based genetic model baggio et al 2018 it is important to note that the diurnal vertical migration is simplified and this could have effects on both spatial distribution and stranding events in the biophysical model a maximum diving depth adjusted to allow for a well defined vertical pattern at different temperatures and stages was used this approach does take into consideration deviations in the diving patterns due to seasonality or other hydrodynamic phenomena p noctiluca samples have been collected in the summer period at depths of up to 1200 and 1400 m cartes et al 2013 a possible explanation is the hypothesis that jellyfish purposely dive to deeper water in order to avoid very warm unpleasant surface temperatures pitt and lucas 2014 future hydrodynamic models that capture deep sea thermal fronts could provide an opportunity to further study dive depth as a function of temperature additional processes not included in this biophysical model and necessary to mention in the discussion are predation and feeding these effects mainly influence survival and to a lesser extent development stage and vertical migration augustine et al 2014 feeding and predation have been already quantified and included in jellyfish models kristiansen et al 2007 legovic 1987 neumann et al 2016 qiu et al 2010 but have been left out of this biophysical model to limit probabilistic factors and complexity together with the biological and behavioral processes the quality and resolution of the hydrodynamic model has a large influence on the dispersion patterns kvile et al 2018 resolving shallow water currents and coastal interactions is a delicate process that requires models of higher resolution than that used in this study and preferably curvilinear or unstructured grids that can accurately trail the coastline a key constituent in the beaching process is wave action causing stranding events especially in shallow waters by increasing the spatial resolution and integrating wave action the biophysical model could be further improved for modelling the physical aspect of p noctiluca strandings 5 conclusion by including life cycle development and behavior in jellyfish modelling our study has shown better prediction of p noctiluca stranding events compared to a simple drift and fixed diurnal behavior model this biophysical model approach is likely to be of use for occurrence prediction of other jellyfish species especially those with strong vertical behavior future research that tackles the knowledge gaps we encountered should address 1 in situ field measurements which provide more accurate p noctiluca stranding events records 2 monitoring campaigns to study seasonality in p noctiluca dive depth and spatial distribution and 3 laboratory research to validate the assumptions on buoyancy swimming velocities motility and time requirements for the development stages this biophysical model could be further developed by including multiple spawning periods switching from seasonal simulations to multiannual lifecycle runs where populations are linked through reproduction through the incorporation of jellyfish sightings to test and adjust model predictions a comprehensive operational model could be setup this model would then be predicting the full lifecycle of jellyfish giving insight on the likeliness of jellyfish spatial and temporal distributions and predicting jellyfish stranding locations thereby contributing to one of the goals of the odyssea project that has funded this study the societal benefits of such a model would be numerous from early warnings to beachgoers industry intakes and fisheries to potential to mitigate upcoming jellyfish blooms and to determine the current

24769,jellyfish behavior and physiology significantly influence spatial distribution and aggregations in the marine environment however current models used to study these transport patterns have a limited incorporation of these physiological and behavioral variables in this paper the life cycle and movement of the mauve stinger pelagia noctiluca is simulated from fertilized egg up to the adult

transport is solely governed by ocean currents but vertical distribution is controlled by diel vertical migration motility and stage of development particle agents are released along the submarine canyons in the spanish mediterranean waters during the spring reproduction period to later disperse and develop through an interplay between physical and biological processes when compared with a

life stage and distribution modelling of jellyfish keywords pelagia noctiluca agent based model behavior balearic sea diurnal vertical migration development stage 1 introduction jellyfish are a known nuisance for tourism fisheries and water intakes graham et al 2014 purcell et al 2007 richardson et al 2009 although they are a natural feature of a healthy ecosystem an increasing trend in jellyfish blooms is caused by a combination of warmer waters eutrophication over fishing and disturbance to natural habitats mills 2001 pauly et al 2009 better prediction of these blooms and their area of impact will support the previously mentioned industries to mitigate their effect or alter their course of action jellyfish are gelatinous zooplankton present in a large variety of marine environments where their transport is controlled by the flow direction and velocity of their surrounding environment e g ocean and tidal currents graham et al 2001 however the biology of jellyfish can also strongly influence their vertical displacement fossette et al 2015 lilley et al 2014 which combined by environmental forces effects their horizontal movement werner et al 2015 in view of this understanding biophysical jellyfish displacement would improve knowledge on their biology dispersion and stranding locations one instance of jellyfish nuisance is the invading swarms of pelagia

clogged fishing nets and economic harm to aquaculture aznar et al 2017 bosch belmar et al 2017 ghermandi et al 2015 pelagia noctiluca hereinafter referred to as p noctiluca also known as the mauve stinger resides offshore in deep waters and is characterized by a holoplanktonic life cycle diel vertical migrations and reproduction by direct development without a benthic stage ferraris et al 2012 mariottini et al 2008 to model biological impact on the horizontal displacement of p noctiluca one must consider the ontogenetic development and include the effects of life stages swimming speeds and behavioral patterns werner et al 2015 starting with non motile fertilized eggs free swimming planulae hatch to later develop into ephyrae and then adult medusae throughout these stages swimming capabilities develop due to increased pulsations and bell size and behavioral patterns are established shaping a well defined diel vertical migration pattern while horizontal transport is critically dependent on the physical environment currents chapman et al 2011 qiu et al 2010 p noctiluca can actively swim in the vertical direction diving during the day and surfacing at night in a pattern that reduces predation and provides a feeding advantage berline et al 2013 ferraris et al 2012 numerical modelling has been successfully applied to simulate i the spatial and temporal variations in

activities two sectors impacted by p noctiluca blooms ghermandi et al 2015 the aim of this study is to improve jellyfish distribution and stranding modelling by including jellyfish specific behavior and development for this we developed an individual based lagrangian particle model for p noctiluca distribution based on life cycle motility and behavior applied to the spanish mediterranean coast

this approach is effective in reproducing the transport of jellyfish under the influence of environmental cues currents and abiotic factors like temperature and luminosity our methods and materials section consists of four subsections study area model description comparison with alternative model structures and model validation of these subsections our model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2020 2006 2 1 study area the mediterranean coastal waters of spain including the balearic islands were selected for the biophysical modelling approach to study the mauve stinger the predominant circulation patterns in the spanish mediterranean waters are a characteristic of the western mediterranean basin a semi isolated oceanic system exchanging water with the north atlantic ocean marine water from the atlantic flows through the strait of gibraltar into the basin and becomes denser because of the intense evaporation thus producing a stronger saline water layer near the sea bed robinson et al 2001 this results in weak stratification and deep vertical mixing of up to 2000 m schroeder 2018 on the surface the circulation is characterized by surface eddies along the african coast and a steady along shore current at the european coast buffett et al 2013 additionally seasonal storms and wind bursts can induce cross shore surface currents the marine topography of the area is characterized by a shallow continental shelf spanning up to 70 km with a depth of 100 m followed by deep waters of up to 3000 m connecting the two zones are marine canyons that act as vertical conveyor belts between deep and shallow waters enhancing marine biodiversity and function for marine species including p noctiluca allen and durrieu de madron 2009 flexas et al 2008 harris and whiteway 2011 würtz 2012 offshore model boundaries and the spanish coastline including the cities of barcelona and valencia in addition to the balearic islands are shown in fig 1 2 2 model description 2 2 1 purpose and patterns the purpose of our biophysical model is to improve the accuracy of stranding events predictions of p noctiluca through hydrodynamic forcing in combination with biophysical modelling features mainly life cycle motility and behavior we evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce the pattern of p noctiluca stranding events based on the assumption that hydrodynamic forcing the moment of spawning along the marine canyon ridge diurnal migration and the effect of biological growth on horizontal and vertical distribution all have major influence on the final outcome the resulting stranding events are compared spatially and temporally to in situ stranding as described in section 2 4 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the biophysical model is composed of two entities 1 the agents representing p noctiluca and 2 the 3 dimensional grid cells representing the host environment each agent is a super individual representing an equal percentage of the p noctiluca population agents are characterized by the state variables identification number nr stage nr time stage hr location x y swimming speed m d and depth m in turn each of these state variables is dependent on constant stage properties such as vertical swimming speed buoyancy and total stage time the host grid cell state variables include location x y z current velocity m s current direction water depth m luminosity simplified to time of sunrise and sunset time and landmask a boolean which returns true for coastline and false for water information about the environmental state variables is obtained through the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems http marine copernicus eu and communicated to our model through a structured grid consisting of discrete rectilinear cells and a z vertical grid the horizontal resolution is 1 24 ca 4 km and consists of 141 unevenly spaced vertical levels this feature provides enhanced vertical resolution that can handle steep topography and resolve deep water exchanges results are available at hourly intervals in a 3 dimensional domain covering the whole vertical profile clementi et al 2018 the biophysical model runs on spatial and temporal resolution of the input hydrodynamic model whereas the agents are traced by coordinated and therefore operate on a finer resolution 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the biophysical model runs in discrete time steps and in each step all entities and their corresponding state variables are updated the processes included are spawning development stage diurnal vertical migration horizontal transport and stranding the biophysical model is started with the release of particle agents representing fertilized eggs these agents will develop over time into planulae ephyrae and mature medusae each of these stages of development has a specified buoyancy and swimming velocity during development between stages the buoyancy and swimming velocity will be interpolated based on the agent s development time the progression of development time is affected by the water temperature which in extreme cases leads to a complete halt in development swimming velocity is affected by the agent s motility which is in turn affected by the experienced water temperature diurnal vertical migration is dependent on luminosity and stage development agents dive during the day and ascend during the night at a vertical swimming speed relative to the stage an ephyra swims slower than an adult with a maximum diving depth relative to the bathymetry the vertical transport is a result of the agents vertical direction of migration buoyancy and swimming velocity on the other hand horizontal transport depends exclusively on advection from horizontal currents agents that reach the land boundary of the hydrodynamic model are considered stranded and agents that reach the water boundary leave the domain during each time step the processes are executed in the following order 1 development stage and resulting buoyancy and swimming velocity 2 motility 3 vertical direction based on day or night time 4 maximum diving depth limit as a result state variables are updated and will thereby directly affect the movement of the entity particle agents transport of agents is based on flow velocity as experienced by the hydrodynamic forcing in addition to the vertical movement based on the diurnal vertical migration process the scheduling of these processes is depicted in fig 2 2 2 4 design concepts based on the description of the odd protocol grimm et al 2020 2006 the design concepts objectives learning prediction stochasticity and collectives do not apply to this model 2 2 4 1 basic principles the model uses a data driven approach to capture the growth and transport of p noctiluca particle agents which is influenced by an interaction of environmental variables temperature luminosity sea water depth on the vertical displacement of agents and hydrodynamic variables currents on the horizontal advection induced displacement of agents this is achieved through the several submodels presented in section 2 2 7 mortality effects of predation and grazing patters are not part of this model reproduction is also disregarded since sex is not a state variable of the agents and simulation time represents only one life cycle 2 2 4 2 emergence the variation in mobility patterns development stage and stranding events emerge from the adaptive traits of the particle agents and the environmental conditions different sea water temperatures will dictate how fast the agents will develop from one stage to another and build up their vertical swimming capabilities respectively 2 2 4 3 adaptation the vertical swimming pattern of the particle agents is an adaptive trait influenced by luminosity and development stage agents take decisions to dive or surface based on the time of the day and their ability to reach the surface or the limiting dive depth is function of their development in turn development stage is an adaptive trait influenced by the sea water temperature both traits do not explicitly seek to increase individual success for example particle agents will not actively migrate towards warmer waters to achieve faster development 2 2 4 4 sensing each particle agent is capable of locally sensing the environmental state variables of the 3 dimensional grid cell in which it is located the sensed variables are sea water temperature luminosity day or night and sea water depth each agent senses these values accurately hence the model does not represent the mechanism of sensing and the uncertainty associated 2 2 4 5 interaction p noctiluca swimming pattern is sometimes directed towards maintaining large aggregations or swarms dawson and hamner 2009 but this is not reproduced in our biophysical mode there is no interaction nor communication between particle agents and they do not affect each other s decisions 2 2 4 6 observation the three dimensional location of the particle agents is recorded at every time step this is also applicable to stranding events which are temporally and spatially logged to monitor biological growth stage development complemented by the water temperature and motility are also recorded at every time step this helps understand and analyze the link between spatial distribution development stage and temperature 2 2 5 initialization agents representing fertilized eggs are released into our model during the peak spawning period which occurs during spring and peaks at temperatures of 17 c augustine et al 2014 the spatial extent of this release is limited to the presence of marine canyons which provide a reproductive advantage by transporting jellyfish from deep to surface layers through enhanced upwelling benedetti cecchi et al 2015 thus fertilized eggs are released in our model top layer at a depth of 0 m evenly distributed within the spatial extent of the marine canyon ridge fig 3 release occurs over a period of 10 days after the first reproduction peak moment in spring and follows the warming of the mediterranean waters from south to north along the marine canyon ridge as detected in the cmems hydrodynamic wave model according to the monthly mean temperature data from cmems fig 3 peak spawning occurs sometime between march and april thus a total of 10 000 particles are continuously released during the 10 day period at a rate of 1000 particle per day from may 8 2018 until may 18 2018 2 2 6 input data our model is coupled offline with the cmems hydrodynamic wave model velocity vectors and temperature data at hourly intervals to supply the information needed to resolve the physical and behavioral effects on the agents horizontal current data and seawater temperature along the vertical grid provide information for all water depth in our model the exact time of sunrise and sunset are calculated using the astronomical computational package pyephem http rhodesmill org pyephem this information is provided to every agent 2 2 7 submodels 2 2 7 1 development the biophysical model is designed to capture the development stage and corresponding behavior throughout p noctiluca s life cycle field observations laboratory studies and deb dynamic energy budget simulations display a strong influence of temperature on development time augustine et al 2014 avian 1986 rosa et al 2012 sandrini and avian 1983 this link is shown in table 1 and the growth ratio is presented graphically in fig 4 by linearly interpolating the growth rates corresponding to the different temperatures growth ratio appears to increase exponentially before reaching a threshold and then declines this would be expected following principles of enzyme kinetics and is frequently modelled using an arrhenius equation boyd et al 2018 bueno pardo et al 2019 politikos et al 2015 nevertheless in this biophysical model a data driven approach has been applied to define the influence of temperature on development the linear interpolation equation for the growth factor is 1 g g 1 g 2 g 1 t 2 t 1 t t 1 where g growth factor of agent t water temperature detected by agent c and g1 and g2 are the growth factors at the theoretical temperatures t1 and t2 shown in table 2 maximum growth corresponds to fastest development which is equivalent to a development period of 1 day from fertilized egg to planula 2 days from planula to ephyra rosa et al 2012 and 2 months from ephyra to mature medusa augustine et al 2014 growth comes to a halt as water temperatures exceed 25 c malej 1989 or drop below 4 5 c avian 1986 the term mature medusa or adult jellyfish is used to refer to an individual with reproductive capabilities and is not established on anatomy following that p noctiluca can live for up to 12 months ferraris et al 2012 hence mortality will not be included into our model to describe this development numerically each released particle is characterized by two properties termed stage and time stage at the initial instance to the stage variable is set to the default value of 1 and time stage to 25 h corresponding to a fertilized egg afterwards with every numerical loop the variable time stage is reduced by a factored time step corrected by the growth factor which adds the influence of water temperature until it reaches a value of 0 at this point the variable stage is increased by one and time stage takes a new value analogous to the development time of a planula by doing so each particle develops independently with a development speed influenced by the water temperature the same process is applied to the planula which develops into an ephyra and then in turn into an adult jellyfish the contribution of development stage in the transport of particles is interpreted through the behavioral processes and effect on vertical swimming speed explained in section 2 7 2 2 2 7 2 vertical swimming speed vertical swimming speed is derived from the development stage of the agent and then adjusted to the temperature of the environment no studies thoroughly document the swimming speed of p noctiluca so estimations from other publications and studies performed on other jellyfish species were used conley and uye 2015 garaventa et al 2010 during the first stage fertilized eggs drift passively with currents afterwards during the second stage particles gradually develop swimming capabilities eventually achieving maximum speeds of 5 m h in agreement with reported swimming speeds of aurelia aurita moon jelly planulae conley and uye 2015 as they develop into ephyrae swimming capabilities are expected to further improve reaching a maximum of 100 m h in stage 4 adult stage this speed has been already used in a previously published p noctiluca model berline et al 2013 moreover it is coherent with the average swimming speed of 180 m h recorded by attaching an accelerometer to the much larger jellyfish rhizostoma octopus fossette et al 2015 the calculation of swimming speed is as follows 2 v i v i 1 v i 1 v i 1 s d where subscript i represents the stage of the agent vi is the swimming speed of the agent v i 1 is the swimming speed at stage i 1 vi 1 is the swimming speed at stage i 1 and sd is the stage development factor of agent i expressed in percentage sd values are between 0 and 100 and represent the status of development of the agent within a stage the influence of seawater temperature on vertical swimming speed is then added through the so called motility ratio obtained through a linear fit between percent motility relative to number of pulsations and water temperature values recorded in laboratory tests avian et al 1991 thus each particle has a swimming speed equivalent to an absolute speed relative to the biological development adjusted for the effect of temperature using the motility ratio trend shown in fig 4 the following equation is used for the calculation of the motility ratio 3 m m 1 m 2 m 1 t 2 t 1 t t 1 where m motility ratio of agent t water temperature detected by the agent c and m1 and m2 are the growth factors at the theoretical temperatures t1 and t2 shown in table 2 last the temperature adjusted agent swimming speed is obtained by multiplying the motility ratio m by the swimming speed vi eq 4 4 v v i m for the calculation of the vertical swimming speeds used in the diurnal vertical migration section 2 7 3 an additional buoyancy parameter is added buoyancy is calculated according to eq 5 and is factored by the stage development factor sd 5 b i b i 1 b i 1 b i 1 s d where subscript i represents the stage of the agent bi is the buoyancy of the agent v i 1 is the buoyancy at stage i 1 vi 1 is the buoyancy at stage i 1 and sd is the stage development factor of agent i expressed in percentage 2 2 7 3 diurnal vertical migration agents in the biophysical model are programmed to perform diurnal vertical migration a feature of p noctiluca berline et al 2013 ferraris et al 2012 this is translated into the numerical model by adding a diurnal function which prompts the particles to dive during the day and surface during the night in the water column luminosity dissolved oxygen turbidity and water density contribute in defining the boundaries of the vertical movement cartes et al 2013 graham et al 2003 jansson and källander 1968 macquart moulin and castelbon 1990 however in our model this is simplified into a positive correlation between bathymetry and dive limit in deep offshore waters exceeding 1500 m particles migrate until 350 m berline et al 2013 kanda et al 1989 and when bathymetry becomes shallower the dive limit decreases accordingly dafni et al 1987 kanda et al 1989 the maximum depth trend is shown in fig 4 agents are programmed to dive 1 h after sunrise and ascend 1 h after sunset anokhina 2006 at a rate equivalent to the vertical swimming speed adjusted to buoyancy the vertical swimming speed for diving and ascending is calculated by adding the influence of buoyancy according to the following equation 6 v z b i v for ascending agents 7 v z b i v for diving agents 2 2 7 4 stranding stranding events are recorded when the agents hit the coastline once agents are stranded they cannot become active again this approach does not take into consideration the transport patterns abundant in shallow waters like breaking waves and rip currents stranding is a default function that comes with the opendrift model at each time step the location of the agents is checked by the landmask function which then identifies the agents that are stranded 2 3 comparison with alternative model structures additionally and for comparison we developed a simple drift model and fixed diurnal vertical behavior model fixed diurnal behavior model hereafter berline et al 2013 the biophysical model and simple drift model were configured to run starting from the spring reproduction period for a total of 8 months while the fixed diurnal behavior model was configured to start when strong vertical behavior became present in the biophysical model a similar initial release along submarine canyons is used for the biophysical and simple drifting models 10 000 agents particles are released linearly in time starting on the 8th of may 2018 from the southern lon 0 388 lat 38 884 up to the northern edge lon 0 3819 lat 38 907 in the fixed diurnal behavior model initial release locations of agents are obtained from the positions of active agents in the biophysical model on the 1st of june this coupling procedure intends to disregard reproduction and early life stages when diurnal vertical migration is absent in all three simulations the models run until the 15th of december 2018 all models are summarized in table 3 the fixed diurnal behavior model starts later in the year and with fewer agents as the model is initialized on current locations of the biophysical model and a portion of the agents has moved across the model water boundary 2 4 model validation to validate the simulated stranding events online published sightings data are used the spatial and temporal distribution of these sightings were collected from the jellyfish monitoring program set up by the mediterranean science commission www ciesm org marine programs jellywatch htm and the citizen science jellyfish program www jellywatch org gathered information was classified according to location and time and then compiled into the georeferenced map shown in fig 1 for the time interval of may until december 2018 there are 8 stranding events recorded over 4 different administrative units 3 results in this section results of the biophysical model showing transport growth and stranding are presented and then confronted with simple drifting and fixed diurnal behavior berline et al 2013 a résumé of the results is presented in table 4 3 1 biophysical model output of the biophysical model focuses on transport biological growth and vertical behavior first the final spatial distribution of the agents by the end of the run time is presented in fig 5 more than half 58 8 of the released agents leave the model domain while the remaining agents either end up stranded on beaches 15 77 or active 25 43 active agents are mostly concentrated in the offshore deep waters between lon 2 and lon 5 with the remaining minority sparsely divided along the coasts while stranded agents are spread with a more complex pattern on the spatial level stranding events are evenly distributed along the coastlines of the three islands from south to north ibiza mallorca and menorca but unevenly spread along the spanish mainland coast stranding events are non existent north of barcelona while one single event is recorded just south of the city further south starting from lat 41 2 the frequency of stranding events increases and becomes geographically more consistent all the way until the southern border of the model with a peak along the coastal section in the vicinity of valencia lat 39 up to lat 40 the temporal distribution of the stranding events is variable throughout the simulation period fig 6 fewest events occur during the months of may and june with a significant increase in july followed by a steady sum of events in august and september following that is a spike resulting in the peak number of events during october 432 with a relatively small number of events during november 394 a steep decrease follows in the month of december with only 36 events all agents stranded in the period spanning from april to september are exclusively stage 3 ephyrae agents stranded in october are of stage 3 or stage 4 adults with exclusive adult stranding events during november and december 3 1 1 biological growth biological growth is interpreted through the different development stages shown in fig 6 for all 10 000 agents and fig 7 for 1 randomly selected agent during the initial release all agents representing fertilized eggs stage 1 quickly develop into planulae stage 2 which in turn become ephyrae stage 3 by the end of may for the majority of their lifecycle the agents remain in stage 3 with the first stage 4 agents emerging in the beginning of october the transition from stage 3 to stage 4 continues throughout october until all agents become adults in november growth ratio check fig 7b varies between a maximum of 100 an average somewhere between 75 and 50 and a minimum that drops to 0 during small intervals 3 1 2 diurnal vertical migration diurnal vertical migration is expressed through the variation in agent depth fig 7c and is function of biological growth ratio of motility and bathymetry during the first period through stage 1 and well into stage 2 the agent remains on the surface before sharply diving to deeper than 200 m during the initial phase of stage 3 afterwards a rebound phase in which the agent starts pushing more towards the surface initiates this phase ends around the mid end of june giving way to a new vertical swimming behavior characterized by well defined patterns of surface to bottom fluctuations an additional feature of the diving pattern is the difference in dive depth which varies from shallow dives of few tens of meters to maxima of 350 m 3 2 comparison across models 3 2 1 spatial distribution of agents in this section the results of the spatial distribution of the biophysical simple drift and fixed diurnal behavior models are compared the spatial occurrence probability maps of the different models are used to evaluate the likelihood of the presence of agents in a given grid cell the maps are generated by averaging the hourly occurrence data over the whole simulation period the purpose of this comparison is to identify the geographic areas with the highest occurrence probability across the different models therefore the results presented in fig 8 will be interpreted visually the biophysical model fig 8 a exhibits a strong probability of occurrence concentrated offshore in between latitudes 39 n and 40 n characterized by a clearly defined central eddy while the simple model fig 8b demonstrates a contrasting probability map which is spread out in space and indicates tracks that are similar in form to surface currents similarly a spatial probability map is produced for the fixed diurnal behavior model in fig 8 c and d displaying the occurrence probability starting from the 1st of june once again the results show divergent probabilities between the two models while the location of the high occurrence zone in the fixed diurnal behavior model matches that of the biophysical its size is significantly smaller and it does not show the spiral shape attributed to the local hydrodynamics 3 2 2 stranding events the total number of stranding events predicted in different administrative units see fig 1 are shown in table 5 the simple drifting model reports more than a thousand stranding events during the month of may zone es514 and more than 500 stranding events during the months of june and july zone es533 in contrast the biophysical and fixed diurnal behavior model report stranding events in the order of 10 the inconsistency in the spatial and temporal distribution of the results combined with the difference in the magnitude of the reported stranding events eliminate the option of producing meaningful statistical results the performance of models in terms of predicting stranding events will be further discussed in section 4 3 3 model validation with in situ stranding observations since data obtained through citizen science approaches relies on the contributions from volunteers the available data set of in situ observations is limited in number of stranding events and characterized by discrepancies in time and space the nature of this data set makes the validation process approximative hence a general qualitative analysis of stranding data obtained from all three simulations will be used in the following comparison data shown in table 5 shows the stranding events per geographic zone and not for a particular location starting with zones where in situ observations are available from north to south in es522 the biophysical model ii is the most accurate with the highest number of stranding events during august when compared to the other two models in zone es523 the simple drifting model iii provides the best approximation for the month of july followed by better results from the biophysical model for the months of august and september while the fixed diurnal model iv outputs no stranding events last in zone es521 all three models completely fail to capture the stranding in june and only the fixed diurnal behavior model partially captures stranding in august in july the simple drifting model gives better prediction while the biophysical model is the sole model to forecast stranding in september in short the biophysical model ranks first in capturing the spatial pattern of stranding events predicting 6 out of the 8 jellyfish sightings followed by the simple drift model with 4 out of 8 and last the fixed diurnal behavior model with 3 out of 8 4 discussion the purpose of this study is to include biological traits and assess the interaction between physical dispersion and physiological behavior the role of biological processes is believed to be crucial with significant effect on transport and population dynamics treml et al 2007 implementing these behavior regimes and growth stages requires information which is species specific thus creating a range of possibilities in the amount of influence biology has on dispersion regarding p noctiluca results of the simulations performed in this study expose the sensitivity of agents to biological behavior and the impact it has on spatial dispersion this is clearly visible in the contradicting transportation patterns followed by agents released in the biophysical and simple drifting models which reflects the importance of considering vertical movement in spatially predicting individual based particle tracking models for this jellyfish species additionally when comparing the results of the biophysical model to that of the fixed behavior model the impacts of variation in swimming speed and temperature in diurnal migration on the spatial distribution are exposed by including this variation in the biophysical model the accuracy of spatially predicting stranding events improved in comparison to the fixed diurnal behavior model within this study our aim was to develop a methodology for a temporally and spatially explicit p noctiluca stranding model including key behavioral processes to their distribution capable of supporting a screening level baseline assessment nevertheless there were several simplifications and limitations in our analyses it was necessary to select a single hydrodynamic year for the baseline assessment to reduce the amount of computational and postprocessing time required running multiple year cycles of our model maintaining a single spawning moment would provide insight in the influence of the hydrodynamic year on model results this would allow for inclusion of multiple years of in field data for comparison potentially enabling a statistical model evaluation through a sensitivity analysis the derived jellyfish model characteristics could be tested for their influence on the model result there are multiple methods to calibrate and evaluate individual based models macpherson and gras 2016 van der vaart et al 2016 nevertheless the lack of coherent and in field data and the quality and amount of in situ observations do no permit for any quantitative assessment this lack of in field data table 5 prohibits the possibility to derive a statistical based goodness of fit for our model as the data that is available 8 measurements appears to have a strong spatial correlation between stranding events es521 es522 es523 and recorded stranding amounts vary widely 100 or 1000 strandings the biophysical model results predict yearlong stranding events while observations are mainly available during summer period seasonality of these observations is potentially related to the activeness of observations along the coasts during the summer months or could be otherwise attributed to the theory of pitt and lucas 2014 that p noctiluca migrate to deeper waters during winter however observations in literature suggest otherwise as stranding events of p noctiluca are reported during the winter months fleming et al 2013 mariottini et al 2008 yahia et al 2003 thus justifying the yearlong stranding events in the biophysical model additionally and when data is available the biophysical model provides predictions with reasonable accuracy in qualitative terms and performs better than both the simple drifting and fixed diurnal behavior models looking into the spatial and temporal distribution of the stranding events another fact which stands out is the high number of stranding events along the three islands in all three models this is most likely related to the fact that islands are not shielded from the winds and currents from either direction thus cross shore forcing a major factor in stranding is more frequent keesing et al 2016 ourmieres et al 2018 temporally the simplistic model yields more stranding events in the first period first 2 months of simulation this exposes the intrinsic property of simplistic models susceptibility to temporal changes in meteorological conditions for example an interval of cross shore currents can cause a high number of beach stranding events over a small period of time this disturbance to realistic dispersion is surpassed by the biophysical model through an increased retention period and a reduction in the influence of hydraulic and environmental parameters another benefit of biophysical modelling is the information it delivers regarding growth and development stage this development of egg towards adult jellyfish seems to be accurate as agents reach the adult stage starting from october and peaking in number during november corresponding to the time window of the autumn reproduction period milisenda et al 2016 it requires notion that in this study the employed models only captured the spring reproduction period of one year 2018 this year has been selected for the availability of data in valencia since the port of valencia is a partner in this project whereas running these models over longer periods with multiple reproduction cycles is likely to give better results for stranding in the early spring and summer season moreover the spawning period used in our model corresponds to the peak release of eggs achieved at an optimum temperature the missing aspect of this approach is the non peak spawning events that occur throughout time at different temperatures and are not included in this work additionally the findings of this work give a strong indication about the population connectivity in the western mediterranean basin signalled by the large proportion of agents more than 50 that exit the model domain this implies that the local populations of p noctiluca in the spanish western mediterranean waters subsidize other sub populations in adjacent waters in turn adult jellyfish are also sourced adjoining waters into the spanish waters thus creating an interexchange of individuals in the western mediterranean as a whole aglieri et al 2014 nevertheless this does not abolish the connectivity driven through self recruitment attributed to the active agents present at the end of the simulation combined both self recruited and subsidized individuals are an indication of the reproductive connectivity that links one season to the other this link could be only revealed through biophysical modelling as the number of active particles by the end of the simulation is the most sensitive variable to agent behavior last population connectivity is not the main purpose of the study and a larger big scale model would be required to adequately represent the exchange between population sources this would be achievable through an additional identity letter state variable for the agents which would differentiate between jellyfish of different subpopulations and could be used to study genetic diversity e g individual based genetic model baggio et al 2018 it is important to note that the diurnal vertical migration is simplified and this could have effects on both spatial distribution and stranding events in the biophysical model a maximum diving depth adjusted to allow for a well defined vertical pattern at different temperatures and stages was used this approach does take into consideration deviations in the diving patterns due to seasonality or other hydrodynamic phenomena p noctiluca samples have been collected in the summer period at depths of up to 1200 and 1400 m cartes et al 2013 a possible explanation is the hypothesis that jellyfish purposely dive to deeper water in order to avoid very warm unpleasant surface temperatures pitt and lucas 2014 future hydrodynamic models that capture deep sea thermal fronts could provide an opportunity to further study dive depth as a function of temperature additional processes not included in this biophysical model and necessary to mention in the discussion are predation and feeding these effects mainly influence survival and to a lesser extent development stage and vertical migration augustine et al 2014 feeding and predation have been already quantified and included in jellyfish models kristiansen et al 2007 legovic 1987 neumann et al 2016 qiu et al 2010 but have been left out of this biophysical model to limit probabilistic factors and complexity together with the biological and behavioral processes the quality and resolution of the hydrodynamic model has a large influence on the dispersion patterns kvile et al 2018 resolving shallow water currents and coastal interactions is a delicate process that requires models of higher resolution than that used in this study and preferably curvilinear or unstructured grids that can accurately trail the coastline a key constituent in the beaching process is wave action causing stranding events especially in shallow waters by increasing the spatial resolution and integrating wave action the biophysical model could be further improved for modelling the physical aspect of p noctiluca strandings 5 conclusion by including life cycle development and behavior in jellyfish modelling our study has shown better prediction of p noctiluca stranding events compared to a simple drift and fixed diurnal behavior model this biophysical model approach is likely to be of use for occurrence prediction of other jellyfish species especially those with strong vertical behavior future research that tackles the knowledge gaps we encountered should address 1 in situ field measurements which provide more accurate p noctiluca stranding events records 2 monitoring campaigns to study seasonality in p noctiluca dive depth and spatial distribution and 3 laboratory research to validate the assumptions on buoyancy swimming velocities motility and time requirements for the development stages this biophysical model could be further developed by including multiple spawning periods switching from seasonal simulations to multiannual lifecycle runs where populations are linked through reproduction through the incorporation of jellyfish sightings to test and adjust model predictions a comprehensive operational model could be setup this model would then be predicting the full lifecycle of jellyfish giving insight on the likeliness of jellyfish spatial and temporal distributions and predicting jellyfish stranding locations thereby contributing to one of the goals of the odyssea project that has funded this study the societal benefits of such a model would be numerous from early warnings to beachgoers industry intakes and fisheries to potential to mitigate upcoming jellyfish blooms and to determine the current
