16545,bioretention system with modified media has been increasingly used to control dissolved nutrients in stormwater runoff however complicated removal processes and improper design have made most of them hardly achieve comprehensive dissolved nutrient removal and even show by product generation problem especially during extreme stormwater events here a modified biochar pyrite fes2 bi layer bioretention system was developed and tested under various stormwater conditions with conventional sand based and woodchip based bioretention systems as controls the modified system showed high stability and efficiency for dissolved nutrient treatment the removal of dissolved organic nitrogen ammonium total dissolved nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorus were 86 3 93 0 95 3 98 1 41 4 76 5 and 69 7 88 2 respectively stormwater conditions only influence nitrate removal which decreased with the increase of total received volume and increased with the extension of antecedent drying duration net sulfate and total iron generation were very low less than 8 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively several microbiology spectroscopy and media related tests further demonstrated that the vadose zone and submerged zone showed synergy effects during operation biochar addition facilitated ammonium adsorption nitrification and in situ denitrification in the vadose zone it also intercepted dissolved oxygen which alleviated aerobic pyrite oxidation and created an anoxic condition for the submerged zone meanwhile the pyrite modified submerged zone achieved stable mixotrophic denitrification the generated iron intermediate products further controlled phosphorus from both influent and vadose zone leaching into stable forms mixotrophic denitrification and potential sulfate reduction processes also reduce sulfate generation overall the biochar pyrite bi layer bioretention is a highly promising technology for stormwater runoff treatment with effective dissolved nutrient removal and minimal by product generation in various stormwater conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mixotrophic denitrification low impact development non point source pollution nitrogen removal phosphorus removal 1 introduction urbanisation and climate change have increased excessive stormwater runoff in impervious urban areas in recent years grimm et al 2008 vast stormwater runoff volume generates a huge amount of nutrient load greatly accelerates the conveyance of nutrients to water bodies and leads to severe non point source pollution eckart et al 2017 kong et al 2021 passive treatment green infrastructures such as bioretention systems have been recently employed in urban stormwater management as cost effective solutions for non point source pollution control eckart et al 2017 conventional bioretention systems are generally planted with sand or soil showing satisfactory removal efficiencies in particulate pollutants by several biogeochemical and physical processes tirpak et al 2021 however for dissolved nutrients the removal performance was unstable for instance a wide range of tn removal between 630 and 46 have been reported in conventional bioretention systems bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2008 dissolved nutrients are often bioavailable form which can lead to quick water quality degradation lusk and toor 2016 to enhance the dissolved nutrients removal capacity many amended media such as woodchips and fly ash have been tested lopez ponnada et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 however most of the conventional amendments can not achieve comprehensive dissolved nutrient removal tirpak et al 2021 if not well designed some of them even face secondary by product generation problems for example carbon source amendments can increase the heterotrophic denitrification ability whereas excessive carbon sources can result in ammonium phosphorus and organic matter om leaching and low carbon source supply may lead to incomplete denitrification both lead to secondary pollution lopez ponnada et al 2017 research is necessary that examines the feasibility of other suitable amendments that improve the dissolved nutrient removal with low by product generation of bioretention systems as passive treatment systems bioretention inevitably face frequently changing wet and dry conditions and hydraulic loading these conditions may influence the interaction between pollutants media and microbes diminishing the pollutant removal performance and enlarging the by product generation problem for instance a long antecedent drying duration likely leads to om and phosphorus leaching in the woodchip based bioretention system lynn et al 2015 lopez ponnada et al 2017 heavy rainfall may also decrease the contact time between pollutants media and microbes then influence pollutant treatment berger et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 however most studies only examined the performance of the bioretention systems under steady state conditions to our knowledge no study evaluated and achieved the comprehensive dissolved nutrient treatment and minimal by product generation under various stormwater conditions recent studies demonstrated that pyrite can be used as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification and generate by products such as fe3 and fe oh 3 for phosphate removal without organic secondary pollution risk torrento et al 2010 ge et al 2019 xu et al 2021 those traits make pyrite a promising low cost solution to enhance dissolved nutrient treatment and by product control in bioretention systems tirpak et al 2021 our preliminary study recently incorporated pyrite into the submerged zone of a bioretention system although it achieved simultaneous nitrate and phosphate control for more than one year high sulfate and iron were also generated even under steady state stormwater conditions which greatly limited its practical use chen et al 2020 several recent studies illustrated that biochar addition can decrease dissolved oxygen do increase water holding capacity and pollutant retention ashoori et al 2019 berger et al 2019 tian et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 which directly fit the need of our preliminary study we anticipated that incorporating biochar into the vadose zone of pyrite based bioretention systems can further strengthen the dissolved nutrient removal and protect pyrite against excessive oxidation however biochar and pyrite addition may alter physical chemical and biological processes in bioretention systems to date no study employed them together for dissolved nutrient treatment and their interaction after media amendment is still unclear the cooperation of pyrite and biochar to increase the stability of the bioretention systems under various stormwater conditions is also unknown to develop a low cost bioretention system for comprehensive dissolved nutrient removal and by product control the biochar pyrite bi layer bioretention system was established and compared with conventional sand based and woodchip based bioretention systems the specific aims of this study are to i understand the influence of rainfall intensity antecedent drying duration and received runoff volume on the bioretention systems ii explore the dissolved nutrient treatment and by product generation mechanism in this new system and iii study potential synergy effects between the biochar modified vadose zone and pyrite modified submerged zone the results of this study provided a new idea strengthening both vadose zone and submerged zone for stormwater runoff treatment of bioretention system which will be helpful for cost effective non point source pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention media pyrite 1 2 mm was obtained from shangbao hunan china it was grounded and characterised by x ray diffraction xrd x pert powder panalytical netherland to confirm purity according to the manufacturer s instruction the xrd spectrum is shown in supplementary material supplementary fig s1 pine woodchip sandy loam and oyster shells were purchased from a local horticultural company pine woodchips were sieved to remove particulates larger than 5 mm well graded sands with a particle size range from 0 075 mm to 4 75 mm were purchased from huamo water treatment equipment co ltd chongqing china commercially available biochar produced by pyrolysis of pine wood at 500 c was purchased from toroyal group shandong china peat moss was obtained from nord agri sia riga latvia before bioretention cells establishment all media were first analysed for basic properties e g particulate size distribution bulk density and porosity then several groups of well grading mixed media were prepared and tested for hydraulic conductivity according to the guideline hatt et al 2009 the mixed media with suitable hydraulic conductivity 100 600 mm h were selected as filling media table 1 2 2 bioretention system set up duplicate cells were established for three types of bioretention systems namely biochar pyrite pb biochar woodchip wb and conventional sand sb cells were made of acrylic 30 cm inner diameter 120 cm height a perforated pipe was placed at the bottom of each cell and covered by a 5 cm cobblestone 4 8 mm drainage layer over the drainage layer is a 5 cm transition layer made of well graded sand to prevents filter media from washing into the drainage layer hatt et al 2009 a submerged zone which aims to create a permanently wet zone for enhanced denitrification was created by raising the outlet 45 cm above the bottom drainage layer for each cell 1500 ml autotrophic sludge and 1500 ml heterotrophic sludge was mixed with submerged zone media during media blending the detailed methods for sludge preparation are summarised in text s1 above the submerged zone is a 45 cm vadose zone also known as the upper layer at the top of each cell a 5 cm cobblestone layer was set for protection all the media were compacted at 4 cm incremental heights during media filling to get an identical bulk density and hydraulic conductivity with basic properties tests the detailed properties of the bioretention cells are listed in table 1 seven media sample ports and one water sample port were established at the cell side for media and pore water sampling the schematic diagram of the bioretention cells and instruments is shown in fig 1 plants are beneficial for dissolved nutrient removal and landscaping bratieres et al 2008 however this study only examined pollutant removal by the proposed media therefore no plants were included in the bioretention systems of this study 2 3 stormwater preparation synthetic stormwater runoff was prepared by using kno3 nh4cl kh2po4 glycine c2h5no2 and ch3coona 3h2o to get a target pollutant concentration of 3 mg l no 3 n 2 mg l nh 4 n 0 5 mg l po 4 3 p 3 mg l dissolved organic nitrogen don and 18 2 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod pollutant concentration in runoff may be influenced by several factors such as underlying surface type air quality etc to test the performance of the bioretention systems for unfavourable stormwater conditions a relatively high level of urban runoff dissolved nutrient concentration suggested in the literature was chosen kayhanian et al 2012 kong et al 2021 although many field monitoring studies found high cod concentration 100 1000 mg l in the urban stormwater runoff the biodegradable fraction was very low lusk and toor 2016 only 18 2 mg l cod was used aims to simulate the biodegradable organic fraction in stormwater runoff kayhanian et al 2012 this concentration was also used to avoid the influence of high influent biodegradable om on minimizing media based denitrification before each experiment tap water was first stored in a 200 l pe barrel for 24 h the barrel was equipped with a mixing unit that operated for about one hour to minimize residual chlorine by aeration the pretreatment aims to avoid the potential adverse effect of residual chlorine for microbes and simulate the high do concentration in the real runoff then stock synthetic stormwater was injected into the barrel and mixed for another 20 min the synthetic stormwater was introduced from the storage barrel to the top of bioretention cells using peristaltic pumps and distributed by fifteen sprinkler heads uniformly onto the column surface peristaltic pumps were recalibrated when the flow rate was changed between different stormwater conditions the received runoff volume l was calculated according to the method reported in a previous study hatt et al 2008 1 v f φ h where f m2 is the catchment area which was estimated to be 20 times of bioretention surface area 1 413 m2 φ is the runoff coefficient which is the ratio of runoff volume to rainfall volume and it was assumed to be 0 7 urban built up area h mm is the rainfall depth which was 25 mm or 50 mm full calculation details are given in text s2 2 4 experimental procedures bioretention cells were first conditioned by synthetic stormwater for one year to stabilize the microbes and media following conditioning stormwater was applied to the cells with different patterns to determine the effect of various stormwater conditions on the dissolved nutrient removal and by product generation to test the influence of received runoff volume on bioretention systems stormwater was applied at 175 mm h for 4 h 50 mm rainfall depth with 6 d antecedent drying duration the duration between two rainfall events for example 1 d means the rainfall event is applied after 24 h of the last simulated rainfall event for rainfall intensity stormwater was introduced at a constant rainfall depth 25 mm but with varied rainfall duration i e 8 4 2 and 1 h this scheme resulted in a hydraulic loading rate ranging between 43 75 and 350 mm h heavy rainfall for antecedent drying duration a total of 25 mm stormwater was applied at 175 mm h for 2 h under four different antecedent drying duration 1 3 6 and 10 d each condition was conducted twice except for antecedent drying duration tests which were conducted three times the calculations of hydraulic loading rate are described in text s2 for all experiments except the 4 h duration experiment a total of six 100 ml samples were collected from each cell when the outflow volume was 3 5 7 10 5 14 17 5 and 21 l during 4 h duration experiment six additional samples were collected after 21 l with a 3 5 l interval since the nitrate concentration drastically fluctuated than other pollutants more intensive sampling 27 samples were applied during the 4 h duration experiment during 10 d intervals pore water was collected from port a to explore the pollutant variation in the submerged zone fig 1 a 50 ml sample was collected for each cell at 0 1 3 7 24 48 240 h 24 h interval after the first 24 h to understand the mechanism of the bioretention system for dissolved nutrient removal and by product control raw media and sample media were collected from each cell for high throughput sequencing sem eds analysis xps analysis and batch experiments after reactor operation batch adsorption experiments were conducted according to tian et al 2016 media potential nitrification rate pna test was conducted according to fan et al 2011 tp bray p 1 extractable phosphorus and acid extractable phosphorus were extracted and tested using the method reported in aspila et al 1976 and fowdar et al 2017 the detailed procedures for media sampling high throughput sequencing and batch experiments are shown in text s3 7 2 5 water sample characterisation the do concentration and oxidant reduction potential orp value were tested for each sample immediately after sampling do and orp were measured using a multifunctional detector wtw 3620 german and orp metre hq30d hach usa respectively water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter first and analysed within 24 h no 3 n n o 2 n and so 4 2 were measured by ion chromatography dionex 600 usa nh 4 n total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp cod uv254 absorbence and fetotal were measured according to standard methods by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa don was calculated by subtracting n h 4 n n o 3 n and n o 2 n from tdn n o x n was calculated as the sum of n o 3 n and n o 2 n 2 6 data analysis event mean concentration was calculated and used to determine the pollutant removal efficiency statistical analysis was performed by imb spss statistics 25 anova was analysed the differences between different variables were considered significant at a p value less than 0 05 pearson correlation was used to determine linear correlations between two variables nitrate removal contribution by the vadose zone was calculated and the detailed calculation procedure is described in text s8 for the microbial analysis shannon and chao 1 indices were calculated as representatives of alpha diversity beta diversity was analysed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis by r programming using bray curtis distance the obtained sequencing data were deposited in the sra database bioproject number prjna762432 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of stormwater conditions on dissolved nutrient treatment and by product generation 3 1 1 effect of received runoff volume the pollutant concentration in the effluent of bioretention systems during the 4 h rainfall duration experiment is shown in fig 2 the pore volume of the submerged zone pv was used to count outflow volume with the increase of received volume pollutant breakthrough was found in sb the outflow concentration of don n h 4 n n o x n and tdp in sb reached 2 16 0 37 1 33 0 04 6 95 0 67 and 0 32 0 06 mg l respectively in comparison the highest concentration for don n h 4 n and tdp in the outflow of pb was only 0 73 0 14 0 04 0 00 0 12 0 02 mg l respectively only n o x n showed a breakthrough at the second pv 7 81 0 12 mg l although wb also increased the nitrogen removal compared to sb the n h 4 n and don concentration in the effluent was slightly higher than pb and n o x n breakthrough still existed 7 26 0 10 mg l moreover wb also showed high initial tdp and cod leaching 0 41 0 03 for tdp and 22 79 2 41 mg l for cod received runoff volume is critical for the dissolved nutrient treatment in the bioretention systems especially for nitrogen when the volume is less the effluent mainly includes stagnant pore water in the anoxic submerged zone if there exist electron donors such as woodchip or pyrite nitrate can be denitrified during prolonged antecedent drying duration as shown in supplementary fig s2 the orp and do value in wb and pb was low indicating that favourable conditions were provided for denitrification however if the vadose zone can not adsorb don and ammonium effectively e g sb or the submerged zone generates those two pollutants in situ e g wb the anoxic and low orp conditions can hinder nitrification as well leading to ammonium accumulation if further increase the received runoff volume pore water will be evacuated by infiltrated stormwater the infiltrated stormwater usually has a relatively short hydraulic retention time hrt and can not be effectively treated by conventional bioretention systems biochar generally has a much higher adsorption and cation exchange capacity than sand tian et al 2016 greatly enhancing the resistance of the bioretention systems for ammonium and don supplementary table s1 however it can not resist nitrate the nitrate transformed from don and ammonium in the vadose zone can not be completely denitrified in situ in the drying period or be removed by media adsorption during stormwater events this part of nitrate will be leached with the received runoff volume increase similar results were also reported in several bioretention related studies hatt et al 2008 li and davis 2014 as for phosphorus pyrite and oyster addition potentially enhanced phosphorus adsorption and precipitation ability park and polprasert 2008 ge et al 2019 making the bioretention system achieve stable and effective phosphorus removal in comparison woodchip can not facilitate adsorption and precipitation processes and it even acts as a phosphorus source which generates phosphorus in situ and leads to initial leaching fig 2e 3 1 2 effect of rainfall intensity the effect of rainfall intensity is shown in fig 3 dissolved nutrient removal in pb remained stable and effective under all conditions the don n h 4 n n o x n tdn and tdp removal in pb were 86 3 4 1 92 7 1 2 95 3 1 4 98 0 0 2 8 6 6 5 17 7 7 0 60 7 3 8 64 7 2 0 and 69 7 3 7 84 6 2 0 although wb showed higher n o x n removal 32 7 3 7 42 0 4 3 than pb its don and n h 4 n removal was slightly lower and the tdp removal was only 23 9 6 0 45 1 5 9 in comparison the dissolved nutrient removal performance in sb was poor with the increase of rainfall intensity the n h 4 n removal in sb increased but n o x n removal decreased dramatically cod removal did not show obvious variation between different conditions sb and wb remained lower cod removal than pb rainfall intensity can influence the hydraulic loading rate of the bioretention systems which may influence ammonium and phosphate adsorption in the sand based bioretention system high rainfall intensity can induce short hrt and high turbulence which may limit pollutant diffusion into the pores and weaken interaction and intraparticle mass transfer between the pollutants and media foo and hameed 2012 however after incorporating high pollutant adsorption media such as biochar and pyrite this influence can be weakened however media amendment can not weaken the influence of intense rainfall on microbial related nutrient treatment processes especially for denitrification intense rainfall will lead to insufficient hrt and dissolved organic carbon wash out from pore water then limit denitrification performance lopez ponnada et al 2017 berger et al 2019 how to achieve effective denitrification in short hrt and the unsteady state condition in the bioretention systems is still a challenge although biochar did not facilitate denitrification during intense stormwater events either it can increase media water content and prolong oxygen diffusion paths tian et al 2019 which will maintain a favourable anoxic condition in the submerged zone for further denitrification during the drying period supplementary fig s3 3 1 3 effect of antecedent drying duration the effect of antecedent drying duration on pollutant removal is shown in fig 4 don n h 4 n and tdp removal in pb remained stable and effective and they were 86 4 4 4 93 0 3 9 97 9 0 5 98 1 0 1 and 79 9 3 1 88 2 1 4 respectively with the increase of antecedent drying duration the n o x n removal increased significantly p 0 05 from 39 8 12 1 to 43 7 6 5 in comparison with the increase of antecedent drying duration n h 4 n tdp and cod removal all decreased dramatically in wb only the n o x n removal increased in 10 d condition no significant difference was found for no x n removal between pb and wb approximately 42 p 0 05 pb surpassed wb for tdn removal in 6 d 71 6 3 0 and 10 d 76 5 2 2 sb showed a similar pattern with pb despite lower overall performance antecedent drying duration generally lasts longer than rainfall events so higher denitrification performance can be expected during that period if an anoxic environment and electron donor were provided the lower orp value under longer antecedent drying duration also indicates that a favourable denitrification environment was provided for all three groups supplementary fig s4 however other by product generation processes may also be exacerbated especially for wb whose ammonium phosphorus and om in the effluent increased simultaneously with antecedent drying duration prolonging p 0 01 r2 0 8 although pb achieved higher nitrate removal and minimal by product generation during longer antecedent drying duration the low electron donor supply rate of pyrite made the denitrification performance of pb under 1 d relatively low increasing pyrite content may be a feasible solution our unpublished work incorporating 20 pyrite achieved a higher denitrification rate than pb besides in practical application the shorter antecedent drying duration may influence the pollutant accumulation processes in the underlying surface and lead to lower stormwater runoff pollutant concentration kim et al 2004 which can further alleviate the denitrification pressure of pb meanwhile antecedent drying duration can also indirectly influence pollutant adsorption processes for the vadose zone the adsorbed ammonium and don will be transformed during the drying period leaving adsorptive sites for the next event similarly more phosphorus removed by repaid reversible adsorption during stormwater events can also be transformed into slower irreversible precipitation form in drying period if high iron aluminium content media was used then free the repaid reversible adsorption sites li and davis 2016 biochar and pyrite addition can enhance those two processes which will be discussed later 3 1 4 so 4 2 and fetotal generation in pb the results of so 4 2 and fetotal generation in pb under various stormwater conditions are shown in supplementary fig s5 the so 4 2 and fetotal net generation were less than 8 and 0 15 mg l respectively much lower than our previous study which received only 40 runoff volume of the current study but generated very high so 4 2 up to 174 94 mg l and fetotal up to 1 94 mg l chen et al 2020 the net so 4 2 generation was below the theoretical value in all experiments eq 2 jorgensen et al 2009 the potentially existing heterotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction may explain this phenomenon besides sulfate is only expected to be generated in the stagnant water of the submerged zone mainly the first pv the mixing of different parts of effluent will further decrease the sulfate concentration supplementary fig s5b 2 6 no 3 2 fe s 2 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 4 so 4 2 2 fe oh 3 2 h in comparison the reason for the decrease of fetotal is more complicated the lower pyrite packing ratio in the current study may be one important reason other reasons such as pyrite oxidation control intermediate products generation etc may also exist which will be discussed later overall pb showed effective dissolved nutrient removal performance and minimal by product generation under various stormwater conditions with higher stability than sb and wb it is expected that more intense rainfall and longer antecedent drying duration will be more frequent in the future prein et al 2017 the higher efficiency and stability make pb suit it well 3 2 the dissolved nutrient removal mechanism 3 2 1 porewater chemistry in the submerged zone the results of pollutant concentration variation in pore water of the submerged zone are shown in fig 5 in pb all pollutants except n o x n kept very low during 10 d interval which indicates those pollutants were effectively removed during stormwater events the no x n in pb decreased constantly from 4 34 0 36 mg l in 0 h to 0 20 0 07 mg l in 240 h with so 4 2 net generation in pb increased steadily to 13 86 2 81 mg l at 96 h this variation indicates that pyrite based autotrophic denitrification occurred after 96 h the net generation of so 4 2 decreased to about 6 mg l potentially caused by the sulfate sulfur reduction process supplementary fig s6 in comparison wb showed a higher denitrification rate than pb however the don n h 4 n tdp and om also generated in situ which proved that woodchip potentially became a pollutant source in prolonged antecedent drying duration as for sb although it also achieved effective denitrification in the submerged zone the rate was the lowest the high don and n h 4 n in 0 h further indicate that the vadose zone of sb can not effectively prevent those two pollutants from entering the submerged zone besides they also showed a decreasing trend during 240 h which further indicate that do potentially enter the submerged zone of sb and facilitate the nitrification process 3 2 2 nitrogen transformation and removal in the vadose zone as for the vadose zone the results of the pna experiment is shown in supplementary fig s7a the pna in the upper biochar layer shows about 3 5 times higher pna than sand samples biochar addition greatly enhanced ammonium and don adsorption and media water content supplementary fig s7b which potentially provided a favourable environment for the microbes related to ammonification and nitrification then accelerated those two processes besides conventional bioretention systems are often over dependent on the submerged zone for enhanced denitrification while the vadose zone was neglected waller et al 2018 demonstrated that denitrification hot zone may exist in the vadose zone during the inundation period after stormwater events tian et al 2019 also achieved effective nitrate removal in the vadose zone using biochar mixed with om during infiltration predictably once the don and ammonium were quickly transformed they may also be denitrified in situ if a suitable environment was provided nitrate accumulation high water content and om supplement etc according to the nitrate removal contribution calculation biochar addition greatly enhanced nitrogen removal in the vadose zone and more importantly more than 50 nitrate from influent and ammonium don transformed in pb and wb were removed by the vadose zone especially the first three days supplementary fig s8 those results confirmed the existence of denitrification hot zone and biochar addition greatly enhanced the efficiency of the hot zone 3 2 3 microbial community analysis to further prove the microbial related processes discussed above the microbial community was analysed at the phylum level fig 6 a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples except pb3 sb3 and sb4 as to the genus level fig 6b several ammonium oxidation bacteria and nitrite oxidising bacteria such as nitrospira and different genera belong to the family nitrosomonadaceae supplementary table s2 xia et al 2005 and several genera capable of autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrification such as thauera azoarcus pseudomonas and denitratisoma qiu et al 2020 xu et al 2021 were found in the vadose zone biochar addition greatly enhanced their relative abundance as for the submerged zone thiobacillus which was deemed as the key genus in the pyrite based autotrophic denitrification process torrento et al 2010 ge et al 2019 showed a high relative abundance in pb3 and pb4 other heterotrophic denitrifiers such as denitratisoma azoarcus and bacillus were also found in pb3 and pb4 in contrast a high proportion of genera be capable of heterotrophic denitrification or om decomposition such as denitratisoma bacillus and cellulomonas were found in the wb3 and wb4 besides various sulfate sulfur reducing bacteria were also found in the submerged zone of pb supplementary table s2 such as desulfosporosinus and geobacter qiu et al 2020 as for alpha diversity supplementary table s3 the biochar addition groups showed a higher shannon and chao1 index than sand counterparts which means biochar addition increased both the richness and diversity of the microbial community as for the submerged zone woodchip addition increased both the shannon and chao1 index than sb while pyrite addition did not show an obvious higher value for both indexes as for beta diversity three big groups contained samples from the vadose zone group 1 the submerged zone of pb and sb group 2 and the submerged zone of wb group 3 was divided by nmds analysis fig 6c hierarchical clustering analysis further showed the biochar modified vadose zone the sb s vadose zone the submerged zone of sb and pb in group 1 and group 2 can still be subdivided supplementary fig s9 those results indicate that both layer and media types greatly shaped the microbial community structures compared to woodchip biochar and pyrite addition only slightly shape the microbial community however their addition increased the key functional genera which greatly facilitate several important pollutant transformation and removal processes e g nitrification denitrification sulfate reduction etc 3 2 4 media phosphorus content to explain the phosphorus removal mechanism phosphorus content tests were conducted and the results are shown in fig 7 a compared with the raw media tp decreased in the biochar layer and increased in the pyrite layer which indicates that the biochar layer was a phosphorus source and the pyrite layer removed the phosphorus from both influent and biochar layer leaching besides compared to raw media the content of less available inorganic phosphorus increased drastically in the sample media of pyrite layer which demonstrates that most of the phosphorus was strongly bound into the pyrite layer by precipitation the available phosphorus also slightly increase in the pyrite layer which indicates that adsorption also played an important role in phosphorus removal both adsorption and precipitation exist simultaneously making pb show stable phosphorus removal during stormwater events and potentially avoid secondary phosphorus leaching during the drying period 3 2 5 pyrite oxidation analysis to further understand the pyrite oxidation mechanism and its potential influence on phosphorus removal and fetotal reduction sem eds and xps analyses were conducted it could be found in sem images that after more than one year of operation the crystal structure on the pyrite surface disappeared and the surface of the used pyrite became rough supplementary fig s10 to explore whether the surface composition of pyrite changed xps analysis was conducted as shown in the full spectrum fig 7b the intensity of the s peak in used pyrite decreased dramatically and the shape of the fe peak changed the curve fitting of fe2p further shows that the peak of iron sulfide in used pyrite decreased drastically and the proportion of peaks for ferrous and ferric iron increased ejtemaei and nguyen 2017 fig 7c and 7d those xps results demonstrate that the used pyrite was oxidized however the eds results showed that the elemental composition and distribution of the used pyrite and the original pyrite did not vary obviously supplementary table s4 and supplementary fig s11 since the excited x ray of eds may penetrate through the surface of pyrite the results of it may include a portion underneath the surface therefore the undetected difference by eds analysis may indicate that the generated oxidized layer was thin further comparing the used pyrite with the oxidized pyrite unpublished work where pyrite was exposed in the vadose zone the surface of the oxidized pyrite showed crust with several cracks s and fe mainly existed in the cracks while the crust area was rich in fe and o supplementary table s4 and supplementary fig s11 the difference in surface morphology elemental composition and elemental distribution demonstrates that the oxidation degree in the used pyrite was milder previous studies have demonstrated that amorphous ferric hydr oxides may be generated in a suitable environment such as low free fe2 concentration during pyrite oxidation senko et al 2005 the o1s of used pyrite also peaked at 531 3 ev where was thought to be hydroxyl together with the sem eds and xps results we speculated that amorphous ferric hydroxides were possibly generated on the pyrite surface this substance was generally thought to have a high surface area and positive charge and is conducive for phosphate adsorption yang et al 2017 3 3 synergy effect between the vadose zone and submerged zone in pb based on all results the schematic diagram of pb was concluded in fig 8 biochar modified vadose zone and pyrite modified submerged zone showed synergy effect for the effective pollutant treatment and by product control during stormwater events biochar effectively adsorbs don and ammonium in the vadose zone and prevents them from flowing into the submerged zone and influences subsequent nitrification the high water content caused by biochar also prolongs the oxygen diffusion paths and entraps do by om decomposing which maintains a stable anoxic environment for the submerged zone supplementary fig s2c those decomposed om will be adsorbed by biochar or be used by microbes a slight amount of om will be leached into the submerged zone and be used for mixotrophic denitrification meanwhile phosphate in both influent and biochar layer leaching will be quickly absorbed by amorphous ferric hydroxides on the pyrite surface eq 3 hu et al 2020 3 f e n oh m ppo 4 3 f e n oh m p o 4 p in the drying period adsorbed ammonium and don can be transformed into nitrate quickly then be denitrified by heterotrophic denitrifiers in situ in the first several days with om supply the vadose zone can also help for the persistence of anoxic conditions in the submerged zone which not only alleviates pyrite aerobic oxidation but also provides a suitable environment for denitrification eq 2 4 5 chandra and gerson 2010 lower fe2 generated by pyrite aerobic oxidation can also avoid ferric hydroxides crystallization senko et al 2005 which not only promotes the lifespan of pyrite but also decreases the amount of soluble phosphorus generated by media crystallization li and davis 2016 4 fe s 2 h 2 o 3 5 o 2 2 so 4 2 f e 2 2 h 5 f e 2 0 25 o 2 h f e 3 0 25 h 2 o meanwhile pyrite can facilitate stable auto mixotrophic denitrification during the drying period and generate fe3 for more stable phosphate precipitation eq 2 and eq 6 yang et al 2017 the excessive fe3 will be transformed into amorphous ferric hydroxides in low free fe2 condition hu et al 2020 which further strengthens the phosphate adsorption ability lower fe3 caused by eq 2 4 5 will further decrease fe3 oxidation eq 7 chandra and gerson 2010 hu et al 2020 which was thought to be more potent and primary for pyrite oxidation and by product generation as for sulfate with antecedent drying duration prolonging the sulfate reduction microbes can use the dead microbes and the slight amount of leached om for sulfate reduction those potential intermediates such as sulfur or h2s may be used for autotrophic denitrification or reacts with ferric hydroxides and generate other substances such as fe2s3 avoiding potential h2s emission eq 8 davydov et al 1998 finally unlike woodchip pyrite itself is not a source of om ammonium don and phosphorus which indirectly avoids the potential leaching of them 6 f e 3 po 4 3 fep o 4 7 fe s 2 14 f e 3 8 h 2 o 15 f e 2 2 so 4 2 16 h 8 2 fe oh 3 3 h 2 s f e 2 s 3 6 h 2 o oyster shells were also demonstrated to have a high surface area and can be used as organic sources tong et al 2017 it may also facilitate denitrification and potentially sulfate reduction in the submerged zone of pb besides park and polprasert 2008 also indicate that oyster shells can increase phosphorus adsorption however compared to their study where a 30 cm oyster shells layer was constructed the proportion of oyster shells in pb was low table 1 and most of the phosphorus removed in pb was precipitated fig 7a therefore we estimate that the oyster shells may contribute to phosphorous adsorption but most of the phosphorus was still removed by pyrite and its intermediate product pyrite oxidation can also induce h generation eq 2 and eq 4 however the low nitrate concentration in stormwater runoff and do entrapment by biochar layer will limit those two processes oyster shells can also serve as alkaline sources and prevent drastic ph decrease tong et al 2017 if particulate nutrients were considered they will be intercepted by the top layer and be mineralized to phosphate and ammonium under aerobic conditions li and davis 2014 then further go through the treatment process discussed above suitable plants such as carex is also beneficial for dissolved inorganic nutrient treatment bratieres et al 2008 they may solve the nitrate breakthrough problem faced by the current study since most nitrate in breakthrough is transformed from ammonium and don in the upper layer where near plant roots most the detailed interaction between plants microbes and media is also studied by our group now 3 4 implication for stormwater bioretention our study demonstrated the importance of media selection and the whole profile usage for effective dissolved nutrient treatment and by product control in the bioretention systems the vadose zone needs to be a buffer zone for the submerged zone decreasing the hydraulic impact such as dynamic rainfall intensity and received runoff volume and intercepting adsorbing pollutants that are difficult to be completely removed in the anoxic environment e g don and ammonium it is better if it can also transform those pollutants into end product e g nitrate and remove them in situ permanently submerged zone in return as a polish zone should be able to cope with the potential leaching and the pollutants that are difficult to be treated by the vadose zone e g nitrate and phosphate besides the media used in the submerged zone need to have less om and nutrient leaching potential during extended antecedent drying duration pb generally fits this aim we also expect that this modified system can achieve more functions after optimization for example enhanced nitrate and phosphate removal can be achieved after optimizing the packing scheme of pyrite using modified biochar higher don and emerging pollutant adsorption are also feasible ashoori et al 2019 meanwhile other mechanisms in the pyrite based system such as pyrite decomposition and microbial interactions still needed to be studied the complicated stormwater drying and wetting alternation may provide a chance to solve some of those problems and the answers may in return facilitate new pyrite based water treatment technology development 4 conclusion in this study bi layer biochar pyrite bioretention was proposed and assessed comprehensively specific conclusions are biochar pyrite bi layer system achieved effective dissolved nutrient removal and minimal by product generation under various rainfall intensity antecedent drying duration and received runoff volume the removal of don n h 4 n tdn and tdp were 86 3 93 0 95 3 98 1 41 4 76 5 and 69 7 88 2 the net generation of sulfate and fetotal was less than 8 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively biochar pyrite bi layer system showed higher stability than conventional sand and woodchip amended bioretention system various stormwater conditions showed little influence on it for all dissolved nutrients except for nitrate whose removal performance decreased with the increase of received runoff volume but increased with the increase of antecedent drying duration biochar addition increased ammonium and don adsorption during stormwater events as well as nitrification and in situ denitrification during the drying period it also enhanced media water content entrapped do and created a suitable anoxic environment for the submerged zone meanwhile pyrite addition facilitated effective auto mixotrophic denitrification during the drying period the intermediate products generated by pyrite oxidation amorphous ferric hydroxides fe3 etc adsorbed phosphorus from both influent and biochar layer leaching during stormwater events and precipitated it stably during the drying period for by product generation control lower packing ratio stable anoxic environment and intermediate products generation decreased the fetotal generation in the submerged zone sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and effluent mixing effect decreased sulfate concentration besides unlike woodchip pyrite itself is not a source of ammonium don phosphorus and om which avoids the potential leaching of them declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no potential

16545,bioretention system with modified media has been increasingly used to control dissolved nutrients in stormwater runoff however complicated removal processes and improper design have made most of them hardly achieve comprehensive dissolved nutrient removal and even show by product generation problem especially during extreme stormwater events here a modified biochar pyrite fes2 bi layer bioretention system was developed and tested under various stormwater conditions with conventional sand based and woodchip based bioretention systems as controls the modified system showed high stability and efficiency for dissolved nutrient treatment the removal of dissolved organic nitrogen ammonium total dissolved nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorus were 86 3 93 0 95 3 98 1 41 4 76 5 and 69 7 88 2 respectively stormwater conditions only influence nitrate removal which decreased with the increase of total received volume and increased with the extension of antecedent drying duration net sulfate and total iron generation were very low less than 8 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively several microbiology spectroscopy and media related tests further demonstrated that the vadose zone and submerged zone showed synergy effects during operation biochar addition facilitated ammonium adsorption nitrification and in situ denitrification in the vadose zone it also intercepted dissolved oxygen which alleviated aerobic pyrite oxidation and created an anoxic condition for the submerged zone meanwhile the pyrite modified submerged zone achieved stable mixotrophic denitrification the generated iron intermediate products further controlled phosphorus from both influent and vadose zone leaching into stable forms mixotrophic denitrification and potential sulfate reduction processes also reduce sulfate generation overall the biochar pyrite bi layer bioretention is a highly promising technology for stormwater runoff treatment with effective dissolved nutrient removal and minimal by product generation in various stormwater conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mixotrophic denitrification low impact development non point source pollution nitrogen removal phosphorus removal 1 introduction urbanisation and climate change have increased excessive stormwater runoff in impervious urban areas in recent years grimm et al 2008 vast stormwater runoff volume generates a huge amount of nutrient load greatly accelerates the conveyance of nutrients to water bodies and leads to severe non point source pollution eckart et al 2017 kong et al 2021 passive treatment green infrastructures such as bioretention systems have been recently employed in urban stormwater management as cost effective solutions for non point source pollution control eckart et al 2017 conventional bioretention systems are generally planted with sand or soil showing satisfactory removal efficiencies in particulate pollutants by several biogeochemical and physical processes tirpak et al 2021 however for dissolved nutrients the removal performance was unstable for instance a wide range of tn removal between 630 and 46 have been reported in conventional bioretention systems bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2008 dissolved nutrients are often bioavailable form which can lead to quick water quality degradation lusk and toor 2016 to enhance the dissolved nutrients removal capacity many amended media such as woodchips and fly ash have been tested lopez ponnada et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 however most of the conventional amendments can not achieve comprehensive dissolved nutrient removal tirpak et al 2021 if not well designed some of them even face secondary by product generation problems for example carbon source amendments can increase the heterotrophic denitrification ability whereas excessive carbon sources can result in ammonium phosphorus and organic matter om leaching and low carbon source supply may lead to incomplete denitrification both lead to secondary pollution lopez ponnada et al 2017 research is necessary that examines the feasibility of other suitable amendments that improve the dissolved nutrient removal with low by product generation of bioretention systems as passive treatment systems bioretention inevitably face frequently changing wet and dry conditions and hydraulic loading these conditions may influence the interaction between pollutants media and microbes diminishing the pollutant removal performance and enlarging the by product generation problem for instance a long antecedent drying duration likely leads to om and phosphorus leaching in the woodchip based bioretention system lynn et al 2015 lopez ponnada et al 2017 heavy rainfall may also decrease the contact time between pollutants media and microbes then influence pollutant treatment berger et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 however most studies only examined the performance of the bioretention systems under steady state conditions to our knowledge no study evaluated and achieved the comprehensive dissolved nutrient treatment and minimal by product generation under various stormwater conditions recent studies demonstrated that pyrite can be used as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification and generate by products such as fe3 and fe oh 3 for phosphate removal without organic secondary pollution risk torrento et al 2010 ge et al 2019 xu et al 2021 those traits make pyrite a promising low cost solution to enhance dissolved nutrient treatment and by product control in bioretention systems tirpak et al 2021 our preliminary study recently incorporated pyrite into the submerged zone of a bioretention system although it achieved simultaneous nitrate and phosphate control for more than one year high sulfate and iron were also generated even under steady state stormwater conditions which greatly limited its practical use chen et al 2020 several recent studies illustrated that biochar addition can decrease dissolved oxygen do increase water holding capacity and pollutant retention ashoori et al 2019 berger et al 2019 tian et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 which directly fit the need of our preliminary study we anticipated that incorporating biochar into the vadose zone of pyrite based bioretention systems can further strengthen the dissolved nutrient removal and protect pyrite against excessive oxidation however biochar and pyrite addition may alter physical chemical and biological processes in bioretention systems to date no study employed them together for dissolved nutrient treatment and their interaction after media amendment is still unclear the cooperation of pyrite and biochar to increase the stability of the bioretention systems under various stormwater conditions is also unknown to develop a low cost bioretention system for comprehensive dissolved nutrient removal and by product control the biochar pyrite bi layer bioretention system was established and compared with conventional sand based and woodchip based bioretention systems the specific aims of this study are to i understand the influence of rainfall intensity antecedent drying duration and received runoff volume on the bioretention systems ii explore the dissolved nutrient treatment and by product generation mechanism in this new system and iii study potential synergy effects between the biochar modified vadose zone and pyrite modified submerged zone the results of this study provided a new idea strengthening both vadose zone and submerged zone for stormwater runoff treatment of bioretention system which will be helpful for cost effective non point source pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention media pyrite 1 2 mm was obtained from shangbao hunan china it was grounded and characterised by x ray diffraction xrd x pert powder panalytical netherland to confirm purity according to the manufacturer s instruction the xrd spectrum is shown in supplementary material supplementary fig s1 pine woodchip sandy loam and oyster shells were purchased from a local horticultural company pine woodchips were sieved to remove particulates larger than 5 mm well graded sands with a particle size range from 0 075 mm to 4 75 mm were purchased from huamo water treatment equipment co ltd chongqing china commercially available biochar produced by pyrolysis of pine wood at 500 c was purchased from toroyal group shandong china peat moss was obtained from nord agri sia riga latvia before bioretention cells establishment all media were first analysed for basic properties e g particulate size distribution bulk density and porosity then several groups of well grading mixed media were prepared and tested for hydraulic conductivity according to the guideline hatt et al 2009 the mixed media with suitable hydraulic conductivity 100 600 mm h were selected as filling media table 1 2 2 bioretention system set up duplicate cells were established for three types of bioretention systems namely biochar pyrite pb biochar woodchip wb and conventional sand sb cells were made of acrylic 30 cm inner diameter 120 cm height a perforated pipe was placed at the bottom of each cell and covered by a 5 cm cobblestone 4 8 mm drainage layer over the drainage layer is a 5 cm transition layer made of well graded sand to prevents filter media from washing into the drainage layer hatt et al 2009 a submerged zone which aims to create a permanently wet zone for enhanced denitrification was created by raising the outlet 45 cm above the bottom drainage layer for each cell 1500 ml autotrophic sludge and 1500 ml heterotrophic sludge was mixed with submerged zone media during media blending the detailed methods for sludge preparation are summarised in text s1 above the submerged zone is a 45 cm vadose zone also known as the upper layer at the top of each cell a 5 cm cobblestone layer was set for protection all the media were compacted at 4 cm incremental heights during media filling to get an identical bulk density and hydraulic conductivity with basic properties tests the detailed properties of the bioretention cells are listed in table 1 seven media sample ports and one water sample port were established at the cell side for media and pore water sampling the schematic diagram of the bioretention cells and instruments is shown in fig 1 plants are beneficial for dissolved nutrient removal and landscaping bratieres et al 2008 however this study only examined pollutant removal by the proposed media therefore no plants were included in the bioretention systems of this study 2 3 stormwater preparation synthetic stormwater runoff was prepared by using kno3 nh4cl kh2po4 glycine c2h5no2 and ch3coona 3h2o to get a target pollutant concentration of 3 mg l no 3 n 2 mg l nh 4 n 0 5 mg l po 4 3 p 3 mg l dissolved organic nitrogen don and 18 2 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod pollutant concentration in runoff may be influenced by several factors such as underlying surface type air quality etc to test the performance of the bioretention systems for unfavourable stormwater conditions a relatively high level of urban runoff dissolved nutrient concentration suggested in the literature was chosen kayhanian et al 2012 kong et al 2021 although many field monitoring studies found high cod concentration 100 1000 mg l in the urban stormwater runoff the biodegradable fraction was very low lusk and toor 2016 only 18 2 mg l cod was used aims to simulate the biodegradable organic fraction in stormwater runoff kayhanian et al 2012 this concentration was also used to avoid the influence of high influent biodegradable om on minimizing media based denitrification before each experiment tap water was first stored in a 200 l pe barrel for 24 h the barrel was equipped with a mixing unit that operated for about one hour to minimize residual chlorine by aeration the pretreatment aims to avoid the potential adverse effect of residual chlorine for microbes and simulate the high do concentration in the real runoff then stock synthetic stormwater was injected into the barrel and mixed for another 20 min the synthetic stormwater was introduced from the storage barrel to the top of bioretention cells using peristaltic pumps and distributed by fifteen sprinkler heads uniformly onto the column surface peristaltic pumps were recalibrated when the flow rate was changed between different stormwater conditions the received runoff volume l was calculated according to the method reported in a previous study hatt et al 2008 1 v f φ h where f m2 is the catchment area which was estimated to be 20 times of bioretention surface area 1 413 m2 φ is the runoff coefficient which is the ratio of runoff volume to rainfall volume and it was assumed to be 0 7 urban built up area h mm is the rainfall depth which was 25 mm or 50 mm full calculation details are given in text s2 2 4 experimental procedures bioretention cells were first conditioned by synthetic stormwater for one year to stabilize the microbes and media following conditioning stormwater was applied to the cells with different patterns to determine the effect of various stormwater conditions on the dissolved nutrient removal and by product generation to test the influence of received runoff volume on bioretention systems stormwater was applied at 175 mm h for 4 h 50 mm rainfall depth with 6 d antecedent drying duration the duration between two rainfall events for example 1 d means the rainfall event is applied after 24 h of the last simulated rainfall event for rainfall intensity stormwater was introduced at a constant rainfall depth 25 mm but with varied rainfall duration i e 8 4 2 and 1 h this scheme resulted in a hydraulic loading rate ranging between 43 75 and 350 mm h heavy rainfall for antecedent drying duration a total of 25 mm stormwater was applied at 175 mm h for 2 h under four different antecedent drying duration 1 3 6 and 10 d each condition was conducted twice except for antecedent drying duration tests which were conducted three times the calculations of hydraulic loading rate are described in text s2 for all experiments except the 4 h duration experiment a total of six 100 ml samples were collected from each cell when the outflow volume was 3 5 7 10 5 14 17 5 and 21 l during 4 h duration experiment six additional samples were collected after 21 l with a 3 5 l interval since the nitrate concentration drastically fluctuated than other pollutants more intensive sampling 27 samples were applied during the 4 h duration experiment during 10 d intervals pore water was collected from port a to explore the pollutant variation in the submerged zone fig 1 a 50 ml sample was collected for each cell at 0 1 3 7 24 48 240 h 24 h interval after the first 24 h to understand the mechanism of the bioretention system for dissolved nutrient removal and by product control raw media and sample media were collected from each cell for high throughput sequencing sem eds analysis xps analysis and batch experiments after reactor operation batch adsorption experiments were conducted according to tian et al 2016 media potential nitrification rate pna test was conducted according to fan et al 2011 tp bray p 1 extractable phosphorus and acid extractable phosphorus were extracted and tested using the method reported in aspila et al 1976 and fowdar et al 2017 the detailed procedures for media sampling high throughput sequencing and batch experiments are shown in text s3 7 2 5 water sample characterisation the do concentration and oxidant reduction potential orp value were tested for each sample immediately after sampling do and orp were measured using a multifunctional detector wtw 3620 german and orp metre hq30d hach usa respectively water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter first and analysed within 24 h no 3 n n o 2 n and so 4 2 were measured by ion chromatography dionex 600 usa nh 4 n total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp cod uv254 absorbence and fetotal were measured according to standard methods by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa don was calculated by subtracting n h 4 n n o 3 n and n o 2 n from tdn n o x n was calculated as the sum of n o 3 n and n o 2 n 2 6 data analysis event mean concentration was calculated and used to determine the pollutant removal efficiency statistical analysis was performed by imb spss statistics 25 anova was analysed the differences between different variables were considered significant at a p value less than 0 05 pearson correlation was used to determine linear correlations between two variables nitrate removal contribution by the vadose zone was calculated and the detailed calculation procedure is described in text s8 for the microbial analysis shannon and chao 1 indices were calculated as representatives of alpha diversity beta diversity was analysed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis by r programming using bray curtis distance the obtained sequencing data were deposited in the sra database bioproject number prjna762432 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of stormwater conditions on dissolved nutrient treatment and by product generation 3 1 1 effect of received runoff volume the pollutant concentration in the effluent of bioretention systems during the 4 h rainfall duration experiment is shown in fig 2 the pore volume of the submerged zone pv was used to count outflow volume with the increase of received volume pollutant breakthrough was found in sb the outflow concentration of don n h 4 n n o x n and tdp in sb reached 2 16 0 37 1 33 0 04 6 95 0 67 and 0 32 0 06 mg l respectively in comparison the highest concentration for don n h 4 n and tdp in the outflow of pb was only 0 73 0 14 0 04 0 00 0 12 0 02 mg l respectively only n o x n showed a breakthrough at the second pv 7 81 0 12 mg l although wb also increased the nitrogen removal compared to sb the n h 4 n and don concentration in the effluent was slightly higher than pb and n o x n breakthrough still existed 7 26 0 10 mg l moreover wb also showed high initial tdp and cod leaching 0 41 0 03 for tdp and 22 79 2 41 mg l for cod received runoff volume is critical for the dissolved nutrient treatment in the bioretention systems especially for nitrogen when the volume is less the effluent mainly includes stagnant pore water in the anoxic submerged zone if there exist electron donors such as woodchip or pyrite nitrate can be denitrified during prolonged antecedent drying duration as shown in supplementary fig s2 the orp and do value in wb and pb was low indicating that favourable conditions were provided for denitrification however if the vadose zone can not adsorb don and ammonium effectively e g sb or the submerged zone generates those two pollutants in situ e g wb the anoxic and low orp conditions can hinder nitrification as well leading to ammonium accumulation if further increase the received runoff volume pore water will be evacuated by infiltrated stormwater the infiltrated stormwater usually has a relatively short hydraulic retention time hrt and can not be effectively treated by conventional bioretention systems biochar generally has a much higher adsorption and cation exchange capacity than sand tian et al 2016 greatly enhancing the resistance of the bioretention systems for ammonium and don supplementary table s1 however it can not resist nitrate the nitrate transformed from don and ammonium in the vadose zone can not be completely denitrified in situ in the drying period or be removed by media adsorption during stormwater events this part of nitrate will be leached with the received runoff volume increase similar results were also reported in several bioretention related studies hatt et al 2008 li and davis 2014 as for phosphorus pyrite and oyster addition potentially enhanced phosphorus adsorption and precipitation ability park and polprasert 2008 ge et al 2019 making the bioretention system achieve stable and effective phosphorus removal in comparison woodchip can not facilitate adsorption and precipitation processes and it even acts as a phosphorus source which generates phosphorus in situ and leads to initial leaching fig 2e 3 1 2 effect of rainfall intensity the effect of rainfall intensity is shown in fig 3 dissolved nutrient removal in pb remained stable and effective under all conditions the don n h 4 n n o x n tdn and tdp removal in pb were 86 3 4 1 92 7 1 2 95 3 1 4 98 0 0 2 8 6 6 5 17 7 7 0 60 7 3 8 64 7 2 0 and 69 7 3 7 84 6 2 0 although wb showed higher n o x n removal 32 7 3 7 42 0 4 3 than pb its don and n h 4 n removal was slightly lower and the tdp removal was only 23 9 6 0 45 1 5 9 in comparison the dissolved nutrient removal performance in sb was poor with the increase of rainfall intensity the n h 4 n removal in sb increased but n o x n removal decreased dramatically cod removal did not show obvious variation between different conditions sb and wb remained lower cod removal than pb rainfall intensity can influence the hydraulic loading rate of the bioretention systems which may influence ammonium and phosphate adsorption in the sand based bioretention system high rainfall intensity can induce short hrt and high turbulence which may limit pollutant diffusion into the pores and weaken interaction and intraparticle mass transfer between the pollutants and media foo and hameed 2012 however after incorporating high pollutant adsorption media such as biochar and pyrite this influence can be weakened however media amendment can not weaken the influence of intense rainfall on microbial related nutrient treatment processes especially for denitrification intense rainfall will lead to insufficient hrt and dissolved organic carbon wash out from pore water then limit denitrification performance lopez ponnada et al 2017 berger et al 2019 how to achieve effective denitrification in short hrt and the unsteady state condition in the bioretention systems is still a challenge although biochar did not facilitate denitrification during intense stormwater events either it can increase media water content and prolong oxygen diffusion paths tian et al 2019 which will maintain a favourable anoxic condition in the submerged zone for further denitrification during the drying period supplementary fig s3 3 1 3 effect of antecedent drying duration the effect of antecedent drying duration on pollutant removal is shown in fig 4 don n h 4 n and tdp removal in pb remained stable and effective and they were 86 4 4 4 93 0 3 9 97 9 0 5 98 1 0 1 and 79 9 3 1 88 2 1 4 respectively with the increase of antecedent drying duration the n o x n removal increased significantly p 0 05 from 39 8 12 1 to 43 7 6 5 in comparison with the increase of antecedent drying duration n h 4 n tdp and cod removal all decreased dramatically in wb only the n o x n removal increased in 10 d condition no significant difference was found for no x n removal between pb and wb approximately 42 p 0 05 pb surpassed wb for tdn removal in 6 d 71 6 3 0 and 10 d 76 5 2 2 sb showed a similar pattern with pb despite lower overall performance antecedent drying duration generally lasts longer than rainfall events so higher denitrification performance can be expected during that period if an anoxic environment and electron donor were provided the lower orp value under longer antecedent drying duration also indicates that a favourable denitrification environment was provided for all three groups supplementary fig s4 however other by product generation processes may also be exacerbated especially for wb whose ammonium phosphorus and om in the effluent increased simultaneously with antecedent drying duration prolonging p 0 01 r2 0 8 although pb achieved higher nitrate removal and minimal by product generation during longer antecedent drying duration the low electron donor supply rate of pyrite made the denitrification performance of pb under 1 d relatively low increasing pyrite content may be a feasible solution our unpublished work incorporating 20 pyrite achieved a higher denitrification rate than pb besides in practical application the shorter antecedent drying duration may influence the pollutant accumulation processes in the underlying surface and lead to lower stormwater runoff pollutant concentration kim et al 2004 which can further alleviate the denitrification pressure of pb meanwhile antecedent drying duration can also indirectly influence pollutant adsorption processes for the vadose zone the adsorbed ammonium and don will be transformed during the drying period leaving adsorptive sites for the next event similarly more phosphorus removed by repaid reversible adsorption during stormwater events can also be transformed into slower irreversible precipitation form in drying period if high iron aluminium content media was used then free the repaid reversible adsorption sites li and davis 2016 biochar and pyrite addition can enhance those two processes which will be discussed later 3 1 4 so 4 2 and fetotal generation in pb the results of so 4 2 and fetotal generation in pb under various stormwater conditions are shown in supplementary fig s5 the so 4 2 and fetotal net generation were less than 8 and 0 15 mg l respectively much lower than our previous study which received only 40 runoff volume of the current study but generated very high so 4 2 up to 174 94 mg l and fetotal up to 1 94 mg l chen et al 2020 the net so 4 2 generation was below the theoretical value in all experiments eq 2 jorgensen et al 2009 the potentially existing heterotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction may explain this phenomenon besides sulfate is only expected to be generated in the stagnant water of the submerged zone mainly the first pv the mixing of different parts of effluent will further decrease the sulfate concentration supplementary fig s5b 2 6 no 3 2 fe s 2 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 4 so 4 2 2 fe oh 3 2 h in comparison the reason for the decrease of fetotal is more complicated the lower pyrite packing ratio in the current study may be one important reason other reasons such as pyrite oxidation control intermediate products generation etc may also exist which will be discussed later overall pb showed effective dissolved nutrient removal performance and minimal by product generation under various stormwater conditions with higher stability than sb and wb it is expected that more intense rainfall and longer antecedent drying duration will be more frequent in the future prein et al 2017 the higher efficiency and stability make pb suit it well 3 2 the dissolved nutrient removal mechanism 3 2 1 porewater chemistry in the submerged zone the results of pollutant concentration variation in pore water of the submerged zone are shown in fig 5 in pb all pollutants except n o x n kept very low during 10 d interval which indicates those pollutants were effectively removed during stormwater events the no x n in pb decreased constantly from 4 34 0 36 mg l in 0 h to 0 20 0 07 mg l in 240 h with so 4 2 net generation in pb increased steadily to 13 86 2 81 mg l at 96 h this variation indicates that pyrite based autotrophic denitrification occurred after 96 h the net generation of so 4 2 decreased to about 6 mg l potentially caused by the sulfate sulfur reduction process supplementary fig s6 in comparison wb showed a higher denitrification rate than pb however the don n h 4 n tdp and om also generated in situ which proved that woodchip potentially became a pollutant source in prolonged antecedent drying duration as for sb although it also achieved effective denitrification in the submerged zone the rate was the lowest the high don and n h 4 n in 0 h further indicate that the vadose zone of sb can not effectively prevent those two pollutants from entering the submerged zone besides they also showed a decreasing trend during 240 h which further indicate that do potentially enter the submerged zone of sb and facilitate the nitrification process 3 2 2 nitrogen transformation and removal in the vadose zone as for the vadose zone the results of the pna experiment is shown in supplementary fig s7a the pna in the upper biochar layer shows about 3 5 times higher pna than sand samples biochar addition greatly enhanced ammonium and don adsorption and media water content supplementary fig s7b which potentially provided a favourable environment for the microbes related to ammonification and nitrification then accelerated those two processes besides conventional bioretention systems are often over dependent on the submerged zone for enhanced denitrification while the vadose zone was neglected waller et al 2018 demonstrated that denitrification hot zone may exist in the vadose zone during the inundation period after stormwater events tian et al 2019 also achieved effective nitrate removal in the vadose zone using biochar mixed with om during infiltration predictably once the don and ammonium were quickly transformed they may also be denitrified in situ if a suitable environment was provided nitrate accumulation high water content and om supplement etc according to the nitrate removal contribution calculation biochar addition greatly enhanced nitrogen removal in the vadose zone and more importantly more than 50 nitrate from influent and ammonium don transformed in pb and wb were removed by the vadose zone especially the first three days supplementary fig s8 those results confirmed the existence of denitrification hot zone and biochar addition greatly enhanced the efficiency of the hot zone 3 2 3 microbial community analysis to further prove the microbial related processes discussed above the microbial community was analysed at the phylum level fig 6 a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples except pb3 sb3 and sb4 as to the genus level fig 6b several ammonium oxidation bacteria and nitrite oxidising bacteria such as nitrospira and different genera belong to the family nitrosomonadaceae supplementary table s2 xia et al 2005 and several genera capable of autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrification such as thauera azoarcus pseudomonas and denitratisoma qiu et al 2020 xu et al 2021 were found in the vadose zone biochar addition greatly enhanced their relative abundance as for the submerged zone thiobacillus which was deemed as the key genus in the pyrite based autotrophic denitrification process torrento et al 2010 ge et al 2019 showed a high relative abundance in pb3 and pb4 other heterotrophic denitrifiers such as denitratisoma azoarcus and bacillus were also found in pb3 and pb4 in contrast a high proportion of genera be capable of heterotrophic denitrification or om decomposition such as denitratisoma bacillus and cellulomonas were found in the wb3 and wb4 besides various sulfate sulfur reducing bacteria were also found in the submerged zone of pb supplementary table s2 such as desulfosporosinus and geobacter qiu et al 2020 as for alpha diversity supplementary table s3 the biochar addition groups showed a higher shannon and chao1 index than sand counterparts which means biochar addition increased both the richness and diversity of the microbial community as for the submerged zone woodchip addition increased both the shannon and chao1 index than sb while pyrite addition did not show an obvious higher value for both indexes as for beta diversity three big groups contained samples from the vadose zone group 1 the submerged zone of pb and sb group 2 and the submerged zone of wb group 3 was divided by nmds analysis fig 6c hierarchical clustering analysis further showed the biochar modified vadose zone the sb s vadose zone the submerged zone of sb and pb in group 1 and group 2 can still be subdivided supplementary fig s9 those results indicate that both layer and media types greatly shaped the microbial community structures compared to woodchip biochar and pyrite addition only slightly shape the microbial community however their addition increased the key functional genera which greatly facilitate several important pollutant transformation and removal processes e g nitrification denitrification sulfate reduction etc 3 2 4 media phosphorus content to explain the phosphorus removal mechanism phosphorus content tests were conducted and the results are shown in fig 7 a compared with the raw media tp decreased in the biochar layer and increased in the pyrite layer which indicates that the biochar layer was a phosphorus source and the pyrite layer removed the phosphorus from both influent and biochar layer leaching besides compared to raw media the content of less available inorganic phosphorus increased drastically in the sample media of pyrite layer which demonstrates that most of the phosphorus was strongly bound into the pyrite layer by precipitation the available phosphorus also slightly increase in the pyrite layer which indicates that adsorption also played an important role in phosphorus removal both adsorption and precipitation exist simultaneously making pb show stable phosphorus removal during stormwater events and potentially avoid secondary phosphorus leaching during the drying period 3 2 5 pyrite oxidation analysis to further understand the pyrite oxidation mechanism and its potential influence on phosphorus removal and fetotal reduction sem eds and xps analyses were conducted it could be found in sem images that after more than one year of operation the crystal structure on the pyrite surface disappeared and the surface of the used pyrite became rough supplementary fig s10 to explore whether the surface composition of pyrite changed xps analysis was conducted as shown in the full spectrum fig 7b the intensity of the s peak in used pyrite decreased dramatically and the shape of the fe peak changed the curve fitting of fe2p further shows that the peak of iron sulfide in used pyrite decreased drastically and the proportion of peaks for ferrous and ferric iron increased ejtemaei and nguyen 2017 fig 7c and 7d those xps results demonstrate that the used pyrite was oxidized however the eds results showed that the elemental composition and distribution of the used pyrite and the original pyrite did not vary obviously supplementary table s4 and supplementary fig s11 since the excited x ray of eds may penetrate through the surface of pyrite the results of it may include a portion underneath the surface therefore the undetected difference by eds analysis may indicate that the generated oxidized layer was thin further comparing the used pyrite with the oxidized pyrite unpublished work where pyrite was exposed in the vadose zone the surface of the oxidized pyrite showed crust with several cracks s and fe mainly existed in the cracks while the crust area was rich in fe and o supplementary table s4 and supplementary fig s11 the difference in surface morphology elemental composition and elemental distribution demonstrates that the oxidation degree in the used pyrite was milder previous studies have demonstrated that amorphous ferric hydr oxides may be generated in a suitable environment such as low free fe2 concentration during pyrite oxidation senko et al 2005 the o1s of used pyrite also peaked at 531 3 ev where was thought to be hydroxyl together with the sem eds and xps results we speculated that amorphous ferric hydroxides were possibly generated on the pyrite surface this substance was generally thought to have a high surface area and positive charge and is conducive for phosphate adsorption yang et al 2017 3 3 synergy effect between the vadose zone and submerged zone in pb based on all results the schematic diagram of pb was concluded in fig 8 biochar modified vadose zone and pyrite modified submerged zone showed synergy effect for the effective pollutant treatment and by product control during stormwater events biochar effectively adsorbs don and ammonium in the vadose zone and prevents them from flowing into the submerged zone and influences subsequent nitrification the high water content caused by biochar also prolongs the oxygen diffusion paths and entraps do by om decomposing which maintains a stable anoxic environment for the submerged zone supplementary fig s2c those decomposed om will be adsorbed by biochar or be used by microbes a slight amount of om will be leached into the submerged zone and be used for mixotrophic denitrification meanwhile phosphate in both influent and biochar layer leaching will be quickly absorbed by amorphous ferric hydroxides on the pyrite surface eq 3 hu et al 2020 3 f e n oh m ppo 4 3 f e n oh m p o 4 p in the drying period adsorbed ammonium and don can be transformed into nitrate quickly then be denitrified by heterotrophic denitrifiers in situ in the first several days with om supply the vadose zone can also help for the persistence of anoxic conditions in the submerged zone which not only alleviates pyrite aerobic oxidation but also provides a suitable environment for denitrification eq 2 4 5 chandra and gerson 2010 lower fe2 generated by pyrite aerobic oxidation can also avoid ferric hydroxides crystallization senko et al 2005 which not only promotes the lifespan of pyrite but also decreases the amount of soluble phosphorus generated by media crystallization li and davis 2016 4 fe s 2 h 2 o 3 5 o 2 2 so 4 2 f e 2 2 h 5 f e 2 0 25 o 2 h f e 3 0 25 h 2 o meanwhile pyrite can facilitate stable auto mixotrophic denitrification during the drying period and generate fe3 for more stable phosphate precipitation eq 2 and eq 6 yang et al 2017 the excessive fe3 will be transformed into amorphous ferric hydroxides in low free fe2 condition hu et al 2020 which further strengthens the phosphate adsorption ability lower fe3 caused by eq 2 4 5 will further decrease fe3 oxidation eq 7 chandra and gerson 2010 hu et al 2020 which was thought to be more potent and primary for pyrite oxidation and by product generation as for sulfate with antecedent drying duration prolonging the sulfate reduction microbes can use the dead microbes and the slight amount of leached om for sulfate reduction those potential intermediates such as sulfur or h2s may be used for autotrophic denitrification or reacts with ferric hydroxides and generate other substances such as fe2s3 avoiding potential h2s emission eq 8 davydov et al 1998 finally unlike woodchip pyrite itself is not a source of om ammonium don and phosphorus which indirectly avoids the potential leaching of them 6 f e 3 po 4 3 fep o 4 7 fe s 2 14 f e 3 8 h 2 o 15 f e 2 2 so 4 2 16 h 8 2 fe oh 3 3 h 2 s f e 2 s 3 6 h 2 o oyster shells were also demonstrated to have a high surface area and can be used as organic sources tong et al 2017 it may also facilitate denitrification and potentially sulfate reduction in the submerged zone of pb besides park and polprasert 2008 also indicate that oyster shells can increase phosphorus adsorption however compared to their study where a 30 cm oyster shells layer was constructed the proportion of oyster shells in pb was low table 1 and most of the phosphorus removed in pb was precipitated fig 7a therefore we estimate that the oyster shells may contribute to phosphorous adsorption but most of the phosphorus was still removed by pyrite and its intermediate product pyrite oxidation can also induce h generation eq 2 and eq 4 however the low nitrate concentration in stormwater runoff and do entrapment by biochar layer will limit those two processes oyster shells can also serve as alkaline sources and prevent drastic ph decrease tong et al 2017 if particulate nutrients were considered they will be intercepted by the top layer and be mineralized to phosphate and ammonium under aerobic conditions li and davis 2014 then further go through the treatment process discussed above suitable plants such as carex is also beneficial for dissolved inorganic nutrient treatment bratieres et al 2008 they may solve the nitrate breakthrough problem faced by the current study since most nitrate in breakthrough is transformed from ammonium and don in the upper layer where near plant roots most the detailed interaction between plants microbes and media is also studied by our group now 3 4 implication for stormwater bioretention our study demonstrated the importance of media selection and the whole profile usage for effective dissolved nutrient treatment and by product control in the bioretention systems the vadose zone needs to be a buffer zone for the submerged zone decreasing the hydraulic impact such as dynamic rainfall intensity and received runoff volume and intercepting adsorbing pollutants that are difficult to be completely removed in the anoxic environment e g don and ammonium it is better if it can also transform those pollutants into end product e g nitrate and remove them in situ permanently submerged zone in return as a polish zone should be able to cope with the potential leaching and the pollutants that are difficult to be treated by the vadose zone e g nitrate and phosphate besides the media used in the submerged zone need to have less om and nutrient leaching potential during extended antecedent drying duration pb generally fits this aim we also expect that this modified system can achieve more functions after optimization for example enhanced nitrate and phosphate removal can be achieved after optimizing the packing scheme of pyrite using modified biochar higher don and emerging pollutant adsorption are also feasible ashoori et al 2019 meanwhile other mechanisms in the pyrite based system such as pyrite decomposition and microbial interactions still needed to be studied the complicated stormwater drying and wetting alternation may provide a chance to solve some of those problems and the answers may in return facilitate new pyrite based water treatment technology development 4 conclusion in this study bi layer biochar pyrite bioretention was proposed and assessed comprehensively specific conclusions are biochar pyrite bi layer system achieved effective dissolved nutrient removal and minimal by product generation under various rainfall intensity antecedent drying duration and received runoff volume the removal of don n h 4 n tdn and tdp were 86 3 93 0 95 3 98 1 41 4 76 5 and 69 7 88 2 the net generation of sulfate and fetotal was less than 8 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively biochar pyrite bi layer system showed higher stability than conventional sand and woodchip amended bioretention system various stormwater conditions showed little influence on it for all dissolved nutrients except for nitrate whose removal performance decreased with the increase of received runoff volume but increased with the increase of antecedent drying duration biochar addition increased ammonium and don adsorption during stormwater events as well as nitrification and in situ denitrification during the drying period it also enhanced media water content entrapped do and created a suitable anoxic environment for the submerged zone meanwhile pyrite addition facilitated effective auto mixotrophic denitrification during the drying period the intermediate products generated by pyrite oxidation amorphous ferric hydroxides fe3 etc adsorbed phosphorus from both influent and biochar layer leaching during stormwater events and precipitated it stably during the drying period for by product generation control lower packing ratio stable anoxic environment and intermediate products generation decreased the fetotal generation in the submerged zone sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and effluent mixing effect decreased sulfate concentration besides unlike woodchip pyrite itself is not a source of ammonium don phosphorus and om which avoids the potential leaching of them declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no potential

16546,cultivating algae using wastewater nutrients is a potential approach to realize resource recovery that can contribute to circular economy however growing algae directly in a wastewater has problems such as bacterial contamination and a low biomass density to address those problems we investigated microalgal cultivation in a photobioreactor pbr fed with the nutrients extracted from wastewater by a microbial nutrient recovery cell mnrc with an external voltage of 0 3 v the mnrc pbr system removed 96 of cod and recovered 44 of nh4 n and 39 of po4 3 p at a hydraulic retention time of 7 2 h microalgae cultivated in the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc had 8 3 fold biomass density and 1 4 fold lipid contents versus that cultivated in a food wastewater containing more nutrients more significantly 90 of biomass yielded from the mnrc pbr system was microalgae much higher than 30 in the food wastewater a liquid exchange ratio of 30 achieved the highest microalgal density of 0 61 0 06 g l 1 comparable to that in a standard bg11 medium there was a tradeoff between recycling pbr medium and microalgal growth the accumulated salinity was observed in the extended operation of the mnrc pbr system treating an actual food wastewater the results of this study have demonstrated an effective approach to extract nutrients from wastewater for enhanced microalgal growth and improved biomass quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient removal and recovery wastewater treatment microbial electrochemical microalgae resource recovery 1 introduction using wastewater to grow microalgae has been of strong interest because of concomitantly removing nutrient contaminants and producing value added microalgal products mohsenpour et al 2021 this can be accomplished through engineered microalgae wastewater treatment systems such as high rate algal ponds and photobioreactors whitton et al 2015 the microalgae based wastewater treatment requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt 1 day to reach a satisfactory effluent quality due to the slow growth rate of microalgae winkler and straka 2019 for example in a high rate algal pond system decreasing hrt from 6 to 2 days resulted in a plummet in nh4 and po4 3 removal efficiency from 96 and 29 to 15 and 9 respectively arcila and buitrón 2016 in addition the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in a wastewater can compete with microalgae for organic substrates and nutrients zhang et al 2012 as a result the bacteria contaminated microalgal biomass often has low lipid and carbohydrate contents thus lowering its value as a livestock food or a precursor for higher value chemical production li et al 2018b mu et al 2021 using wastewater directly to grow microalgae will lead to a low concentration of microalgal biomass due to the large volume of wastewater thereby creating significant challenges for subsequent separation of microalgal cells christenson and sims 2011 to address those challenges we aim to grow microalgae on the extracted nutrients from a wastewater nutrients in a wastewater nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be extracted using methods such as biological nutrient leaching ruiz martinez et al 2012 wang and lee 2021 membrane concentration xie et al 2016 xu and he 2021 chemical precipitation sena and hicks 2018 wang et al 2020a and electrochemical separation liu et al 2021 ward et al 2018 among those methods microbial electrochemical systems mes are attractive because of low energy consumption and simultaneous organic removal zou and he 2018 most studies of the mes based nutrient recovery were about nitrogen recovery by taking advantage of ammonium ion migration through cation exchange membrane cem driven by an electric field rodríguez arredondo et al 2015 a special mes design named microbial nutrient recovery cell mnrc was proposed to recover both n and p in a three chamber configuration chen et al 2015 in a typical mnrc cations e g nh4 n move through cem and anions e g po4 3 p migrate across anion exchange membrane aem under an electric field it was reported that an mnrc could recover 23 nh4 n and 40 po4 3 p from a synthetic wastewater containing glucose as an organic substrate chen et al 2015 the recovery efficiency was enhanced to 60 70 for both nh4 n and po4 3 p by adding more membrane pairs and or applying an external voltage chen et al 2017 hou et al 2017 li et al 2020 mnrcs have been investigated to treat actual wastes such as hydrolyzed human urine municipal wastewater and reject water and have achieved a wide range of nutrient recovery efficiency 7 74 with the nutrient concentration factor of 0 3 22 8 freguia et al 2019 koskue et al 2021 ledezma et al 2017 monetti et al 2019 sun et al 2018 tice and kim 2014 despite the potential for nutrient recovery in an mnrc there is a lack of studies of applying the recovered nutrients to beneficial use herein we proposed and investigated a hybrid microbial nutrient recovery cell photobioreactor mnrc pbr system unlike the previous studies that included algal growth as a part of an mes cathode wang et al 2020b the proposed system decoupled the nutrient recovery wastewater treatment process from microalgal growth allowing a better control of each process in this way wastewater treatment ideally a short hrt could be separated from microalgae cultivation a long hrt resulting in higher microalgae biomass and less bacteria contamination the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the mnrc pbr system 2 understand the effects of the key operational parameters on system performance and 3 provide a perspective on the limitations and potential applications of the proposed system 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operation the proposed system consisted of an mnrc and a pbr fig 1 the mnrc was operated and stabilized for 2 months on a synthetic municipal wastewater more details in the followings before being hydraulically connected to the pbr the mnrc was built in a plate configuration containing an anode 15 ml a nutrient recovery chamber 15 ml and a cathode 15 ml separated by a piece of cem ultrex cmi7000 membranes international inc glen rock nj and a piece of aem ultrex ami 7001 with a surface area of 25 cm2 per membrane the permselectivities of the cem and aem were about 90 and 94 respectively mehanna et al 2010 each chamber was connected to an external 100 ml reservoir container both the anode electrode carbon brush and the cathode electrode activated carbon coated carbon cloth stitched by titanium wires on stainless steel mesh were prepared and pretreated according to a previous study wu et al 2018 the anode and cathode connected by a 47 ω external resistance and an external voltage 3644 a circuit specialists inc mesa az usa would be applied when noted the anode was inoculated with the sludge from an anaerobic digester in the missouri river treatment plant st louis mo usa and was operated in an anoxic environment under 20 ºc for reactor start up and operation optimization a synthetic municipal wastewater influent was fed to the anode containing g l 1 deionized or di water na acetate 0 35 nh4cl 0 15 nacl 0 15 nahco3 0 1 mgso4 0 015 cacl2 0 02 kh2po4 0 0069 k2hpo4 0 014 1 ml l 1 trace elements angenent and sung 2001 for microalgae purity test and in the final stage of the study the influent was switched to an actual food wastewater fw that was sampled at south 40 student dining service on the danforth campus of washington university in st louis fw was collected from the liquid effluent of a mechanical pulper onsite prior to discharge into municipal sewer system and the collected sample was pretreated by passing through 0 45 μm filter for solid separation the fw filtrate had an initial cod of 2100 mg l 1 nh4 n 3 mg l 1 po4 3 p 1 mg l 1 and was diluted 7 times with nutrients using a mineral solution nh4cl 0 15 nacl 0 15 nahco3 0 3 mgso4 0 015 cacl2 0 02 kh2po4 0 0069 k2hpo4 0 014 g l 1 di water fw was used here to mimic domestic wastewater mainly because of inconvenient sampling of domestic wastewater for a long period of time during the covid 19 pandemic the influent was fed to in the anode for organic removal and cation separation and then the anode effluent was supplied to the cathode for anion separation in each fed batch cycle a total of 100 ml wastewater influent was treated by the mnrc anode cathode 30 ml in total in 24 h resulting in a total hrt of 7 2 h the initial solution in the nutrient recovery chamber was di water the solutions in all three chambers were recirculated at a flow rate of 20 ml min 1 and the cathode was aerated with air at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min 1 chlorella vulgaris utex 395 was cultivated in bg11 medium and used as the initial inoculum in the pbr the initial microalgal culture was centrifuged 5 min at 4000 rpm and washed by di water 3 times to remove residual nutrient the microalgal biomass was then supplied to the pbr that contained the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc the pbr was established in a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask which was continuously illuminated under 100 μe m 2 s 1 fluorescent light at 20 mixing was provided by 200 rpm magnetic stirring the microalgal biomass was harvested at a certain solids retention time srt 2 2 experimental procedure the feasibility of the mnrc pbr system was firstly examined to do so we compared the mnrc performance between a closed circuit no external voltage and an open circuit modes at the end of the 7th fed batch cycles the recovery medium from the closed circuit was strained by 40 micron nylon meshes and supplemented with an additional 1 ml l 1 of trace elements table s1 to create microalgae growth medium which was supplied to the pbr with srt of 20 d to investigate the effect of external voltage we applied 0 0 3 and 0 6 v to the mnrc circuit to examine bacterial contamination in microalgal biomass the diluted fw was fed to the mnrc to generate two solutions fig s1 an mnrc medium nutrient recovery medium collected at the end of 6th cycles 90 ml and a fw medium cathode effluent continuously collected for 6 cycles and supplemented nutrient to influent level 6 100 ml those two media were then used in the pbr separately for supporting microalgal growth the effects of two operational factors liquid exchange ratio and recycling ratio were investigated liquid exchange ratio reflects the volumetric percentage of the pbr medium that was replaced by the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc every 24 h three liquid exchange ratios were studied 10 30 or 50 that means a 50 ml pbr would have 5 15 or 25 ml of its medium being replaced by the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc every 24 h in return the mnrc nutrient recovery chamber received the same amount of the pbr medium i e 5 15 or 25 ml after biomass was removed via centrifuging at 4000 rpm the pbr medium loss due to biomass harvesting was replenished with freshwater and both the volumes of the nutrient recovery medium and pbr medium were kept constant throughout the operation for comparison a pbr was fed with standard bg11 medium all the pbrs were operated at srt of 10 days i e 10 of the biomass was harvested daily unless noted otherwise water recycling ratio is the percentage of pbr medium returned to the pbr after biomass was harvested three water recycling ratios 0 50 and 92 were studied with 30 liquid exchange and srt 10 days the maximum water recycle ratio was determined to be 92 considering the water losses from daily sampling and volatilization the mnrc pbr system was operated on fw for an extended period of 20 d under the condition of 0 3 v 30 liquid exchange 50 water recycling and srt of 10 days all the operations were conducted in duplicates the operational parameters at different stages are provided in table s2 2 3 measurements and analysis parameters including voltage ph conductivity cod ions concentrations were quantified by the methods detailed in the supplementary information all the liquid samples were filtered through a 0 45 micron pvdf filter and then stored at 4 before analysis the concentration of microalgal biomass was monitored based on the optical density at 680 nm od680 wavelength thermo scientific genesys 20 waltham ma usa a calibration curve was established to calculate the dry biomass from od680 fig s2 the microalgae were filtered and dried overnight at 60 to quantify the dried biomass the harvested microalgal biomass was lyophilized at 80 labconco kansas city mo usa before analyzing the contents of lipid total carbohydrate and protein according to the previous study wang et al 2020c the bacterial and microalgal cell counts were quantified using a flow cytometer according to a modified method ma et al 2017 membranes with pore size of 40 μm and 1 μm were used to remove large particles and separate microalgae and bacteria cell high green fluorescence threshold and elliptical gates were applied to signals to count microalgae and bacteria cells fig s3 concentration factor was calculated as the ratio of ion concentration in the nutrient recovery chamber to that in the initial wastewater influent the calculation of the ion transport efficiency was according to a previous study koskue et al 2021 3 results and discussions 3 1 establishing a functional mnrc pbr system started in a closed circuit that did not have an external voltage the mnrc produced a maximum power density of 0 1 w m 2 had an internal resistance of 347 ω fig s4 and generated an operational current density of 0 35 0 58 a m 2 fig s5 to examine ion diffusion driven by the concentration gradient we compared the mnrc in a closed circuit both electric field and diffusion driven with that in an open circuit diffusion driven only as shown in fig 2 a the mnrc in the closed circuit obtained significantly more ions in its nutrient recovery chamber 3 47 0 1 ms cm 1 than that in the open circuit 0 05 0 008 ms cm 1 indicating that ion diffusion was not a major mechanism for nutrient migration in the mnrc this has caused a difference in microalgal growth the microalgal density in the pbr fed with the solution from the closed circuit mnrc increased from 0 036 g l 1 to 0 36 0 05 g l 1 in 5 days while there was little growth of microalgae in the solution from the open circuit mnrc fig 2b to better understand the effects of nutrients on microalgal growth we conducted an in depth analysis of the ions in the nutrient recovery solution from the closed circuit mnrc after 7 fed batch cycles the nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations reached 67 0 5 0 and 8 6 0 9 mg l 1 corresponding to concentration factors of 1 72 and 2 78 respectively fig 2c the n p ratio of 7 8 was also suitable for microalgae cultivation and both nutrients can be efficiently consumed by microalgae fig 2d as the salinity increased in the nutrient recovery chamber the junction potential also elevated because of the friction from a salinity gradient across cem or aem kim and logan 2013 the increased friction could lead to a diminished recovery efficiency in the mnrc for example the nh4 n recovery rate in the mnrc decreased from 12 5 mg l 1 d 1 in the first fed batch cycle to 7 5 mg l 1 d 1 in the final cycle in addition to n and p the nutrient recovery solution also contained other ions that were present in the wastewater fig 2e dominant ions such as na cl and hco3 accumulated to 648 29 754 42 and 650 186 mg l 1 respectively hco3 ions acted as an additional carbon source for the microalgal growth but the salinity buildup by na and cl could be harmful for microalgae such an effect might be alleviated by optimizing medium discharge that was investigated in the following sections other ions k ca2 mg2 and so4 2 increased to 26 3 1 2 5 9 4 8 6 6 1 9 and 67 1 14 7 mg l 1 and at such concentrations those ions were not expected to affect microalgae cultivation as shown in fig 2f ion movement was dominated by several major species na 42 63 of cations nh4 21 30 of cations cl 51 58 of anions and hco3 29 38 of anions the contribution of po4 3 ions to anion movement was only 4 5 those results suggest that the competition between dominant ions in a wastewater and the target nutrient ions could negatively affect the recovery of the target nutrient ions this issue may be addressed by reducing the competition ions in the feed wastewater or applying an external voltage koskue et al 2021 3 2 effects of applying a voltage to intensify the driving force in addition to the self produced bioelectricity i e external voltage of 0 v we further applied a mild external voltage 0 3 or 0 6 v to the closed circuit mnrc the application of the external voltage increased the cod removal efficiency from 91 no voltage to 96 in the absence of an external voltage the nutrient recovery chamber collected 36 of nh4 n from the influent with 24 or 9 6 1 9 mg l 1 remaining in the cathode effluent applying 0 3 v enhanced the recovery efficiency to 44 leaving only 6 or 2 4 0 7 mg l 1 of nh4 n in the cathode effluent however further increasing the voltage to 0 6 v showed limited improvement on recovery efficiency it was observed that 27 32 of nh4 n was lost in the anode chamber and 14 19 was lost in the cathode chamber fig 3 a the losses could be related to the microbial metabolic activity in the anode and ammonia volatilization under continuous air sparging in the cathode without external voltage the mnrc recovered 36 of po4 3 p and left 14 or 1 28 0 6 mg l 1 in the cathode effluent applying 0 3 v or 0 6 v did not significantly improve po4 3 p recovery efficiency 37 39 with 10 11 remaining in the cathode effluent p value 0 05 about 17 26 of po4 3 p was lost in the anode and 26 34 was lost in the cathode likely stemming from the microbial uptake in the anode and precipitation in the cathode due to an alkaline environment ichihashi and hirooka 2012 the limited nutrient recovery improvement with the applied voltage was related to the little change in the produced coulombs 80 6 6 87 8 2 9 and 82 6 2 7 c at 0 0 3 and 0 6 v respectively fig 3b likely resulted from the relatively low organic substrate in the influent and good cod removal 90 without a voltage however an external voltage of 0 3 v could still be advantageous in terms of enhanced ammonium recovery and lower contaminant concentrations in the cathode effluent cod 20 mg l 1 nh4 n 5 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 therefore 0 3 v was employed in the following experiments 3 3 reducing bacterial contamination in microalgal biomass bacterial contamination can decrease the value and hamper the separation and collection of microalgal biomass we compared the microalgae grown in the mnrc nutrient recovery medium with that in an actual wastewater medium diluted food wastewater fw was fed into the mnrc that generated two streams nutrient recovery solution mnrc medium and the cathode effluent fw medium fig s1 the mnrc removed 78 of cod 66 of nh4 n and 68 of po4 3 p fig 4 a this lower removal efficiency than that of the synthetic wastewater was likely due to the more complicated organic matters in fw however nutrient recovery efficiency was similar to that fed with the synthetic wastewater fig 3a as a result the mnrc medium contained 39 of the influent nh4 n and 47 of the influent po4 3 p while the fw medium was amended to contain 100 of both nh4 n and po4 3 p to mimic a wastewater that has been treated for organic removal and then used for growing microalgae it was observed that microalgae in the mnrc medium grew at an average rate of 0 12 g l 1 d 1 7 7 fold faster than that in the fw medium fig 4b at the end of the testing period the microalgal biomass density and absolute microalgal biomass yield in the mnrc medium was 8 3 fold and 1 2 fold as in the fw medium a higher microalgal density would facilitate the subsequent separation and harvesting of microalgal biomass the 10 day biomass density 1 2 g l 1 achieved in the mnrc medium is comparable to chlorella sp cultivation in a standard growth medium chiu et al 2008 loganathan et al 2020 sarkar et al 2021 in both media most of the nutrients were consumed at the end of cultivation fig s6 when normalizing microalgal biomass yield to the consumed nutrient the pbr fed with the mnrc medium had 12 1 g g 1 n and 97 3 g g 1 p significantly higher than 3 5 g g 1 n and 31 7 g g 1 p with the fw medium despite less nutrient in the mnrc medium a better nutrient utilization efficiency was obtained compared to that in the fw considering co2 mass transfer limitation was not observed in the fw medium this higher efficiency in the mnrc medium was likely related to a less competition for nutrients from bacteria and a more habitable environment that prevented potentially toxic compounds in the fw from entering the pbr in addition a low biomass density in the fw medium might have induced a stronger photo inhibition that slowed the microalgae growth compared to that in the mnrc medium further analysis of the biomass composition using a flow cytometer revealed that the biomass in the mnrc medium was dominated by microalgae which contributed to 83 day 1 99 day 5 and 90 the end of the batch of the total cell counts fig 4c bacteria appeared in the initial mnrc medium 17 possibly due to the algae associated bacteria in the pristine culture and nutrient recovery chamber and their contribution to the total count was kept below 7 at the end in contrast a significant presence of bacteria was observed in the microalgal biomass cultivated in the fw medium fig 4c the initial fw medium contained 67 of bacteria and such dominance 68 persisted at the end of the batch the large number of bacteria in the fw medium could have created a stressful environment for microalgae leading to a slower growth rate in fw as compared to that in mnrc medium fig 4b the dry biomass from the mnrc medium consisted of 26 2 1 1 lipids and 43 4 1 0 protein significantly higher than 18 5 1 0 lipids and 40 0 1 0 protein in the fw biomass fig 4d p value 0 05 likely owing to a higher microalgae purity wastewater derived microalgae typically contain a low content of lipid 10 8 14 4 thereby limiting its economic value chiu et al 2015 li et al 2018b a higher lipid content in the microalgal biomass from the mnrc medium would make the proposed technology more competitive 3 4 effects of liquid exchange ratio the recovered nutrient from the mnrc was supplied to the pbr via liquid exchange that is a certain amount of the mnrc nutrient recovery medium was exchanged with the same amount of the pbr medium microalgal biomass was retained in the pbr during the exchange this liquid exchange ratio could have effects on the system operation and performance for example a higher ratio would require more energy due to a larger liquid volume while a lower ratio might provide insufficient nutrients to the pbr for microalgae to investigate such effects we studied three liquid exchange ratios 10 30 and 50 varying the liquid exchange ratio did not significantly affect the nutrient removal efficiency for both nh4 n and po4 3 p which were at 71 75 and 75 80 respectively p value 0 05 fig s7 however nutrient supplying rates to the pbr were significantly different at the varied ratios 10 30 50 4 67 0 20 14 75 2 62 and 20 93 3 11 mg l 1 d 1 for nh4 n and 0 35 0 02 1 27 0 44 and 1 65 0 59 mg l 1 d 1 for po4 3 p one can see that at 10 exchange ratio nutrients were accumulated in the mnrc recovery medium and became less available in the pbr fig 5 a b the microalgal biomass in the pbr was measured at three exchange ratios and compared to that grown in a standard bg11 medium as shown in fig 5c the final microalgal concentration at the 30 exchange ratio was 0 61 0 06 g l 1 comparable to that in the standard bg11 medium 52 5 higher than that at the 10 exchange ratio and 24 7 higher than that at the 50 exchange ratio although the microalgal concentration in the bg11 medium reached a higher peak value of 0 70 g l 1 its final concentration became lower likely because of the inhibition from the self shading effects and the release of soluble algal products at a high biomass density sforza et al 2014 zhuang et al 2016 the lower microalgal concentrations at 10 and 50 exchange ratio could be attributed to different reasons at 10 nutrient supply was insufficient as abovementioned at 50 frequent liquid exchange created a greater shear stress that rendered a slower microalgae growth rate and this was consistent with the previous studies wang and lan 2018 the microalgal biomass grown in the nutrient recovery medium contained a lower content of carbohydrate 14 3 16 5 than that in the bg11 medium 20 2 1 5 p value 0 05 fig 5d the varied liquid exchange ratios had no significant effects on the carbohydrate and lipids contents in the harvested microalgal biomass fig 5d p value 0 05 as the liquid exchange ratio increased from 10 to 50 the protein contents increased from 27 6 0 7 to 33 8 1 2 and then to 40 4 1 7 p value 0 05 because of a highest biomass yield the 30 exchange ratio was adopted for the following experiments 3 5 reusing the pbr medium the medium after harvesting microalgal biomass can be fully or partially returned to the pbr and this medium recycling ratio would affect the water consumption by the pbr microalgal growth via accumulating undesired substances and the mnrc performance through liquid exchange section 3 4 thus we investigated three recycling ratios 92 recycling most of the medium 50 and 0 no recycling and refresh medium with di water after each microalgal harvesting varying recycling ratios did not exert significant influence on the contaminant removal in the mnrc p value 0 05 nearly complete cod removal 70 77 of nh4 n and 79 83 of po4 3 p removal were achieved at three recycling ratios fig s8 however drastic effects were observed with the nutrient levels in the pbr and mnrc nutrient recovery medium in both of which the high recycling ratio of 92 led to the accumulation of nutrients fig 6 a b in more detail the nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the pbr reached 70 4 5 4 and 8 5 0 7 mg l 1 at 92 recycling ratio but became much lower when less medium was recycled 12 8 0 8 and 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 at 50 recycling ratio or 11 7 3 3 and 0 9 0 2 mg l 1 at 0 recycling ratio similar trends were obtained in the nutrient recovery medium those results suggest that recycling more microalgal medium back to the pbr would retain more nutrients in both the pbr and the mnrc nutrient recovery chamber via liquid exchange medium recycling clearly affected microalgal growth and a fresher medium containing less recycled medium could result in more growth the final microalgae biomass reached 0 47 0 06 0 39 0 02 and 0 06 0 05 g l 1 at 0 50 and 92 recycling ratio respectively fig 6c the carbohydrate and protein contents in the microalgal biomass harvested at 92 recycling ratio were 11 7 and 18 9 respectively much lower than those 18 4 and 31 9 at 50 the lipid content was not significantly affected by water recycling p value 0 05 and the obtained values were consistent with what we reported earlier sections 3 3 and 3 4 the obvious inhibition of microalgal growth was observed at 92 recycling ratio after reaching a density of 0 22 0 08 g l 1 at 96 h likely resulted from the accumulated salinity stress and dissolved organic matters dom exudated by microalgae lu et al 2019 sha et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the conductivity of the pbr medium at the end of the operation was 2 68 3 19 and 3 71 ms cm 1 at 0 50 and 92 respectively fig s9 the final dom in the pbrs medium ascended to 110 125 mg cod l 1 at all ratios but the specific dom was 0 23 0 28 and 1 93 g cod g 1 biomass at 0 50 and 92 recycling indicating an elevated dom stress at a higher recycling ratio specific biomass productivity rate was estimated by normalizing the harvested microalgal biomass to the water usage fig 6d despite the highest biomass density at 0 recycling ratio its specific biomass productivity was the lowest at 0 47 g l 1 fresh water d 1 because of the largest demand for fresh water 5 of the influent wastewater volume there was no statistical difference between 50 and 92 recycling ratio 0 77 g l 1 freshwater d 1 p value 0 05 due to the minimal freshwater consumption at 92 recycling but 50 recycling ratio would be preferred because of a greater biomass density a tradeoff between algal growth and water usage was observed at 50 recycling ratio the mnrc pbr system would demand freshwater for supporting microalgal growth with a volume that is about 2 5 of the influent wastewater volume fig s10 3 6 extended mnrc pbr operation with food wastewater the mnrc pbr system was operated under a defined condition i e 0 3 v 30 liquid exchange and 50 water recycling ratio to continuously treat fw for an extended period of 20 days and major results are summarized in fig 7 the electricity generation was stable with a peak current density of 0 4 0 5 a m 2 leading to relatively stable nutrient concentrations in the mnrc nutrient recovery chamber 63 0 7 0 mg l 1 nh4 n and 12 9 1 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p this ensured the nutrient supply to the pbr throughout the operation nh4 n 9 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 1 5 mg l 1 both nutrients in the pbr exhibited a decrease trend in their concentrations after 300 h likely caused by a higher biomass concentration that created a strong demand for nutrients the microalgae biomass reached a density at 0 6 0 1 g l 1 with a harvesting rate of 0 06 g l 1 d 1 na and cl eventually accumulated to 658 and 918 mg l 1 in the pbr that were within the salinity tolerance of chlorella v ishika et al 2017 a similar accumulating pattern was observed for k and so4 2 but did not apply to ca2 mg2 and hco3 fig s11 despite the promise of above results we must realize that salinity accumulation could still be a key issue for operating the mnrc pbr system salts are built up as a result of non selective ion separation in the mnrc and reuse of the medium water recycling in the pbr the salinity of both mnrc nutrient recovery medium and pbr medium would continue to increase with time and could elevate the friction potential in mnrc and the salinity stress in pbr in the mnrc pbr system to alleviate such salt accumulation a higher medium discharge or a lower water recycling ratio can be employed at a cost of a higher freshwater demand it is desirable to have more water recycled with minimal effects on microalgal growth thus this tradeoff between freshwater demand and microalgae warrants further investigation to determine the operational period that can accommodate both factors to avoid the effect of non nutrient ions it is possible to further extract those ions from the mnrc nutrient recovery solution but such an approach will undoubtedly be more costly enhanced understanding and fabricating nutrient selective ion exchange membrane may help to address this issue but it is still at a very early stage epsztein et al 2019 alternatively salinity adapted up to 30 000 mg l 1 freshwater microalgae such as chlorella sp and chlamydomonas sp may provide a solution to address the increased salinity stress li et al 2018a perrineau et al 2014 we should also realize that nutrient recovery would inevitably make a wastewater treatment process more complicated expensive compared to the existing wastewater treatment process the economic benefits of such a recovery process will need to consider the saved cost by avoiding or minimizing nitrification denitrification phosphorus removal the value of the microalgae biomass which may be further enhanced by cultivating high value species reduced greenhouse gas emission by decreasing energy consumption associated with nutrient removal and potential credits from the government when the relevant legislations about green resource utilization are in place 4 conclusions in this work we have studied the application of the recovered nutrient to grow microalgae in a microbial nutrient recovery cell photobioreactor system by decoupling microalgae cultivation from wastewater treatment we have demonstrated the potential benefits of this system with the following results 1 compared to direct cultivation in a treated food wastewater the mnrc pbr system enhanced the microalgal biomass density by 8 3 folds and improved lipid contents from 18 5 to 26 2 because of the greater microalgae abundance the system could be operated at a wastewater hydraulic retention time of 7 2 h much lower than a typical hrt 24 h in algae based wastewater treatment 2 applying a low external voltage of 0 3 v external voltage led to 44 of nh4 n and 39 of po4 3 p recovery in the mnrc nutrient recovery medium resulting an effluent quality of cod 20 mg l 1 nh4 n 5 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 3 a liquid exchange ratio of 30 ensured sufficient nutrient supply rate of 14 75 mg n l 1 d 1 and 1 27 mg p l 1 d 1 to the pbr and achieved highest biomass productivity of 0 06 g l 1 d 1 a high exchange ratio would limit microalgae growth due to the increased shear stress 4 a recycling ratio of 50 showed both high biomass concentration 0 39 g l 1 and specific biomass productivity 0 77 g l 1 freshwater d 1 no water recycling caused high freshwater demand but a high recycling water at 92 inhibited microalgae growth due to the higher level of inhibitory compound 5 extended operation of the mnrc pbr system for treating a food wastewater achieved continuous nutrient supply 18 9 2 1 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 n and 3 9 0 3 mg l 1 d 1 po4 3 p and stable biomass production 0 06 0 01 g l 1 d 1 6 the

16546,cultivating algae using wastewater nutrients is a potential approach to realize resource recovery that can contribute to circular economy however growing algae directly in a wastewater has problems such as bacterial contamination and a low biomass density to address those problems we investigated microalgal cultivation in a photobioreactor pbr fed with the nutrients extracted from wastewater by a microbial nutrient recovery cell mnrc with an external voltage of 0 3 v the mnrc pbr system removed 96 of cod and recovered 44 of nh4 n and 39 of po4 3 p at a hydraulic retention time of 7 2 h microalgae cultivated in the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc had 8 3 fold biomass density and 1 4 fold lipid contents versus that cultivated in a food wastewater containing more nutrients more significantly 90 of biomass yielded from the mnrc pbr system was microalgae much higher than 30 in the food wastewater a liquid exchange ratio of 30 achieved the highest microalgal density of 0 61 0 06 g l 1 comparable to that in a standard bg11 medium there was a tradeoff between recycling pbr medium and microalgal growth the accumulated salinity was observed in the extended operation of the mnrc pbr system treating an actual food wastewater the results of this study have demonstrated an effective approach to extract nutrients from wastewater for enhanced microalgal growth and improved biomass quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient removal and recovery wastewater treatment microbial electrochemical microalgae resource recovery 1 introduction using wastewater to grow microalgae has been of strong interest because of concomitantly removing nutrient contaminants and producing value added microalgal products mohsenpour et al 2021 this can be accomplished through engineered microalgae wastewater treatment systems such as high rate algal ponds and photobioreactors whitton et al 2015 the microalgae based wastewater treatment requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt 1 day to reach a satisfactory effluent quality due to the slow growth rate of microalgae winkler and straka 2019 for example in a high rate algal pond system decreasing hrt from 6 to 2 days resulted in a plummet in nh4 and po4 3 removal efficiency from 96 and 29 to 15 and 9 respectively arcila and buitrón 2016 in addition the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in a wastewater can compete with microalgae for organic substrates and nutrients zhang et al 2012 as a result the bacteria contaminated microalgal biomass often has low lipid and carbohydrate contents thus lowering its value as a livestock food or a precursor for higher value chemical production li et al 2018b mu et al 2021 using wastewater directly to grow microalgae will lead to a low concentration of microalgal biomass due to the large volume of wastewater thereby creating significant challenges for subsequent separation of microalgal cells christenson and sims 2011 to address those challenges we aim to grow microalgae on the extracted nutrients from a wastewater nutrients in a wastewater nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be extracted using methods such as biological nutrient leaching ruiz martinez et al 2012 wang and lee 2021 membrane concentration xie et al 2016 xu and he 2021 chemical precipitation sena and hicks 2018 wang et al 2020a and electrochemical separation liu et al 2021 ward et al 2018 among those methods microbial electrochemical systems mes are attractive because of low energy consumption and simultaneous organic removal zou and he 2018 most studies of the mes based nutrient recovery were about nitrogen recovery by taking advantage of ammonium ion migration through cation exchange membrane cem driven by an electric field rodríguez arredondo et al 2015 a special mes design named microbial nutrient recovery cell mnrc was proposed to recover both n and p in a three chamber configuration chen et al 2015 in a typical mnrc cations e g nh4 n move through cem and anions e g po4 3 p migrate across anion exchange membrane aem under an electric field it was reported that an mnrc could recover 23 nh4 n and 40 po4 3 p from a synthetic wastewater containing glucose as an organic substrate chen et al 2015 the recovery efficiency was enhanced to 60 70 for both nh4 n and po4 3 p by adding more membrane pairs and or applying an external voltage chen et al 2017 hou et al 2017 li et al 2020 mnrcs have been investigated to treat actual wastes such as hydrolyzed human urine municipal wastewater and reject water and have achieved a wide range of nutrient recovery efficiency 7 74 with the nutrient concentration factor of 0 3 22 8 freguia et al 2019 koskue et al 2021 ledezma et al 2017 monetti et al 2019 sun et al 2018 tice and kim 2014 despite the potential for nutrient recovery in an mnrc there is a lack of studies of applying the recovered nutrients to beneficial use herein we proposed and investigated a hybrid microbial nutrient recovery cell photobioreactor mnrc pbr system unlike the previous studies that included algal growth as a part of an mes cathode wang et al 2020b the proposed system decoupled the nutrient recovery wastewater treatment process from microalgal growth allowing a better control of each process in this way wastewater treatment ideally a short hrt could be separated from microalgae cultivation a long hrt resulting in higher microalgae biomass and less bacteria contamination the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the mnrc pbr system 2 understand the effects of the key operational parameters on system performance and 3 provide a perspective on the limitations and potential applications of the proposed system 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operation the proposed system consisted of an mnrc and a pbr fig 1 the mnrc was operated and stabilized for 2 months on a synthetic municipal wastewater more details in the followings before being hydraulically connected to the pbr the mnrc was built in a plate configuration containing an anode 15 ml a nutrient recovery chamber 15 ml and a cathode 15 ml separated by a piece of cem ultrex cmi7000 membranes international inc glen rock nj and a piece of aem ultrex ami 7001 with a surface area of 25 cm2 per membrane the permselectivities of the cem and aem were about 90 and 94 respectively mehanna et al 2010 each chamber was connected to an external 100 ml reservoir container both the anode electrode carbon brush and the cathode electrode activated carbon coated carbon cloth stitched by titanium wires on stainless steel mesh were prepared and pretreated according to a previous study wu et al 2018 the anode and cathode connected by a 47 ω external resistance and an external voltage 3644 a circuit specialists inc mesa az usa would be applied when noted the anode was inoculated with the sludge from an anaerobic digester in the missouri river treatment plant st louis mo usa and was operated in an anoxic environment under 20 ºc for reactor start up and operation optimization a synthetic municipal wastewater influent was fed to the anode containing g l 1 deionized or di water na acetate 0 35 nh4cl 0 15 nacl 0 15 nahco3 0 1 mgso4 0 015 cacl2 0 02 kh2po4 0 0069 k2hpo4 0 014 1 ml l 1 trace elements angenent and sung 2001 for microalgae purity test and in the final stage of the study the influent was switched to an actual food wastewater fw that was sampled at south 40 student dining service on the danforth campus of washington university in st louis fw was collected from the liquid effluent of a mechanical pulper onsite prior to discharge into municipal sewer system and the collected sample was pretreated by passing through 0 45 μm filter for solid separation the fw filtrate had an initial cod of 2100 mg l 1 nh4 n 3 mg l 1 po4 3 p 1 mg l 1 and was diluted 7 times with nutrients using a mineral solution nh4cl 0 15 nacl 0 15 nahco3 0 3 mgso4 0 015 cacl2 0 02 kh2po4 0 0069 k2hpo4 0 014 g l 1 di water fw was used here to mimic domestic wastewater mainly because of inconvenient sampling of domestic wastewater for a long period of time during the covid 19 pandemic the influent was fed to in the anode for organic removal and cation separation and then the anode effluent was supplied to the cathode for anion separation in each fed batch cycle a total of 100 ml wastewater influent was treated by the mnrc anode cathode 30 ml in total in 24 h resulting in a total hrt of 7 2 h the initial solution in the nutrient recovery chamber was di water the solutions in all three chambers were recirculated at a flow rate of 20 ml min 1 and the cathode was aerated with air at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min 1 chlorella vulgaris utex 395 was cultivated in bg11 medium and used as the initial inoculum in the pbr the initial microalgal culture was centrifuged 5 min at 4000 rpm and washed by di water 3 times to remove residual nutrient the microalgal biomass was then supplied to the pbr that contained the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc the pbr was established in a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask which was continuously illuminated under 100 μe m 2 s 1 fluorescent light at 20 mixing was provided by 200 rpm magnetic stirring the microalgal biomass was harvested at a certain solids retention time srt 2 2 experimental procedure the feasibility of the mnrc pbr system was firstly examined to do so we compared the mnrc performance between a closed circuit no external voltage and an open circuit modes at the end of the 7th fed batch cycles the recovery medium from the closed circuit was strained by 40 micron nylon meshes and supplemented with an additional 1 ml l 1 of trace elements table s1 to create microalgae growth medium which was supplied to the pbr with srt of 20 d to investigate the effect of external voltage we applied 0 0 3 and 0 6 v to the mnrc circuit to examine bacterial contamination in microalgal biomass the diluted fw was fed to the mnrc to generate two solutions fig s1 an mnrc medium nutrient recovery medium collected at the end of 6th cycles 90 ml and a fw medium cathode effluent continuously collected for 6 cycles and supplemented nutrient to influent level 6 100 ml those two media were then used in the pbr separately for supporting microalgal growth the effects of two operational factors liquid exchange ratio and recycling ratio were investigated liquid exchange ratio reflects the volumetric percentage of the pbr medium that was replaced by the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc every 24 h three liquid exchange ratios were studied 10 30 or 50 that means a 50 ml pbr would have 5 15 or 25 ml of its medium being replaced by the nutrient recovery medium from the mnrc every 24 h in return the mnrc nutrient recovery chamber received the same amount of the pbr medium i e 5 15 or 25 ml after biomass was removed via centrifuging at 4000 rpm the pbr medium loss due to biomass harvesting was replenished with freshwater and both the volumes of the nutrient recovery medium and pbr medium were kept constant throughout the operation for comparison a pbr was fed with standard bg11 medium all the pbrs were operated at srt of 10 days i e 10 of the biomass was harvested daily unless noted otherwise water recycling ratio is the percentage of pbr medium returned to the pbr after biomass was harvested three water recycling ratios 0 50 and 92 were studied with 30 liquid exchange and srt 10 days the maximum water recycle ratio was determined to be 92 considering the water losses from daily sampling and volatilization the mnrc pbr system was operated on fw for an extended period of 20 d under the condition of 0 3 v 30 liquid exchange 50 water recycling and srt of 10 days all the operations were conducted in duplicates the operational parameters at different stages are provided in table s2 2 3 measurements and analysis parameters including voltage ph conductivity cod ions concentrations were quantified by the methods detailed in the supplementary information all the liquid samples were filtered through a 0 45 micron pvdf filter and then stored at 4 before analysis the concentration of microalgal biomass was monitored based on the optical density at 680 nm od680 wavelength thermo scientific genesys 20 waltham ma usa a calibration curve was established to calculate the dry biomass from od680 fig s2 the microalgae were filtered and dried overnight at 60 to quantify the dried biomass the harvested microalgal biomass was lyophilized at 80 labconco kansas city mo usa before analyzing the contents of lipid total carbohydrate and protein according to the previous study wang et al 2020c the bacterial and microalgal cell counts were quantified using a flow cytometer according to a modified method ma et al 2017 membranes with pore size of 40 μm and 1 μm were used to remove large particles and separate microalgae and bacteria cell high green fluorescence threshold and elliptical gates were applied to signals to count microalgae and bacteria cells fig s3 concentration factor was calculated as the ratio of ion concentration in the nutrient recovery chamber to that in the initial wastewater influent the calculation of the ion transport efficiency was according to a previous study koskue et al 2021 3 results and discussions 3 1 establishing a functional mnrc pbr system started in a closed circuit that did not have an external voltage the mnrc produced a maximum power density of 0 1 w m 2 had an internal resistance of 347 ω fig s4 and generated an operational current density of 0 35 0 58 a m 2 fig s5 to examine ion diffusion driven by the concentration gradient we compared the mnrc in a closed circuit both electric field and diffusion driven with that in an open circuit diffusion driven only as shown in fig 2 a the mnrc in the closed circuit obtained significantly more ions in its nutrient recovery chamber 3 47 0 1 ms cm 1 than that in the open circuit 0 05 0 008 ms cm 1 indicating that ion diffusion was not a major mechanism for nutrient migration in the mnrc this has caused a difference in microalgal growth the microalgal density in the pbr fed with the solution from the closed circuit mnrc increased from 0 036 g l 1 to 0 36 0 05 g l 1 in 5 days while there was little growth of microalgae in the solution from the open circuit mnrc fig 2b to better understand the effects of nutrients on microalgal growth we conducted an in depth analysis of the ions in the nutrient recovery solution from the closed circuit mnrc after 7 fed batch cycles the nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations reached 67 0 5 0 and 8 6 0 9 mg l 1 corresponding to concentration factors of 1 72 and 2 78 respectively fig 2c the n p ratio of 7 8 was also suitable for microalgae cultivation and both nutrients can be efficiently consumed by microalgae fig 2d as the salinity increased in the nutrient recovery chamber the junction potential also elevated because of the friction from a salinity gradient across cem or aem kim and logan 2013 the increased friction could lead to a diminished recovery efficiency in the mnrc for example the nh4 n recovery rate in the mnrc decreased from 12 5 mg l 1 d 1 in the first fed batch cycle to 7 5 mg l 1 d 1 in the final cycle in addition to n and p the nutrient recovery solution also contained other ions that were present in the wastewater fig 2e dominant ions such as na cl and hco3 accumulated to 648 29 754 42 and 650 186 mg l 1 respectively hco3 ions acted as an additional carbon source for the microalgal growth but the salinity buildup by na and cl could be harmful for microalgae such an effect might be alleviated by optimizing medium discharge that was investigated in the following sections other ions k ca2 mg2 and so4 2 increased to 26 3 1 2 5 9 4 8 6 6 1 9 and 67 1 14 7 mg l 1 and at such concentrations those ions were not expected to affect microalgae cultivation as shown in fig 2f ion movement was dominated by several major species na 42 63 of cations nh4 21 30 of cations cl 51 58 of anions and hco3 29 38 of anions the contribution of po4 3 ions to anion movement was only 4 5 those results suggest that the competition between dominant ions in a wastewater and the target nutrient ions could negatively affect the recovery of the target nutrient ions this issue may be addressed by reducing the competition ions in the feed wastewater or applying an external voltage koskue et al 2021 3 2 effects of applying a voltage to intensify the driving force in addition to the self produced bioelectricity i e external voltage of 0 v we further applied a mild external voltage 0 3 or 0 6 v to the closed circuit mnrc the application of the external voltage increased the cod removal efficiency from 91 no voltage to 96 in the absence of an external voltage the nutrient recovery chamber collected 36 of nh4 n from the influent with 24 or 9 6 1 9 mg l 1 remaining in the cathode effluent applying 0 3 v enhanced the recovery efficiency to 44 leaving only 6 or 2 4 0 7 mg l 1 of nh4 n in the cathode effluent however further increasing the voltage to 0 6 v showed limited improvement on recovery efficiency it was observed that 27 32 of nh4 n was lost in the anode chamber and 14 19 was lost in the cathode chamber fig 3 a the losses could be related to the microbial metabolic activity in the anode and ammonia volatilization under continuous air sparging in the cathode without external voltage the mnrc recovered 36 of po4 3 p and left 14 or 1 28 0 6 mg l 1 in the cathode effluent applying 0 3 v or 0 6 v did not significantly improve po4 3 p recovery efficiency 37 39 with 10 11 remaining in the cathode effluent p value 0 05 about 17 26 of po4 3 p was lost in the anode and 26 34 was lost in the cathode likely stemming from the microbial uptake in the anode and precipitation in the cathode due to an alkaline environment ichihashi and hirooka 2012 the limited nutrient recovery improvement with the applied voltage was related to the little change in the produced coulombs 80 6 6 87 8 2 9 and 82 6 2 7 c at 0 0 3 and 0 6 v respectively fig 3b likely resulted from the relatively low organic substrate in the influent and good cod removal 90 without a voltage however an external voltage of 0 3 v could still be advantageous in terms of enhanced ammonium recovery and lower contaminant concentrations in the cathode effluent cod 20 mg l 1 nh4 n 5 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 therefore 0 3 v was employed in the following experiments 3 3 reducing bacterial contamination in microalgal biomass bacterial contamination can decrease the value and hamper the separation and collection of microalgal biomass we compared the microalgae grown in the mnrc nutrient recovery medium with that in an actual wastewater medium diluted food wastewater fw was fed into the mnrc that generated two streams nutrient recovery solution mnrc medium and the cathode effluent fw medium fig s1 the mnrc removed 78 of cod 66 of nh4 n and 68 of po4 3 p fig 4 a this lower removal efficiency than that of the synthetic wastewater was likely due to the more complicated organic matters in fw however nutrient recovery efficiency was similar to that fed with the synthetic wastewater fig 3a as a result the mnrc medium contained 39 of the influent nh4 n and 47 of the influent po4 3 p while the fw medium was amended to contain 100 of both nh4 n and po4 3 p to mimic a wastewater that has been treated for organic removal and then used for growing microalgae it was observed that microalgae in the mnrc medium grew at an average rate of 0 12 g l 1 d 1 7 7 fold faster than that in the fw medium fig 4b at the end of the testing period the microalgal biomass density and absolute microalgal biomass yield in the mnrc medium was 8 3 fold and 1 2 fold as in the fw medium a higher microalgal density would facilitate the subsequent separation and harvesting of microalgal biomass the 10 day biomass density 1 2 g l 1 achieved in the mnrc medium is comparable to chlorella sp cultivation in a standard growth medium chiu et al 2008 loganathan et al 2020 sarkar et al 2021 in both media most of the nutrients were consumed at the end of cultivation fig s6 when normalizing microalgal biomass yield to the consumed nutrient the pbr fed with the mnrc medium had 12 1 g g 1 n and 97 3 g g 1 p significantly higher than 3 5 g g 1 n and 31 7 g g 1 p with the fw medium despite less nutrient in the mnrc medium a better nutrient utilization efficiency was obtained compared to that in the fw considering co2 mass transfer limitation was not observed in the fw medium this higher efficiency in the mnrc medium was likely related to a less competition for nutrients from bacteria and a more habitable environment that prevented potentially toxic compounds in the fw from entering the pbr in addition a low biomass density in the fw medium might have induced a stronger photo inhibition that slowed the microalgae growth compared to that in the mnrc medium further analysis of the biomass composition using a flow cytometer revealed that the biomass in the mnrc medium was dominated by microalgae which contributed to 83 day 1 99 day 5 and 90 the end of the batch of the total cell counts fig 4c bacteria appeared in the initial mnrc medium 17 possibly due to the algae associated bacteria in the pristine culture and nutrient recovery chamber and their contribution to the total count was kept below 7 at the end in contrast a significant presence of bacteria was observed in the microalgal biomass cultivated in the fw medium fig 4c the initial fw medium contained 67 of bacteria and such dominance 68 persisted at the end of the batch the large number of bacteria in the fw medium could have created a stressful environment for microalgae leading to a slower growth rate in fw as compared to that in mnrc medium fig 4b the dry biomass from the mnrc medium consisted of 26 2 1 1 lipids and 43 4 1 0 protein significantly higher than 18 5 1 0 lipids and 40 0 1 0 protein in the fw biomass fig 4d p value 0 05 likely owing to a higher microalgae purity wastewater derived microalgae typically contain a low content of lipid 10 8 14 4 thereby limiting its economic value chiu et al 2015 li et al 2018b a higher lipid content in the microalgal biomass from the mnrc medium would make the proposed technology more competitive 3 4 effects of liquid exchange ratio the recovered nutrient from the mnrc was supplied to the pbr via liquid exchange that is a certain amount of the mnrc nutrient recovery medium was exchanged with the same amount of the pbr medium microalgal biomass was retained in the pbr during the exchange this liquid exchange ratio could have effects on the system operation and performance for example a higher ratio would require more energy due to a larger liquid volume while a lower ratio might provide insufficient nutrients to the pbr for microalgae to investigate such effects we studied three liquid exchange ratios 10 30 and 50 varying the liquid exchange ratio did not significantly affect the nutrient removal efficiency for both nh4 n and po4 3 p which were at 71 75 and 75 80 respectively p value 0 05 fig s7 however nutrient supplying rates to the pbr were significantly different at the varied ratios 10 30 50 4 67 0 20 14 75 2 62 and 20 93 3 11 mg l 1 d 1 for nh4 n and 0 35 0 02 1 27 0 44 and 1 65 0 59 mg l 1 d 1 for po4 3 p one can see that at 10 exchange ratio nutrients were accumulated in the mnrc recovery medium and became less available in the pbr fig 5 a b the microalgal biomass in the pbr was measured at three exchange ratios and compared to that grown in a standard bg11 medium as shown in fig 5c the final microalgal concentration at the 30 exchange ratio was 0 61 0 06 g l 1 comparable to that in the standard bg11 medium 52 5 higher than that at the 10 exchange ratio and 24 7 higher than that at the 50 exchange ratio although the microalgal concentration in the bg11 medium reached a higher peak value of 0 70 g l 1 its final concentration became lower likely because of the inhibition from the self shading effects and the release of soluble algal products at a high biomass density sforza et al 2014 zhuang et al 2016 the lower microalgal concentrations at 10 and 50 exchange ratio could be attributed to different reasons at 10 nutrient supply was insufficient as abovementioned at 50 frequent liquid exchange created a greater shear stress that rendered a slower microalgae growth rate and this was consistent with the previous studies wang and lan 2018 the microalgal biomass grown in the nutrient recovery medium contained a lower content of carbohydrate 14 3 16 5 than that in the bg11 medium 20 2 1 5 p value 0 05 fig 5d the varied liquid exchange ratios had no significant effects on the carbohydrate and lipids contents in the harvested microalgal biomass fig 5d p value 0 05 as the liquid exchange ratio increased from 10 to 50 the protein contents increased from 27 6 0 7 to 33 8 1 2 and then to 40 4 1 7 p value 0 05 because of a highest biomass yield the 30 exchange ratio was adopted for the following experiments 3 5 reusing the pbr medium the medium after harvesting microalgal biomass can be fully or partially returned to the pbr and this medium recycling ratio would affect the water consumption by the pbr microalgal growth via accumulating undesired substances and the mnrc performance through liquid exchange section 3 4 thus we investigated three recycling ratios 92 recycling most of the medium 50 and 0 no recycling and refresh medium with di water after each microalgal harvesting varying recycling ratios did not exert significant influence on the contaminant removal in the mnrc p value 0 05 nearly complete cod removal 70 77 of nh4 n and 79 83 of po4 3 p removal were achieved at three recycling ratios fig s8 however drastic effects were observed with the nutrient levels in the pbr and mnrc nutrient recovery medium in both of which the high recycling ratio of 92 led to the accumulation of nutrients fig 6 a b in more detail the nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the pbr reached 70 4 5 4 and 8 5 0 7 mg l 1 at 92 recycling ratio but became much lower when less medium was recycled 12 8 0 8 and 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 at 50 recycling ratio or 11 7 3 3 and 0 9 0 2 mg l 1 at 0 recycling ratio similar trends were obtained in the nutrient recovery medium those results suggest that recycling more microalgal medium back to the pbr would retain more nutrients in both the pbr and the mnrc nutrient recovery chamber via liquid exchange medium recycling clearly affected microalgal growth and a fresher medium containing less recycled medium could result in more growth the final microalgae biomass reached 0 47 0 06 0 39 0 02 and 0 06 0 05 g l 1 at 0 50 and 92 recycling ratio respectively fig 6c the carbohydrate and protein contents in the microalgal biomass harvested at 92 recycling ratio were 11 7 and 18 9 respectively much lower than those 18 4 and 31 9 at 50 the lipid content was not significantly affected by water recycling p value 0 05 and the obtained values were consistent with what we reported earlier sections 3 3 and 3 4 the obvious inhibition of microalgal growth was observed at 92 recycling ratio after reaching a density of 0 22 0 08 g l 1 at 96 h likely resulted from the accumulated salinity stress and dissolved organic matters dom exudated by microalgae lu et al 2019 sha et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the conductivity of the pbr medium at the end of the operation was 2 68 3 19 and 3 71 ms cm 1 at 0 50 and 92 respectively fig s9 the final dom in the pbrs medium ascended to 110 125 mg cod l 1 at all ratios but the specific dom was 0 23 0 28 and 1 93 g cod g 1 biomass at 0 50 and 92 recycling indicating an elevated dom stress at a higher recycling ratio specific biomass productivity rate was estimated by normalizing the harvested microalgal biomass to the water usage fig 6d despite the highest biomass density at 0 recycling ratio its specific biomass productivity was the lowest at 0 47 g l 1 fresh water d 1 because of the largest demand for fresh water 5 of the influent wastewater volume there was no statistical difference between 50 and 92 recycling ratio 0 77 g l 1 freshwater d 1 p value 0 05 due to the minimal freshwater consumption at 92 recycling but 50 recycling ratio would be preferred because of a greater biomass density a tradeoff between algal growth and water usage was observed at 50 recycling ratio the mnrc pbr system would demand freshwater for supporting microalgal growth with a volume that is about 2 5 of the influent wastewater volume fig s10 3 6 extended mnrc pbr operation with food wastewater the mnrc pbr system was operated under a defined condition i e 0 3 v 30 liquid exchange and 50 water recycling ratio to continuously treat fw for an extended period of 20 days and major results are summarized in fig 7 the electricity generation was stable with a peak current density of 0 4 0 5 a m 2 leading to relatively stable nutrient concentrations in the mnrc nutrient recovery chamber 63 0 7 0 mg l 1 nh4 n and 12 9 1 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p this ensured the nutrient supply to the pbr throughout the operation nh4 n 9 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 1 5 mg l 1 both nutrients in the pbr exhibited a decrease trend in their concentrations after 300 h likely caused by a higher biomass concentration that created a strong demand for nutrients the microalgae biomass reached a density at 0 6 0 1 g l 1 with a harvesting rate of 0 06 g l 1 d 1 na and cl eventually accumulated to 658 and 918 mg l 1 in the pbr that were within the salinity tolerance of chlorella v ishika et al 2017 a similar accumulating pattern was observed for k and so4 2 but did not apply to ca2 mg2 and hco3 fig s11 despite the promise of above results we must realize that salinity accumulation could still be a key issue for operating the mnrc pbr system salts are built up as a result of non selective ion separation in the mnrc and reuse of the medium water recycling in the pbr the salinity of both mnrc nutrient recovery medium and pbr medium would continue to increase with time and could elevate the friction potential in mnrc and the salinity stress in pbr in the mnrc pbr system to alleviate such salt accumulation a higher medium discharge or a lower water recycling ratio can be employed at a cost of a higher freshwater demand it is desirable to have more water recycled with minimal effects on microalgal growth thus this tradeoff between freshwater demand and microalgae warrants further investigation to determine the operational period that can accommodate both factors to avoid the effect of non nutrient ions it is possible to further extract those ions from the mnrc nutrient recovery solution but such an approach will undoubtedly be more costly enhanced understanding and fabricating nutrient selective ion exchange membrane may help to address this issue but it is still at a very early stage epsztein et al 2019 alternatively salinity adapted up to 30 000 mg l 1 freshwater microalgae such as chlorella sp and chlamydomonas sp may provide a solution to address the increased salinity stress li et al 2018a perrineau et al 2014 we should also realize that nutrient recovery would inevitably make a wastewater treatment process more complicated expensive compared to the existing wastewater treatment process the economic benefits of such a recovery process will need to consider the saved cost by avoiding or minimizing nitrification denitrification phosphorus removal the value of the microalgae biomass which may be further enhanced by cultivating high value species reduced greenhouse gas emission by decreasing energy consumption associated with nutrient removal and potential credits from the government when the relevant legislations about green resource utilization are in place 4 conclusions in this work we have studied the application of the recovered nutrient to grow microalgae in a microbial nutrient recovery cell photobioreactor system by decoupling microalgae cultivation from wastewater treatment we have demonstrated the potential benefits of this system with the following results 1 compared to direct cultivation in a treated food wastewater the mnrc pbr system enhanced the microalgal biomass density by 8 3 folds and improved lipid contents from 18 5 to 26 2 because of the greater microalgae abundance the system could be operated at a wastewater hydraulic retention time of 7 2 h much lower than a typical hrt 24 h in algae based wastewater treatment 2 applying a low external voltage of 0 3 v external voltage led to 44 of nh4 n and 39 of po4 3 p recovery in the mnrc nutrient recovery medium resulting an effluent quality of cod 20 mg l 1 nh4 n 5 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 3 a liquid exchange ratio of 30 ensured sufficient nutrient supply rate of 14 75 mg n l 1 d 1 and 1 27 mg p l 1 d 1 to the pbr and achieved highest biomass productivity of 0 06 g l 1 d 1 a high exchange ratio would limit microalgae growth due to the increased shear stress 4 a recycling ratio of 50 showed both high biomass concentration 0 39 g l 1 and specific biomass productivity 0 77 g l 1 freshwater d 1 no water recycling caused high freshwater demand but a high recycling water at 92 inhibited microalgae growth due to the higher level of inhibitory compound 5 extended operation of the mnrc pbr system for treating a food wastewater achieved continuous nutrient supply 18 9 2 1 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 n and 3 9 0 3 mg l 1 d 1 po4 3 p and stable biomass production 0 06 0 01 g l 1 d 1 6 the

16547,microplastics mps have been recognized as a global concern due to their potential health effect as mps could adsorb and carry various pollutants in aquatic environment in the present study a new environmental behavior related to polyvinyl chloride microplastics pvc mps and the underlying mechanism were described our results showed that the photo aged pvc mps could affect the transformation of cephalosporin antibiotics for instance the presence of altered pvc mps significantly accelerated the hydrolysis of cefazolin cfz but exhibited negligible effect on the degradation of cephalexin cfx as indicated by in situ fourier transform infrared spectra and theoretical calculations hydrogen bonds could be formed between β lactam carbonyl of cfz and the oxygen containing moieties on the aged pvc mp surfaces the hydrogen bonding was able to significantly increase the positive atomic mulliken charge on the β lactam carbonyl carbon thus narrowing the energy gap of cfz hydrolysis and subsequently enhancing the disruption of β lactam ring while for cfx instead of the β lactam carbonyl the amide amino group was involved in the hydrogen bonding due to the structural difference therefore in addition to increasing the adsorption capacity the aged pvc mps could act as the catalyst to mediate the transformation of antibiotics our study would help improve the understanding for interactions between contaminants and mps in natural environments graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyvinyl chloride microplastics photo aging cephalosporin antibiotics hydrolysis hydrogen

the fragmented pieces those with sizes of 5 mm are termed as microplastics mps thompson et al 2004 which have been identified as the emerging global concern due to their physiochemical hazards and the role as carrier for contaminants liang et al 2021 mps can be ingested by various creatures of different trophic levels e g whale turtle lugworm and even zooplankton chua et al 2014 which subsequently leads to inflammatory responses von moos et al 2012 and decreases in feeding activity survival and fecundity besseling et al 2013 cole et al 2015 moreover mps have been widely reported to adsorb

polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene microplastics demonstrating that the released pops from microplastics under simulated physiological conditions could reach 30 times greater than that in seawater alone bakir et al 2014 it was reported that aging and weathering processes are able to change the environmental behaviors of mps mainly including the release of additives e g flame retardants

undergoes photo thermal hydro or bio degradation oxygen containing functional groups e g carbonyl c o carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh would be generated on mp surfaces wang et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 ding et al 2020 the appearance of oxygenated groups is able to decrease the mp hydrophobicity thus enhancing the adsorption of compounds with high hydrophilicity and polarity such as sulfonamide fluoroquinolone tetracycline and β lactam antibiotics li et al 2018 liu et al 2019a zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2019b liu et al 2019b investigated the adsorption of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic i e ciprofloxacin on ultraviolet aged pvc and polystyrene mps finding that the adsorption of ciprofloxacin on mps significantly increased after photo aging treatment the enhanced adsorption performance could be mainly ascribed to the hydrogen bonding forces between antibiotic molecules and oxygen containing moieties on the aged pvc mp surface liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b similar results were also observed for the adsorption of oxytetracycline on virgin and bleached polystyrene mps zhang et al 2018 however even the adsorption process of various organic contaminants on pristine and altered mps has been extensively explored little information is available for the impact of mps on the transformation of adsorbed chemicals it has been well recognized that hydrolysis is a major degradation pathway for commonly used antibiotics especially for those containing amido and β lactam groups mitchell et al 2014 jin et al 2019 sheng et al 2019 heterogenous surface catalyzed degradation of pharmaceuticals by various minerals has been widely studied and the surface brӧnsted and lewis acidities could induce the hydrolytic reaction by breaking the amino bond fang et al 2018 wei et al 2001 xu 1998 moreover our recent study found that the enhanced hydrolysis of chloramphenicol might be attributed to the hydrogen bonding with kaolinite surface jin et al 2019 since c o cooh and oh groups could be generated on mp surfaces after aging process wang et al 2020a ding et al 2020 hydrogen bonding interaction would also be involved between antibiotics and oxygenated mp surfaces therefore aged mps with oxygenated groups might serve as a new matrix for adsorption and subsequent transformation of commonly used antibiotics which has not yet been reported before cephalosporins are representatives of semi synthetic β lactam antibiotics which are widely applied to human and animals as high priority antimicrobials ribeiro et al 2018 the detection of cephalosporins has been reported in various aqueous matrices e g surface water coastal water sewage and wastewater within concentrations of 0 30 ng l 1 to 0 03 mg l 1 ribeiro et al 2018 despite these compounds readily undergo rapid hydrolytic and photolytic reactions in aquatic matrices under environmentally relevant conditions half life values ranging from days to weeks wang and lin 2012 jiang et al 2010 interestingly the transformation products of cephalosporins exhibit greater toxicity towards aquatic organisms e g vibrio fischeri and daphnia magna wang and lin 2012 kim et al 2017 and stronger persistence than the parental compounds ribeiro et al 2018 for instance the photo degradation products of cefazolin cfz exhibited greater photo stability and acute toxicity which could be possibly attributed to its 5 methyl 1 3 4 thiadiazole 2 thiol moiety wang and lin 2012 the strong hydrophilicity of this β lactam drug might render the interaction with aged mps containing polar oxygenated functional groups which might change its transformation process via surface catalyzed reaction the objectives of this study are i to explore the changes in physiochemical properties of mps induced by photo irradiation in the aquatic environment ii to investigate the impacts of aged mps on the adsorption and transformation of cephalosporin antibiotics iii to reveal the catalytic degradation mechanism of cephalosporin pharmaceuticals by aged mps pvc mp was applied due to the vast production in china liu et al 2020 moreover the detection of pvc mps has been reported in various matrices including soil sediment and water yan et al 2019 tan et al 2019 uv treatment was used to obtain the aged pvc mps as prior studies reported that uv irradiation ozone treatment and advanced oxidation could be employed to simulate the aging processes of mps in the environments liu et al 2019a tian et al 2017 decker and balandier 1982 cefazolin cfz and cephalexin cfx were chosen as the model cephalosporin antibiotics with nephrotoxic properties as indicated by animal and human tests zhanel 1990 and their molecular structures are shown in fig 1 our experimental results provide the first evidence for the transformation of β lactam antibiotics catalyzed by mps under environmentally relevant conditions which would increase the attention on the aging processes of mps and shed light on the environmental behaviors of organic contaminants associated with mps 2 materials and methods chemicals pvc particles with the diameter of 1 µm were purchased from guanbu tech shanghai china cfz

detailed information on the analysis of mass spectrometry is provided in supporting information text s1 batch adsorption experiments the adsorption of cfz on pristine and aged pvc mps followed a standard batch equilibrium method for each adsorption experiment 10 0 mg pvc mp particles were added into a glass centrifuge tube containing 10 0 ml cfz solution with the initial concentrations ranging from 1 0 to 104 9 µm the solution ph was adjusted to ph 7 by adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solutions prior to the addition of mp particles the centrifuge tubes were placed in a rotary shaker 200 rpm is rdvi crystal usa and shaken at 25 c for 12 h in the dark and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min no significant loss resulting from degradation or adsorption to glassware during the adsorption process was observed as indicated by the recovery of 95 the concentration of cfz in the supernatant was measured using the same hplc method as mentioned above the amount of cfz adsorbed on pvc mp particles was calculated by the difference between the cfz concentrations in blank no pvc mps and in supernatant from the sample containing adsorbent similar experiments were conducted to determine the adsorption isotherm of cfx on pristine and aged pvc mps theoretical calculations gaussian 09 w program frisch et al 2009 with density function theory dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to optimize the geometrical structures of cfz and cfx the same method was also applied to investigate the geometrical and chemical properties of pristine and aged pvc six monomers was employed to simplify the structure of pvc for the calculation of gaussian simulation wang et al 2020a hamed mashhadzadeh et al 2017 in addition the binary systems composed of cephalosporin antibiotics and pristine aged pvc polymers were simulated by dft calculations i e cfz pvcpristine cfz pvcaged cfx pvcpristine and cfx pvcaged on the basis of optimized geometries mulliken charges and frontier molecular orbitals i e the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were calculated to elucidate the underlying degradation mechanism induced by aged pvc mps moreover the transition states of cephalosporin degradation in the presence or absence of aged pvc mps were determined to obtain the activation energy the 6 31 g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of cfz cfx and pvc i e c h o n s and cl the effects of common water quality factors on the transformation and adsorption of cephalosporins in the presence of pvc mps the effects of coexisting ions and nom on the transformation and adsorption of cfz and cfx in the presence of pristine and aged pvc mps were investigated by adding nacl 1 0 mm cacl2 1 0 mm na2so4 1 0 mm srfa 10 mg l

shown in fig 2 a and b a uniform and glossy surface was observed for pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv while the photo aged pvc mps appeared harsh and uneven fig 2c fig 2d e and f showed the digital images of water droplets on the pvc mp disks the respective θw values of pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv were calculated as 113 0 and 110 5 suggesting that the surface of pristine polymer exhibited strong hydrophobicity fig 2d and e after photo treatment a significant decrease in θw value was obtained θw 10 0 indicating greater water affinity of pvcaged particles fig 2f similar results were also reported in our recent studies that an increase of hydrophilicity was observed for the aged mp surfaces wang et al 2020a liu et al 2019a in addition to surface morphology uv irradiation also showed a significant impact on the specific surface areas as indicated by the bet results as listed in table s2 the bet surface areas were 77 5 77 9 and 89 2 m2 g 1 for pvcpristine pvcaged no uv and pvcaged respectively therefore the photo aging process could increase the surface areas by changing the surface morphologies of pvc mp pellets which was also consistent with the results of sem images fig 2a b and c the surface structure of pvc mp powders was further investigated by the ftir spectroscopy as illustrated in fig 2g h and i the peaks of pristine pvc mps at 616 694 835 960 1255 1335 1430 and

respectively quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 for comparison after uv treatment three absorption bands at 1610 1725 and 3450 cm 1 appeared which corresponded to c c c o and oh stretching vibrations respectively rajendran and uma 2001 similar results were also reported in the previous studies that c c c o and oh moieties could be formed after artificial and natural aging of pvc plastics in the presence of water wang et al 2020a real et al 2005 the carbonyl index ci is commonly served as an indicator for plastic aging degree which was calculated by dividing the intensity of carbonyl by the methylene peak intensity i e 1725 1430 for pvc shi et al 2008 the ci value was calculated as 0 65 indicating that the aged pvc mps were at the advanced oxidative stage ter halle et al 2016 furthermore ft iris images were collected to visualize the relative intensities of newly occurring functional groups in pristine and altered pvc mps the signal intensities of ftir characteristic peaks were reflected by the color in ft iris images which increased as the color varied from blue to pink as shown in the insets of fig 2g h and i blue color was observed for c c c o and oh peaks of pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv while red and pink colors were obtained for pvcaged particles suggesting a great amount of alkene and oxygen containing moieties produced on pvc mp surface after uv irradiation in addition the xps technique was used to perform elemental analysis of the pvc mp powders as illustrated in fig 2j k and l when exposed to uv irradiation an increase in o1s peak and a decrease in cl2p peak were observed while negligible change was obtained for c1s intensity to quantitatively assess the aging degree of pvc mps the percentages of elements i e c cl and o in pristine and aged pvc mps were determined as listed in table s3 the percentage of cl atoms decreased from 22 06 to 13 09 after aging for 5 d and an increase from 2 74 to 11 85 for o atoms furthermore the chlorine to carbon cl c and oxygen to carbon o c ratios were calculated to describe the aging degrees of pvc mps liu et al 2019a the cl c and o c values were 0 29 and 0 04 for both pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv while 0 17 and 0 16 for pvcaged respectively table s3 degradation of cfz and cfx in the presence of pristine and aged pvc mps as shown in fig 3 a bare cfz underwent slight degradation with the removal ratio of 19 8 at neutral ph after 7 d and the presence of pvcpristine didn t promote the degradation process even showing somewhat inhibition effect with lower removal ratio 16 3 fig 3b similar phenomena were also observed for cfz decomposition when lower concentrations of pristine pvc mps existed figure s2a however when photo aged pvc mps were added into cfz solution significant enhancement for cfz degradation 44 2 was observed fig 3c as listed in table s4 all the degradation kinetic data were well fitted by pseudo first order kinetic model and the reaction rate constant kobs was calculated as 3 4 10 3 h 1 for photo aged pvc mps which was 2 6 and 3 4 times higher than those for cfz itself and pvcpristine respectively moreover the significant enhancement in cfz degradation was also obtained in the presence of 10 mg l 1 pvcaged figure s2b indicating that catalytic degradation of cfz by the aged pvc mps would possibly occur in the natural aquatic environment leusch and ziajahromi 2021 yan et al 2019 interestingly pvcaged showed no significant enhancement for the degradation of cfx which possesses similar core structure as cfz as illustrated in figure s3 cfx itself decomposed with the degradation ratio of 24 4 after 7 d and the reaction rate constant was fitted to be 1 5 10 3 h 1 table s4 no significant difference in the degradation rate constants was obtained for cfx pvcpristine kobs 1 3 10 3 h 1 and cfx pvcaged kobs 1 4 10 3 h 1 reaction systems figure s3 and table s4 therefore the aged pvc mps exhibited great potential to catalyze the hydrolysis of cfz but no effects on the removal of cfx this might be ascribed to the difference in molecular structures of cfz and cfx e g functional groups attached to the core structure of cephalosporin antibiotics 7 aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid which subsequently led to the varied intermolecular interactions between β lactam antibiotics and pvcaged surfaces more discussion for the degradation mechanism was provided below the enhanced transformation route of cfz was further investigated by identifying the reaction product comparing the retention times of standards and the detected daughter product in the hplc chromatogram the peaks at 6 55 and 4 25 min corresponded to cfz and cfzhydrolyzed respectively figure s4 moreover cfz h and cfzhydrolyzed h were identified by the hplc ms system with the respective mass charge ratios of 455 04 456 04 457 04 and 473 05 474 05 475 05 figure s5 confirming the generation of cfzhydrolyzed furthermore a good mass balance of 95 was obtained by quantification of residual cfz and generated cfzhydrolyzed fig 3 therefore hydrolysis at the β lactam ring is the dominant transformation pathway of cfz under neutral ph condition which could be catalyzed by the aged pvc mps adsorption of cfz and cfx on pristine and altered pvc mps to obtain further insights into the underlying mechanism the adsorption of cfz and cfx on pristine and aged pvc mps was investigated considering the decomposition of cfz and cfx during the adsorption period the adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted within 12 h during which negligible degradation of β lactam antibiotics was observed in the presence of pvcpristine and pvcaged figs 3 and s3 as shown in fig 4 a the adsorption isotherms of cfz on pvc mps followed the langmuir model suggesting the occurrence of monolayer adsorption on the mp surface liu et al 2019a as listed in table s5 the fitted maximum adsorption amounts of cfz on pvc mps qmax µmol g 1 were 8 11 and 23 98 µmol g 1 for pvcpristine and pvcaged respectively the higher adsorption of cfz on photo altered pvc mps could be attributed to the higher surface area and greater quantity of the oxygen containing moieties on the mp surfaces which would provide more reactive sites for cfz molecules and might explain the enhanced hydrolytic rate of the β lactam antibiotic similarly for cfx the qmax values were also calculated as 7 58 and 10 36 µmol g 1 for pvcpristine and pvcaged respectively indicating that greater adsorption capacity of cfx was obtained for the aged pvc mps fig 4b and table s6 in situ ftir analysis the in situ ftir spectroscopy was employed to investigate the interactions between cfz cfx and pristine or aged pvc mp particles our recent study explored the transformation of penicillin antibiotics on zinc adsorbed goethite and concluded that the specific complexation interactions as evidenced by ftir spectrum could accelerate the hydrolytic degradation rate of penicillin by 3 orders of magnitude sheng et al 2019 therefore the surface interaction mode might play an important role in promoting the transformation process of cephalosporin antibiotics in the presence of pvc mps as shown in fig 5 the absorption bands of cfz at 1247 1386 1599 1697 and 1765 cm 1 were assigned to the bending vibration of cn in β lactam ring vcn bend symmetric stretching mode of carboxyl group vcoo sym asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxyl vcoo as stretching mode of carbonyl in amide group vc o ami and stretching vibration of carbonyl in the β lactam ring vc o respectively sheng et al 2019 rechelo et al 2019 in the presence of pristine pvc mp particles only a blue shift for vcn bend was observed in the cfz spectrum fig 5a while compared to the original pvc mps for the system with pvcaged powders the intensities of cfz characteristic peaks were significantly enhanced for vcn bend vcoo sym vcoo as vc o ami and vc o especially for vcoo as and vc o fig 5b which could be ascribed to the greater adsorption of β lactam pharmaceuticals on the aged pvc mps fig 4 furthermore red shifts for carbonyl peaks of cfz were obtained as pvcaged powders existed as shown in fig 5b the peak of vc o was broadened and red shifted upon cfz adsorption compared to the spectrum of cfz in aqueous solution indicating the involvement of hydrogen bonding forces between β lactam carbonyl and pvcaged hydroxyl fig 5b the interfacial interactions between pristine aged pvc mp surfaces and cfx were also investigated by monitoring the in situ ftir spectra as indicated in figure s6 the characteristic peaks at 1755 1588 1500 and 1394 cm 1 were assigned to vc o vnh bend amide nh bending vibration vcoo as and vcoo sym respectively agnihotri et al 2006 by comparison with the results of cfz no significant shifts were obtained for vc o while a blue shift of 34 cm 1 occurred for vnh bend absorption band in the ftir spectrum of cfx pvcaged this suggested that hydrogen bonding was involved in the intermolecular interactions between the secondary amine of cfx and carbonyl of pvcaged similar results were also reported by wang et al that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction was able to induce a significant blue shift in the hoh bending mode of water molecule wang et al 2020b despite both cfz and cfx could form hydrogen bonding with aged pvc mp surfaces significant difference was obtained in the binding sites which might be responsible for the varied catalytic activity of pvcaged for the degradation of cfz and cfx to further elucidate the underlying mechanism theoretical calculations were performed to provide evidence for the catalytic degradation of cephalosporin antibiotics on the surfaces of pvc mps the binary systems i e cfz pvcaged and cfx pvcaged were simulated and optimized based on the intermolecular binding sites as indicated by the results of in situ ftir spectra figure s7a showed the simulated molecular structures of pristine pvc mp composed of six vinyl chloride monomers while alkene hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were added to the carbon skeleton of pvcaged polymer figure s7b the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between pvcaged and β lactam antibiotic molecules changed the distribution of frontier molecular electron cloud as indicated by visualization of homo and lumo orbitals figures s8 and s9 in the case of bare cfz homo orbital was mostly located on the thiadiazole and thiazine rings and dispersedly distributed on the β lactam ring while lumo orbital was mainly on the thiazine and β lactam rings figure s8 similar results were also obtained for cfz pvcpristine binary system figure s10 indicating that pristine pvc mps showed negligible effect on the electron cloud distribution of cfz due to the weak van der waals force compared to the frontier molecular orbitals of cfz only and cfz pvcpristine in the cfz pvcaged system lumo orbital transferred from cfz molecule to the aged pvc polymer which could be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between β lactam antibiotic molecules and aged pvc mps moreover the variation of frontier molecular orbitals is commonly accompanied by the changes of bond lengths and atomic charges li et al 2015 as shown in figure s11 the bond lengths of c o 19c 20o increased by 0 01 å due to the hydrogen bonding interaction between cfz and aged pvc polymer which was consistent with the red shift of vc o peak fig 5 on the other hand the intermolecular hydrogen bonding could increase the positive charge of the carbonyl carbon atom in the β lactam ring i e 19c from 0 563 to 0 579 figures s8 and s9 which was reported to facilitate the h2o induced nucleophilic attack jin et al 2019 furthermore based on the optimized transition states of cfz hydrolysis by h2o attack figures s12 s14 the hydrolytic activation energy of cfz coexisting with pvcaged and a h2o molecule cfz pvcaged h2o 177 2 kj mol 1 was significantly lowered than that of bare cfz with a h2o molecule cfz h2o 239 7 kj mol 1 and that of cfz pvcpristine h2o ternary system 250 5 kj mol 1 fig 6 therefore our theoretical calculation results provided more convincing evidence for the enhanced hydrolysis of cfz by the aged pvc mps for comparison frontier molecular orbitals were also calculated for cfx as shown in figures s8 and s10 both homo and lumo orbitals were mainly distributed around thiazine and β lactam rings for cfx only and cfx pvcpristine systems when cfx was hydrogen bonded to the aged pvc mps the homo and lumo orbitals moved to the benzene ring and pvcaged chain respectively figure s9 while only a slight increase of 0 002 was obtained for the positive mulliken charge of β lactam carbonyl carbon atom i e 7c figures s8 and s9 comparing with cfz stronger electron donating moieties containing phenyl and amino groups were attached to the core structure of cephalosporin pharmaceuticals figure s8 qian et al 2018 as a result the electron cloud density on the amide nitrogen atom was increased as indicated by the distribution of frontier molecular orbitals figure s8 moreover as the electronegativity is positively correlated with electron cloud density and atoms with greater electronegativity are more facile to form hydrogen bonding ghosh and islam 2011 thus the amino group of cfx amide would exhibit great potential to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety on the aged pvc mp surface which has been confirmed by the results of in situ ftir spectra as discussed above as shown in figures s8 s10 the hydrogen bonding significantly changed the mulliken charges on the atoms directly involved e g n while little effect was obtained for the positive atomic charge of β lactam carbonyl carbon furthermore different from cfz both pvcpristine and pvcaged showed negligible effects on the hydrolytic activation energy of cfx figure s15 which is supported by the optimized transition states of cfx upon being attacked by a h2o molecule figure s16 s18 therefore the structure dependent hydrogen bonding mode might be responsible for the negligible effect of aged pvc mps on the degradation of cfx impacts of ions and nom on the decomposition of cephalosporin antibiotics figure s19 showed the effects of coexisting ions and nom on the degradation kinetics of cfz in the absence and presence of pvc mps and degradation rate constants of cfz were fitted with pseudo first order model as listed in tables s4 and s7 common ions i e na ca2 cl and so4 2 and nom i e srfa and srha exhibited great potential to promote the degradation of cfz in bare cfz and cfz pvcpristine binary system which is consistent with the results reported by jiang et al 2010 that cephalosporin antibiotics underwent faster degradation in sterilized natural water than in distilled water for cfz pvcaged system the presence of cations and anions was able to suppress the catalytic degradation of cfz by pvcaged while srfa and srha strengthened the catalytic effects as shown in figures s20 the adsorption of cfz on pvcaged was strongly restrained in the presence of common cations and anions due to the inhibition of intermolecular hydrogen bondind yang et al 2012 while nom just slightly decreased the adsorbed amounts as it might compete for the hydrogen bonding sites on the pvcaged surface with cfz this suggested that the contribution of ions and nom to the adsorption of cfz on the aged pvc mps played significant role in the surface catalytic degradation of cephalosporin antibiotics similarly both ions and nom were able to slightly increase the degradation rates of cfx figure s21 tables s4 and s7 but inhibit the adsorption amounts of cfx on the aged pvc mps figure s20 4 conclusion our results clearly demonstrate that the aged pvc mps exhibit great potential to catalyze the hydrolysis of cephalosporin antibiotics under environmentally relevant conditions while the catalytic effects are strongly dependent on the electron donating ability of functional groups attached to the core structure of cephalosporin molecules pvcaged showed enhanced adsorption capacity for both cfz and cfx via forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds with cephalosporin antibiotics however the altered pvc mps exhibited enhancement for hydrolysis of cfz but negligible effects on the degradation of cfx which might be explained by different hydrogen bonding sites of cephalosporin pharmaceuticals with aged pvc mp surface by comparison with cfx cfz possesses weaker electron donating moieties attached to the cephalosporin core structure which could strengthen the hydrogen bonding potential of β lactam carbonyl and weaken the ability of amide nitrogen to form hydrogen bonds as evidenced by the in situ ftir spectra theoretical calculations further confirm that direct hydrogen bonding to β lactam carbonyl could significantly increase the positive charge on carbon atom of β lactam carbonyl thus lowering the hydrolytic energy gap of cfz since both naturally aged pvc mps and cephalosporin pharmaceuticals are widely distributed in aquatic environments it is reasonable that other β lactam antibiotics could undergo a similar hydrolytic reaction the novel role of pvcaged in the transformation pathway of antibiotics improves our understanding for the environmental behavior of various mps distributed in the various environmental matrices declaration of competing interest

16547,microplastics mps have been recognized as a global concern due to their potential health effect as mps could adsorb and carry various pollutants in aquatic environment in the present study a new environmental behavior related to polyvinyl chloride microplastics pvc mps and the underlying mechanism were described our results showed that the photo aged pvc mps could affect the transformation of cephalosporin antibiotics for instance the presence of altered pvc mps significantly accelerated the hydrolysis of cefazolin cfz but exhibited negligible effect on the degradation of cephalexin cfx as indicated by in situ fourier transform infrared spectra and theoretical calculations hydrogen bonds could be formed between β lactam carbonyl of cfz and the oxygen containing moieties on the aged pvc mp surfaces the hydrogen bonding was able to significantly increase the positive atomic mulliken charge on the β lactam carbonyl carbon thus narrowing the energy gap of cfz hydrolysis and subsequently enhancing the disruption of β lactam ring while for cfx instead of the β lactam carbonyl the amide amino group was involved in the hydrogen bonding due to the structural difference therefore in addition to increasing the adsorption capacity the aged pvc mps could act as the catalyst to mediate the transformation of antibiotics our study would help improve the understanding for interactions between contaminants and mps in natural environments graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyvinyl chloride microplastics photo aging cephalosporin antibiotics hydrolysis hydrogen

ding et al 2020 the appearance of oxygenated groups is able to decrease the mp hydrophobicity thus enhancing the adsorption of compounds with high hydrophilicity and polarity such as sulfonamide fluoroquinolone tetracycline and β lactam antibiotics li et al 2018 liu et al 2019a zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2019b liu et al 2019b investigated the adsorption of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic i e ciprofloxacin on ultraviolet aged pvc and polystyrene mps finding that the adsorption of ciprofloxacin on mps significantly increased after photo aging treatment the enhanced adsorption performance could be mainly ascribed to the hydrogen bonding forces between antibiotic molecules and oxygen containing moieties on the aged pvc mp surface liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b similar results were also observed for the adsorption of oxytetracycline on virgin and bleached polystyrene mps zhang et al 2018 however even the adsorption process of various organic contaminants on pristine and altered mps has been extensively explored little information is available for the impact of mps on the transformation of adsorbed chemicals it has been well recognized that hydrolysis is a major degradation pathway for commonly used antibiotics especially for those containing amido and β lactam groups mitchell et al 2014 jin et al 2019 sheng et al 2019 heterogenous surface catalyzed degradation of pharmaceuticals by various minerals has been widely studied and the surface brӧnsted and lewis acidities could induce the hydrolytic reaction by breaking the amino bond fang et al 2018 wei et al 2001 xu 1998 moreover our recent study found that the enhanced hydrolysis of chloramphenicol might be attributed to the hydrogen bonding with kaolinite surface jin et al 2019 since c o cooh and oh groups could be generated on mp surfaces after aging process wang et al 2020a ding et al 2020 hydrogen bonding interaction would also be involved between antibiotics and oxygenated mp surfaces therefore aged mps with oxygenated groups might serve as a new matrix for adsorption and subsequent transformation of commonly used antibiotics which has not yet been reported before cephalosporins are representatives of semi synthetic β lactam antibiotics which are widely applied to human and animals as high priority antimicrobials ribeiro et al 2018 the detection of cephalosporins has been reported in various aqueous matrices e g surface water coastal water sewage and wastewater within concentrations of 0 30 ng l 1 to 0 03 mg l 1 ribeiro et al 2018 despite these compounds readily undergo rapid hydrolytic and photolytic reactions in aquatic matrices under environmentally relevant conditions half life values ranging from days to weeks wang and lin 2012 jiang et al 2010 interestingly the transformation products of cephalosporins exhibit greater toxicity towards aquatic organisms e g vibrio fischeri and daphnia magna wang and lin 2012 kim et al 2017 and stronger persistence than the parental compounds ribeiro et al 2018 for instance the photo degradation products of cefazolin cfz exhibited greater photo stability and acute toxicity which could be possibly attributed to its 5 methyl 1 3 4 thiadiazole 2 thiol moiety wang and lin 2012 the strong hydrophilicity of this β lactam drug might render the interaction with aged mps containing polar oxygenated functional groups which might change its transformation process via surface catalyzed reaction the objectives of this study are i to explore the changes in physiochemical properties of mps induced by photo irradiation in the aquatic environment ii to investigate the impacts of aged mps on the adsorption and transformation of cephalosporin antibiotics iii to reveal the catalytic degradation mechanism of cephalosporin pharmaceuticals by aged mps pvc mp was applied due to the vast production in china liu et al 2020 moreover the detection of pvc mps has been reported in various matrices including soil sediment and water yan et al 2019 tan et al 2019 uv treatment was used to obtain the aged pvc mps as prior studies reported that uv irradiation ozone treatment and advanced oxidation could be employed to simulate the aging processes of mps in the environments liu et al 2019a tian et al 2017 decker and balandier 1982 cefazolin cfz and cephalexin cfx were chosen as the model cephalosporin antibiotics with nephrotoxic properties as indicated by animal and human tests zhanel 1990 and their molecular structures are shown in fig 1 our experimental results provide the first evidence for the transformation of β lactam antibiotics catalyzed by mps under environmentally relevant conditions which would increase the attention on the aging processes of mps and shed light on the environmental behaviors of organic contaminants associated with mps 2 materials and methods chemicals pvc particles with the diameter of 1 µm were purchased from guanbu tech shanghai china cfz

detailed information on the analysis of mass spectrometry is provided in supporting information text s1 batch adsorption experiments the adsorption of cfz on pristine and aged pvc mps followed a standard batch equilibrium method for each adsorption experiment 10 0 mg pvc mp particles were added into a glass centrifuge tube containing 10 0 ml cfz solution with the initial concentrations ranging from 1 0 to 104 9 µm the solution ph was adjusted to ph 7 by adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solutions prior to the addition of mp particles the centrifuge tubes were placed in a rotary shaker 200 rpm is rdvi crystal usa and shaken at 25 c for 12 h in the dark and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min no significant loss resulting from degradation or adsorption to glassware during the adsorption process was observed as indicated by the recovery of 95 the concentration of cfz in the supernatant was measured using the same hplc method as mentioned above the amount of cfz adsorbed on pvc mp particles was calculated by the difference between the cfz concentrations in blank no pvc mps and in supernatant from the sample containing adsorbent similar experiments were conducted to determine the adsorption isotherm of cfx on pristine and aged pvc mps theoretical calculations gaussian 09 w program frisch et al 2009 with density function theory dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to optimize the geometrical structures of cfz and cfx the same method was also applied to investigate the geometrical and chemical properties of pristine and aged pvc six monomers was employed to simplify the structure of pvc for the calculation of gaussian simulation wang et al 2020a hamed mashhadzadeh et al 2017 in addition the binary systems composed of cephalosporin antibiotics and pristine aged pvc polymers were simulated by dft calculations i e cfz pvcpristine cfz pvcaged cfx pvcpristine and cfx pvcaged on the basis of optimized geometries mulliken charges and frontier molecular orbitals i e the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were calculated to elucidate the underlying degradation mechanism induced by aged pvc mps moreover the transition states of cephalosporin degradation in the presence or absence of aged pvc mps were determined to obtain the activation energy the 6 31 g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of cfz cfx and pvc i e c h o n s and cl the effects of common water quality factors on the transformation and adsorption of cephalosporins in the presence of pvc mps the effects of coexisting ions and nom on the transformation and adsorption of cfz and cfx in the presence of pristine and aged pvc mps were investigated by adding nacl 1 0 mm cacl2 1 0 mm na2so4 1 0 mm srfa 10 mg l 1 and srha 10 mg l 1 respectively sampling and analysis of cfz and cfx were performed according to the methods described above 3 results and discussion characterization of pristine and aged pvc mps as shown in fig 2 a and b a uniform and glossy surface was observed for pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv while the photo aged pvc mps appeared harsh and uneven fig 2c fig 2d e and f showed the digital images of water droplets on the pvc mp disks the respective θw values of pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv were calculated as 113 0 and 110 5 suggesting that the surface of pristine polymer exhibited strong hydrophobicity fig 2d and e after photo treatment a significant decrease in θw value was obtained θw 10 0 indicating greater water affinity of pvcaged particles fig 2f similar results were also reported in our recent studies that an increase of hydrophilicity was observed for the aged mp surfaces wang et al 2020a liu et al 2019a in addition to surface morphology uv irradiation also showed a significant impact on the specific surface areas as indicated by the bet results as listed in table s2 the bet surface areas were 77 5 77 9 and 89 2 m2 g 1 for pvcpristine pvcaged no uv and pvcaged respectively therefore the photo aging process could increase the surface areas by changing the surface morphologies of pvc mp pellets which was also consistent with the results of sem images fig 2a b and c the surface structure of pvc mp powders was further investigated by the ftir spectroscopy as illustrated in fig 2g h and i the peaks of pristine pvc mps at 616 694 835 960 1255 1335 1430 and 2950 cm 1 were assigned to ccl stretching in pvc syndiotactic sequence ccl stretching in isotactic sequence ch2 rocking trans ch wagging ch rocking ch2 deformation ch deformation and ch stretching respectively quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 for comparison after uv treatment three absorption bands at 1610 1725 and 3450 cm 1 appeared which corresponded to c c c o and oh stretching vibrations respectively rajendran and uma 2001 similar results were also reported in the previous studies that c c c o and oh moieties could be formed after artificial and natural aging of pvc plastics in the presence of water wang et al 2020a real et al 2005 the carbonyl index ci is commonly served as an indicator for plastic aging degree which was calculated by dividing the intensity of carbonyl by the methylene peak intensity i e 1725 1430 for pvc shi et al 2008 the ci value was calculated as 0 65 indicating that the aged pvc mps were at the advanced oxidative stage ter halle et al 2016 furthermore ft iris images were collected to visualize the relative intensities of newly occurring functional groups in pristine and altered pvc mps the signal intensities of ftir characteristic peaks were reflected by the color in ft iris images which increased as the color varied from blue to pink as shown in the insets of fig 2g h and i blue color was observed for c c c o and oh peaks of pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv while red and pink colors were obtained for pvcaged particles suggesting a great amount of alkene and oxygen containing moieties produced on pvc mp surface after uv irradiation in addition the xps technique was used to perform elemental analysis of the pvc mp powders as illustrated in fig 2j k and l when exposed to uv irradiation an increase in o1s peak and a decrease in cl2p peak were observed while negligible change was obtained for c1s intensity to quantitatively assess the aging degree of pvc mps the percentages of elements i e c cl and o in pristine and aged pvc mps were determined as listed in table s3 the percentage of cl atoms decreased from 22 06 to 13 09 after aging for 5 d and an increase from 2 74 to 11 85 for o atoms furthermore the chlorine to carbon cl c and oxygen to carbon o c ratios were calculated to describe the aging degrees of pvc mps liu et al 2019a the cl c and o c values were 0 29 and 0 04 for both pvcpristine and pvcaged no uv while 0 17 and 0 16 for pvcaged respectively table s3 degradation of cfz and cfx in the presence of pristine and aged pvc mps as shown in fig 3 a bare cfz underwent slight degradation with the removal ratio of 19 8 at neutral ph after 7 d and the presence of pvcpristine didn t promote the degradation process even showing somewhat inhibition effect with lower removal ratio 16 3 fig 3b similar phenomena were also observed for cfz decomposition when lower concentrations of pristine pvc mps existed figure s2a however when photo aged pvc mps were added into cfz solution significant enhancement for cfz degradation 44 2 was observed fig 3c as listed in table s4 all the degradation kinetic data were well fitted by pseudo first order kinetic model and the reaction rate constant kobs was calculated as 3 4 10 3 h 1 for photo aged pvc mps which was 2 6 and 3 4 times higher than those for cfz itself and pvcpristine respectively moreover the significant enhancement in cfz degradation was also obtained in the presence of 10 mg l 1 pvcaged figure s2b indicating that catalytic degradation of cfz by the aged pvc mps would possibly occur in the natural aquatic environment leusch and ziajahromi 2021 yan et al 2019 interestingly pvcaged showed no significant enhancement for the degradation of cfx which possesses similar core structure as cfz as illustrated in figure s3 cfx itself decomposed with the degradation ratio of 24 4 after 7 d and the reaction rate constant was fitted to be 1 5 10 3 h 1 table s4 no significant difference in the degradation rate constants was obtained for cfx pvcpristine kobs 1 3 10 3 h 1 and cfx pvcaged kobs 1 4 10 3 h 1 reaction systems figure s3 and table s4 therefore the aged pvc mps exhibited great potential to catalyze the hydrolysis of cfz but no effects on the removal of cfx this might be ascribed to the difference in molecular structures of cfz and cfx e g functional groups attached to the core structure of cephalosporin antibiotics 7 aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid which subsequently led to the varied intermolecular interactions between β lactam antibiotics and pvcaged surfaces more discussion for the degradation mechanism was provided below the enhanced transformation route of cfz was further investigated by identifying the reaction product comparing the retention times of standards and the detected daughter product in the hplc chromatogram the peaks at 6 55 and 4 25 min corresponded to cfz and cfzhydrolyzed respectively figure s4 moreover cfz h and cfzhydrolyzed h were identified by the hplc ms system with the respective mass charge ratios of 455 04 456 04 457 04 and 473 05 474 05 475 05 figure s5 confirming the generation of cfzhydrolyzed furthermore a good mass balance of 95 was obtained by quantification of residual cfz and generated cfzhydrolyzed fig 3 therefore hydrolysis at the β lactam ring is the dominant transformation pathway of cfz under neutral ph condition which could be catalyzed by the aged pvc mps adsorption of cfz and cfx on pristine and altered pvc mps to obtain further insights into the underlying mechanism the adsorption of cfz and cfx on pristine and aged pvc mps was investigated considering the decomposition of cfz and cfx during the adsorption period the adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted within 12 h during which negligible degradation of β lactam antibiotics was observed in the presence of pvcpristine and pvcaged figs 3 and s3 as shown in fig 4 a the adsorption isotherms of cfz on pvc mps followed the langmuir model suggesting the occurrence of monolayer adsorption on the mp surface liu et al 2019a as listed in table s5 the fitted maximum adsorption amounts of cfz on pvc mps qmax µmol g 1 were 8 11 and 23 98 µmol g 1 for pvcpristine and pvcaged respectively the higher adsorption of cfz on photo altered pvc mps could be attributed to the higher surface area and greater quantity of the oxygen containing moieties on the mp surfaces which would provide more reactive sites for cfz molecules and might explain the enhanced hydrolytic rate of the β lactam antibiotic similarly for cfx the qmax values were also calculated as 7 58 and 10 36 µmol g 1 for pvcpristine and pvcaged respectively indicating that greater adsorption capacity of cfx was obtained for the aged pvc mps fig 4b and table s6 in situ ftir analysis the in situ ftir spectroscopy was employed to investigate the interactions between cfz cfx and pristine or aged pvc mp particles our recent study explored the transformation of penicillin antibiotics on zinc adsorbed goethite and concluded that the specific complexation interactions as evidenced by ftir spectrum could accelerate the hydrolytic degradation rate of penicillin by 3 orders of magnitude sheng et al 2019 therefore the surface interaction mode might play an important role in promoting the transformation process of cephalosporin antibiotics in the presence of pvc mps as shown in fig 5 the absorption bands of cfz at 1247 1386 1599 1697 and 1765 cm 1 were assigned to the bending vibration of cn in β lactam ring vcn bend symmetric stretching mode of carboxyl group vcoo sym asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxyl vcoo as stretching mode of carbonyl in amide group vc o ami and stretching vibration of carbonyl in the β lactam ring vc o respectively sheng et al 2019 rechelo et al 2019 in the presence of pristine pvc mp particles only a blue shift for vcn bend was observed in the cfz spectrum fig 5a while compared to the original pvc mps for the system with pvcaged powders the intensities of cfz characteristic peaks were significantly enhanced for vcn bend vcoo sym vcoo as vc o ami and vc o especially for vcoo as and vc o fig 5b which could be ascribed to the greater adsorption of β lactam pharmaceuticals on the aged pvc mps fig 4 furthermore red shifts for carbonyl peaks of cfz were obtained as pvcaged powders existed as shown in fig 5b the peak of vc o was broadened and red shifted upon cfz adsorption compared to the spectrum of cfz in aqueous solution indicating the involvement of hydrogen bonding forces between β lactam carbonyl and pvcaged hydroxyl fig 5b the interfacial interactions between pristine aged pvc mp surfaces and cfx were also investigated by monitoring the in situ ftir spectra as indicated in figure s6 the characteristic peaks at 1755 1588 1500 and 1394 cm 1 were assigned to vc o vnh bend amide nh bending vibration vcoo as and vcoo sym respectively agnihotri et al 2006 by comparison with the results of cfz no significant shifts were obtained for vc o while a blue shift of 34 cm 1 occurred for vnh bend absorption band in the ftir spectrum of cfx pvcaged this suggested that hydrogen bonding was involved in the intermolecular interactions between the secondary amine of cfx and carbonyl of pvcaged similar results were also reported by wang et al that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction was able to induce a significant blue shift in the hoh bending mode of water molecule wang et al 2020b despite both cfz and cfx could form hydrogen bonding with aged pvc mp surfaces significant difference was obtained in the binding sites which might be responsible for the varied catalytic activity of pvcaged for the degradation of cfz and cfx to further elucidate the underlying mechanism theoretical calculations were performed to provide evidence for the catalytic degradation of cephalosporin antibiotics on the surfaces of pvc mps the binary systems i e cfz pvcaged and cfx pvcaged were simulated and optimized based on the intermolecular binding sites as indicated by the results of in situ ftir spectra figure s7a showed the simulated molecular structures of pristine pvc mp composed of six vinyl chloride monomers while alkene hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were added to the carbon skeleton of pvcaged polymer figure s7b the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between pvcaged and β lactam antibiotic molecules changed the distribution of frontier molecular electron cloud as indicated by visualization of homo and lumo orbitals figures s8 and s9 in the case of bare cfz homo orbital was mostly located on the thiadiazole and thiazine rings and dispersedly distributed on the β lactam ring while lumo orbital was mainly on the thiazine and β lactam rings figure s8 similar results were also obtained for cfz pvcpristine binary system figure s10 indicating that pristine pvc mps showed negligible effect on the electron cloud distribution of cfz due to the weak van der waals force compared to the frontier molecular orbitals of cfz only and cfz pvcpristine in the cfz pvcaged system lumo orbital transferred from cfz molecule to the aged pvc polymer which could be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between β lactam antibiotic molecules and aged pvc mps moreover the variation of frontier molecular orbitals is commonly accompanied by the changes of bond lengths and atomic charges li et al 2015 as shown in figure s11 the bond lengths of c o 19c 20o increased by 0 01 å due to the hydrogen bonding interaction between cfz and aged pvc polymer which was consistent with the red shift of vc o peak fig 5 on the other hand the intermolecular hydrogen bonding could increase the positive charge of the carbonyl carbon atom in the β lactam ring i e 19c from 0 563 to 0 579 figures s8 and s9 which was reported to facilitate the h2o induced nucleophilic attack jin et al 2019 furthermore based on the optimized transition states of cfz hydrolysis by h2o attack figures s12 s14 the hydrolytic activation energy of cfz coexisting with pvcaged and a h2o molecule cfz pvcaged h2o 177 2 kj mol 1 was significantly lowered than that of bare cfz with a h2o molecule cfz h2o 239 7 kj mol 1 and that of cfz pvcpristine h2o ternary system 250 5 kj mol 1 fig 6 therefore our theoretical calculation results provided more convincing evidence for the enhanced hydrolysis of cfz by the aged pvc mps for comparison frontier molecular orbitals were also calculated for cfx as shown in figures s8 and s10 both homo and lumo orbitals were mainly distributed around thiazine and β lactam rings for cfx only and cfx pvcpristine systems when cfx was hydrogen bonded to the aged pvc mps the homo and lumo orbitals moved to the benzene ring and pvcaged chain respectively figure s9 while only a slight increase of 0 002 was obtained for the positive mulliken charge of β lactam carbonyl carbon atom i e 7c figures s8 and s9 comparing with cfz stronger electron donating moieties containing phenyl and amino groups were attached to the core structure of cephalosporin pharmaceuticals figure s8 qian et al 2018 as a result the electron cloud density on the amide nitrogen atom was increased as indicated by the distribution of frontier molecular orbitals figure s8 moreover as the electronegativity is positively correlated with electron cloud density and atoms with greater electronegativity are more facile to form hydrogen bonding ghosh and islam 2011 thus the amino group of cfx amide would exhibit great potential to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety on the aged pvc mp surface which has been confirmed by the results of in situ ftir spectra as discussed above as shown in figures s8 s10 the hydrogen bonding significantly changed the mulliken charges on the atoms directly involved e g n while little effect was obtained for the positive atomic charge of β lactam carbonyl carbon furthermore different from cfz both pvcpristine and pvcaged showed negligible effects on the hydrolytic activation energy of cfx figure s15 which is supported by the optimized transition states of cfx upon being attacked by a h2o molecule figure s16 s18 therefore the structure dependent hydrogen bonding mode might be responsible for the negligible effect of aged pvc mps on the degradation of cfx impacts of ions and nom on the decomposition of cephalosporin antibiotics figure s19 showed the effects of coexisting ions and nom on the degradation kinetics of cfz in the absence and presence of pvc mps and degradation rate constants of cfz were fitted with pseudo first order model as listed in tables s4 and s7 common ions i e na ca2 cl and so4 2 and nom i e srfa and srha exhibited great potential to promote the degradation of cfz in bare cfz and cfz pvcpristine binary system which is consistent with the results reported by jiang et al 2010 that cephalosporin antibiotics underwent faster degradation in sterilized natural water than in distilled water for cfz pvcaged system the presence of cations and anions was able to suppress the catalytic degradation of cfz by pvcaged while srfa and srha strengthened the catalytic effects as shown in figures s20 the adsorption of cfz on pvcaged was strongly restrained in the presence of common cations and anions due to the inhibition of intermolecular hydrogen bondind yang et al 2012 while nom just slightly decreased the adsorbed amounts as it might compete for the hydrogen bonding sites on the pvcaged surface with cfz this suggested that the contribution of ions and nom to the adsorption of cfz on the aged pvc mps played significant role in the surface catalytic degradation of cephalosporin antibiotics similarly both ions and nom were able to slightly increase the degradation rates of cfx figure s21 tables s4 and s7 but inhibit the adsorption amounts of cfx on the aged pvc mps figure s20 4 conclusion our results clearly demonstrate that the aged pvc mps exhibit great potential to catalyze the hydrolysis of cephalosporin antibiotics under environmentally relevant conditions while the catalytic effects are strongly dependent on the electron donating ability of functional groups attached to the core structure of cephalosporin molecules pvcaged showed enhanced adsorption capacity for both cfz and cfx via forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds with cephalosporin antibiotics however the altered pvc mps exhibited enhancement for hydrolysis of cfz but negligible effects on the degradation of cfx which might be explained by different hydrogen bonding sites of cephalosporin pharmaceuticals with aged pvc mp surface by comparison with cfx cfz possesses weaker electron donating moieties attached to the cephalosporin core structure which could strengthen the hydrogen bonding potential of β lactam carbonyl and weaken the ability of amide nitrogen to form hydrogen bonds as evidenced by the in situ ftir spectra theoretical calculations further confirm that direct hydrogen bonding to β lactam carbonyl could significantly increase the positive charge on carbon atom of β lactam carbonyl thus lowering the hydrolytic energy gap of cfz since both naturally aged pvc mps and cephalosporin pharmaceuticals are widely distributed in aquatic environments it is reasonable that other β lactam antibiotics could undergo a similar hydrolytic reaction the novel role of pvcaged in the transformation pathway of antibiotics improves our understanding for the environmental behavior of various mps distributed in the various environmental matrices declaration of competing interest

16548,algal bloom species can live upon internal regenerated ammonium nh4 for growth during the nitrogen limited period however the linkages between nh4 regeneration and phytoplankton biomass and community composition dynamics remain largely unknown to unravel the interactions between nh4 regeneration and phytoplankton community we measured water column nh4 regeneration rates regs during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer winter turnover in eutrophic lake taihu measured regs were higher in summer than in winter and significantly correlated to total phytoplankton biomass cyanophyta biomass and its biomass proportions and the concentrations of particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon as well as the relative abundance of labile components proteins and lipids random forest regression analyses displayed that variation of regs were mainly controlled by water temperature and algal related parameters including chlorophyll a total phytoplankton biomass and cyanophyta biomass partial least squares path model further revealed that algal related parameters were the direct and significant factors regulating regs and contributed to the largest effect of the variance in regs of the algal community cyanophyta was the dominant phylum to accelerate regs correspondingly rapid internal nh4 turnover may strongly support the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms thus forming a positive feedback between cyanobacterial blooms and regs during the nitrogen limited summer months we therefore deduced that the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs during summer may be a key self maintenance mechanism of continuous cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium regeneration cyanobacterial blooms phytoplankton community organic matter self maintenance eutrophic lakes 1 introduction eutrophication and algal blooms have increased in frequency magnitude and duration globally since the 1980s in aquatic ecosystems huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 and this is linked to substantial increase of nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs resulting from rapid industries agriculture and population development liu and diamond 2005 michalak et al 2013 the annual cycle of cyanobacteria dominated blooms in most temperate lakes is mainly triggered and regulated by water temperature recruitment at 11 14 c in spring and dormancy at lower than 10 c in winter yang et al 2020 while the interannual variation is mainly related to the nutrient load conley et al 2009 controlling p loading has traditionally been considered as the primary measure to curb the further proliferation of harmful algal blooms schindler et al 2008 michalak et al 2013 however studies in some inland waters showed that only reducing p is no longer adequate and n is often the main factor limiting algae growth in summer and fall months paerl et al 2011 lewis et al 2011 therefore additional bioavailable n ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and some organic n are required to sustain blooms during n limited periods surprisingly decades of extensive abatement efforts and steadily declined nh4 concentration in waters have not stopped the occurrence of algal blooms qin et al 2019 ma et al 2020 rapid n supply process internal n especially nh4 regeneration in waters has been proved to play an increasingly important role in sustaining algal blooms jiang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 systematically understanding nh4 regeneration rates regs and the potential driving factors thus have important implications for nutrient management during the past few decades the regulation of regs by organic matter dissolved organic carbon doc n concentrations and microbial properties microbial abundance and composition has been studied intensively gardner et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 isobe et al 2020 organic nitrogen protein humic and fulvic substances can be decomposed into soluble low weight n containing organic matter such as amino acid urea polypeptide nucleic acid by heterotrophic microbes and then is hydrolyzed to nh4 and provide for the phytoplankton glibert 1982 bronk et al 2007 despite many studies conducted thus far our understanding of the main driving factors of regs under the background of continued algal blooms in eutrophic waters is still inadequate encouragingly some researchers have now begun to focus on the effect of algae biomass on regs a research in the west florida shelf showed that the coastal areas with karenia had regs three fold higher than that without karenia present bronk et al 2014 in addition the research in eutrophic lake taihu found a significant positive correlation between regs and chlorophyll a concentration a proxy for algal biomass jiang et al 2019 these studies provide a basic understanding of the potential relationship between algal biomass and regs however major changes in phytoplankton community composition may occur during algal blooms in different seasons and aquatic ecosystems and the effect of phytoplankton community composition dynamics on regs gets less attention cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta cryptophyta pyrrophyta and euglenophyta are common algal groups in freshwater ecosystems and cyanobacteria often dominant the total biomass amorim and moura 2021 n fixing traits and gas vesicles contained in some bloom forming cyanobacterial bacteria provide cyanobacteria a distinct competitive advantage over other phytoplankton in the water huisman et al 2018 during the blooms different algal taxa may produce organic matter with varying characteristics henderson et al 2008 used doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva zeta potential charge density hydrophobicity protein and carbohydrate content molecular weight and fluorescence to characterize the characteristics of dissolved organic matter derived from four different algal species some studies also revealed the important role of phytoplankton community composition in affecting water quality such as ph and nutrient concentration amorim and moura 2021 which are related to regs moreover changes of phytoplankton community often cause a cascade of changes in the diversity and composition of bacterioplankton community huisman et al 2018 woodhouse et al 2016 which can markedly impact regs in the water column due to the interactive effects of phytoplankton community organic matter nutrient and microbial community on regs a comprehensive study of regs together with these potential factors is highly needed in this study phytoplankton biomass and community composition organic matter components optical and molecular composition and regs during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer winter turnover in eutrophic lake taihu where is experiencing a continuous proliferation of cyanobacteria dominated blooms were investigated to identify the key indictors in regulating regs fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms fluorescence and absorption spectra measurements were used to evaluate the composition of organic nitrogen we hypothesize that phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria biomass would be the key indicator to regulate internal nh4 regeneration and the strong interactions between cyanobacteria and regs may be the key mechanism of sustaining cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effect of algal biomass and community composition on the types of organic matter and organic nitrogen 2 measure the regs associated with the organic nitrogen composition and 3 reveal how regenerated nh4 supports the continuous dominance of cyanobacteria blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake taihu 30 05 32 08 n 119 08 121 55 e the third largest freshwater lake in china is located in the yangtze river delta the most urbanized area in china with high population density and economic development it is a large surface area 2338 km2 shallow mean depth 1 9 m eutrophic lake with the average water retention time of 300 days zhang et al 2009 excess input of nutrients has led to the deterioration of water quality eutrophication and frequent cyanobacterial blooms a multi annual climate warming trend on aquatic ecosystems advanced the bloom start dates prolonged the bloom period and amplified its

methods isotope dilution experiments are often conducted with low trace amendment level about 10 of ambient nh4 glibert et al 1982 yet the low nh4 concentrations and fast nh4 recycling rates of lake taihu may lead to depleted nh4 pool before final sampling blackburn 1979 excess 15nh4 approximately 10 μmol n l 1 as the reaction product rather than as a potentially limiting substrate was added at the beginning of incubation mccarthy et al 2007 water samples from each site were amended with 98 15nh4cl and partitioned into triplicate clear polystyrene culture bottles 70 ml coring after thoroughly mixed initial samples were filtered through a rinsed 0 2 μm syringe filter immediately after enrichment and mixing and frozen until analysis the remaining 15nh4cl amended water samples were incubated near the surface in a floating frame suspended off a pier at meiliang bay to provide natural light and water temperature comparable with in situ condition at the end of 24 h incubation samples were collected filtered and frozen in the same way as the initial sample until analysis to measure the nh4 concentration and isotopic composition of final samples the regs were calculated using a modified isotope dilution method glibert et al 1982 blackburn 1979 the relative abundance of nh4 15n r was required to calculation the regs which can be calculated as follows r 15 n 15 n 14 n where 15n and 14n were the concentrations of nh4 15n and nh4 14n μmol n l 1 respectively the regs can be calculated as follows bruesewitz et al 2015 which is derived from the logarithmic equations of blackburn 1979 r e g r 0 r t t c 0 r t where r0 and rt are the relative abundances of nh4 15n at the initial and final point respectively and t is the incubation time h c0 is the initial concentration of nh4 μmol n l 1 regs μmol n l 1 h 1 are absolutely positive values indicating the actual regeneration rates of nh4 2 4 phytoplankton community composition and biomass phytoplankton species were identified according to hu and wei 2006 and were identified and quantified at the genus level algal cell volume was calculated from cell numbers and cell size measurements the volume values were converted to biomass based on the assumption that 1 mm3 of volume was equivalent to 1 mg of fresh weight biomass liu et al 2011 2 5 fluorescence and absorption spectra measurements fluorescence

relationship between regs and physicochemical characteristics phytoplankton community biomass fluorescent components and absorption indices in the water column then we explored the key predictors for regs using random forest regression analyses and the analyses were conducted using the randomforest package in r mean square error mse is used to evaluate the importance of variable in addition rfpermute package was applied to evaluate the significance of each predictor for regs and a3 package was applied to calculate the significance with 1000 permutations of the response variables partial least squares path model pls pm was further used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the factors on the regs this model can partition the direct and indirect effects of one variable on

chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cryptophyta were the dominant phytoplankton in lake taihu with only a few pyrrophyta and euglenophyta fig 2 the biomass of phytoplankton was higher in summer 1 04 19 7 mg l 1 than in winter 0 39 1 57 mg l 1 p 0 01 and note that the phytoplankton community composition in zhushan bay s7 was absent in summer because the sample was damaged during the measurement of the algal community cyanophyta typically dominated in most areas of lake taihu such as meiliang bay s1 s2 and southwest coastal area s4 s8 in summer and open lake area s3 s10 in winter in monthly samples total phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0 55 to 6 89 mg l 1 and cyanophyta dominated from june to october except for the mid july and august while cryptophyta dominated in other months 3 2 nh4 regeneration rates in our study regs in all water samples collected from lake taihu ranged from 0 03 to 1 84 μmol n l 1 h 1 in summer the regs had relatively high values from meiliang bay to open lake area s1 s2 s3 s9 s10 with an average of 1 33 0 22 μmol n l 1 h 1 while the relatively low values were observed in xukou bay s12 and east taihu bay s11 macrophytes dominated zones fig 3 in addition zhushan bay s7 and southwest coastal area s4 s5 s8 were also active areas for nh4 regeneration compared to the gonghu bay s6 in winter regs was significantly lower than that in summer p 0 01 the highest reg was found in meiliang bay s2 and the lowest was located in xukou bay s12 fig 3 similar to the spatial distribution pattern in summer in monthly samples extremely high regs were found at

three component c1 3 model was established fig s2 the spectral characteristics of the three components were compared with parafac results for samples collected from other ecosystems by openfluor which is an online spectral library murphy et al 2014 c1 had an excitation emission ex em maxima at 325 419 nm which was thought to correspond to anthropogenic humic like material liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 c2 displayed single ex and em maxima at 280 nm 326 nm respectively which was categorized as a protein like material liu et al 2019 stedmon et al 2007 c3 exhibited two ex maxima at 275 and 380 nm and an em maximum 471 nm similar to those of terrestrially derived humic material liu et al 2019 protein like c2 dominated the fluorescence composition representing 53 7 10 3 of dom fluorescence in the collected samples while the anthropogenic humic like component c1 and terrestrially derived humic c3 accounted for 27 4 5 7 and 18 8 4 7 respectively of the three components table s1 in addition suva values were higher in winter 2 93 0 65 l mg 1 m 1 than in summer 2 11 0 50 l mg 1 m 1 p 0 01 table s1 in monthly samples the lowest suva was found at the end of june 1 16 l mg 1 m 1 as the sampling time point of the highest regs and then suva increased gradually and reached the highest value in december 4 02 l mg 1 m 1 fig 2e samples collected from meiliang bay in summer and winter exhibited 2690 and 1635 n containing molecular formulae respectively fig 4 fig s3 van krevelen diagrams were used to characterize the molecular composition of don in summer and winter protein and lipid compounds which typically represent the bulk of labile don pool lusk and toor 2016 accounted in total relative abundance of n containing molecular formulae for 12 in summer and were higher than in winter 6 table s2 in comparison the percentage of refractory lignin tannins and condensed aromatics was higher in winter 92 than in summer 86 3 4 potential indicators of regs four statistical methods including spearman rank correlation analysis random forest regression analyses pls pm and pca were used to discern the key indicator of regs in lake taihu spearman rank correlation analysis showed that regs were significantly positive correlated with wt ph chl a pn doc don tdn pn tn doc don total phytoplankton biomass c1 c2 and c3 while significantly negative correlated with do tdn nox tn tp suva fig s4 random forest regression analyses revealed that wt and algal related parameters including chl a total phytoplankton biomass and cyanophyta biomass were the key indicators for regs fig 5 a pls pm further revealed that algal related parameters were the direct and significant factors regulated regs while pn and c2 had a direct but non significant effect on regs fig 5b in addition algal related parameters exerted an indirect effect on the regs through its direct effects on pn c2 and doc the combination of algal related parameters pn c2 doc and suva explained 59 6 of the variance in the regs and algal related parameters had the largest effect fig s5 the pca revealed that the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained approximately 61 5 of the variance with pc1 accounting for 41 9 of the variance and pc2 accounting for 19 6 of the variance fig 5c the winter and summer samples grouped in two distinct areas with respect to pc1 x axis with winter samples grouping in positive pc1 summer samples grouping in negative pc1 and monthly samples connected with the winter and summer samples fig 5c this separation displayed by pc1 appears to be strongly influenced by seasonal and algal blooms differences with the variables wt ph doc chl a total phytoplankton biomass cyanophyta biomass pn and protein like c2 grouping apart from a variable cluster that includes nutrients nox nh4 and don do and suva indicating that pc1 was negative related to the algal related parameters regs in this study decreased with increasing pc1 scores fig 5d taken together these four statistical analyses indicated that algal blooms were the key factor regulating regs in eutrophic lake taihu 4 discussion 4 1 effect of algal blooms on regs based on multiple analysis and statistical methods our study suggested that algal blooms characterized by chl a concentration and phytoplankton biomass were the key indicator of internal nh4 regeneration in eutrophic lake fig 5 regs increased with the concentrations of chl a and phytoplankton biomass but decreased with suva fig 2e fig s4 phytoplankton are a main organic matter producer during algal blooms period zhang et al 2009 gao et al 2021 moreover the algae produced organic matter is biologically labile nguyen et al 2005 the higher chl a concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in summer than in winter can produce the higher proportions of labile organic n such as proteins and lipids fig 4 table s2 which can be easily used by ammonifiers and release nh4 into water gardner et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 previous studies also showed that after the addition of algal biomass the concentrations of n and doc increased suggesting the decomposing algae are an important nutrient source yan et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 furthermore the concentrations of n and doc were found to be positively correlated with regs in lake taihu jiang et al 2019 therefore the regulation of algal blooms on the regs could be attributed to its potential effects on both the concentration and dynamics of c and n on the one hand algal blooms exerted strong direct impacts on doc and protein like c2 fig 5b leading to the higher doc concentrations and c2 table 1 and table s1 than non algal bloom periods on the other hand algal blooms can also trigger great n especially pn production fig 5b since the accumulation and death of algae can release particulate matter into water and this highly enriched n containing matter was the main source of pn in the water during algal bloom period the decrease in the regs with suva could be due to its aromaticity and terrigenous characteristics previous studies have suggested that suva increase with increasing dom aromaticity zhou et al 2020 luzius et al 2018 the higher suva in winter than in summer and the opposite trend between suva and algal biomass fig 2e table s1 indicated that increasing phytoplankton coincided with a decrease in the suva cheng and chi 2003 this was further supported by the fact that the total relative abundance of refractory don ligning tannins and condensed aromatics is higher in winter 92 than summer 86 table s2 compared with fresh and labile algal dom the complex molecular structure of aromatic dom can hinder the breakdown of n containing dom to access available n hertkorn et al 2006 the lack of available n further constrained regs in our study area furthermore oxidized aromatic organic matter is preferentially removed in the degradation process whereas the reduced aliphatic and n containing organic matter is either resistant to degradation or tightly recycled and thus persist in the lake systems kellerman et al 2015 therefore high suva could inhibit regs through their constraints on organic n availability and persistence in addition to the effects of algal blooms on the concentration and dynamics of c n and the liability of dom the effects of algal blooms on the physicochemical factors can also control regs algal blooms especially cyanobacterial blooms have been verified to promote the increase of ph amorim and moura 2021 and ph may influence the regs by affecting the population of total bacteria isobe et al 2015 our study verified that ph was significantly positively correlated with regs fig s4 reflecting that change of ph caused by algal blooms can indirectly affect regs do was negative correlated with regs fig s4 because algal decomposition accelerated do exhaustion and nh4 release 4 2 interactions between cyanobacteria and regs although above results demonstrated the important role of algal blooms in regulating the regs the contribution of various algal species to regs is still unclear our study further suggested that cyanobacteria interacted strongly with regs in lake taihu this is supported by the high concentration and proportion of cyanophyta biomass significant correlations and high correlation coefficient between the concentration and proportion of cyanophyta biomass and regs fig 6 fig s6 cyanobacteria especially non n2 fixing cyanobacteria often dominates the algal community in summer and fall months of eutrophic systems such as lake taihu bambini junior et al 2014 paerl et al 2011 the high concentration and proportion of cyanobacteria biomass could regulate regs through cyanobacteria derived organic matter and cyanobacteria bacteria interactions firstly compared with green algae chlorella vulgaris and diatoms asterionella formosa and melosira sp cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa had the lowest suva while the highest protein doc ratio and protein carbohydrates ratio henderson et al 2008 suggesting the lower aromaticity and higher protein proportion of cyanobacteria derived organic matter this is supported by the positive correlations between cyanophyta and protein like c2 fig 6c indicating cyanobacteria were an important source of protein furthermore the majority of cyanobacteria derived organic matter were assigned to aliphatic formulas patriarca et al 2021 higher cyanobacteria biomass and total relative abundance of lipids in summer than in winter fig 2 table s2 provide rich substrate and energy for ammonifiers secondly compared with eukaryotic algal species prokaryotic cyanobacteria have the ability to supply themselves with the necessary vitamin b12 cobalamin thereby to avoid the restriction of growth croft et al 2005 bertrand et al 2015 in addition cyanobacteria dominated blooms can increase the abundance of organic aggregates provide attachment carriers for microbe and promote the ammonification rate isobe et al 2020 tang et al 2010 given this an increase in the frequency and scale of cyanobacterial blooms have the potential to accelerate regs in lakes interestingly regenerated nh4 also strongly stimulates the blooms of cyanobacteria during n limited summer months paerl et al 2011 swarbrick et al 2019 andersen et al 2020 although low ambient nh4 concentrations the higher nh4 turnover rates the ration of regs and ambient nh4 concentrations in cyanobacteria dominated blooms regions than other algae dominated regions during summer fig 6d likely provide rich nh4 and support the continuous cyanobacteria dominated blooms fig s7 this is because under n limitation cyanobacteria especially non n2 fixing cyanobacteria were often more strongly stimulated by regenerated nh4 while diatoms and cryptophytes may be suppressed by nh4 swarbrick et al 2019 andersen et al 2020 compared with summer the lower wt higher nh4 concentrations lower regs and lower cyanophyta biomass in winter indicated that the external input was enough to support the growth of algae at this time and the contribution of nh4 turnover was small fig s7 in the growing period high ambient n concentrations meet algal growth requirements through winter into spring and as blooms mature and persist during summer to autumn internal regenerated nh4 and rapid nh4 turnover rates tend to become more important for cyanobacteria maintenance fig s7 moreover the lower nitrification rates and higher algae uptake rates in summer suggested that nitrifiers were poor competitors for nh4 during the bloom hampel et al 2018 and internal regenerated nh4 was more directly assimilated by cyanobacteria rather than oxidized to no3 to support the growth of other algae therefore internal regenerated nh4 would favorably facilitate cyanobacteria to become the dominate species and sustaining blooms during the periods of n limitation 4 3 environmental implication of regs in eutrophic lakes based on the former results and discussion on the relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and regs we raised a conceptual model aiming at clarifying how this internal loop was formed and how cyanobacteria could sustain in these eutrophic lakes especially during very low ambient concentration of both nh4 and no3 fig 7 firstly cyanobacteria dominated blooms in summer produced more labile organic matter e g proteins and lipids pn and doc than the algal communities in winter fig 4 table 1 cyanobacteria derived organic matter is the substrate basis for enhanced microbial ammonification and internal nh4 recycling which is proved by the close linkages between protein like c2 and regs as well as the faster regs from ammonification during summer blooms fig s4 fig 3 secondly the regenerated nh4 would be without so much doubt the main n source for phytoplankton during the bloom season when ambient inorganic n concentrations were as low as the minimum limit of detection hampel et al 2018 paerl et al 2011 meanwhile compared to a direct assimilation fate the regenerated nh4 is hardly transformed to no3 by nitrifiers to support no3 favored algal genus typically diatom because nitrification rates were lower than algae uptake rates in these eutrophic lakes hampel et al 2018 and vigorous denitrification would compete for the produced no3 xu et al 2021 low ambient no3 concentrations together with slow no3 supply rates were thus unfavored to diatoms in summer fig 2 in contrast faster turnover rates and shorter recycling pathway provide continuous nh4 for cyanobacteria the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs may be the key self maintenance mechanism of sustaining blooms and will continue to reinforce the dominant position of cyanobacteria in the future lastly this model also implied that internal production rates e g nh4 regeneration vs nitrification would be more important than stoichiometry of ambient concentration e g nh4 vs no3 referring to shape the phytoplankton community composition particularly in the low n but high biomass lakes although nutrient stoichiometry has been persuasively used in many aquatic systems glibert et al 2016 we raise the doubt that these stoichiometry e g n p nh4 no3 may only take effect in the system with low internal recycling rates compared to high nutrients input nutrients pool in addition a multi annual warming trend not only advance the bloom start sates but also promote the proliferate of cyanobacterial blooms shi et al 2019 glibert et al 2016 warming also promotes regs through enhancing the metabolic activity of ammonifiers thus the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs will be further strengthened under the climate warming our study provided a new viewpoint for the continuous cyanobacterial blooms from the perspective of cyanobacterial blooms and nh4 internal recycling frequent cyanobacterial blooms caused by nh4 internal recycling exert adversely effects on ecosystem such as water and habitat degradation biodiversity reduction drinking water supply disruption qin et al 2010 paerl et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to take effective management measures controlling external n inputs is the key step towards the restoration of eutrophic lakes furthermore salvaging algae dense mats during bloom period and surface dredging to remove dead algae could interrupt or alleviate the internal recycling processes for shallow eutrophic lakes frequently suspended sediment was an unneglectable pn source and henceforth induced new internal nh4 source newly sinking algal debris were enriched of high content of labile organic nitrogen which would be another internal nh4 regeneration source we therefore recommend frequent surficial dredging instead of occasional deep dredging to alleviate internal cycling and nh4 favored cyanobacteria 5 conclusion this study investigated the phytoplankton biomass and community composition om components optical and molecular composition and regs during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer winter turnover in eutrophic lake taihu to unravel the interactions of algal community with regs our results highlighted that regs were significantly regulated by algal blooms due to the high proportion of labile organic matter and high concentrations of doc pn protein like components produced by phytoplankton during the summer bloom period of the algal community cyanophyta was the dominant phylum to accelerate regs correspondingly rapid internal nh4 turnover may also strongly stimulate the blooms of cyanobacteria during n limited summer months the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs may be a key self maintenance mechanism of continuous blooms in high eutrophic lakes declaration of competing

16548,algal bloom species can live upon internal regenerated ammonium nh4 for growth during the nitrogen limited period however the linkages between nh4 regeneration and phytoplankton biomass and community composition dynamics remain largely unknown to unravel the interactions between nh4 regeneration and phytoplankton community we measured water column nh4 regeneration rates regs during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer winter turnover in eutrophic lake taihu measured regs were higher in summer than in winter and significantly correlated to total phytoplankton biomass cyanophyta biomass and its biomass proportions and the concentrations of particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon as well as the relative abundance of labile components proteins and lipids random forest regression analyses displayed that variation of regs were mainly controlled by water temperature and algal related parameters including chlorophyll a total phytoplankton biomass and cyanophyta biomass partial least squares path model further revealed that algal related parameters were the direct and significant factors regulating regs and contributed to the largest effect of the variance in regs of the algal community cyanophyta was the dominant phylum to accelerate regs correspondingly rapid internal nh4 turnover may strongly support the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms thus forming a positive feedback between cyanobacterial blooms and regs during the nitrogen limited summer months we therefore deduced that the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs during summer may be a key self maintenance mechanism of continuous cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium regeneration cyanobacterial blooms phytoplankton community organic matter self maintenance eutrophic lakes 1 introduction eutrophication and algal blooms have increased in frequency magnitude and duration globally since the 1980s in aquatic ecosystems huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 and this is linked to substantial increase of nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs resulting from rapid industries agriculture and population development liu and diamond 2005 michalak et al 2013 the annual cycle of cyanobacteria dominated blooms in most temperate lakes is mainly triggered and regulated by water temperature recruitment at 11 14 c in spring and dormancy at lower than 10 c in winter yang et al 2020 while the interannual variation is mainly related to the nutrient load conley et al 2009 controlling p loading has traditionally been considered as the primary measure to curb the further proliferation of harmful algal blooms schindler et al 2008 michalak et al 2013 however studies in some inland waters showed that only reducing p is no longer adequate and n is often the main factor limiting algae growth in summer and fall months paerl et al 2011 lewis et al 2011 therefore additional bioavailable n ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and some organic n are required to sustain blooms during n limited periods surprisingly decades of extensive abatement efforts and steadily declined nh4 concentration in waters have not stopped the occurrence of algal blooms qin et al 2019 ma et al 2020 rapid n supply process internal n especially nh4 regeneration in waters has been proved to play an increasingly important role in sustaining algal blooms jiang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 systematically understanding nh4 regeneration rates regs and the potential driving factors thus have important implications for nutrient management during the past few decades the regulation of regs by organic matter dissolved organic carbon doc n concentrations and microbial properties microbial abundance and composition has been studied intensively gardner et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 isobe et al 2020 organic nitrogen protein humic and fulvic substances can be decomposed into soluble low weight n containing organic matter such as amino acid urea polypeptide nucleic acid by heterotrophic microbes and then is hydrolyzed to nh4 and provide for the phytoplankton glibert 1982 bronk et al 2007 despite many studies conducted thus far our understanding of the main driving factors of regs under the background of continued algal blooms in eutrophic waters is still inadequate encouragingly some researchers have now begun to focus on the effect of algae biomass on regs a research in the west florida shelf showed that the coastal areas with karenia had regs three fold higher than that without karenia present bronk et al 2014 in addition the research in eutrophic lake taihu found a significant positive correlation between regs and chlorophyll a concentration a proxy for algal biomass jiang et al 2019 these studies provide a basic understanding of the potential relationship between algal biomass and regs however major changes in phytoplankton community composition may occur during algal blooms in different seasons and aquatic ecosystems and the effect of phytoplankton community composition dynamics on regs gets less attention cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta cryptophyta pyrrophyta and euglenophyta are common algal groups in freshwater ecosystems and cyanobacteria often dominant the total biomass amorim and moura 2021 n fixing traits and gas vesicles contained in some bloom forming cyanobacterial bacteria provide cyanobacteria a distinct competitive advantage over other phytoplankton in the water huisman et al 2018 during the blooms different algal taxa may produce organic matter with varying characteristics henderson et al 2008 used doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva zeta potential charge density hydrophobicity protein and carbohydrate content molecular weight and fluorescence to characterize the characteristics of dissolved organic matter derived from four different algal species some studies also revealed the important role of phytoplankton community composition in affecting water quality such as ph and nutrient concentration amorim and moura 2021 which are related to regs moreover changes of phytoplankton community often cause a cascade of changes in the diversity and composition of bacterioplankton community huisman et al 2018 woodhouse et al 2016 which can markedly impact regs in the water column due to the interactive effects of phytoplankton community organic matter nutrient and microbial community on regs a comprehensive study of regs together with these potential factors is highly needed in this study phytoplankton biomass and community composition organic matter components optical and molecular composition and regs during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer winter turnover in eutrophic lake taihu where is experiencing a continuous proliferation of cyanobacteria dominated blooms were investigated to identify the key indictors in regulating regs fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms fluorescence and absorption spectra measurements were used to evaluate the composition of organic nitrogen we hypothesize that phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria biomass would be the key indicator to regulate internal nh4 regeneration and the strong interactions between cyanobacteria and regs may be the key mechanism of sustaining cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effect of algal biomass and community composition on the types of organic matter and organic nitrogen 2 measure the regs associated with the organic nitrogen composition and 3 reveal how regenerated nh4 supports the continuous dominance of cyanobacteria blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake taihu 30

dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured using the toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcpn japan 2 3 water column nh4 regeneration water column regs were determined using isotope dilution methods isotope dilution experiments are often conducted with low trace amendment level about 10 of ambient nh4 glibert et al 1982 yet the low nh4 concentrations and fast nh4 recycling rates of lake taihu may lead to depleted nh4 pool before final sampling blackburn 1979 excess 15nh4 approximately 10 μmol n l 1 as the reaction product rather than as a potentially limiting substrate was added at the beginning of incubation mccarthy et al 2007 water samples from each site were amended with 98 15nh4cl and partitioned into triplicate clear polystyrene culture bottles 70 ml coring after thoroughly mixed initial samples were filtered through a rinsed 0 2 μm syringe filter immediately after enrichment and mixing and frozen until analysis the remaining 15nh4cl amended water samples were incubated near the surface in a floating frame suspended off a pier at meiliang bay to provide natural light and water temperature comparable with in situ condition at the end of 24 h incubation samples were collected filtered and frozen in the same way as the initial sample until analysis to measure the nh4 concentration and isotopic composition of final samples the regs were calculated using a modified isotope dilution method glibert et al 1982 blackburn 1979 the relative abundance of nh4 15n r was required to calculation the regs which can be calculated as follows r 15 n 15 n 14 n where 15n and 14n were the concentrations of nh4 15n and nh4 14n μmol n l 1 respectively the regs can be calculated as follows bruesewitz et al 2015 which is derived from the logarithmic equations of blackburn 1979 r e g r 0 r t t c 0 r t where r0 and rt are the relative abundances of nh4 15n at the initial and final point respectively and t is the incubation time h c0 is the initial concentration of nh4 μmol n l 1 regs μmol n l 1 h 1 are absolutely positive values indicating the actual regeneration rates of nh4 2 4 phytoplankton community composition and biomass phytoplankton species were identified according to hu and wei 2006 and were identified and quantified at the genus level algal cell volume was calculated from cell numbers and cell size measurements the volume values were converted to biomass based on the assumption that 1 mm3 of volume was equivalent to 1 mg of fresh weight biomass liu et al 2011 2 5 fluorescence and absorption spectra measurements fluorescence

rfpermute package was applied to evaluate the significance of each predictor for regs and a3 package was applied to calculate the significance with 1000 permutations of the response variables partial least squares path model pls pm was further used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the factors on the regs this model can partition the direct and indirect effects of one variable on

chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cryptophyta were the dominant phytoplankton in lake taihu with only a few pyrrophyta and euglenophyta fig 2 the biomass of phytoplankton was higher in summer 1 04 19 7

algal community cyanophyta typically dominated in most areas of lake taihu such as meiliang bay s1 s2 and southwest coastal area s4 s8 in summer and open lake area s3 s10 in winter in monthly samples total phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0 55 to 6 89 mg l 1 and cyanophyta dominated from june to october except for the mid july and august while cryptophyta dominated in other months 3 2 nh4 regeneration rates in our study regs in all water samples collected from lake taihu ranged from 0 03 to 1 84 μmol n l 1 h 1 in summer the regs had relatively high values from meiliang bay to open lake area s1 s2 s3 s9 s10 with an average of 1 33 0 22 μmol n l 1 h 1 while the relatively low values were observed in xukou bay s12 and east taihu bay s11 macrophytes dominated zones fig 3 in addition zhushan bay s7 and southwest coastal area s4 s5 s8 were also active areas for nh4 regeneration compared to the gonghu bay s6 in winter regs was significantly lower than that in summer p 0 01 the highest reg was found in meiliang bay s2 and the lowest was located in xukou bay s12 fig 3 similar to the spatial distribution pattern in summer in monthly samples extremely high regs were found at

three component c1 3 model was established fig s2 the spectral characteristics of the three components were compared with parafac results for samples collected from other ecosystems by openfluor which is an online spectral library murphy et al 2014 c1 had an excitation emission ex em maxima at 325 419 nm which was thought to correspond to anthropogenic humic like material liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 c2 displayed single ex and em maxima at 280 nm 326 nm respectively which was categorized as a protein like material liu et al 2019 stedmon et al 2007 c3 exhibited two ex maxima at 275 and 380 nm and an em maximum 471 nm similar to those of terrestrially derived humic material liu et al 2019 protein like c2 dominated the fluorescence composition representing 53 7 10 3 of dom fluorescence in the collected samples while the anthropogenic humic like component c1 and terrestrially derived humic c3 accounted for 27 4 5 7 and 18 8 4 7 respectively of the three components table s1 in addition suva values were higher in winter 2 93 0 65 l mg 1 m 1 than in summer 2 11 0 50 l mg 1 m 1 p 0 01 table s1 in monthly samples the lowest suva was found at the end of june 1 16 l mg 1 m 1 as the sampling time point of the highest regs and then suva increased gradually and reached the highest value in december 4 02 l mg 1 m 1 fig 2e samples collected from meiliang bay in summer and winter exhibited 2690 and 1635 n containing molecular formulae respectively fig 4 fig s3 van krevelen diagrams were used to characterize the molecular composition of don in summer and winter protein and lipid compounds which typically represent the bulk of labile don pool lusk and toor 2016 accounted in total relative abundance of n containing molecular formulae for 12 in summer and were higher than in winter 6 table s2 in comparison the percentage of refractory lignin tannins and condensed aromatics was higher in winter 92 than in summer 86 3 4 potential indicators of regs four statistical methods including spearman rank correlation analysis random forest regression analyses pls pm and pca were used to discern the key indicator of regs in lake taihu spearman rank correlation analysis showed that regs were significantly positive correlated with wt ph chl a pn doc don tdn pn tn doc don total phytoplankton biomass c1 c2 and c3 while significantly negative correlated with do tdn nox tn tp suva fig s4 random forest regression analyses revealed that wt and algal related parameters including chl a total phytoplankton biomass and cyanophyta biomass were the key indicators for regs fig 5 a pls pm further revealed that algal related parameters were the direct and significant factors regulated regs while pn and c2 had a direct but non significant effect on regs fig 5b in addition algal related parameters exerted an indirect effect on the regs through its direct effects on pn c2 and doc the combination of algal related parameters pn c2 doc and suva explained 59 6 of the variance in the regs and algal related parameters had the largest effect fig s5 the pca revealed that the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained approximately 61 5 of the variance with pc1 accounting for 41 9 of the variance and pc2 accounting for 19 6 of the variance fig 5c the winter and summer samples grouped in two distinct areas with respect to pc1 x axis with winter samples grouping in positive pc1 summer samples grouping in negative pc1 and monthly samples connected with the winter and summer samples fig 5c this separation displayed by pc1 appears to be strongly influenced by seasonal and algal blooms differences with the variables wt ph doc chl a total phytoplankton biomass cyanophyta biomass pn and protein like c2 grouping apart from a variable cluster that includes nutrients nox nh4 and don do and suva indicating that pc1 was negative related to the algal related parameters regs in this study decreased with increasing pc1 scores fig 5d taken together these four statistical analyses indicated that algal blooms were the key factor regulating regs in eutrophic lake taihu 4 discussion 4 1 effect of algal blooms on regs based on multiple analysis and statistical methods our study suggested that algal blooms characterized by chl a concentration and phytoplankton biomass were the key indicator of internal nh4 regeneration in eutrophic lake fig 5 regs increased with the concentrations of chl a and phytoplankton biomass but decreased with suva fig 2e fig s4 phytoplankton are a main organic matter producer during algal blooms period zhang et al 2009 gao et al 2021 moreover the algae produced organic matter is biologically labile nguyen et al 2005 the higher chl a concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in summer than in winter can produce the higher proportions of labile organic n such as proteins and lipids fig 4 table s2 which can be easily used by ammonifiers and release nh4 into water gardner et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 previous studies also showed that after the addition of algal biomass the concentrations of n and doc increased suggesting the decomposing algae are an important nutrient source yan et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 furthermore the concentrations of n and doc were found to be positively correlated with regs in lake taihu jiang et al 2019 therefore the regulation of algal blooms on the regs could be attributed to its potential effects on both the concentration and dynamics of c and n on the one hand algal blooms exerted strong direct impacts on doc and protein like c2 fig 5b leading to the higher doc concentrations and c2 table 1 and table s1 than non algal bloom periods on the other hand algal blooms can also trigger great n especially pn production fig 5b since the accumulation and death of algae can release particulate matter into water and this highly enriched n containing matter was the main source of pn in the water during algal bloom period the decrease in the regs with suva could be due to its aromaticity and terrigenous characteristics previous studies have suggested that suva increase with increasing dom aromaticity zhou et al 2020 luzius et al 2018 the higher suva in winter than in summer and the opposite trend between suva and algal biomass fig 2e table s1 indicated that increasing phytoplankton coincided with a decrease in the suva cheng and chi 2003 this was further supported by the fact that the total relative abundance of refractory don ligning tannins and condensed aromatics is higher in winter 92 than summer 86 table s2 compared with fresh and labile algal dom the complex molecular structure of aromatic dom can hinder the breakdown of n containing dom to access available n hertkorn et al 2006 the lack of available n further constrained regs in our study area furthermore oxidized aromatic organic matter is preferentially removed in the degradation process whereas the reduced aliphatic and n containing organic matter is either resistant to degradation or tightly recycled and thus persist in the lake systems kellerman et al 2015 therefore high suva could inhibit regs through their constraints on organic n availability and persistence in addition to the effects of algal blooms on the concentration and dynamics of c n and the liability of dom the effects of algal blooms on the physicochemical factors can also control regs algal blooms especially cyanobacterial blooms have been verified to promote the increase of ph amorim and moura 2021 and ph may influence the regs by affecting the population of total bacteria isobe et al 2015 our study verified that ph was significantly positively correlated with regs fig s4 reflecting that change of ph caused by algal blooms can indirectly affect regs do was negative correlated with regs fig s4 because algal decomposition accelerated do exhaustion and nh4 release 4 2 interactions between cyanobacteria and regs although above results demonstrated the important role of algal blooms in regulating the regs the contribution of various algal species to regs is still unclear our study further suggested that cyanobacteria interacted strongly with regs in lake taihu this is supported by the high concentration and proportion of cyanophyta biomass significant correlations and high correlation coefficient between the concentration and proportion of cyanophyta biomass and regs fig 6 fig s6 cyanobacteria especially non n2 fixing cyanobacteria often dominates the algal community in summer and fall months of eutrophic systems such as lake taihu bambini junior et al 2014 paerl et al 2011 the high concentration and proportion of cyanobacteria biomass could regulate regs through cyanobacteria derived organic matter and cyanobacteria bacteria interactions firstly compared with green algae chlorella vulgaris and diatoms asterionella formosa and melosira sp cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa had the lowest suva while the highest protein doc ratio and protein carbohydrates ratio henderson et al 2008 suggesting the lower aromaticity and higher protein proportion of cyanobacteria derived organic matter this is supported by the positive correlations between cyanophyta and protein like c2 fig 6c indicating cyanobacteria were an important source of protein furthermore the majority of cyanobacteria derived organic matter were assigned to aliphatic formulas patriarca et al 2021 higher cyanobacteria biomass and total relative abundance of lipids in summer than in winter fig 2 table s2 provide rich substrate and energy for ammonifiers secondly compared with eukaryotic algal species prokaryotic cyanobacteria have the ability to supply themselves with the necessary vitamin b12 cobalamin thereby to avoid the restriction of growth croft et al 2005 bertrand et al 2015 in addition cyanobacteria dominated blooms can increase the abundance of organic aggregates provide attachment carriers for microbe and promote the ammonification rate isobe et al 2020 tang et al 2010 given this an increase in the frequency and scale of cyanobacterial blooms have the potential to accelerate regs in lakes interestingly regenerated nh4 also strongly stimulates the blooms of cyanobacteria during n limited summer months paerl et al 2011 swarbrick et al 2019 andersen et al 2020 although low ambient nh4 concentrations the higher nh4 turnover rates the ration of regs and ambient nh4 concentrations in cyanobacteria dominated blooms regions than other algae dominated regions during summer fig 6d likely provide rich nh4 and support the continuous cyanobacteria dominated blooms fig s7 this is because under n limitation cyanobacteria especially non n2 fixing cyanobacteria were often more strongly stimulated by regenerated nh4 while diatoms and cryptophytes may be suppressed by nh4 swarbrick et al 2019 andersen et al 2020 compared with summer the lower wt higher nh4 concentrations lower regs and lower cyanophyta biomass in winter indicated that the external input was enough to support the growth of algae at this time and the contribution of nh4 turnover was small fig s7 in the growing period high ambient n concentrations meet algal growth requirements through winter into spring and as blooms mature and persist during summer to autumn internal regenerated nh4 and rapid nh4 turnover rates tend to become more important for cyanobacteria maintenance fig s7 moreover the lower nitrification rates and higher algae uptake rates in summer suggested that nitrifiers were poor competitors for nh4 during the bloom hampel et al 2018 and internal regenerated nh4 was more directly assimilated by cyanobacteria rather than oxidized to no3 to support the growth of other algae therefore internal regenerated nh4 would favorably facilitate cyanobacteria to become the dominate species and sustaining blooms during the periods of n limitation 4 3 environmental implication of regs in eutrophic lakes based on the former results and discussion on the relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and regs we raised a conceptual model aiming at clarifying how this internal loop was formed and how cyanobacteria could sustain in these eutrophic lakes especially during very low ambient concentration of both nh4 and no3 fig 7 firstly cyanobacteria dominated blooms in summer produced more labile organic matter e g proteins and lipids pn and doc than the algal communities in winter fig 4 table 1 cyanobacteria derived organic matter is the substrate basis for enhanced microbial ammonification and internal nh4 recycling which is proved by the close linkages between protein like c2 and regs as well as the faster regs from ammonification during summer blooms fig s4 fig 3 secondly the regenerated nh4 would be without so much doubt the main n source for phytoplankton during the bloom season when ambient inorganic n concentrations were as low as the minimum limit of detection hampel et al 2018 paerl et al 2011 meanwhile compared to a direct assimilation fate the regenerated nh4 is hardly transformed to no3 by nitrifiers to support no3 favored algal genus typically diatom because nitrification rates were lower than algae uptake rates in these eutrophic lakes hampel et al 2018 and vigorous denitrification would compete for the produced no3 xu et al 2021 low ambient no3 concentrations together with slow no3 supply rates were thus unfavored to diatoms in summer fig 2 in contrast faster turnover rates and shorter recycling pathway provide continuous nh4 for cyanobacteria the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs may be the key self maintenance mechanism of sustaining blooms and will continue to reinforce the dominant position of cyanobacteria in the future lastly this model also implied that internal production rates e g nh4 regeneration vs nitrification would be more important than stoichiometry of ambient concentration e g nh4 vs no3 referring to shape the phytoplankton community composition particularly in the low n but high biomass lakes although nutrient stoichiometry has been persuasively used in many aquatic systems glibert et al 2016 we raise the doubt that these stoichiometry e g n p nh4 no3 may only take effect in the system with low internal recycling rates compared to high nutrients input nutrients pool in addition a multi annual warming trend not only advance the bloom start sates but also promote the proliferate of cyanobacterial blooms shi et al 2019 glibert et al 2016 warming also promotes regs through enhancing the metabolic activity of ammonifiers thus the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs will be further strengthened under the climate warming our study provided a new viewpoint for the continuous cyanobacterial blooms from the perspective of cyanobacterial blooms and nh4 internal recycling frequent cyanobacterial blooms caused by nh4 internal recycling exert adversely effects on ecosystem such as water and habitat degradation biodiversity reduction drinking water supply disruption qin et al 2010 paerl et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to take effective management measures controlling external n inputs is the key step towards the restoration of eutrophic lakes furthermore salvaging algae dense mats during bloom period and surface dredging to remove dead algae could interrupt or alleviate the internal recycling processes for shallow eutrophic lakes frequently suspended sediment was an unneglectable pn source and henceforth induced new internal nh4 source newly sinking algal debris were enriched of high content of labile organic nitrogen which would be another internal nh4 regeneration source we therefore recommend frequent surficial dredging instead of occasional deep dredging to alleviate internal cycling and nh4 favored cyanobacteria 5 conclusion this study investigated the phytoplankton biomass and community composition om components optical and molecular composition and regs during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer winter turnover in eutrophic lake taihu to unravel the interactions of algal community with regs our results highlighted that regs were significantly regulated by algal blooms due to the high proportion of labile organic matter and high concentrations of doc pn protein like components produced by phytoplankton during the summer bloom period of the algal community cyanophyta was the dominant phylum to accelerate regs correspondingly rapid internal nh4 turnover may also strongly stimulate the blooms of cyanobacteria during n limited summer months the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and regs may be a key self maintenance mechanism of continuous blooms in high eutrophic lakes declaration of competing

capacity to generate highly active radical species and interesting radical chemistry however applications of uv based aops have been commonly optimized case by case due to the lack of theoretical investigations on process optimization especially on oxidant doses in this study a simple equation for uv h2o2 oh as the sole primary reactive species prs to obtain the theoretical optimal concentration copt theoretical for h2o2 was derived copt theoretical a b s c ε k the equation was then validated for its accuracy in the calculation of copt theoretical for h2o2 in the uv h2o2 aop using a well established comprehensive kinetic model a competition kinetics method for the measurement of scavenging capacity sc the unknown parameter for the simple equation was designed for which nitrobenzene was employed as the probe compound and tert butyl alcohol was introduced as the standard compound based on this simple equation we calculated the copt theoretical of 77 environmental water samples and introduced the concept of a practical optimal oxidants dose for the uv h2o2 aop while minimizing the operation costs in engineering applications moreover this study mathematically proved that the simple equation obtained from uv h2o2 could be successfully extended to other uv based aops including uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv s2o8 2 and uv peracetic acid the simple equation of copt

operating convenience the oxidation of a wide range of contaminants for water treatment by uv based advanced oxidation processes uv based aops have been of interest to numerous researchers over the past several decades miklos et al 2018 wang et al 2020b wols and hofman caris 2012 yang et al 2014 the uv based aops commonly employ precursor chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 free available chlorine fac peroxydisulfate pds monochloramine nh2cl peracetic acid paa and other such oxidants in combination with uv irradiation to generate reactive species for the elimination of contaminants in water loeb et al 2019 von gunten 2018 this includes processes based on hydroxyl radicals oh uv h2o2 and those favoring other oxidizing species such as chlorine radicals cl uv fac uv nh2cl sulfate radical so4 uv pds reactive nitrogen species rns uv nh2cl and carbon centered radicals ccr uv paa cai et al 2017 miklos et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wols and hofman caris 2012 several uv

uv based aops i e uv chlor am ine uv pds uv paa and so on for pollution control in engineering systems remain limited miklos et al 2018 wang et al 2020b for any uv based aops to be implemented at water utilities a common challenge is the optimization of cost effectiveness which usually respect to oxidant dose and electrical energy dose however applications of uv based aops have been commonly optimized case by case on site due to the lack of theoretical investigations on process optimization especially on the optimization of oxidant doses direct photolysis of the oxidants h2o2 fac pds nh2cl paa in situ generates highly reactive primary reactive species prs including oh 1 8 2 7 v cl 2 0 v and so4 2 5 3 1 v beitz et al 1998 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the prs quickly reacts with the water matrix and target pollutants therefore uv based aops require continuously generating prs to compensate for their continuous decay the performance of uv based aops mainly relies on the steady state concentration of prs prs ss which is controlled by the radical formation rate as well as competing reactions with other constituents in the water commonly called radical scavengers in the reaction system radical scavengers usually include the precursor oxidant and all background constituents in the water the intrinsic scavenging capacity of the water matrix is denoted as sc in this study wang et al 2020a the generation rate of prs increases with increasing the oxidant concentration however at relatively high oxidant concentrations the prs ss decreases as the oxidant itself becomes an active scavenger therefore for a certain uv based aop system i e uv equipment size and the light intensity were fixed the oxidant concentration that generates the highest steady state concentration of prs is the theoretical optimal concentration copt theoretical for uv based aops previous studies have investigated the photochemical nature of oxidants and established comprehensive kinetic models for uv based aops in batch reactors cai et al 2017 fang et al 2014 qian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 by solving a set of differential equations between radicals and water solutes these kinetic models successfully predicted the degradation of target contaminants in various water matrices under different operational conditions therefore after obtaining the concentrations of all the major water constituents the copt theoretical for a specific water sample can be found by plotting prs ss with the oxidant doses examples are shown in fig 1 however several complications have prohibited the use of kinetic models in engineering applications for example all the key radical scavengers in water should be accurately determined which is labor intensive and requires multiple analytical instruments the complex nature of large organic molecules e g dissolved organic matter dom exerts great uncertainty in the radical consuming capability in addition advanced solver software is required to obtain results within an acceptable amount of time therefore this study was conducted with the aim of seeking a simple method to obtain the theoretical concentration of oxidants to achieve the highest prs concentrations for various uv based aops and provide some guidance for the optimization of uv based aops in the engineering application in this study we first derived a simple equation for uv h2o2 the most commonly used aop that generates oh as the sole prs to obtain the copt theoretical then we validated this equation and demonstrated its successful application for other uv based aops 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents the hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 w w nitrobenzene nb 99 5 and hplc methanol 99 9 purity were purchased from aladdin shanghai china tert butyl alcohol tba 99 5 was obtained from alfa assar all other chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade or higher reagent grade deionized di water resistivity 18 2 mω cm 1 was prepared using the milli q reference system merck the samples were quenched with sodium thiosulfate nb stock solutions were prepared in di water at 1 0 mm and stored at 4 c stock solutions of dom were prepared and standardized as described previously fang et al 2014 briefly 6 aliquots of ihss doms were dissolved in purified water and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane si table s1 the stock solution was standardized through a dissolved organic carbon doc analysis with a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu tnm l rohs 2 2 experimental setup the uv based aops were created by adding the oxidant solution to the target water matrix 10 ml in a merry go around photoreactor cel lab500 beijing china wducation au light co ltd china that was irradiated with a 10 w low pressure percury lamp peaking at 254 nm si figure s1 a protocol is detailed in si text s1 the sc of the water samples was measured by applying nb as the probe compound and tba as the external radical scavenger nb was used because it predominantly reacts with oh knb oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 ashton et al 1995 in uv h2o2 aop system and it was insensitive to direct uv photolysis and h2o2 oxidation in addition nb was desirable because of high stability over a broad ph range however to make sure the total light absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was lower than 0 1 relatively low concentration of nb was applied the overall scavenging effect was not constant during the reaction with the fast decay of nb in this case tba was applied as an external radical consumer to maintain steady radical concentrations as it has a well defined rate constant for the oh reaction ktba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 has no absorption at uv254 and tba was a relatively slow reacting compound for oh compared with other radical quenchers a reaction solution containing 1 5 μm nb 0 1 mm h2o2 and 10 or 100 μm tba was prepared in a quartz reactor and buffered at needed ph with a 5 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs the reaction time for all the experiments was 12 15 min the reaction was initiated by exposing the reactor to uv irradiation the samples were collected periodically and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate they were then analyzed using suitable analytical methods the degradation of nb in uv h2o2 was tested in 77 water samples including the standard dom solution lake water tap water and wastewater from

2030c system equipped with a c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm shimadzu the detection wavelength was set as 260 nm and isocratic elution using water and methanol was performed to detect the nb the

including over two hundred elementary reactions between the radicals and water solutes the rate constants for most reactions considered in the kinetic modeling were obtained from previous studies si table s3 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2014 qian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 this kinetic model was developed to simulate the radical concentrations in different water samples in the uv based aops 3 results and discussion 3 1 derivation of c opt theoretical for uv h2o2 first a simple equation was derived to obtain the theoretical optimal concentration for uv h2o2 one of the most commonly used uv based aops with oh as its sole prs produced through photolysis under uv irradiation because of its high reactivity the half life of oh is of the order of nanoseconds to microseconds depending on the water matrix hoigné 1998 given the pseudo steady state assumption the net formation rate of oh can be set to zero i e d oh dt generation rate scavenging effect oh ss 0 therefore the concentration of oh during treatment is controlled by the ratio of the generation rate to the scavenging effect in water eq 1 1 oh ss generation rate scavenging effect 3 1 1 generation rate the generation rate of oh is equivalent to the direct photolysis rate of h2o2 multiplied by two i e the decomposition of one h2o2 yields two oh assuming that the photolysis of solutes and the secondary formation of oh were negligible in the uv h2o2 processes the direct photolysis rate of h2o2 dc dt in the aquatic environment can be expressed as a combination of the quantum yield of h2o2 φλ mol einstein 1 and the specific rate of uv fluence rate absorption iaλ einstein l 1 s 1 the general rate expression of h2o2 for uv photolysis can be further expressed as 2 generation rate 2 dc dt λ 2 φ λ i a λ 2 φ λ i 0 λ f s λ f c λ where i 0λ einstein l 1 s 1 is the incident light intensity at wavelength fsλ is the fraction of light absorbed by the system and fcλ is the fraction of absorbed light that is absorbed by the oxidant fsλ and fcλ can be further expressed as 3 f s λ 1 1 0 a b ε λ c l 4 f c λ ε λ c a b ε λ c where ab is the absorption coefficient of the solvent cm 1 i e water sample ελ is the molar extinction coefficient of the photoreactive substance m 1 cm 1 i e h2o2 and l is the effective optical path length cm engineering water treatment facilities tend to utilize uv light as much as possible photoreactors are designed such as using reflective surfaces so that all the light remains within the reactor and is absorbed by the water matrix as the light is reflected between the surfaces the effective path length in engineering systems is considerably larger than the physical dimensions of the reactor as the path length l which is a part of the negative exponent term in eq 3 increases fsλ λ 254 nm in the following study approaches one and eq 2 is expressed as 5 generation rate 2 i 0 φ ε c ε c a b 3 1 2 scavenging effect in the environmental water matrix the scavenging effect was mostly due to the self scavenging effect of the oxidant k c k oh oxidant oxidant s 1 and the scavenger capacity sc s 1 of the water matrix in an engineering water treatment system the steady state concentration of oh ss can be expressed as eq 6 lee et al 2016 6 oh ss generation rate scavenging effect 2 i 0 φ ε c ε c a b k c s c for a specific water sample i e fixed values of ab and sc oh ss is a function of the oxidant concentration c in the uv h2o2 system in the uv h2o2 system oh ss first increased and then decreased with increasing concentrations of h2o2 the concentration of h2o2 corresponding to the highest point of oh ss is the copt theoretical for this water sample si figure s2 to obtain the maximum oh ss for a water sample we can differentiate eq 6 with respect to the concentration of h2o2 and obtain the following equation 7 d oh ss dc 2 i 0 φ ε ε c a b k c s c a b ε c a b k c k c s c by setting d oh ss dc equal to zero copt theoretical can be determined 8 c opt theoretical a b s c ε k in eq 8 the numerator represents the property of the water matrix and the denominator represents the property of the oxidants the equation to determine copt theoretical in this study differs from the previous method i e a comprehensive kinetic model in that it does not require separate measurements of the photochemical conditions i e uv dose or path length in addition the simple equation method which only requires the input of ab and sc is more feasible than the comprehensive kinetic model for copt theoretical measurements ab is a common indicator for a water sample and is easy to measure using a real time uv spectrometer therefore if the sc is determined for the water matrix we can obtain the theoretical optimal concentration of the oxidant for a water sample 3 2 validation of the theoretical optimal concentration equation using the kinetic model prior to measuring sc the accuracy of the copt theoretical equation should be validated previous studies have investigated the photochemistry of h2o2 and established kinetic models for uv h2o2 in a sequential batch reaction crittenden et al 1999 lee et al 2016 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 yao et al 2013 the accuracy of the model prediction has been widely recognized by researchers in the uv h2o2 aop the changes in the oh ss with h2o2 doses were modeled using matlab fig 1 eq 8 was validated by comparing the copt theoretical obtained from eq 8 and the h2o2 doses that achieved the highest oh ss obtained from matlab modeling results seven representative water samples including baseline bl a stated water sample represent the basic water matrix tap water tw lake water lw and wastewater ww were chosen and their water quality is listed in si table s1 lake water sample 11 31 and 32 and table s4 the sc was calculated based on the water matrix eq 9 and then the copt theoretical of the seven samples could be calculated using eq 8 dots in fig 1 9 s c k i c i k oh dom c dom k oh hco 3 c hco 3 k oh no 2 c no 2 the assumption that the contribution of solutes to oh generation was negligible in the derivation of copt theoretical was valid for several reasons in natural and domestic water the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate are usually below 1 mm in addition these compounds have relatively low molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields at 254 nm εno2 13 0 m 1 cm 1 εno3 3 51 m 1 cm 1 φ oh no2 0 046 φ oh no3 0 09 mol einstein 1 mack and bolton 1999 wang et al 2020b therefore their negligible contribution to the overall oh generation rate is expected the contribution of common ions chloride and oh to the scavenging capacity of the water sample is negligible because the reactions between oh and oh cl are reversible oh cl cloh 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 6 1 109 s 1 oh oh o h2o 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 1 8 106 m 1 s 1 si table s3 as for dom the φ oh dom 0 00048 lester et al 2013 is far lower than that of h2o2 φ oh h2o2 0 5 crittenden et al 1999 and the contribution of oh formation to dom could also be negligible in uv h2o2 aop as shown in fig 1 the correlation between oh ss and h2o2 consumption exhibited a bell shaped behavior the line in fig 1 at lower h2o2 concentrations the figure display the desirable conditions under which oh generated from h2o2 photolysis effectively reacted with the water matrix at higher h2o2 concentrations the reaction between h2o2 and oh dominated the scavenging effect resulting in the decrease in oh ss the copt theoretical from eq 8 agreed well with the kinetic model prediction demonstrating that the equation could be used to calculate the theoretical optimal concentration of h2o2 in uv h2o2 aops in addition the copt theoretical was validated using an engineering photoreactor with reflective inner surface detailed in si text s2 the copt theoretical were indeed has the best performance for the acetate removal among the selected h2o2 doses si figure s3 3 3 methods for sc measurement in eq 8 as εh2o2 k oh h2o2 and ab are all easily determined experimentally or found in the literature efforts were made to develop methods for sc measurements as described above the sc of the water matrix can be calculated using eq 9 method ⅰ calculation from the sum of individual water constituents detailed in si text s3 lee et al 2016 it should be noted that the second order rate constants between oh and dom vary with dom from different origins wang et al 2020b however in order to incorporate the dom effect we have to assign a constant value for the reaction thus the value of sc using method ⅰ may significantly deviate from the true sc of the water samples moreover as dom is commonly measured using a toc analyzer the other solutes of the water sample used to calculate the sc need to be measured separately using ic equipment 3 3 1 method ⅱ measurement by competition kinetics to overcome the shortcoming of method ⅰ an experimental design applying competition kinetics was proposed to directly measure the value of sc for a given water sample to simplify the measurement nb is used as the probe compound because it predominantly reacts with oh knb oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 in uv h2o2 systems ashton et al 1995 in the system the radical scavengers only include nb h2o2 and sc of the water sample as relatively low concentrations of h2o2 and nb were applied the total light absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was lower than 0 1 therefore the generation rate of oh g r could be simplified si text s4 and the sc of the water sample can be solved using eqs 10 and 11 for a certain photoreactor fixed i0 and l 10 oh ss g r scavenging effect 2 2 303 i 0 φ ε l c k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh nb nb s c 11 k nb k oh nb oh ss where knb is the observed first order degradation rate constant s 1 however the measurements of i0 and l require additional experimental work and instruments and introduce more potential errors in the calculation moreover with the fast decay of nb the overall scavenging effect was not constant during the reaction two parallel groups of experiments were carried out to avoid these uncertainties method ⅱ a uv h2o2 with tba and nb and b uv h2o2 with tba and nb and aliquots of buffered diluted water sample the buffer was added to maintain its original ph because it has a well defined rate constant for the oh reaction ktba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and has no absorption at uv254 tba was applied as an external radical scavenger to compete with sc and it significantly contributed to the scavenging effect of the solution without the water sample tba is a relatively slow reacting compound for oh therefore the overall scavenging effect of the solution was stable during the measurement with the introduction of the standard compound tba eqs 10 and 11 can be expressed as 12 k 1 k oh nb oh ss k oh nb g r k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb 13 k 2 k oh nb oh ss k oh nb g r k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb s c where k1 and k2 are the observed degradation rates of nb in the control and test groups respectively because the introduction of water did not affect the light absorbed by h2o2 i e fsλ should be lower than 0 1 g r is the same in both eq 12 and eq 13 and it can be canceled out in eq 14 based on the following equation we obtain the value of sc 14 k 1 k 2 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb s c k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb s t s c s t to improve the accuracy of the calculation various concentrations of tba 10 and 100 µm and if necessary 1 or 1000 µm were also included were spiked in a pbs buffer 5 mm ph 7 2 or water samples containing 1 5 µm nb and 0 1 mm h2o2 because the sc values of the water samples were distributed in different orders of magnitude tba was used as the standard compound and we could obtain several values of sc among which the value in the same order of magnitude as the scavenger effect of tba is the most reliable result detailed in the si text s3 in this study we measured the sc of 77 water samples including tap water lake water wastewater and standard dom solutions with both method ⅰ and method ⅱ fig 2 a as shown in fig 2a most of the experimental values method ii of the water samples were lower than those calculated method ⅰ as discussed before the second order rate constants k oh dom between dom and oh varied with the dom from different water sources ranging from 1 16 to 9 85 104 mg c l 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 lee et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2007 as for the calculated data method ⅰ we assigned a value for the reaction to incorporate the dom effect in this study one of the most commonly used values 2 5 104 mg c l 1s 1 k oh dom fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hoigné 1998 lee et al 2007 sun et al 2019 was chosen to calculate the scavenging effect of dom moreover the dom contributed significantly to the overall sc of the water samples the value of sc from method ⅰ was therefore significantly influenced by the k oh dom in addition the ratios of the experimental data to the calculations showed no obvious difference for the water samples from different water sources fig 2a in all the water samples the dom may have had the same composition but in different proportions the exact concentration of each species of dom was hardly able to determine thus the value of the sc using method ⅰ was not accurately representing the actual scavenging capacity of the samples and the experimental data method ii were chosen here for the following discussion for the environmental water samples the sc of lake water was higher than those of wastewater and tap water which was in agreement with the absorption of water at 254 nm ab254 si figure s4 as for the standard dom samples sc varied for different sources ranging from 5 04 104 to 1 51 105 s 1 si table s1 the actual k oh dom was calculated based on the experimental sc to better understand the contribution of the dom to the sc of the water samples detailed in si text s5 fig 2b si table s1 the range of the experimental k oh dom from 1 89 103 to 1 75 105 mg c l 1 s 1was larger than that for the reported data 1 16 9 85 104 mg c l 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 lee et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2007 a universal k oh dom is not suitable for use in engineering applications and our study provides a more reliable method for the determination of sc moreover the k oh dom values for the standard dom were measured and found to be 5 01 104 to 1 51 105 mg c l 1 s 1 comparable to the values reported in previous studies 1 16 9 85 104 mg c l 1 s 1 si figure s5 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 lee et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2007 these results further supported method ⅱ 3 4 theoretical and practical c opt of h2o2 based on the experimental values of sc we calculated the copt theoretical for all 77 water samples the overall trend of copt theoretical followed the order lake water wastewater tap water the copt theoretical varied substantially for the different water sources 1 27 20 37 mm fig 3 however the calculated copt theoretical values only represent the ultimate treatment capability of uv h2o2 which were too high for applications in water treatment facilities considering the operational cost in engineering application we introduce the concept of a practical optimal dose copt practical of the h2o2 that must be added for a given containment in a water matrix i e fixed values of ab and sc the copt theoretical generates the highest concentration of oh oh max whereas copt practical refers to the dose resulting in a needed concentration of oh ss the needed oh ss can be calculate based on the target removal of the containment ln c c0 k t k oh containment oh ss t applying the percentage of oh ss over oh max the copt practical can be calculated we provided the numerical solution of copt practical for any portion of oh max detailed calculation is shown in si text s6 and table s5 in engineering applications reaching 90 or even lower of the oh max can also achieve the water quality requirements which can significantly reduce the oxidant dose as an example fig 3b to reach 90 or 80 of oh max approximately 51 9 and 38 2 of copt theoretical is necessary respectively correspondingly about 111 and 125 of reaction time was needed to reach the same removal of target compounds as that under optimal dose condition evidently the reduction of oxidants increase the reaction time which leads to the higher operational cost i e the electrical energy of uv lamp detailed in si text s7 in engineering applications the balance between the decrease of the oxidant consumption e g 100 51 9 and 38 2 of copt theoretical and the increase of the operational cost e g 100 111 and 125 of reaction time should be both taken into account the optimization of total energy cost for adjustable uv input needs further research with respect to certain target contaminants 3 5 extended to other uv based aops uv h2o2 aops produces oh as its sole prs as for other uv based aops of interest including uv fac uv nh2cl uv pds and uv paa the prs may include cl or so4 as well as oh considering that they all react with most organic molecules at near diffusion control rates it is well known that uv photolysis of fac can yield cl and oh uv irradiation of nh2cl can produce nh2 and cl uv photolysis of pds can create so4 and uv photolysis of paa could generate ccr and oh although nh2 ccr and secondary radicals e g co3 cl2 and clo are weak radicals they were reported to be able to transform certain moieties cai et al 2017 lei et al 2019 sun et al 2016 as they are not major contributors in uv based aops they were not considered as prs in this study therefore copt theoretical is redefined as the concentration of oxidants that achieved the highest steady state concentration of prs prs ss oh ss cl ss so4 ss n h 2 cl h ν n h 2 cl hocl oc l h ν oh cl cl o h h 2 o cloh c l oh s 2 o 8 2 h ν 2 s o 4 s o 4 o h h 2 o s o 4 2 hs o 4 oh pa a 0 pa a h ν c h 3 c o o oh we first evaluated the hypothesis of weather eq 8 could successfully predict the copt theoretical for the other uv based aops using a comprehensive kinetic model four representative water samples detailed in si table s4 were chosen and the method was similar to that described above section 3 2 validation of the theoretical optimal concentration equation using the kinetic model the copt theoretical values for the water samples in the various uv based aops were calculated with respect to oh i e s c k oh i c i and c opt theoretical a b s c ε oxidant k oh oxidant whereas in the kinetic model the individual water components were included for their reactions with all related radicals as shown in fig 4 the calculated data were in good agreement with the modeling values except for uv pds aop in ww which indicates that the proposed expression eq 8 was potentially suitable for other uv based aops uv h2o2 was compared with other uv based aops to further explore if the consistency resulted from some inherent mechanisms or characteristics of the uv based aops the bl and ww detailed in si table s4 were chosen as representative water samples in the following study we first modeled the changes in all the prss for the five uv based aops in the bl and ww si figure s6 for uv paa the oh was the only dominant prs because the photolysis of paa directly produces oh eq 8 was apparently applicable to uv paa as for uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds except for oh the generation of cl or so4 could not be neglected the changing trend of the oh dose appears to be consistent with that of the prs suggesting that we may find the copt theoretical for oh instead of the copt theoretical for the overall prs to optimize the processes notably in uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds the production of oh consists of two parts the uv photolysis of oxidants and the transformation of cl so4 to oh because the g r of oh cannot be written in the form of i 0 φ ε c ε c a b the derivation process eq 7 was no longer suitable for other uv based aops in contrast cl from uv chlorine and uv nh2cl and so4 from uv pds were predominantly generated from the uv photolysis of the oxidants the g r of these can be expressed as i φ ε c ε c a b therefore if the g r of the cl or the so4 was proportional to the g r of the oh the equation established based on the oh can then be suitable for the other uv based aops 15 oh ss generation rate wrt oh scavenging effect wrt oh dgr sgr scavenging effect wrt oh 16 cl ss generation rate wrt cl scavenging effect wrt cl dgr wrt cl scavenging effect wrt cl 17 so 4 ss generation rate wrt so 4 scavenging effect wrt so 4 dgr wrt so 4 scavenging effect wrt so 4 before validating this hypothesis a couple of terms are defined as follows the prs from the photolysis of the oxidant was set as a direct generated radical dgr the secondary radical generated from the reaction between the primary radical and the water matrix was set as the secondary generated radical sgr the total generated concentration of oh tgr oh was the sum of dgr oh and sgr oh as for other uv based aops including uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds the direct photolysis generated radicals besides oh including the cl or so4 were set as dgr cl or dgr so4 the tgr oh dgr cl or tgr oh dgr so4 were set as α and our hypothesis was to verify whether α is constant to test this hypothesis we first modeled the concentration of the direct photolysis generated prs including the dgr oh dgr cl and dgr so4 the concentration of the secondary generated oh sgr oh was also modeled for uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds in the bl and ww as shown in fig 5 α was a constant for all the mentioned conditions after the system was stabilized among them uv pds took a longer time to reach a stable state in ww which may explain the inconstancy between the calculated copt theoretical and the kinetic model prediction fig 4 overall we revealed a linear correlation between the generation rates of prs which supports the applicability of eq 8 for the other uv based aops employing the experimental sc the copt theoretical of 77 water samples in the five uv based aops were calculated in this study shown in si table s6 the copt theoretical in uv based aops can generally be ranked as pds h2o2 nh2cl paa fac for the known water sample i e fixed values of ab and sc the copt theoretical was determined by the ε254nm of the oxidant and the rate constant of the reaction between oxidants and oh k in the uv based aops the ε254nm m 1 cm 1 of the oxidants generally follow the order nh2cl 382 hocl ocl 62 60 paa0 paa 10 59 pds 22 07 h2o2 18 9 whereas the k value m 1 s 1 follow the order hocl ocl k oh hocl 2 00 109 k oh ocl 8 80 109 paa0 paa k oh paa0 9 33 108 k oh paa 9 97

oxidants and oh is rapid 107 109 m 1 s 1 indicating that excessive oxidants could scavenge oh while producing it and therefore higher k values exhibited lower copt theoretical values specifically for the newly proposed uv combined with chemical disinfectant aops e g uv fac and uv nh2cl the copt theoretical for all water samples was mostly below 0 2 mm i e 1 4 mg cl l 1 which is in the typical practical range of chemical doses in disinfection processes this may suggest the compatibility of upgrading the current chemical disinfection processes to uv based aops or advanced disinfection processes adps 4 conclusion the simple equation c opt theoretical a b s c ε k derived in this study is promising for the optimization of various uv based aops to treat different types of water in engineering applications the only parameter to be measured except for ab which is easily measured with a uv spectrometer is sc which can be accurately determined by competition kinetics in addition the practical optimal dose copt practical proposed in this study may provide guidance for uv based aops in engineering applications the sc can be determined by applying a real time online monitoring system using an external calibration method wang et al 2020a by combining the real time online sc and ab monitoring system and the simple equation proposed in this study the performance of uv based aops can be determined and optimized over time this can help save material cost and ensure adequate treatment in engineering applications moreover the sc agreed well the ab of the water samples at 254 nm except for tap water which may be due to the relatively low ab si figure s4 and the correlation between sc with ab could be determined in future work to help simplify the calculation of copt theoretical for engineering applications in addition for the newly proposed uv based aops i e uv performic acid uv no2 uv peroxymonosulfate by applying the k oh oxidant and the εoxidant to the simple equation one can obtain the copt theoretical note that the optimization of oxidant dose in this study point out the ultimate treatment capability of each uv based aops whereas the uv based aops in the engineering application are commonly optimized with respect to oxidant dose and electrical energy dose such that the treatment goals are met at the minimum cost the energy cost i e ee o based on the copt theoretical for the uv based aops need further research even so this equation may help to provide instructions and evaluate the promising application of these new processes in engineering applications moreover this study provide a simple method compare various uv based aops and helps select the most cost effective uv aop for the specific engineering application appendix a supplementary

tianjin 300000 china uv based advanced oxidation processes aops via photolysis of precursor chemical oxidants have been of interest to numerous researchers over the past several decades due to their capacity to generate highly active radical species and interesting radical chemistry however applications of uv based aops have been commonly optimized case by case due to the lack of theoretical investigations on process optimization especially on oxidant doses in this study a simple equation for uv h2o2 oh as the sole primary reactive species prs to obtain the theoretical optimal concentration copt theoretical for h2o2 was derived copt theoretical a b s c ε k the equation was then validated for its accuracy in the calculation of copt theoretical for h2o2 in the uv h2o2 aop using a well established comprehensive kinetic model a competition kinetics method for the measurement of scavenging capacity sc the unknown parameter for the simple equation was designed for which nitrobenzene was employed as the probe compound and tert butyl alcohol was introduced as the standard compound based on this simple equation we calculated the copt theoretical of 77 environmental water samples and introduced the concept of a practical optimal oxidants dose for the uv h2o2 aop while minimizing the operation costs in engineering applications moreover this study mathematically proved that the simple equation obtained from uv h2o2 could be successfully extended to other uv based aops including uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv s2o8 2 and uv peracetic acid the simple equation of copt

operating convenience the oxidation of a wide range of contaminants for water treatment by uv based advanced oxidation processes uv based aops have been of interest to numerous researchers over the past several decades miklos et al 2018 wang et al 2020b wols and hofman caris 2012 yang et al 2014 the uv based aops commonly employ precursor chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 free available chlorine fac peroxydisulfate pds monochloramine nh2cl peracetic acid paa and other such oxidants in combination with uv irradiation to generate reactive species for the elimination of contaminants in water loeb et al 2019 von gunten 2018 this includes processes based on hydroxyl radicals oh uv h2o2 and those favoring other oxidizing species such as chlorine radicals cl uv fac uv nh2cl sulfate radical so4 uv pds reactive nitrogen species rns uv nh2cl and carbon centered radicals ccr uv paa cai et al 2017 miklos et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wols and hofman caris 2012 several uv

uv based aops i e uv chlor am ine uv pds uv paa and so on for pollution control in engineering systems remain limited miklos et al 2018 wang et al 2020b for any uv based aops to be implemented at water utilities a common challenge is the optimization of cost effectiveness which usually respect to oxidant dose and electrical energy dose however applications of uv based aops have been commonly optimized case by case on site due to the lack of theoretical investigations on process optimization especially on the optimization of oxidant doses direct photolysis of the oxidants h2o2 fac pds nh2cl paa in situ generates highly reactive primary reactive species prs including oh 1 8 2 7 v cl 2 0 v and so4 2 5 3 1 v beitz et al 1998 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the prs quickly reacts with the water matrix and target pollutants therefore uv based aops require continuously generating prs to compensate for their continuous decay the performance of uv based aops mainly relies on the steady state concentration of prs prs ss which is controlled by the radical formation rate as well as competing reactions with other constituents in the water commonly called radical scavengers in the reaction system radical scavengers usually include the precursor oxidant and all background constituents in the water the intrinsic scavenging capacity of the water matrix is denoted as sc in this study wang et al 2020a the generation rate of prs increases with increasing the oxidant concentration however at relatively high oxidant concentrations the prs ss decreases as the oxidant itself becomes an active scavenger therefore for a certain uv based aop system i e uv equipment size and the light intensity were fixed the oxidant concentration that generates the highest steady state concentration of prs is the theoretical optimal concentration copt theoretical for uv based aops previous studies have investigated the photochemical nature of oxidants and established comprehensive kinetic models for uv based aops in batch reactors cai et al 2017 fang et al 2014 qian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 by solving a set of differential equations between radicals and water solutes these kinetic models successfully predicted the degradation of target contaminants in various water matrices under different operational conditions therefore after obtaining the concentrations of all the major water constituents the copt theoretical for a specific water sample can be found by plotting prs ss with the oxidant doses examples are shown in fig 1 however several complications have prohibited the use of kinetic models in engineering applications for example all the key radical scavengers in water should be accurately determined which is labor intensive and requires multiple analytical instruments the complex nature of large organic molecules e g dissolved organic matter dom exerts great uncertainty in the radical consuming capability in addition advanced solver software is required to obtain results within an acceptable amount of time therefore this study was conducted with the aim of seeking a simple method to obtain the theoretical concentration of oxidants to achieve the highest prs concentrations for various uv based aops and provide some guidance for the optimization of uv based aops in the engineering application in this study we first derived a simple equation for uv h2o2 the most commonly used aop that generates oh as the sole prs to obtain the copt theoretical then we validated this equation and demonstrated its successful application for other

oxidant solution to the target water matrix 10 ml in a merry go around photoreactor cel lab500 beijing china wducation au light co ltd china that was irradiated with a 10 w low pressure percury lamp peaking at 254 nm si figure s1 a protocol is detailed in si text s1 the sc of the water samples was measured by applying nb as the probe compound and tba as the external radical scavenger nb was used because it predominantly reacts with oh knb oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 ashton et al 1995 in uv h2o2 aop system and it was insensitive to direct uv photolysis and h2o2 oxidation in addition nb was desirable because of high stability over a broad ph range however to make sure the total light absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was lower than 0 1 relatively low concentration of nb was applied the overall scavenging effect was not constant during the reaction with the fast decay of nb in this case tba was applied as an external radical consumer to maintain steady radical concentrations as it has a well defined rate constant for the oh reaction ktba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 has no absorption at uv254 and tba was a relatively slow reacting compound for oh compared with other radical quenchers a reaction solution containing 1 5 μm nb 0 1 mm h2o2 and 10 or 100 μm tba was prepared in a quartz reactor and buffered at needed ph with a 5 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs the reaction time for all the experiments was 12 15 min the reaction was initiated by exposing the reactor to uv irradiation the samples were collected periodically and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate they were then analyzed using suitable analytical methods the degradation of nb in uv h2o2 was tested in 77 water samples including the standard dom solution lake water tap water and wastewater from

theoretical was validated using an engineering photoreactor with reflective inner surface si figure s1 b the water sample was obtained from a lake in tianjin china and the water sample was filtered using 0 45 μm membranes si table s2 acetate was selected as the probe compound for the validation because 1 it reacts rapidly with oh kacetate oh 1 108 m 1 s 1 in uv h2o2 systems 2 it does not absorb

solutions were determined using the colorimetric method satterfield and bonnell 1955 adapted from the literature ketchie et al 2007 the sample 1 0 ml was added to 1 0 ml of sulfuric acid 0 5 m and 1 0

2030c system equipped with a c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm shimadzu the detection wavelength was set as 260 nm and isocratic elution using water and methanol was performed to detect the nb the concentration of acetate was analyzed using ic equipment thermo scientific ics 600 rfic 4 250 mm 2 4 kinetic modeling the uv based aops were modeled using the matlab 2016b simbiology application including over two hundred elementary reactions between the radicals and water solutes the rate constants for most reactions considered in the kinetic modeling were obtained from previous studies si table s3 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2014 qian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 this kinetic model was developed to simulate the radical concentrations in different water samples in the uv based aops 3 results and discussion 3 1 derivation of c opt theoretical for uv h2o2 first a simple equation was derived to obtain the theoretical optimal concentration for uv h2o2 one of the most commonly used uv based aops with oh as its sole prs produced through photolysis under uv irradiation because of its high reactivity the half life of oh is of the order of nanoseconds to microseconds depending on the water matrix hoigné 1998 given the pseudo steady state assumption the net formation rate of oh can be set to zero i e d oh dt generation rate scavenging effect oh ss 0 therefore the concentration of oh during treatment is controlled by the ratio of the generation rate to the scavenging effect in water eq 1 1 oh ss generation rate scavenging effect 3 1 1 generation rate the generation rate of oh is equivalent to the direct photolysis rate of h2o2 multiplied by two i e the decomposition of one h2o2 yields two oh assuming that the photolysis of solutes and the secondary formation of oh were negligible in the uv h2o2 processes the direct photolysis rate of h2o2 dc dt in the aquatic environment can be expressed as a combination of the quantum yield of h2o2 φλ mol einstein 1 and the specific rate of uv fluence rate absorption iaλ einstein l 1 s 1 the general rate expression of h2o2 for uv photolysis can be further expressed as 2 generation rate 2 dc dt λ 2 φ λ i a λ 2 φ λ i 0 λ f s λ f c λ where i 0λ einstein l 1 s 1 is the incident light intensity at wavelength fsλ is the fraction of light absorbed by the system and fcλ is the fraction of absorbed light that is absorbed by the oxidant fsλ and fcλ can be further expressed as 3 f s λ 1 1 0 a b ε λ c l 4 f c λ ε λ c a b ε λ c where ab is the absorption coefficient of the solvent cm 1 i e water sample ελ is the molar extinction coefficient of the photoreactive substance m 1 cm 1 i e h2o2 and l is the effective optical path length cm engineering water treatment facilities tend to utilize uv light as much as possible photoreactors are designed such as using reflective surfaces so that all the light remains within the reactor and is absorbed by the water matrix as the light is reflected between the surfaces the effective path length in engineering systems is considerably larger than the physical dimensions of the reactor as the path length l which is a part of the negative exponent term in eq 3 increases fsλ λ 254 nm in the following study approaches one and eq 2 is expressed as 5 generation rate 2 i 0 φ ε c ε c a b 3 1 2 scavenging effect in the environmental water matrix the scavenging effect was mostly due to the self scavenging effect of the oxidant k c k oh oxidant oxidant s 1 and the scavenger capacity sc s 1 of the water matrix in an engineering water treatment system the steady state concentration of oh ss can be expressed as eq 6 lee et al 2016 6 oh ss generation rate scavenging effect 2 i 0 φ ε c ε c a b k c s c for a specific water sample i e fixed values of ab and sc oh ss is a function of the oxidant concentration c in the uv h2o2 system in the uv h2o2 system oh ss first increased and then decreased with increasing concentrations of h2o2 the concentration of h2o2 corresponding to the highest point of oh ss is the copt theoretical for this water sample si figure s2 to obtain the maximum oh ss for a water sample we can differentiate eq 6 with respect to the concentration of h2o2 and obtain the following equation 7 d oh ss dc 2 i 0 φ ε ε c a b k c s c a b ε c a b k c k c s c by setting d oh ss dc equal to zero copt theoretical can be determined 8 c opt theoretical a b s c ε k in eq 8 the numerator represents the property of the water matrix and the denominator represents the property of the oxidants the equation to determine copt theoretical in this study differs from the previous method i e a comprehensive kinetic model in that it does not require separate measurements of the photochemical conditions i e uv dose or path length in addition the simple equation method which only requires the input of ab and sc is more feasible than the comprehensive kinetic model for copt theoretical measurements ab is a common indicator for a water sample and is easy to measure using a real time uv spectrometer therefore if the sc is determined for the water matrix we can obtain the theoretical optimal concentration of the oxidant for a water sample 3 2 validation of the theoretical optimal concentration equation using the kinetic model prior to measuring sc the accuracy of the copt theoretical equation should be validated previous studies have investigated the photochemistry of h2o2 and established kinetic models for uv h2o2 in a sequential batch reaction crittenden et al 1999 lee et al 2016 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 yao et al 2013 the accuracy of the model prediction has been widely recognized by researchers in the uv h2o2 aop the changes in the oh ss with h2o2 doses were modeled using matlab fig 1 eq 8 was validated by comparing the copt theoretical obtained from eq 8 and the h2o2 doses that achieved the highest oh ss obtained from matlab modeling results seven representative water samples including baseline bl a stated water sample represent the basic water matrix tap water tw lake water lw and wastewater ww were chosen and their water quality is listed in si table s1 lake water sample 11 31 and 32 and table s4 the sc was calculated based on the water matrix eq 9 and then the copt theoretical of the seven samples could be calculated using eq 8 dots in fig 1 9 s c k i c i k oh dom c dom k oh hco 3 c hco 3 k oh no 2 c no 2 the assumption that the contribution of solutes to oh generation was negligible in the derivation of copt theoretical was valid for several reasons in natural and domestic water the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate are usually below 1 mm in addition these compounds have relatively low molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields at 254 nm εno2 13 0 m 1 cm 1 εno3 3 51 m 1 cm 1 φ oh no2 0 046 φ oh no3 0 09 mol einstein 1 mack and bolton 1999 wang et al 2020b therefore their negligible contribution to the overall oh generation rate is expected the contribution of common ions chloride and oh to the scavenging capacity of the water sample is negligible because the reactions between oh and oh cl are reversible oh cl cloh 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 6 1 109 s 1 oh oh o h2o 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 1 8 106 m 1 s 1 si table s3 as for dom the φ oh dom 0 00048 lester et al 2013 is far lower than that of h2o2 φ oh h2o2 0 5 crittenden et al 1999 and the contribution of oh formation to dom could also be negligible in uv h2o2 aop as shown in fig 1 the correlation between oh ss and h2o2 consumption exhibited a bell shaped behavior the line in fig 1 at lower h2o2 concentrations the figure display the desirable conditions under which oh generated from h2o2 photolysis effectively reacted with the water matrix at higher h2o2 concentrations the reaction between h2o2 and oh dominated the scavenging effect resulting in the decrease in oh ss the copt theoretical from eq 8 agreed well with the kinetic model prediction demonstrating that the equation could be used to calculate the theoretical optimal concentration of h2o2 in uv h2o2 aops in addition the copt theoretical was validated using an engineering photoreactor with reflective inner surface detailed in si text s2 the copt theoretical were indeed has the best performance for the acetate removal among the selected h2o2 doses si figure s3 3 3 methods for sc measurement in eq 8 as εh2o2 k oh h2o2 and ab are all easily determined experimentally or found in the literature efforts were made to develop methods for sc measurements as described above the sc of the water matrix can be calculated using eq 9 method ⅰ calculation from the sum of individual water constituents detailed in si text s3 lee et al 2016 it should be noted that the second order rate constants between oh and dom vary with dom from different origins wang et al 2020b however in order to incorporate the dom effect we have to assign a constant value for the reaction thus the value of sc using method ⅰ may significantly deviate from the true sc of the water samples moreover as dom is commonly measured using a toc analyzer the other solutes of the water sample used to calculate the sc need to be measured separately using ic equipment 3 3 1 method ⅱ measurement by competition kinetics to overcome the shortcoming of method ⅰ an experimental design applying competition kinetics was proposed to directly measure the value of sc for a given water sample to simplify the measurement nb is used as the probe compound because it predominantly reacts with oh knb oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 in uv h2o2 systems ashton et al 1995 in the system the radical scavengers only include nb h2o2 and sc of the water sample as relatively low concentrations of h2o2 and nb were applied the total light absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was lower than 0 1 therefore the generation rate of oh g r could be simplified si text s4 and the sc of the water sample can be solved using eqs 10 and 11 for a certain photoreactor fixed i0 and l 10 oh ss g r scavenging effect 2 2 303 i 0 φ ε l c k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh nb nb s c 11 k nb k oh nb oh ss where knb is the observed first order degradation rate constant s 1 however the measurements of i0 and l require additional experimental work and instruments and introduce more potential errors in the calculation moreover with the fast decay of nb the overall scavenging effect was not constant during the reaction two parallel groups of experiments were carried out to avoid these uncertainties method ⅱ a uv h2o2 with tba and nb and b uv h2o2 with tba and nb and aliquots of buffered diluted water sample the buffer was added to maintain its original ph because it has a well defined rate constant for the oh reaction ktba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and has no absorption at uv254 tba was applied as an external radical scavenger to compete with sc and it significantly contributed to the scavenging effect of the solution without the water sample tba is a relatively slow reacting compound for oh therefore the overall scavenging effect of the solution was stable during the measurement with the introduction of the standard compound tba eqs 10 and 11 can be expressed as 12 k 1 k oh nb oh ss k oh nb g r k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb 13 k 2 k oh nb oh ss k oh nb g r k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb s c where k1 and k2 are the observed degradation rates of nb in the control and test groups respectively because the introduction of water did not affect the light absorbed by h2o2 i e fsλ should be lower than 0 1 g r is the same in both eq 12 and eq 13 and it can be canceled out in eq 14 based on the following equation we obtain the value of sc 14 k 1 k 2 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb s c k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh tba tba k oh nb nb s t s c s t to improve the accuracy of the calculation various concentrations of tba 10 and 100 µm and if necessary 1 or 1000 µm were also included were spiked in a pbs buffer 5 mm ph 7 2 or water samples containing 1 5 µm nb and 0 1 mm h2o2 because the sc values of the water samples were distributed in different orders of magnitude tba was used as the standard compound and we could obtain several values of sc among which the value in the same order of magnitude as the scavenger effect of tba is the most reliable result detailed in the si text s3 in this study we measured the sc of 77 water samples including tap water lake water wastewater and standard dom solutions with both method ⅰ and method ⅱ fig 2 a as shown in fig 2a most of the experimental values method ii of the water samples were lower than those calculated method ⅰ as discussed before the second order rate constants k oh dom between dom and oh varied with the dom from different water sources ranging from 1 16 to 9 85 104 mg c l 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 lee et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2007 as for the calculated data method ⅰ we assigned a value for the reaction to incorporate the dom effect in this study one of the most commonly used values 2 5 104 mg c l 1s 1 k oh dom fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hoigné 1998 lee et al 2007 sun et al 2019 was chosen to calculate the scavenging effect of dom moreover the dom contributed significantly to the overall sc of the water samples the value of sc from method ⅰ was therefore significantly influenced by the k oh dom in addition the ratios of the experimental data to the calculations showed no obvious difference for the water samples from different water sources fig 2a in all the water samples the dom may have had the same composition but in different proportions the exact concentration of each species of dom was hardly able to determine thus the value of the sc using method ⅰ was not accurately representing the actual scavenging capacity of the samples and the experimental data method ii were chosen here for the following discussion for the environmental water samples the sc of lake water was higher than those of wastewater and tap water which was in agreement with the absorption of water at 254 nm ab254 si figure s4 as for the standard dom samples sc varied for different sources ranging from 5 04 104 to 1 51 105 s 1 si table s1 the actual k oh dom was calculated based on the experimental sc to better understand the contribution of the dom to the sc of the water samples detailed in si text s5 fig 2b si table s1 the range of the experimental k oh dom from 1 89 103 to 1 75 105 mg c l 1 s 1was larger than that for the reported data 1 16 9 85 104 mg c l 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 lee et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2007 a universal k oh dom is not suitable for use in engineering applications and our study provides a more reliable method for the determination of sc moreover the k oh dom values for the standard dom were measured and found to be 5 01 104 to 1 51 105 mg c l 1 s 1 comparable to the values reported in previous studies 1 16 9 85 104 mg c l 1 s 1 si figure s5 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 lee et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2007 these results further supported method ⅱ 3 4 theoretical and practical c opt of h2o2 based on the experimental values of sc we calculated the copt theoretical for all 77 water samples the overall trend of copt theoretical followed the order lake water wastewater tap water the copt theoretical varied substantially for the different water sources 1 27 20 37 mm fig 3 however the calculated copt theoretical values only represent the ultimate treatment capability of uv h2o2 which were too high for applications in water treatment facilities considering the operational cost in engineering application we introduce the concept of a practical optimal dose copt practical of the h2o2 that must be added for a given containment in a water matrix i e fixed values of ab and sc the copt theoretical generates the highest concentration of oh oh max whereas copt practical refers to the dose resulting in a needed concentration of oh ss the needed oh ss can be calculate based on the target removal of the containment ln c c0 k t k oh containment oh ss t applying the percentage of oh ss over oh max the copt practical can be calculated we provided the numerical solution of copt practical for any portion of oh max detailed calculation is shown in si text s6 and table s5 in engineering applications reaching 90 or even lower of the oh max can also achieve the water quality requirements which can significantly reduce the oxidant dose as an example fig 3b to reach 90 or 80 of oh max approximately 51 9 and 38 2 of copt theoretical is necessary respectively correspondingly about 111 and 125 of reaction time was needed to reach the same removal of target compounds as that under optimal dose condition evidently the reduction of oxidants increase the reaction time which leads to the higher operational cost i e the electrical energy of uv lamp detailed in si text s7 in engineering applications the balance between the decrease of the oxidant consumption e g 100 51 9 and 38 2 of copt theoretical and the increase of the operational cost e g 100 111 and 125 of reaction time should be both taken into account the optimization of total energy cost for adjustable uv input needs further research with respect to certain target contaminants 3 5 extended to other uv based aops uv h2o2 aops produces oh as its sole prs as for other uv based aops of interest including uv fac uv nh2cl uv pds and uv paa the prs may include cl or so4 as well as oh considering that they all react with most organic molecules at near diffusion control rates it is well known that uv photolysis of fac can yield cl and oh uv irradiation of nh2cl can produce nh2 and cl uv photolysis of pds can create so4 and uv photolysis of paa could generate ccr and oh although nh2 ccr and secondary radicals e g co3 cl2 and clo are weak radicals they were reported to be able to transform certain moieties cai et al 2017 lei et al 2019 sun et al 2016 as they are not major contributors in uv based aops they were not considered as prs in this study therefore copt theoretical is redefined as the concentration of oxidants that achieved the highest steady state concentration of prs prs ss oh ss cl ss so4 ss n h 2 cl h ν n h 2 cl hocl oc l h ν oh cl cl o h h 2 o cloh c l oh s 2 o 8 2 h ν 2 s o 4 s o 4 o h h 2 o s o 4 2 hs o 4 oh pa a 0 pa a h ν c h 3 c o o oh we first evaluated the hypothesis of weather eq 8 could successfully predict the copt theoretical for the other uv based aops using a comprehensive kinetic model four representative water samples detailed in si table s4 were chosen and the method was similar to that described above section 3 2 validation of the theoretical optimal concentration equation using the kinetic model the copt theoretical values for the water samples in the various uv based aops were calculated with respect to oh i e s c k oh i c i and c opt theoretical a b s c ε oxidant k oh oxidant whereas in the kinetic model the individual water components were included for their reactions with all related radicals as shown in fig 4 the calculated data were in good agreement with the modeling values except for uv pds aop in ww which indicates that the proposed expression eq 8 was potentially suitable for other uv based aops uv h2o2 was compared with other uv based aops to further explore if the consistency resulted from some inherent mechanisms or characteristics of the uv based aops the bl and ww detailed in si table s4 were chosen as representative water samples in the following study we first modeled the changes in all the prss for the five uv based aops in the bl and ww si figure s6 for uv paa the oh was the only dominant prs because the photolysis of paa directly produces oh eq 8 was apparently applicable to uv paa as for uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds except for oh the generation of cl or so4 could not be neglected the changing trend of the oh dose appears to be consistent with that of the prs suggesting that we may find the copt theoretical for oh instead of the copt theoretical for the overall prs to optimize the processes notably in uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds the production of oh consists of two parts the uv photolysis of oxidants and the transformation of cl so4 to oh because the g r of oh cannot be written in the form of i 0 φ ε c ε c a b the derivation process eq 7 was no longer suitable for other uv based aops in contrast cl from uv chlorine and uv nh2cl and so4 from uv pds were predominantly generated from the uv photolysis of the oxidants the g r of these can be expressed as i φ ε c ε c a b therefore if the g r of the cl or the so4 was proportional to the g r of the oh the equation established based on the oh can then be suitable for the other uv based aops 15 oh ss generation rate wrt oh scavenging effect wrt oh dgr sgr scavenging effect wrt oh 16 cl ss generation rate wrt cl scavenging effect wrt cl dgr wrt cl scavenging effect wrt cl 17 so 4 ss generation rate wrt so 4 scavenging effect wrt so 4 dgr wrt so 4 scavenging effect wrt so 4 before validating this hypothesis a couple of terms are defined as follows the prs from the photolysis of the oxidant was set as a direct generated radical dgr the secondary radical generated from the reaction between the primary radical and the water matrix was set as the secondary generated radical sgr the total generated concentration of oh tgr oh was the sum of dgr oh and sgr oh as for other uv based aops including uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds the direct photolysis generated radicals besides oh including the cl or so4 were set as dgr cl or dgr so4 the tgr oh dgr cl or tgr oh dgr so4 were set as α and our hypothesis was to verify whether α is constant to test this hypothesis we first modeled the concentration of the direct photolysis generated prs including the dgr oh dgr cl and dgr so4 the concentration of the secondary generated oh sgr oh was also modeled for uv fac uv nh2cl and uv pds in the bl and ww as shown in fig 5 α was a constant for all the mentioned conditions after the system was stabilized among them uv pds took a longer time to reach a stable state in ww which may explain the inconstancy between the calculated copt theoretical and the kinetic model prediction fig 4 overall we revealed a linear correlation between the generation rates of prs which supports the applicability of eq 8 for the other uv based aops employing the experimental sc the copt theoretical of 77 water samples in the five uv based aops were calculated in this study shown in si table s6 the copt theoretical in uv based aops can generally be ranked as pds h2o2 nh2cl paa fac for the known water sample i e fixed values of ab and sc the copt theoretical was determined by the ε254nm of the oxidant and the rate constant of the reaction between oxidants and oh k in the uv based aops the ε254nm m 1 cm 1 of the oxidants generally follow the order nh2cl 382 hocl ocl 62 60 paa0 paa 10 59 pds 22 07 h2o2 18 9 whereas the k value m 1 s 1 follow the order hocl ocl k oh hocl 2 00 109 k oh ocl 8 80 109 paa0 paa k oh paa0 9 33 108 k oh paa 9 97

oxidants and oh is rapid 107 109 m 1 s 1 indicating that excessive oxidants could scavenge oh while producing it and therefore higher k values exhibited lower copt theoretical values specifically for the newly proposed uv combined with chemical disinfectant aops e g uv fac and uv nh2cl the copt theoretical for all water samples was mostly below 0 2 mm i e 1 4 mg cl l 1 which is in the typical practical range of chemical doses in disinfection processes this may suggest the compatibility of upgrading the current chemical disinfection processes to uv based aops or advanced disinfection processes adps 4 conclusion the simple equation c opt theoretical a b s c ε k derived in this study is promising for the optimization of various uv based aops to treat different types of water in engineering applications the only parameter to be measured except for ab which is easily measured with a uv spectrometer is sc which can be accurately determined by competition kinetics in addition the practical optimal dose copt practical proposed in this study may provide guidance for uv based aops in engineering applications the sc can be determined by applying a real time online monitoring system using an external calibration method wang et al 2020a by combining the real time online sc and ab monitoring system and the simple equation proposed in this study the performance of uv based aops can be determined and optimized over time this can help save material cost and ensure adequate treatment in engineering applications moreover the sc agreed well the ab of the water samples at 254 nm except for tap water which may be due to the relatively low ab si figure s4 and the correlation between sc with ab could be determined in future work to help simplify the calculation of copt theoretical for engineering applications in addition for the newly proposed uv based aops i e uv performic acid uv no2 uv peroxymonosulfate by applying the k oh oxidant and the εoxidant to the simple equation one can obtain the copt theoretical note that the optimization of oxidant dose in this study point out the ultimate treatment capability of each uv based aops whereas the uv based aops in the engineering application are commonly optimized with respect to oxidant dose and electrical energy dose such that the treatment goals are met at the minimum cost the energy cost i e ee o based on the copt theoretical for the uv based aops need further research even so this equation may help to provide instructions and evaluate the promising application of these new processes in engineering applications moreover this study provide a simple method compare various uv based aops and helps select the most cost effective uv aop for the specific engineering application appendix a supplementary
