1360,natural attenuation na processes have been demonstrated to reduce pollutant loads at different contaminated groundwater sites world wide and are increasingly considered in contaminated site management concepts however data are mainly available for steady state groundwater flow and stable redox conditions as well as pollutants listed in standard regulatory schemes in this study the influence of transient groundwater flow and redox conditions on na was examined at a former gas works site near the river rhine in germany the investigated 78 pollutants included 40 mono and polyaromatic hydrocarbons mahs pahs and 38 nso heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons nso het in the highly polluted areas the mahs benzene indene and indane the pahs naphthalene acenaphthene 1 and 2 methylnaphthalene and the nso het 2 methylquinoline carbazole benzothiophene dibenzofuran and benzofuran were predominant pollutant concentrations decreased with increasing distance from the sources of contamination at the plume fringes the mahs benzene and indane the pah acenaphthene the nso het carbazole 5 methylbenzothiophene 2 and 3 methylbenzofuran and 2 methyldibenzofuran were predominant indicating low retention and slow intrinsic biodegradation of these compounds the influence of surface water on groundwater level pollutant concentrations and redox conditions in the monitoring wells was observed with a permanently installed groundwater sensor the temporary availability of oxygen was observed at the plume fringes resulting in aerobic and ferric iron reducing biodegradation processes field and laboratory data were used to set up a groundwater flow and reactive transport model used for quantification of the field mass transfer rates in conclusion the study demonstrates that na is effective under transient flow and redox conditions a conceptual model and reactive transport simulation can facilitate the interpretation of pronounced fluctuations of pollutant concentration in monitoring wells based on the analysis of 78 pollutants indane indene and several nso het like carbazole benzothiophene and 2 methyldibenzofuran are recommended for monitoring at tar oil polluted sites besides epa pahs and btex keywords pah mah heterocyclic compounds biodegradation groundwater modelling tar oil pollutants 1 introduction tar oil processing plants gasworks sites and abandoned deposit sites containing gasworks residues have caused a large number of long lasting soil and groundwater contamination issues natural attenuation na is defined as a wide range of processes happening without human intervention such as evaporation dilution biodegradation and adsorption similarly monitored natural attenuation means the extensive monitoring of the natural processes in soil and groundwater brown et al 2017 u s epa 1999 monitored natural attenuation mna concepts became a reliable and economic method to manage a wide range of contaminated sites in germany and other parts of the world declercq et al 2012 rügner et al 2006 the crucial process of mna concepts is microbial degradation as it leads to an effective reduction of pollutant loads at contaminated sites schulze and tiehm 2004 during bioremediation processes organic pollutants serve as carbon sources whereas oxygen nitrate ferric iron sulfate and carbonates are used as electron acceptors the energy yield differs strongly depending on the available electron acceptor the most powerful electron acceptors are oxygen and nitrate followed by ferric iron borch et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2011 tiehm and schulze 2003 in order to apply an mna concept as a remediation option the plume needs to be stationary quasi stationary or shrinking and degradation needs to be proved blum et al 2011 rügner et al 2006 at sites with steady state conditions a depletion of the electron acceptors oxygen nitrate and sulfate as well as the increase of biodegradation products like ferrous iron sulfide and methane indicate active microbial processes within the plume schulze and tiehm 2004 studies with focus on mna concepts for contaminations with groundwater surface water interactions are rare so far manufacturing sites were often built near major rivers allowing easy transport of raw material and products to or from the site the direct vicinity of surface water with temporarily varying water levels could lead to transient groundwater flow and redox conditions that could improve availability of nutrients and electron acceptors lee et al 2001 observed that besides biodegradation seasonal groundwater recharge was the most important factor controlling the distribution of hydrocarbon contaminants within a sandy aquifer fritz and arntzen 2007 demonstrated a relationship between hydraulic gradient changes due to river fluctuations and uranium fluxes discharging to the river meckenstock et al 2015 described that biodegradation activity was controlled by the availability of specific electron acceptors rather than by thermodynamics under transient conditions a better distribution of electron acceptors in an aquifer is feasible different effects of transient groundwater conditions on na are possible in most cases the surface water will contain higher concentrations of dissolved electron acceptors such as nitrate sulfate or oxygen than the corresponding contaminated aquifer recharge of those electron acceptors to the aquifer could thus have a positive effect on na scholl et al 2006 described the effect of seasonal changes of sulfate concentrations in a shallow alluvial aquifer the water of the canadian river near the site is seen as one of the main natural sources of sulfate in the groundwater this kind of recharge is not only related to the influence of surface waters van stempvoort et al 2007 described a seasonal infiltration of snowmelt water recharging the groundwater table and replenishing the contaminated zone with sulfate decreasing sulfate concentrations in the contaminant plume accompanied with an enrichment of sulfur isotope 34s indicated that sulfate reduction was a dominant terminal electron accepting process in the natural attenuation of the hydrocarbon plume in the ground water wei et al 2018 demonstrated that the implementation of monitoring approaches with isotopic and molecular biological procedures can improve the understanding of sulfate reductions processes in petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater as additional line of evidence recharge of dissolved electron acceptors whether due to an infiltration of surface water or groundwater formation can improve natural attenuation processes additionally the respiration product ferrous iron could be re oxidized into ferric iron also an efficient electron acceptor for example cozzarelli et al 2011 summarized results of 10 year study of an leachate affected aquifer and demonstrated with chemical and isotopic data from different monitoring strategies that measurable rates of fe reduction are consistent with the advance of the leachate plume into sediments in which relatively labile fe iii oxides were incompletely reduced as well as the regeneration of fe iii phases near the water table they confirmed groundwater surface water interactions and temporal variations in hydrologic flow need to be considered on the other hand anaerobic bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the presence of oxygen fu et al 2015 imlay 2013 a predominantly anaerobic microbial population could therefore suffer from frequently changing redox conditions and microbial degradation processes could be diminished due to infiltration of oxygen rich surface water into an aquifer meckenstock et al 2015 pointed out that if the prevailing geochemical conditions for microorganisms shift degraders must continuously follow or re establish in other strata those geochemical shifts could lead to kinetic limitation of biodegradation these aspects also play an important role when it comes to enhanced natural attenuation ena e g when oxygen is injected in an anaerobic aquifer as an electron acceptor not only the primary contaminant degradation but also competing mineral precipitation must be considered however increasing degradation rate constants were observed with the availability of oxygen herold et al 2011 in general for remediation of tar oil contaminated sites standard risk assessment protocols require the analysis of only a small subset of pollutants namely the 16 epa polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and 6 monoaromatic hydrocarbons btex tar oil contains thousands of organic pahs volatile aromatic compounds phenols and inorganic substances inorganic compounds of sulfur and nitrogen metals partly with high toxic potential and persistence to biodegradation logeshwaran et al 2018 in recent years the importance of increased analytical efforts to identify and monitor additional key compounds was demonstrated andersson and achten 2015a 2015b e g in case of nso heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons nso het for mna conditions blum et al 2011 the contamination of groundwater in such cases is dominated by the water soluble fraction of the coal tar due to their toxicity and higher polarity heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen sulfur or oxygen are increasingly included in monitoring programmes in addition to btex and pahs blum et al 2011 in the german federal soil protection ordinance the critical value for epa pahs and other relevant pahs such as quinoline is defined with 0 2 μg l the occurrence and distribution of nso het at tar oil contaminated sites has been investigated and presented in different studies blum et al 2011 tiehm et al 2008 blum et al 2011 pointed out that the comparison of three tar oil contaminated sites in germany showed longer plume lengths for nso het than for pahs ecotoxicity mutagenicity dioxin like and estrogenic activity of at least some nso het or their metabolites as well as the monoaromatic hydrocarbons indane and indene are already known and characterized brinkmann et al 2019a brinkmann et al 2019b brinkmann et al 2014a brinkmann et al 2014b eisenträger et al 2008 peddinghaus et al 2012 however nso het are not yet included in standard risk protocols beside nso het methylated naphthalenes and the monoaromatic carbocycles indane and indene are often reported at tar oil contaminated sites mundt and hollender 2005 schulze and tiehm 2004 but also not included in standard risk protocols toxicity tests on marine plankton organisms showed toxic effects towards different naphthalenes methylated naphthalenes were more toxic than naphthalene the toxicity was not dependent on the number of methyl groups but rather on their position on the naphthalene molecule falk petersen et al 1982 this study focused on the characterisation of microbial degradation processes under transient groundwater flow and variable redox conditions at a tar oil contaminated site located in the upper rhine valley south west germany the combination of field investigations laboratory studies and numerical modelling of groundwater flow and contaminant transport was applied to assess the influence of groundwater surface water interactions on na processes furthermore for the first time the degradation potential of nearly 80 tar oil pollutants was investigated to identify key constituents important for monitoring at tar oil contaminated sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling the gasworks site considered in this study was operated from 1867 to 1937 it is located in the upper rhine valley south west germany the production wastes of the gasworks were reused in a nearby impregnation site for railroad ties and served as levelling material in urban development source of contamination is the gasworks area itself and two secondary sources an impregnation site where tar oil products were used and a former pond filled with gasworks residues soil and groundwater are contaminated with typical tar oil pollutants i e mahs pahs nso het as well as phenols in the years 2010 2011 removal of hot spots by excavating polluted material from the former gasworks site took place in total 28 groundwater monitoring wells were set up covering the entire source and plume areas of the site and thus allowing for comprehensive monitoring the three source areas of contamination are located to the west between 150 m and 250 m of the receiving surface water the river rhine fig 1 flowing past the site at the east in the west the site is partly surrounded by a cut off meander of the river rhine and another small surface water called queich the shallow aquifer consists of sand and gravel layers representing a highly conductive aquifer typical for the upper rhine valley the average depth to groundwater is 4 5 m the thickness of the polluted aquifer ranges from 9 to 15 m with silt and clay layers of low permeability underneath separating the shallow aquifer from the deeper one the average value for hydraulic conductivity for the area is about 2 10 3 m s groundwater sampling at the field site was performed with a grundfoss mp1 pump according to general guidelines iso 2009 samples for chemical analysis were regularly taken over a period of three years between october 2010 and april 2013 all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark for up to 24 h prior to analysis 2 2 chemical analysis of tar oil pollutants samples for mah pah and nso het analysis were prepared using liquid liquid extraction 45 ml of the groundwater sample were spiked with 10 μl internal standard toluene d 8 and naphthalene d8 and 5 ml mtbe and extracted for 20 min after phase separation the extract was dried using sodium sulfate and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography agilent technologies gc 6890n the gc was equipped with an auto sampler agilent technologies and a mass selective detector agilent technologies ms 5973 network operated in sim single ion monitoring mode separation of the substances took place by a zb 5 inferno column 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm by phenomenex limits of detection are listed in table 2 of the supplementary data the relative deviation of standard procedure sx0 amounted to 10 regression coefficients ranged from 0 985 to 0 997 all used chemicals were of p a chemical purity all substances were purchased from abcr karlsruhe germany sigma deisenhofen germany alfa aesar karlsruhe germany ehrenstorfer augsburg germany or merck darmstadt germany 2 3 detection of ferrous iron and sulfate reducing bacteria ferrous iron and sulfate reducing bacteria were examined by the most probable number mpn method as described by stieber et al 1994 and tiehm and schmidt 2007 ferric iron reducing bacteria were detected by the formation of the respiration product ferrous iron that forms a red complex after bipyridin addition sulfate reducers were detected by iron sulfide precipitation after sulfide formation incubation and detection methods for ferric iron and sulfate reducing bacteria are described by schulze and tiehm 2004 and stieber et al 1994 2 4 hydrochemical parameters and multiparameter sensor during groundwater sampling oxygen was analysed on site by electrode measurements in a flow through chamber limit of detection 0 1 mg l nitrate limit of detection 1 0 mg l nitrite limit of detection 0 5 mg l and sulfate limit of detection 1 0 mg l were analysed by ion chromatography metrohm as described by zhao et al 2010 rapid test kits macherey nagel were used for sulfide ferric and ferrous iron quantification limit of detection 0 01 mg l automated monitoring of groundwater level and redox conditions was achieved by installing a multiparameter water quality sensor ysi 600xlm v2 s ecotech umweltmesssysteme gmbh bonn in observation well gwm 17 which is situated approximately 100 m to the west of the river rhine fig 1 oxygen concentration mg l redox potential mv ph and conductivity μs cm of the groundwater as well as the water level in the well were monitored every six hours and recorded continuously over a period of two years 2 5 pollutant biodegradation in microcosms for the microcosm studies in the laboratory autoclaved 2 l glass bottles were flushed with nitrogen before sampling groundwater samples were filled directly into the bottles used for incubation a stock solution was prepared by mixing mahs pahs and nso het and dissolving them in each other this resulted in widely differing concentrations of the substances e g indane 80 and toluene 650 μg l as acenaphthene was found in high enough concentrations of 30 μg l in the groundwater samples this compound was not added to the stock solution the experimental design included three active approaches and one sterile control to distinguish abiotic processes anaerobic experiments were conducted in a nitrogen flushed anaerobic chamber during the anaerobic phase of the experiments the microcosms were stored in vessels containing anaerogenic bags anaerogen from oxoid germany to diminish traces of oxygen and an oxygen indicator anaerobic indicator from oxoid germany the anaerogen bag rapidly absorbs the atmospheric oxygen present in the storage vessels and simultaneously evolves carbon dioxide samples were taken with glass syringes through a teflon coated septum fe iii in form of iron hydroxides feooh was supplied as described in schulze et al 2004 fe reducing conditions were maintained for 310 d after that period oxygen was added in order to simulate aerobic field conditions aerobic conditions were induced by repeated dosage of air the microcosms were incubated at 20 c 2 for 445 d the sterile control was inhibited by poisoning with sodium azide 2 6 groundwater modelling in order to consider hydraulic effects at the gasworks site in combination with the experimental findings on degradation processes a transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport model was developed the usgs tool modflow 2005 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and the transport model mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 were applied to simulate groundwater heads and pollutant concentrations the pmwin environment model chiang 2016 was used for pre and post processing of parameters and results the model simulations were run from october 2010 to april 2013 the pollutants considered in the transport model were acenaphthene naphthalene benzene benzothiophene dibenzofurane carbazole and 2 methyldibenzofurane covering typical substance classes found at the site the aim of the model application was to reproduce the interaction of hydraulic and hydrochemical processes and to quantify the effect of this interaction on contaminant release and degradation the model area stretched over 9 km in south north direction and 8 km in west east direction and was thus much larger than the actual gasworks site embedding the site into a larger flow model domain was necessary to minimize spurious boundary effects on model results in the vertical direction the model covered the shallow aquifer with the underlying low permeable silt and clay layers acting as an impermeable lower boundary the aquifer was resolved by an unconfined single model layer in the vicinity of the gasworks site the aquifer has a saturated thickness of about 10 m to 11 m the model domain was resolved with a grid of 10 m by 10 m size around the gasworks site the course of the river rhine which was close to the gasworks site formed the eastern boundary of the model area it was implemented in form of a leakage boundary 3rd type boundary the smaller watercourses visible in fig 1 were treated as 3rd type or leakage boundaries also the southern northern and western boundaries of the model domain were at a distance of 4 5 km to 6 5 km from the gasworks site not shown in fig 1 the western boundary was treated as a fixed head boundary 1st type boundary the southern and northern boundary as no flux boundaries 2nd type boundaries in the transport model contaminants enter the aquifer via a number of grid cells with a prescribed mass load mass per time the contaminant release cells were located manually by an inverse procedure such that the concentrations at the sampling points at the gas works site could be reproduced the degradation of contaminants was simulated using a first order degradation model with species dependent rate constants see table 5 in the supplement in order to reproduce contaminant spreading in the model it was not only necessary to consider degradation processes but also to differentiate between two degradation areas one is the gasworks site itself and most parts of its downstream area here reducing redox conditions prevailed and anaerobic processes presumably governed degradation i e by ferric iron reducing bacteria in this area lower degradation rates were specified the other degradation area was the vicinity of the riverbank where dissolved oxygen was provided by periodic flood events cf chapter 3 1 4 and where aerobic degradation processes might develop the degradation rates specified for the aerobic areas are much higher than those given for the anaerobic areas this was done to take into account that aerobic degradation is very efficient for the contaminants considered in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 field studies 3 1 1 groundwater flow direction groundwater levels were recorded at the monitoring wells gwm 1 gwm 10 and gwm 13 the evaluation of the head time series by hydrologic triangulation for 2 5 years 3636 data points per well showed a dominant groundwater flow eastward towards the river rhine for 54 of the overall flow situations during the monitoring period during flood events of the river the groundwater flow direction was reversed westward in 11 of the flow situations also any other direction of groundwater flow can occur at the site the frequency of groundwater flow directions is listed in table 1 of the supplement information 3 1 2 field studies on pollutant patterns groundwater samples for chemical analysis were taken at different time points cf section 2 1 fig 2 shows the distribution of pollutant concentrations of mahs pahs and nso het during the sampling campaign in may 2012 when the predominant groundwater flow direction was to the west the data were chosen because the sampling was during high water of the rhine and demonstrate the influence of the surface water to the groundwater aquifer a different method of displaying the data is shown in figs 1 and 2 of the supplement in general pollutant concentrations were found to be highest in the groundwater of the source areas gwm 7 gwm 9 and gwm 16 the concentrations in the mainly eastern directed plume decreased in direction towards the river rhine fig 2a shows the predominance of indene and indane in nearly all investigated groundwater wells in the source areas of contamination a significant proportion of the total pollutant concentration 25 gwm 7 more than 75 gwm 16 nearly 98 gmw 9 would not have been quantified by analysing only the standard risk parameters btex peripheral groundwater wells confirmed these results gwm 25 and gwm 26 the results illustrate that important information on e g the length of a plume and the contamination levels of source areas might not be obtained by focusing analysis on the group of btex contaminants these observations are confirmed in previous studies e g podgorski et al 2021 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 illustrate that concentrations of alkyl pahs heterocycles and of some presumed metabolites contribute to the overall concentration in the plume of the investigated gas works site in the case of the analysed pahs pollutant profiles were shifting as the concentration decreased from the contamination source to the plume fig 2b acenaphthene was predominant in most of the groundwater wells 0 1 360 μg l other studies confirm the persistence of acenaphthene which is often the only substance within the group of the 16 analysed epa pahs that is still detectable in the contamination plume tiehm and schmidt 2007 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 naphthalene occurs in high concentrations near the source area of the gasworks site 180 μg l as well as in the secondary source wells i e gwm 9 660 μg l and gwm 16 83 μg l the decrease of concentration of this very mobile compound in groundwater of the plume indicate microbiological activity near the source area limiting groundwater transport of naphthalene this observation is confirmed by previous studies schulze and tiehm 2004 in addition to the standard risk parameters 16 epa pahs 1 and 2 methylnaphthalene were analysed for 2 methylnaphthalene as well as for naphthalene an efficient biodegradation under anaerobic conditions is described the detection of these compounds can be seen as an indicator for contamination sources schulze and tiehm 2004 in contrast 1 methylnaphthalene shows higher persistence and was therefore detectable in the plume between 6 1 μg l and 25 μg l our results confirm this effect and are consistent with previous studies mundt and hollender 2005 tiehm and schmidt 2007 in conclusion the analysis of methylated naphthalenes provides additional information on microbiological degradation processes at contaminated sites in addition to the mahs and pahs nso het were also considered in our study fig 2c and d in total 38 nso heterocycles were examined 17 n heterocycles n het 13 s heterocycles s het and 8 heterocycles containing oxygen o het comparing the percentage shares of different pollutant groups o het seemed to be relevant in the source area as well as in the plume n het seemed to be relevant especially in the source area and nearby the source area s het accounted for the smallest proportion of the total nso het concentration concentrations of many of the analysed n het were below the limit of detection see table 2 in supplement including mono methylated quinolines and isoquinoline carbazole was the pollutant found in the highest concentrations near the sources as well as in many plume measuring wells for example in gwm 25 and gwm 26 there were only single findings of quinoline and 2 methylquinoline in the source area previous studies confirm the relevance of carbazole mundt and hollender 2005 further substances of the group of n het were 2 4 and 2 6 dimethylquinoline acridine and phenanthridine evidence of those substances was mainly limited to the source areas benzothiophene accounted for the largest proportion of s het in the source area concentrations decreased in the plume thiophene was detected solely in or near the source area dibenzothiophene the methylated benzothiophenes and dibenzothiophenes accounted for the total s het pollution in the further groundwater downstream wells considering o het only in the source area benzofuran and dibenzofuran accounted for a significant proportion of total o het concentration the wells in the direction of the river were primarily dominated by concentrations of 2 and 3 methylbenzofuran 2 methyldibenzofuran as well as 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran fig 2d similar to the findings of s het the methylated o het became more relevant from the source area to the different plume wells these observations are consistent with previous studies tiehm et al 2008 tiehm and schmidt 2007 and confirmed the importance of the analysis besides the routine parameters such as 16 epa pahs the heteroatoms within the ring structure induce a higher water solubility for nso het in comparison with their pah analogues and nso het are often more persistent towards biodegradation than other coal tar constituents therefore nso het form longer plumes in groundwater than pahs at some sites the evaluation of 10 field studies where the plume lengths of nso het btex and pahs are reported indicated higher field derived half lives for 2 3 methylbenzofuran 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran carbazole and benzothiophene as well as for the usually measured pollutants acenaphthene and benzene tiehm and schulze 2003 blum et al 2011 reineke 2008 safinowski et al 2006 focussing on only the 16 epa pahs and btex could lead to an underestimation of pollutant concentrations extent of contamination and the potential risk of exposure andersson and achten 2015b furthermore the plume length of mahs pahs and nso het at this site was comparatively short 150 200 m observed plume lengths at other tar oil contaminated sites are usually found to be longer than 250 m tiehm and schulze 2003 anneser et al 2008 blum et al 2011 safinowski et al 2006 3 1 3 groundwater redox conditions and field studies on patterns of redox sensitive parameters the evaluation of redox conditions in groundwater pollution plumes is necessary in order to understand pollutants behavior in the plume but rigorous interpretation of individual oxidation reduction potential orp values are not recommendable because of slow electrode kinetics on the one hand and the common lack of internal equilibrium of redox processes in pollution plumes on the other side christensen et al 2000 to consider predominant groundwater redox conditions at the site samples for hydrochemical parameter analysis were taken despite a temporary entry of oxygen the predominant conditions were anaerobic fig 3 shows orp fig 3a the oxygen concentration fig 3b the ferrous iron concentration fig 3c and the sulfate concentration fig 3d during the same sampling campaign in may 2012 described in section 3 1 2 with a westward directed groundwater flow redox conditions of the aquifer are mainly anaerobic resulting in orp between 130 mv and 240 mv eh fig 3a supplement table 2 the oxygen concentration was found to be below 0 1 mg l in most cases which confirms the anaerobic conditions at this contaminated site in the groundwater of very few wells oxygen concentrations were determined between 0 1 and 0 5 mg l indicating the dynamic conditions fig 3b supplement table 2 and an occasional input of oxygen at the site this occasional input of oxygen close to the riverbank could be demonstrated using a permanently installed multiparameter water quality sensor in one of the groundwater wells see section 3 1 4 the product of fe iii reduction ferrous iron was detected throughout the whole plume in concentrations from 0 5 to 9 5 mg l fig 3c supplement table 2 high ferrous iron concentrations are measured at the source areas of contamination indicating ferric iron reduction the electron acceptor sulfate was detected in concentrations from 25 to 200 mg l fig 3d supplement table 2 the high sulfate concentrations in the source areas gwm 7 153 mg l gwm 9 56 4 mg l may be the result of construction waste disposal from the former gas plant buildings it is feasible that sulfate reduction took place in those areas but the process was not identifiable on basis of decreasing sulfate concentrations one explanation could be that the sulfate reduction was inhibited or slowed down by high pollutant concentrations and contaminant matrix regarding to toxic effects in the source areas as described in previous studies lerner et al 2000 thornton et al 2001 nevertheless the quantification of iron sulfides is difficult because of the precipitation processes of iron sulfides but sulfate concentration decreased eastward towards the river rhine which indicated sulfate reduction processes at the site beside sulfate reduction processes the decrease of sulfate could be due to the infiltration of surface water to the aquifer the sulfate concentration levels of the river rhine differed from 19 5 mg l to 33 mg l over the year 2011 further analysis showed that the detection of the reduced product sulfide was rare probably due to precipitation processes microbiological investigations with mpn tests showed the existence of sulfate reducing bacteria in some of the wells gwm 9 gwm 10 gwm 27 gwm 25 at the sampling campaign in may 2012 see supplement table 2 concentrations of dissolved methane were high in the area of the secondary source gwm 9 1 500 μg l indicating methanogenesis see supplement table 2 1 2 2 methane concentrations were also high in groundwater wells of the plume gwm 17 1 200 μg l gwm 25 940 μg l methane as well as ferrous iron and sulfide compete for soluble electron acceptors like oxygen or nitrate van breukelen and griffioen 2004 beside the degradation processes of contaminants this may be another reason for the rare findings of oxygen and nitrate for more information table 2 in the supplement shows pollutant concentrations and redox conditions at the site the pattern of electron acceptors and the transformation into reduced species is evidence for microbial activity at the contaminated site tiehm and schulze 2003 furthermore using continuous sensor technique an occasional input of oxygen was observed close to the riverbank which indicated a refill of electron acceptors into the aquifer in the following section the dynamics are shown for one of the groundwater wells gwm 15 3 1 4 dynamics of pollutant concentration and oxygen availability electron acceptor availability pollutant concentrations in the monitoring wells varied throughout the major sampling campaigns a categorisation in expanding stable or shrinking plume is not possible by a standard pollutant monitoring program at sites which are affected by frequent changes in flow conditions for example striking differences in concentrations over time were shown for groundwater well gwm 15 located 150 m west of river rhine that was selected for weekly monitoring over six months in 2011 this well was located between a contamination source gwm 16 located 200 m west of the river and the river rhine over a period of six months concentrations of btex indane and indene epa pahs 1 methylnaphthalene 2 methylnaphthalene and 1 4 dimethylnaphthalene as well as 38 nso het were correlated with the surface water level fig 4 shows the relationship between overall pollutant concentrations of mahs pahs and nso het and surface water level during periods of lower surface water levels april and may the concentrations of mahs pahs and nso het increased significantly as surface water levels began to rise june to july pollutant concentrations decreased and at the end of the measuring campaign with decreasing surface water levels the pollutant concentrations increased again the results show clearly that the water level of the surface water influenced pollutant concentrations in the groundwater additionally the permanently installed multiparameter groundwater sensor in gwm 17 showed an occasional input of oxygen into the groundwater from sept 2011 till august 2012 fig 5 a temporary increase of oxygen concentration during flood times was observed and was correlated with orp measurements these results were recorded frequently and were reproducible during the two years of sensor operation the evidence of dissolved oxygen in the groundwater was of high importance as the biodegradability of at least some tar oil pollutants strongly depended on the availability of this electron acceptor the oxygen concentration in the groundwater was not directly correlated with the surface water level during december and january high surface water levels resulted in oxygen concentrations of more than 2 mg l in june similar surface water levels were measured but oxygen concentrations were much lower 0 5 mg l data on rhine water quality showed a significant lower oxygen concentration in june 7 6 8 0 mg l than in january 11 9 12 5 mg l the potential of oxygen input was therefore higher in january in addition metabolic processes in soil and groundwater are less active at low temperatures probably resulting in higher oxygen concentrations in the groundwater as mentioned before methane ferrous iron and sulfide compete for soluble electron acceptors van breukelen and griffioen 2004 methane concentrations in gwm 17 differ from the winter campaign in november 2011 750 μg l to the summer campaign in may 2012 1200 μg l indicating another explanation for lower oxygen concentrations in may and june table 2 in the supplement 3 2 microcosms studies microcosm studies were conducted to simulate the dynamics of changing redox conditions under controlled conditions in the laboratory to better understand the varying na processes at the site oxygen tolerance of ferric iron and sulfate reducing bacteria were examined therefore for the first 310 days anaerobic conditions were induced then the conditions were changed into aerobic conditions whereas the addition of oxygen seemed to lead to an increase of the number of ferric iron reducing bacteria no more sulfate reducing bacteria were detected after experimental day 310 table 3 in the supplement lists oxygen and ferric iron concentrations as well as cell counts of ferrous iron and sulfate reducing bacteria during the experiment the results show a toxic effect of oxygen on the sulfate reducing species considered in this test the effect indicates that bacteria with a broad physiological tolerance are in advantage at sites with transient groundwater flow conditions deangelis et al 2010 describe significant higher cell counts of active bacteria in tests with fluctuating redox conditions compared to tests with static redox potential under transient redox conditions and especially with additional oxygen input bacteria must be able to tolerate oxygen at least for a certain amount of time and defend cells from oxygen radicals the ability to synthesise special enzymes like superperoxidase is directly related to the oxygen tolerance of bacteria fu et al 2015 imlay 2013 the findings of our study demonstrated oxygen tolerance of some anaerobic bacteria e g ferric iron reducing bacteria suggesting a higher oxygen tolerance of ferric iron than of sulfate reducing bacteria at the site according to lovley 1991 alternative electron acceptors for fe iii reducers include oxygen and nitrate the capability to use ferric iron as an electron acceptor is thus potentially more widespread than the capability of sulfate reduction this might be due to the higher energy yields for bacteria using ferric iron as an electron acceptor christensen et al 2000 lueders 2017 however oxygen tolerance and even growth of sulfate reducing bacteria under aerobic conditions is also described in literature lin et al 2004 in order to evaluate pollutant biodegradation under transient conditions relevant for the study site pollutant concentrations were measured during incubation time fig 6a results are shown for selected compounds representing predominant pollutants in the source areas and at the plume fringes respectively for the first 310 days the microcosms were operated under anaerobic ferric iron reducing conditions directly after sampling at day 310 aerobic conditions were implemented by dosage of air as discussed in sections 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 it is likely that sulfate reduction takes place at the site however we observed mainly on ferric iron reducing processes in our microcosm studies in the microcosms sulfate concentrations were monitored and differed between 66 and 68 mg l no significant decrease of sulfate could be detected during the experimental time whereas the concentration of dissolved iron increases in addition the cell counts of sulfate reducing bacteria did not increase but those of fe lll reducing bacteria fig 3 supplement all three active microcosms showed similar results regarding mahs indane and toluene degradation was observed during ferric iron reducing conditions after the dosage of oxygen and the generation of aerobic condition benzene and indene were also degraded in contrast to benzene and toluene the bicyclic mahs indane and indene are not measured routinely although their occurrence at tar oil contaminated sites is evident mundt et al 2003 richnow et al 2003 literature reports on the microbial degradation of those two constituents are rare the fast and complete degradation of indane under ferric iron reducing conditions in our study suggested its potential of anaerobic biodegradation concentrations of indene however remained stable until the implementation of aerobic conditions kim et al 2011 describe the aerobic degradation of indane the bacterium was able to grow with indane as sole carbon and energy source but not with indene however our study was able to show the aerobic degradation of indene in the case of anaerobic benzene degradation differing results are described in the literature e g jahn et al 2005 foght 2008 and lueders 2017 describe the biodegradation of benzene and toluene under anaerobic conditions the persistence of benzene however is described as well and in addition various substrate interactions can inhibit the degradation of benzene foght 2008 johnson et al 2003 obviously no appropriate microorganisms for anaerobic benzene degradation were present in the microcosms of our current study but substrate interactions potentially disturbing the aerobic degradation were also not observed with oxygen as electron acceptor all mahs were degraded during the experiment regarding the pahs naphthalene was also degraded under ferric iron reducing conditions the concentration of acenaphthene remained more or less stable until the first dosage of air at day 310 the microbial degradation of naphthalene proceeds under various conditions and is well described e g by meckenstock et al 2000 the relative enrichment of acenaphthene in relation to naphthalene indicates na processes at contaminated sites schulze and tiehm 2004 tiehm and schulze 2003 furthermore fig 6b shows the degradation of prominent nso het of the site during the microcosm studies microbial degradation of some of the n and o het started under fe iii reducing conditions and was completed with the availability of oxygen as electron acceptor concerning the s het no degradation occurred during fe lll reducing conditions after the dosage of air a rapid degradation of carbazole benzothiophene 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran and dibenzofuran took place as well the anaerobic degradation of indole and quinoline is well described in the literature and summarized in fetzner 1998 none of the s het was degraded during the ferric iron reducing part of the biodegradation test s het are often more toxic than their o het n het or pah analogue eisenträger et al 2008 therefore the elimination of these substances is of special interest and the results of our study suggest that the pollutants are degraded as soon as oxygen as an electron acceptor is available at a contaminated site although benzothiophene was not degraded under ferric iron reducing conditions in the laboratory experiments investigations in the field and model results suggested anaerobic benzothiophene degradation see section 3 3 3 regarding biodegradation of benzofuran co metabolic processes are also discussed in literature dyreborg et al 1997 safinowski et al 2006 however in our study degradation started rapidly and was complete studies by dyreborg et al 1997 provided evidence of aerobic dibenzofuran degradation apparently dibenzofuran can be used as primary substrate monna et al 1993 and can also be degraded co metabolically becher et al 2000 microcosm studies represent an essential component of the multiple lines of evidence approach to assess na processes at contaminated sites particularly for constituents that have not been previously studied for commonly monitored constituents there is an increasing reliance on diagnostic tools like compound specific stable isotope analysis csia or multielement csia me csia allowing for the differentiation of degradation pathways and distinguishing from biodegradation and abiotic transformation kuntze et al 2020 in this study microcosms demonstrated anaerobic biodegradation with fe iii for many compounds the demonstration of the effect of hydraulic dynamics by dosage with air after incubation under anaerobic conditions clearly showed the positive effect on microbial degradation by providing oxygen as electron acceptor in comparison in the field studies the temporary increase of oxygen concentration at the groundwater well see fig 5 might accelerate or support microbial degradation of constituents of tar oil however since the number of sampling points for microcosms is limited not all processes occurring in the field might be shown in the lab therefore additional evidence for pollutant degradation was obtained by reactive transport modelling 3 3 groundwater modelling 3 3 1 transient flow simulations the water level in the river rhine varied by about 4 m during the two and a half years considered in the model the typical duration of low and high water conditions was several weeks the water level of the river was resolved on a weekly basis resulting in 135 model periods the flow model was calibrated against the groundwater levels recorded for a period of 2 years and 2 months in the monitoring wells gwm 1 gwm 10 and gwm 13 located at the former gasworks site see fig 1 the critical model parameter adapted during flow calibration was the storage coefficient of the aquifer where confined conditions prevailed the general trends in water levels are well reproduced in the model shown for gmw 10 in fig 5 in the supplement however the extreme values were underestimated an explanation for this could be that the only driving forces for water level fluctuations in the model were the water level changes in the river rhine in reality seasonal changes of regional groundwater recharge would also influence water levels the calibrated transient flow model formed the basis for the subsequent transport simulations 3 3 2 range of influence of the river water as discussed infiltration of aerobic river water into the otherwise anaerobic aquifer provides an important source of oxidation capacity in the aquifer which in turn provides the possibility of subsurface contaminant sulfide and ferrous iron fe ii oxidation in addition to oxygen other electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate are dissolved in the river water the nitrate concentration in the water of river rhine in 2011 ranged from 4 7 mg l to 9 3 mg l the sulfate concentrations from 19 5 mg l to 33 mg l fig 4 in the supplement shows the sulfate concentration in gwm 15 related with the water level of the river sulfate concentrations were low 5 10 mg l at low water levels and increased 30 mg l with the rising water level as the supply of dissolved oxidants by the river was supposed to be essential for the assessment of in situ degradation processes the numerical model was first applied to quantify the amount of river water rich in oxygen and other electron acceptors entering the aquifer during flood events this was accomplished by treating river water as a virtual model species and then simulating transport of the species river water from the river into the adjacent aquifer in the transient groundwater model the model results were compared to the observed oxygen concentrations data collected by the multiparameter probe installed in monitoring well gwm 17 near the riverbank see section 3 1 4 fig 7 shows the comparison between measured oxygen concentrations and the simulated fraction of river water at the well for comparison water level in the river rhine gauge philippsburg located about 5 km downstream of the gasworks site is shown the simulations showed four distinct periods with increasing amounts of river water in the aquifer caused by flood events it can also be seen that not every single flood event in the river resulted in an increase in simulated river water content in the aquifer rather the simulated river water content was not only controlled by the water level in the river itself but was also depending e g on the preceding water level history in the aquifer the oxygen recording in the sampling well started in september 2011 the simulated increase in river water fraction beginning in december 2011 coincided with an increase in oxygen concentrations in the aquifer increased oxygen contents could also be seen for the following two simulated flood events although the calculated river water fraction was not directly proportional to the observed oxygen contents moreover enhanced oxygen contents showed up only at the beginning of the simulated penetration of river water into the aquifer the oxygen increase vanished during the flood period this effect might be caused by naturally occurring oxygen consuming processes in the aquifer despite these deviations the semi quantitative comparison was sufficient to show that the model was able to reproduce the periodical penetration of river water into the aquifer and therefore to outline the range of influence of river water this range in turn was used to delineate a zone of possible aerobic degradation processes in the model 3 3 3 simulation of contaminant transport the goal of the transport simulations was to predict the observed concentration levels of the seven model species in the 28 sampling locations at the gasworks site or its vicinity the transport model calibration was an iterative process where the model parameters mainly contaminant release rates and degradation rates were adjusted to reproduce the important trends in concentration behavior due to the unknown detailed distribution of either hydrogeological and hydrochemical parameters and the limited temporal resolution of transient groundwater flow an exact reproduction of the observed values was not feasible seven distinct areas with contaminant loading were located in the model at the gasworks site see table 4 and fig 7 in the supplement some of these areas were substantiated by independent site investigations while others were evidenced from model calibration only the total contaminant release rate in the model amounted to about 170 g d sum over the seven model species further contaminant sources e g by groundwater recharge or by boundary fluxes were not considered in the model initial concentrations were set to zero for all contaminants with the calibrated release rates and without considering any degradation processes the contaminant concentrations at the more distal sampling points were clearly overestimated by the model reducing the release rates would help to improve simulation results in the downstream areas of the gasworks site however it would also lead to too low simulated contaminant concentrations at the sampling points close to the contamination sources it can be excluded that the overestimation at the distal sampling points was caused by a completely incorrect simulation of groundwater flow as the mean flow conditions were confirmed by water level samplings and were clearly defined by the vicinity of the river rhine which acted as major groundwater recipient the only way to accomplish both elevated concentrations close to the sources and lower concentrations in the downstream area was to assume contaminant degradation processes in the model this assumption was supported by the field studies and the experimental findings on contaminant degradation described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the effect of aerobic degradation processes on contaminant transport was shown for acenaphthene at a sampling point close to the river rhine gwm 17 where partly aerobic periods presumably lead to highly efficient contaminant degradation fig 6 in the supplement it is shown that degradation must have a major effect on acenaphthene fate at this sampling point for neglecting degradation in the model scenario leads to enhanced acenaphthene levels not observed in reality no anaerobic degradation was assumed for acenaphthene carbazole and 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran in the model these findings from model calibration are in agreement with the experimental findings presented in section 3 2 where the three compounds mentioned above showed no degradation under fe iii reducing conditions for benzene model calibrations suggested a relatively rapid degradation also in the reducing parts of the aquifer while the experimental studies showed no benzene degradation under fe iii reducing conditions model results also hint on a certain degradation of benzothiophene and dibenzofuran in the anaerobic part of the aquifer while microcosm studies showed no degradation under fe iii reducing conditions the reasons for these deviations are not clear naphthalene was degraded under anaerobic conditions in the model as well as in the microcosm studies in contrast to the situation in the anaerobic parts of the aquifer all seven contaminants were degraded in the model in the partially aerobic region close the riverbank where periodical flood events provided dissolved oxygen to the aquifer the rapid degradation process under aerobic conditions was implemented in the transport model by assuming enhanced degradation rates for all contaminants in the partially aerobic part aquifer as delineated by the special simulations presented in section 3 3 2 this model assumption was confirmed by the experimental studies where these species showed a rapid degradation as soon as oxygen was supplied to the system in fig 8 the effect of the aerobic area is exemplified for acenaphthene distribution for a typical low water situation in the river the assumption of an enhanced degradation process in the model for the aquifer close to the river was supported by the experimental findings for aerobic acenaphthene degradation and moreover by the low acenaphthene concentrations in the groundwater of wells gwm 17 gwm 25 and gwm 26 additionally the model was run for a hypothetical scenario where aerobic degradation near the river was not active in this scenario acenaphthene should reach the riverbank and the acenaphthene values in gwm 17 gwm 25 and gwm 26 should be enhanced which was not observed during the field studies 4 conclusions and perspectives the study demonstrated the characterisation of microbial degradation processes of tar oil contaminants under transient groundwater flow and redox conditions at a tar oil contaminated site located in the upper rhine valley south west germany a multiple evidence concept was thus considered including field studies microcosm studies in the laboratory and groundwater modelling the following aspects were demonstrated microbial degradation was observed as key process of na processes at the contaminated site based on the analysis of 78 pollutants indane indene and several nso het like carbazole benzothiophene and 2 methyldibenzofuran are recommended for consideration in na monitoring concepts at tar oil polluted sites in addition to epa pahs and btex analysis by using sensor technique the frequent infiltration of oxygen into the aquifer could be proven which seems to have a stimulating effect on intrinsic biodegradation and plays an important role for re oxidation of fe ii and therefore a recycling of the electron acceptor fe iii frequent monitoring of pollutants proved an impact of the surface water on pollutant concentrations field and laboratory data were used to set up a groundwater flow and reactive transport model for quantification of the field mass transfer rates in conclusion the study demonstrates that na processes are very effective for tar oil pollutants under transient groundwater conditions the site conditions result in a strikingly short pollutant plume with the application of groundwater modelling the processes identified during field and laboratory studies were brought into accordance with the transient groundwater flow conditions at the site the model helped to delineate the range of influence of aerobic river water and to quantify contaminant release and degradation processes the model results suggest that na leads to a complete contaminant removal during a relatively short groundwater passage mainly triggered by the periodical influx of oxygen rich river water during flood events thus the model accords with the field data of the site to our knowledge our study shows the effects of transient groundwater conditions on na of 78 mono poly and nso heterocyclic compounds for the first time the combination of field studies including sensor techniques microcosms in the lab and reactive transport simulation can facilitate the interpretation of pronounced fluctuations of pollutant concentrations and seems a suitable concept to manage the contaminated site the study demonstrate that na can reliably contribute to pollutant elimination at contaminated sites with dynamic

1360,natural attenuation na processes have been demonstrated to reduce pollutant loads at different contaminated groundwater sites world wide and are increasingly considered in contaminated site management concepts however data are mainly available for steady state groundwater flow and stable redox conditions as well as pollutants listed in standard regulatory schemes in this study the influence of transient groundwater flow and redox conditions on na was examined at a former gas works site near the river rhine in germany the investigated 78 pollutants included 40 mono and polyaromatic hydrocarbons mahs pahs and 38 nso heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons nso het in the highly polluted areas the mahs benzene indene and indane the pahs naphthalene acenaphthene 1 and 2 methylnaphthalene and the nso het 2 methylquinoline carbazole benzothiophene dibenzofuran and benzofuran were predominant pollutant concentrations decreased with increasing distance from the sources of contamination at the plume fringes the mahs benzene and indane the pah acenaphthene the nso het carbazole 5 methylbenzothiophene 2 and 3 methylbenzofuran and 2 methyldibenzofuran were predominant indicating low retention and slow intrinsic biodegradation of these compounds the influence of surface water on groundwater level pollutant concentrations and redox conditions in the monitoring wells was observed with a permanently installed groundwater sensor the temporary availability of oxygen was observed at the plume fringes resulting in aerobic and ferric iron reducing biodegradation processes field and laboratory data were used to set up a groundwater flow and reactive transport model used for quantification of the field mass transfer rates in conclusion the study demonstrates that na is effective under transient flow and redox conditions a conceptual model and reactive transport simulation can facilitate the interpretation of pronounced fluctuations of pollutant concentration in monitoring wells based on the analysis of 78 pollutants indane indene and several nso het like carbazole benzothiophene and 2 methyldibenzofuran are recommended for monitoring at tar oil polluted sites besides epa pahs and btex keywords pah mah heterocyclic compounds biodegradation groundwater modelling tar oil pollutants 1 introduction tar oil processing plants gasworks sites and abandoned deposit sites containing gasworks residues have caused a large number of long lasting soil and groundwater contamination issues natural attenuation na is defined as a wide range of processes happening without human intervention such as evaporation dilution biodegradation and adsorption similarly monitored natural attenuation means the extensive monitoring of the natural processes in soil and groundwater brown et al 2017 u s epa 1999 monitored natural attenuation mna concepts became a reliable and economic method to manage a wide range of contaminated sites in germany and other parts of the world declercq et al 2012 rügner et al 2006 the crucial process of mna concepts is microbial degradation as it leads to an effective reduction of pollutant loads at contaminated sites schulze and tiehm 2004 during bioremediation processes organic pollutants serve as carbon sources whereas oxygen nitrate ferric iron sulfate and carbonates are used as electron acceptors the energy yield differs strongly depending on the available electron acceptor the most powerful electron acceptors are oxygen and nitrate followed by ferric iron borch et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2011 tiehm and schulze 2003 in order to apply an mna concept as a remediation option the plume needs to be stationary quasi stationary or shrinking and degradation needs to be proved blum et al 2011 rügner et al 2006 at sites with steady state conditions a depletion of the electron acceptors oxygen nitrate and sulfate as well as the increase of biodegradation products like ferrous iron sulfide and methane indicate active microbial processes within the plume schulze and tiehm 2004 studies with focus on mna concepts for contaminations with groundwater surface water interactions are rare so far manufacturing sites were often built near major rivers allowing easy transport of raw material and products to or from the site the direct vicinity of surface water with temporarily varying water levels could lead to transient groundwater flow and redox conditions that could improve availability of nutrients and electron acceptors lee et al 2001 observed that besides biodegradation seasonal groundwater recharge was the most important factor controlling the distribution of hydrocarbon contaminants within a sandy aquifer fritz and arntzen 2007 demonstrated a relationship between hydraulic gradient changes due to river fluctuations and uranium fluxes discharging to the river meckenstock et al 2015 described that biodegradation activity was controlled by the availability of specific electron acceptors rather than by thermodynamics under transient conditions a better distribution of electron acceptors in an aquifer is feasible different effects of transient groundwater conditions on na are possible in most cases the surface water will contain higher concentrations of dissolved electron acceptors such as nitrate sulfate or oxygen than the corresponding contaminated aquifer recharge of those electron acceptors to the aquifer could thus have a positive effect on na scholl et al 2006 described the effect of seasonal changes of sulfate concentrations in a shallow alluvial aquifer the water of the canadian river near the site is seen as one of the main natural sources of sulfate in the groundwater this kind of recharge is not only related to the influence of surface waters van stempvoort et al 2007 described a seasonal infiltration of snowmelt water recharging the groundwater table and replenishing the contaminated zone with sulfate decreasing sulfate concentrations in the contaminant plume accompanied with an enrichment of sulfur isotope 34s indicated that sulfate reduction was a dominant terminal electron accepting process in the natural attenuation of the hydrocarbon plume in the ground water wei et al 2018 demonstrated that the implementation of monitoring approaches with isotopic and molecular biological procedures can improve the understanding of sulfate reductions processes in petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater as additional line of evidence recharge of dissolved electron acceptors whether due to an infiltration of surface water or groundwater formation can improve natural attenuation processes additionally the respiration product ferrous iron could be re oxidized into ferric iron also an efficient electron acceptor for example cozzarelli et al 2011 summarized results of 10 year study of an leachate affected aquifer and demonstrated with chemical and isotopic data from different monitoring strategies that measurable rates of fe reduction are consistent with the advance of the leachate plume into sediments in which relatively labile fe iii oxides were incompletely reduced as well as the regeneration of fe iii phases near the water table they confirmed groundwater surface water interactions and temporal variations in hydrologic flow need to be considered on the other hand anaerobic bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the presence of oxygen fu et al 2015 imlay 2013 a predominantly anaerobic microbial population could therefore suffer from frequently changing redox conditions and microbial degradation processes could be diminished due to infiltration of oxygen rich surface water into an aquifer meckenstock et al 2015 pointed out that if the prevailing geochemical conditions for microorganisms shift degraders must continuously follow or re establish in other strata those geochemical shifts could lead to kinetic limitation of biodegradation these aspects also play an important role when it comes to enhanced natural attenuation ena e g when oxygen is injected in an anaerobic aquifer as an electron acceptor not only the primary contaminant degradation but also competing mineral precipitation must be considered however increasing degradation rate constants were observed with the availability of oxygen herold et al 2011 in general for remediation of tar oil contaminated sites standard risk assessment protocols require the analysis of only a small subset of pollutants namely the 16 epa polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and 6 monoaromatic hydrocarbons btex tar oil contains thousands of organic pahs volatile aromatic compounds phenols and inorganic substances inorganic compounds of sulfur and nitrogen metals partly with high toxic potential and persistence to biodegradation logeshwaran et al 2018 in recent years the importance of increased analytical efforts to identify and monitor additional key compounds was demonstrated andersson and achten 2015a 2015b e g in case of nso heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons nso het for mna conditions blum et al 2011 the contamination of groundwater in such cases is dominated by the water soluble fraction of the coal tar due to their toxicity and higher polarity heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen sulfur or oxygen are increasingly included in monitoring programmes in addition to btex and pahs blum et al 2011 in the german federal soil protection ordinance the critical value for epa pahs and other relevant pahs such as quinoline is defined with 0 2 μg l the occurrence and distribution of nso het at tar oil contaminated sites has been investigated and presented in different studies blum et al 2011 tiehm et al 2008 blum et al 2011 pointed out that the comparison of three tar oil contaminated sites in germany showed longer plume lengths for nso het than for pahs ecotoxicity mutagenicity dioxin like and estrogenic activity of at least some nso het or their metabolites as well as the monoaromatic hydrocarbons indane and indene are already known and characterized brinkmann et al 2019a brinkmann et al 2019b brinkmann et al 2014a brinkmann et al 2014b eisenträger et al 2008 peddinghaus et al 2012 however nso het are not yet included in standard risk protocols beside nso het methylated naphthalenes and the monoaromatic carbocycles indane and indene are often reported at tar oil contaminated sites mundt and hollender 2005 schulze and tiehm 2004 but also not included in standard risk protocols toxicity tests on marine plankton organisms showed toxic effects towards different naphthalenes methylated naphthalenes were more toxic than naphthalene the toxicity was not dependent on the number of methyl groups but rather on their position on the naphthalene molecule falk petersen et al 1982 this study focused on the characterisation of microbial degradation processes under transient groundwater flow and variable redox conditions at a tar oil contaminated site located in the upper rhine valley south west germany the combination of field investigations laboratory studies and numerical modelling of groundwater flow and contaminant transport was applied to assess the influence of groundwater surface water interactions on na processes furthermore for the first time the degradation potential of nearly 80 tar oil pollutants was investigated to identify key constituents important for monitoring at tar oil contaminated sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling the gasworks site considered in this study was operated from 1867 to 1937 it is located in the upper rhine valley south west germany the production wastes of the gasworks were reused in a nearby impregnation site for railroad ties and served as levelling material in urban development source of contamination is the gasworks area itself and two secondary sources an impregnation site where tar oil products were used and a former pond filled with gasworks residues soil and groundwater are contaminated with typical tar oil pollutants i e mahs pahs nso het as well as phenols in the years 2010 2011 removal of hot spots by excavating polluted material from the former gasworks site took place in total 28 groundwater monitoring wells were set up covering the entire source and plume areas of the site and thus allowing for comprehensive monitoring the three source areas of contamination are located to the west between 150 m and 250 m of the receiving surface water the river rhine fig 1 flowing past the site at the east in the west the site is partly surrounded by a cut off meander of the river rhine and another small surface water called queich the shallow aquifer consists of sand and gravel layers representing a highly conductive aquifer typical for the upper rhine valley the average depth to groundwater is 4 5 m the thickness of the polluted aquifer ranges from 9 to 15 m with silt and clay layers of low permeability underneath separating the shallow aquifer from the deeper one the average value for hydraulic conductivity for the area is about 2 10 3 m s groundwater sampling at the field site was performed with a grundfoss mp1 pump according to general guidelines iso 2009 samples for chemical analysis were regularly taken over a period of three years between october 2010 and april 2013 all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark for up to 24 h prior to analysis 2 2 chemical analysis of tar oil pollutants samples for mah pah and nso het analysis were prepared using liquid liquid extraction 45 ml of the groundwater sample were spiked with 10 μl internal standard toluene d 8 and naphthalene d8 and 5 ml mtbe and extracted for 20 min after phase separation the extract was dried using sodium sulfate and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography agilent technologies gc 6890n the gc was equipped with an auto sampler agilent technologies and a mass selective detector agilent technologies ms 5973 network operated in sim single ion monitoring mode separation of the substances took place by a zb 5 inferno column 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm by phenomenex limits of detection are listed in table 2 of the supplementary data the relative deviation of standard procedure sx0 amounted to 10 regression coefficients ranged from 0 985 to 0 997 all used chemicals were of p a chemical purity all substances were purchased from abcr karlsruhe germany sigma deisenhofen germany alfa aesar karlsruhe germany ehrenstorfer augsburg germany or merck darmstadt germany 2 3 detection of ferrous iron and sulfate reducing bacteria ferrous iron and sulfate reducing bacteria were examined by the most probable number mpn method as described by stieber et al 1994 and tiehm and schmidt 2007 ferric iron reducing bacteria were detected by the formation of the respiration product ferrous iron that forms a red complex after bipyridin addition sulfate reducers were detected by iron sulfide precipitation after sulfide formation incubation and detection methods for ferric iron and sulfate reducing bacteria are described by schulze and tiehm 2004 and stieber et al 1994 2 4 hydrochemical parameters and multiparameter sensor during groundwater sampling oxygen was analysed on site by electrode measurements in a flow through chamber limit of detection 0 1 mg l nitrate limit of detection 1 0 mg l nitrite limit of detection 0 5 mg l and sulfate limit of detection 1 0 mg l were analysed by ion chromatography metrohm as described by zhao et al 2010 rapid test kits macherey nagel were used for sulfide ferric and ferrous iron quantification limit of detection 0 01 mg l automated monitoring of groundwater level and redox conditions was achieved by installing a multiparameter water quality sensor ysi 600xlm v2 s ecotech umweltmesssysteme gmbh bonn in observation well gwm 17 which is situated approximately 100 m to the west of the river rhine fig 1 oxygen concentration mg l redox potential mv ph and conductivity μs cm of the groundwater as well as the water level in the well were monitored every six hours and recorded continuously over a period of two years 2 5 pollutant biodegradation in microcosms for the microcosm studies in the laboratory autoclaved 2 l glass bottles were flushed with nitrogen before sampling groundwater samples were filled directly into the bottles used for incubation a stock solution was prepared by mixing mahs pahs and nso het and dissolving them in each other this resulted in widely differing concentrations of the substances e g indane 80 and toluene 650 μg l as acenaphthene was found in high enough concentrations of 30 μg l in the groundwater samples this compound was not added to the stock solution the experimental design included three active approaches and one sterile control to distinguish abiotic processes anaerobic experiments were conducted in a nitrogen flushed anaerobic chamber during the anaerobic phase of the experiments the microcosms were stored in vessels containing anaerogenic bags anaerogen from oxoid germany to diminish traces of oxygen and an oxygen indicator anaerobic indicator from oxoid germany the anaerogen bag rapidly absorbs the atmospheric oxygen present in the storage vessels and simultaneously evolves carbon dioxide samples were taken with glass syringes through a teflon coated septum fe iii in form of iron hydroxides feooh was supplied as described in schulze et al 2004 fe reducing conditions were maintained for 310 d after that period oxygen was added in order to simulate aerobic field conditions aerobic conditions were induced by repeated dosage of air the microcosms were incubated at 20 c 2 for 445 d the sterile control was inhibited by poisoning with sodium azide 2 6 groundwater modelling in order to consider hydraulic effects at the gasworks site in combination with the experimental findings on degradation processes a transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport model was developed the usgs tool modflow 2005 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and the transport model mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 were applied to simulate groundwater heads and pollutant concentrations the pmwin environment model chiang 2016 was used for pre and post processing of parameters and results the model simulations were run from october 2010 to april 2013 the pollutants considered in the transport model were acenaphthene naphthalene benzene benzothiophene dibenzofurane carbazole and 2 methyldibenzofurane covering typical substance classes found at the site the aim of the model application was to reproduce the interaction of hydraulic and hydrochemical processes and to quantify the effect of this interaction on contaminant release and degradation the model area stretched over 9 km in south north direction and 8 km in west east direction and was thus much larger than the actual gasworks site embedding the site into a larger flow model domain was necessary to minimize spurious boundary effects on model results in the vertical direction the model covered the shallow aquifer with the underlying low permeable silt and clay layers acting as an impermeable lower boundary the aquifer was resolved by an unconfined single model layer in the vicinity of the gasworks site the aquifer has a saturated thickness of about 10 m to 11 m the model domain was resolved with a grid of 10 m by 10 m size around the gasworks site the course of the river rhine which was close to the gasworks site formed the eastern boundary of the model area it was implemented in form of a leakage boundary 3rd type boundary the smaller watercourses visible in fig 1 were treated as 3rd type or leakage boundaries also the southern northern and western boundaries of the model domain were at a distance of 4 5 km to 6 5 km from the gasworks site not shown in fig 1 the western boundary was treated as a fixed head boundary 1st type boundary the southern and northern boundary as no flux boundaries 2nd type boundaries in the transport model contaminants enter the aquifer via a number of grid cells with a prescribed mass load mass per time the contaminant release cells were located manually by an inverse procedure such that the concentrations at the sampling points at the gas works site could be reproduced the degradation of contaminants was simulated using a first order degradation model with species dependent rate constants see table 5 in the supplement in order to reproduce contaminant spreading in the model it was not only necessary to consider degradation processes but also to differentiate between two degradation areas one is the gasworks site itself and most parts of its downstream area here reducing redox conditions prevailed and anaerobic processes presumably governed degradation i e by ferric iron reducing bacteria in this area lower degradation rates were specified the other degradation area was the vicinity of the riverbank where dissolved oxygen was provided by periodic flood events cf chapter 3 1 4 and where aerobic degradation processes might develop the degradation rates specified for the aerobic areas are much higher than those given for the anaerobic areas this was done to take into account that aerobic degradation is very efficient for the contaminants considered in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 field studies 3 1 1 groundwater flow direction groundwater levels were recorded at the monitoring wells gwm 1 gwm 10 and gwm 13 the evaluation of the head time series by hydrologic triangulation for 2 5 years 3636 data points per well showed a dominant groundwater flow eastward towards the river rhine for 54 of the overall flow situations during the monitoring period during flood events of the river the groundwater flow direction was reversed westward in 11 of the flow situations also any other direction of groundwater flow can occur at the site the frequency of groundwater flow directions is listed in table 1 of the supplement information 3 1 2 field studies on pollutant patterns groundwater samples for chemical analysis were taken at different time points cf section 2 1 fig 2 shows the distribution of pollutant concentrations of mahs pahs and nso het during the sampling campaign in may 2012 when the predominant groundwater flow direction was to the west the data were chosen because the sampling was during high water of the rhine and demonstrate the influence of the surface water to the groundwater aquifer a different method of displaying the data is shown in figs 1 and 2 of the supplement in general pollutant concentrations were found to be highest in the groundwater of the source areas gwm 7 gwm 9 and gwm 16 the concentrations in the mainly eastern directed plume decreased in direction towards the river rhine fig 2a shows the predominance of indene and indane in nearly all investigated groundwater wells in the source areas of contamination a significant proportion of the total pollutant concentration 25 gwm 7 more than 75 gwm 16 nearly 98 gmw 9 would not have been quantified by analysing only the standard risk parameters btex peripheral groundwater wells confirmed these results gwm 25 and gwm 26 the results illustrate that important information on e g the length of a plume and the contamination levels of source areas might not be obtained by focusing analysis on the group of btex contaminants these observations are confirmed in previous studies e g podgorski et al 2021 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 illustrate that concentrations of alkyl pahs heterocycles and of some presumed metabolites contribute to the overall concentration in the plume of the investigated gas works site in the case of the analysed pahs pollutant profiles were shifting as the concentration decreased from the contamination source to the plume fig 2b acenaphthene was predominant in most of the groundwater wells 0 1 360 μg l other studies confirm the persistence of acenaphthene which is often the only substance within the group of the 16 analysed epa pahs that is still detectable in the contamination plume tiehm and schmidt 2007 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 naphthalene occurs in high concentrations near the source area of the gasworks site 180 μg l as well as in the secondary source wells i e gwm 9 660 μg l and gwm 16 83 μg l the decrease of concentration of this very mobile compound in groundwater of the plume indicate microbiological activity near the source area limiting groundwater transport of naphthalene this observation is confirmed by previous studies schulze and tiehm 2004 in addition to the standard risk parameters 16 epa pahs 1 and 2 methylnaphthalene were analysed for 2 methylnaphthalene as well as for naphthalene an efficient biodegradation under anaerobic conditions is described the detection of these compounds can be seen as an indicator for contamination sources schulze and tiehm 2004 in contrast 1 methylnaphthalene shows higher persistence and was therefore detectable in the plume between 6 1 μg l and 25 μg l our results confirm this effect and are consistent with previous studies mundt and hollender 2005 tiehm and schmidt 2007 in conclusion the analysis of methylated naphthalenes provides additional information on microbiological degradation processes at contaminated sites in addition to the mahs and pahs nso het were also considered in our study fig 2c and d in total 38 nso heterocycles were examined 17 n heterocycles n het 13 s heterocycles s het and 8 heterocycles containing oxygen o het comparing the percentage shares of different pollutant groups o het seemed to be relevant in the source area as well as in the plume n het seemed to be relevant especially in the source area and nearby the source area s het accounted for the smallest proportion of the total nso het concentration concentrations of many of the analysed n het were below the limit of detection see table 2 in supplement including mono methylated quinolines and isoquinoline carbazole was the pollutant found in the highest concentrations near the sources as well as in many plume measuring wells for example in gwm 25 and gwm 26 there were only single findings of quinoline and 2 methylquinoline in the source area previous studies confirm the relevance of carbazole mundt and hollender 2005 further substances of the group of n het were 2 4 and 2 6 dimethylquinoline acridine and phenanthridine evidence of those substances was mainly limited to the source areas benzothiophene accounted for the largest proportion of s het in the source area concentrations decreased in the plume thiophene was detected solely in or near the source area dibenzothiophene the methylated benzothiophenes and dibenzothiophenes accounted for the total s het pollution in the further groundwater downstream wells considering o het only in the source area benzofuran and dibenzofuran accounted for a significant proportion of total o het concentration the wells in the direction of the river were primarily dominated by concentrations of 2 and 3 methylbenzofuran 2 methyldibenzofuran as well as 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran fig 2d similar to the findings of s het the methylated o het became more relevant from the source area to the different plume wells these observations are consistent with previous studies tiehm et al 2008 tiehm and schmidt 2007 and confirmed the importance of the analysis besides the routine parameters such as 16 epa pahs the heteroatoms within the ring structure induce a higher water solubility for nso het in comparison with their pah analogues and nso het are often more persistent towards biodegradation than other coal tar constituents therefore nso het form longer plumes in groundwater than pahs at some sites the evaluation of 10 field studies where the plume lengths of nso het btex and pahs are reported indicated higher field derived half lives for 2 3 methylbenzofuran 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran carbazole and benzothiophene as well as for the usually measured pollutants acenaphthene and benzene tiehm and schulze 2003 blum et al 2011 reineke 2008 safinowski et al 2006 focussing on only the 16 epa pahs and btex could lead to an underestimation of pollutant concentrations extent of contamination and the potential risk of exposure andersson and achten 2015b furthermore the plume length of mahs pahs and nso het at this site was comparatively short 150 200 m observed plume lengths at other tar oil contaminated sites are usually found to be longer than 250 m tiehm and schulze 2003 anneser et al 2008 blum et al 2011 safinowski et al 2006 3 1 3 groundwater redox conditions and field studies on patterns of redox sensitive parameters the evaluation of redox conditions in groundwater pollution plumes is necessary in order to understand pollutants behavior in the plume but rigorous interpretation of individual oxidation reduction potential orp values are not recommendable because of slow electrode kinetics on the one hand and the common lack of internal equilibrium of redox processes in pollution plumes on the other side christensen et al 2000 to consider predominant groundwater redox conditions at the site samples for hydrochemical parameter analysis were taken despite a temporary entry of oxygen the predominant conditions were anaerobic fig 3 shows orp fig 3a the oxygen concentration fig 3b the ferrous iron concentration fig 3c and the sulfate concentration fig 3d during the same sampling campaign in may 2012 described in section 3 1 2 with a westward directed groundwater flow redox conditions of the aquifer are mainly anaerobic resulting in orp between 130 mv and 240 mv eh fig 3a supplement table 2 the oxygen concentration was found to be below 0 1 mg l in most cases which confirms the anaerobic conditions at this contaminated site in the groundwater of very few wells oxygen concentrations were determined between 0 1 and 0 5 mg l indicating the dynamic conditions fig 3b supplement table 2 and an occasional input of oxygen at the site this occasional input of oxygen close to the riverbank could be demonstrated using a permanently installed multiparameter water quality sensor in one of the groundwater wells see section 3 1 4 the product of fe iii reduction ferrous iron was detected throughout the whole plume in concentrations from 0 5 to 9 5 mg l fig 3c supplement table 2 high ferrous iron concentrations are measured at the source areas of contamination indicating ferric iron reduction the electron acceptor sulfate was detected in concentrations from 25 to 200 mg l fig 3d supplement table 2 the high sulfate concentrations in the source areas gwm 7 153 mg l gwm 9 56 4 mg l may be the result of construction waste disposal from the former gas plant buildings it is feasible that sulfate reduction took place in those areas but the process was not identifiable on basis of decreasing sulfate concentrations one explanation could be that the sulfate reduction was inhibited or slowed down by high pollutant concentrations and contaminant matrix regarding to toxic effects in the source areas as described in previous studies lerner et al 2000 thornton et al 2001 nevertheless the quantification of iron sulfides is difficult because of the precipitation processes of iron sulfides but sulfate concentration decreased eastward towards the river rhine which indicated sulfate reduction processes at the site beside sulfate reduction processes the decrease of sulfate could be due to the infiltration of surface water to the aquifer the sulfate concentration levels of the river rhine differed from 19 5 mg l to 33 mg l over the year 2011 further analysis showed that the detection of the reduced product sulfide was rare probably due to precipitation processes microbiological investigations with mpn tests showed the existence of sulfate reducing bacteria in some of the wells gwm 9 gwm 10 gwm 27 gwm 25 at the sampling campaign in may 2012 see supplement table 2 concentrations of dissolved methane were high in the area of the secondary source gwm 9 1 500 μg l indicating methanogenesis see supplement table 2 1 2 2 methane concentrations were also high in groundwater wells of the plume gwm 17 1 200 μg l gwm 25 940 μg l methane as well as ferrous iron and sulfide compete for soluble electron acceptors like oxygen or nitrate van breukelen and griffioen 2004 beside the degradation processes of contaminants this may be another reason for the rare findings of oxygen and nitrate for more information table 2 in the supplement shows pollutant concentrations and redox conditions at the site the pattern of electron acceptors and the transformation into reduced species is evidence for microbial activity at the contaminated site tiehm and schulze 2003 furthermore using continuous sensor technique an occasional input of oxygen was observed close to the riverbank which indicated a refill of electron acceptors into the aquifer in the following section the dynamics are shown for one of the groundwater wells gwm 15 3 1 4 dynamics of pollutant concentration and oxygen availability electron acceptor availability pollutant concentrations in the monitoring wells varied throughout the major sampling campaigns a categorisation in expanding stable or shrinking plume is not possible by a standard pollutant monitoring program at sites which are affected by frequent changes in flow conditions for example striking differences in concentrations over time were shown for groundwater well gwm 15 located 150 m west of river rhine that was selected for weekly monitoring over six months in 2011 this well was located between a contamination source gwm 16 located 200 m west of the river and the river rhine over a period of six months concentrations of btex indane and indene epa pahs 1 methylnaphthalene 2 methylnaphthalene and 1 4 dimethylnaphthalene as well as 38 nso het were correlated with the surface water level fig 4 shows the relationship between overall pollutant concentrations of mahs pahs and nso het and surface water level during periods of lower surface water levels april and may the concentrations of mahs pahs and nso het increased significantly as surface water levels began to rise june to july pollutant concentrations decreased and at the end of the measuring campaign with decreasing surface water levels the pollutant concentrations increased again the results show clearly that the water level of the surface water influenced pollutant concentrations in the groundwater additionally the permanently installed multiparameter groundwater sensor in gwm 17 showed an occasional input of oxygen into the groundwater from sept 2011 till august 2012 fig 5 a temporary increase of oxygen concentration during flood times was observed and was correlated with orp measurements these results were recorded frequently and were reproducible during the two years of sensor operation the evidence of dissolved oxygen in the groundwater was of high importance as the biodegradability of at least some tar oil pollutants strongly depended on the availability of this electron acceptor the oxygen concentration in the groundwater was not directly correlated with the surface water level during december and january high surface water levels resulted in oxygen concentrations of more than 2 mg l in june similar surface water levels were measured but oxygen concentrations were much lower 0 5 mg l data on rhine water quality showed a significant lower oxygen concentration in june 7 6 8 0 mg l than in january 11 9 12 5 mg l the potential of oxygen input was therefore higher in january in addition metabolic processes in soil and groundwater are less active at low temperatures probably resulting in higher oxygen concentrations in the groundwater as mentioned before methane ferrous iron and sulfide compete for soluble electron acceptors van breukelen and griffioen 2004 methane concentrations in gwm 17 differ from the winter campaign in november 2011 750 μg l to the summer campaign in may 2012 1200 μg l indicating another explanation for lower oxygen concentrations in may and june table 2 in the supplement 3 2 microcosms studies microcosm studies were conducted to simulate the dynamics of changing redox conditions under controlled conditions in the laboratory to better understand the varying na processes at the site oxygen tolerance of ferric iron and sulfate reducing bacteria were examined therefore for the first 310 days anaerobic conditions were induced then the conditions were changed into aerobic conditions whereas the addition of oxygen seemed to lead to an increase of the number of ferric iron reducing bacteria no more sulfate reducing bacteria were detected after experimental day 310 table 3 in the supplement lists oxygen and ferric iron concentrations as well as cell counts of ferrous iron and sulfate reducing bacteria during the experiment the results show a toxic effect of oxygen on the sulfate reducing species considered in this test the effect indicates that bacteria with a broad physiological tolerance are in advantage at sites with transient groundwater flow conditions deangelis et al 2010 describe significant higher cell counts of active bacteria in tests with fluctuating redox conditions compared to tests with static redox potential under transient redox conditions and especially with additional oxygen input bacteria must be able to tolerate oxygen at least for a certain amount of time and defend cells from oxygen radicals the ability to synthesise special enzymes like superperoxidase is directly related to the oxygen tolerance of bacteria fu et al 2015 imlay 2013 the findings of our study demonstrated oxygen tolerance of some anaerobic bacteria e g ferric iron reducing bacteria suggesting a higher oxygen tolerance of ferric iron than of sulfate reducing bacteria at the site according to lovley 1991 alternative electron acceptors for fe iii reducers include oxygen and nitrate the capability to use ferric iron as an electron acceptor is thus potentially more widespread than the capability of sulfate reduction this might be due to the higher energy yields for bacteria using ferric iron as an electron acceptor christensen et al 2000 lueders 2017 however oxygen tolerance and even growth of sulfate reducing bacteria under aerobic conditions is also described in literature lin et al 2004 in order to evaluate pollutant biodegradation under transient conditions relevant for the study site pollutant concentrations were measured during incubation time fig 6a results are shown for selected compounds representing predominant pollutants in the source areas and at the plume fringes respectively for the first 310 days the microcosms were operated under anaerobic ferric iron reducing conditions directly after sampling at day 310 aerobic conditions were implemented by dosage of air as discussed in sections 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 it is likely that sulfate reduction takes place at the site however we observed mainly on ferric iron reducing processes in our microcosm studies in the microcosms sulfate concentrations were monitored and differed between 66 and 68 mg l no significant decrease of sulfate could be detected during the experimental time whereas the concentration of dissolved iron increases in addition the cell counts of sulfate reducing bacteria did not increase but those of fe lll reducing bacteria fig 3 supplement all three active microcosms showed similar results regarding mahs indane and toluene degradation was observed during ferric iron reducing conditions after the dosage of oxygen and the generation of aerobic condition benzene and indene were also degraded in contrast to benzene and toluene the bicyclic mahs indane and indene are not measured routinely although their occurrence at tar oil contaminated sites is evident mundt et al 2003 richnow et al 2003 literature reports on the microbial degradation of those two constituents are rare the fast and complete degradation of indane under ferric iron reducing conditions in our study suggested its potential of anaerobic biodegradation concentrations of indene however remained stable until the implementation of aerobic conditions kim et al 2011 describe the aerobic degradation of indane the bacterium was able to grow with indane as sole carbon and energy source but not with indene however our study was able to show the aerobic degradation of indene in the case of anaerobic benzene degradation differing results are described in the literature e g jahn et al 2005 foght 2008 and lueders 2017 describe the biodegradation of benzene and toluene under anaerobic conditions the persistence of benzene however is described as well and in addition various substrate interactions can inhibit the degradation of benzene foght 2008 johnson et al 2003 obviously no appropriate microorganisms for anaerobic benzene degradation were present in the microcosms of our current study but substrate interactions potentially disturbing the aerobic degradation were also not observed with oxygen as electron acceptor all mahs were degraded during the experiment regarding the pahs naphthalene was also degraded under ferric iron reducing conditions the concentration of acenaphthene remained more or less stable until the first dosage of air at day 310 the microbial degradation of naphthalene proceeds under various conditions and is well described e g by meckenstock et al 2000 the relative enrichment of acenaphthene in relation to naphthalene indicates na processes at contaminated sites schulze and tiehm 2004 tiehm and schulze 2003 furthermore fig 6b shows the degradation of prominent nso het of the site during the microcosm studies microbial degradation of some of the n and o het started under fe iii reducing conditions and was completed with the availability of oxygen as electron acceptor concerning the s het no degradation occurred during fe lll reducing conditions after the dosage of air a rapid degradation of carbazole benzothiophene 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran and dibenzofuran took place as well the anaerobic degradation of indole and quinoline is well described in the literature and summarized in fetzner 1998 none of the s het was degraded during the ferric iron reducing part of the biodegradation test s het are often more toxic than their o het n het or pah analogue eisenträger et al 2008 therefore the elimination of these substances is of special interest and the results of our study suggest that the pollutants are degraded as soon as oxygen as an electron acceptor is available at a contaminated site although benzothiophene was not degraded under ferric iron reducing conditions in the laboratory experiments investigations in the field and model results suggested anaerobic benzothiophene degradation see section 3 3 3 regarding biodegradation of benzofuran co metabolic processes are also discussed in literature dyreborg et al 1997 safinowski et al 2006 however in our study degradation started rapidly and was complete studies by dyreborg et al 1997 provided evidence of aerobic dibenzofuran degradation apparently dibenzofuran can be used as primary substrate monna et al 1993 and can also be degraded co metabolically becher et al 2000 microcosm studies represent an essential component of the multiple lines of evidence approach to assess na processes at contaminated sites particularly for constituents that have not been previously studied for commonly monitored constituents there is an increasing reliance on diagnostic tools like compound specific stable isotope analysis csia or multielement csia me csia allowing for the differentiation of degradation pathways and distinguishing from biodegradation and abiotic transformation kuntze et al 2020 in this study microcosms demonstrated anaerobic biodegradation with fe iii for many compounds the demonstration of the effect of hydraulic dynamics by dosage with air after incubation under anaerobic conditions clearly showed the positive effect on microbial degradation by providing oxygen as electron acceptor in comparison in the field studies the temporary increase of oxygen concentration at the groundwater well see fig 5 might accelerate or support microbial degradation of constituents of tar oil however since the number of sampling points for microcosms is limited not all processes occurring in the field might be shown in the lab therefore additional evidence for pollutant degradation was obtained by reactive transport modelling 3 3 groundwater modelling 3 3 1 transient flow simulations the water level in the river rhine varied by about 4 m during the two and a half years considered in the model the typical duration of low and high water conditions was several weeks the water level of the river was resolved on a weekly basis resulting in 135 model periods the flow model was calibrated against the groundwater levels recorded for a period of 2 years and 2 months in the monitoring wells gwm 1 gwm 10 and gwm 13 located at the former gasworks site see fig 1 the critical model parameter adapted during flow calibration was the storage coefficient of the aquifer where confined conditions prevailed the general trends in water levels are well reproduced in the model shown for gmw 10 in fig 5 in the supplement however the extreme values were underestimated an explanation for this could be that the only driving forces for water level fluctuations in the model were the water level changes in the river rhine in reality seasonal changes of regional groundwater recharge would also influence water levels the calibrated transient flow model formed the basis for the subsequent transport simulations 3 3 2 range of influence of the river water as discussed infiltration of aerobic river water into the otherwise anaerobic aquifer provides an important source of oxidation capacity in the aquifer which in turn provides the possibility of subsurface contaminant sulfide and ferrous iron fe ii oxidation in addition to oxygen other electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate are dissolved in the river water the nitrate concentration in the water of river rhine in 2011 ranged from 4 7 mg l to 9 3 mg l the sulfate concentrations from 19 5 mg l to 33 mg l fig 4 in the supplement shows the sulfate concentration in gwm 15 related with the water level of the river sulfate concentrations were low 5 10 mg l at low water levels and increased 30 mg l with the rising water level as the supply of dissolved oxidants by the river was supposed to be essential for the assessment of in situ degradation processes the numerical model was first applied to quantify the amount of river water rich in oxygen and other electron acceptors entering the aquifer during flood events this was accomplished by treating river water as a virtual model species and then simulating transport of the species river water from the river into the adjacent aquifer in the transient groundwater model the model results were compared to the observed oxygen concentrations data collected by the multiparameter probe installed in monitoring well gwm 17 near the riverbank see section 3 1 4 fig 7 shows the comparison between measured oxygen concentrations and the simulated fraction of river water at the well for comparison water level in the river rhine gauge philippsburg located about 5 km downstream of the gasworks site is shown the simulations showed four distinct periods with increasing amounts of river water in the aquifer caused by flood events it can also be seen that not every single flood event in the river resulted in an increase in simulated river water content in the aquifer rather the simulated river water content was not only controlled by the water level in the river itself but was also depending e g on the preceding water level history in the aquifer the oxygen recording in the sampling well started in september 2011 the simulated increase in river water fraction beginning in december 2011 coincided with an increase in oxygen concentrations in the aquifer increased oxygen contents could also be seen for the following two simulated flood events although the calculated river water fraction was not directly proportional to the observed oxygen contents moreover enhanced oxygen contents showed up only at the beginning of the simulated penetration of river water into the aquifer the oxygen increase vanished during the flood period this effect might be caused by naturally occurring oxygen consuming processes in the aquifer despite these deviations the semi quantitative comparison was sufficient to show that the model was able to reproduce the periodical penetration of river water into the aquifer and therefore to outline the range of influence of river water this range in turn was used to delineate a zone of possible aerobic degradation processes in the model 3 3 3 simulation of contaminant transport the goal of the transport simulations was to predict the observed concentration levels of the seven model species in the 28 sampling locations at the gasworks site or its vicinity the transport model calibration was an iterative process where the model parameters mainly contaminant release rates and degradation rates were adjusted to reproduce the important trends in concentration behavior due to the unknown detailed distribution of either hydrogeological and hydrochemical parameters and the limited temporal resolution of transient groundwater flow an exact reproduction of the observed values was not feasible seven distinct areas with contaminant loading were located in the model at the gasworks site see table 4 and fig 7 in the supplement some of these areas were substantiated by independent site investigations while others were evidenced from model calibration only the total contaminant release rate in the model amounted to about 170 g d sum over the seven model species further contaminant sources e g by groundwater recharge or by boundary fluxes were not considered in the model initial concentrations were set to zero for all contaminants with the calibrated release rates and without considering any degradation processes the contaminant concentrations at the more distal sampling points were clearly overestimated by the model reducing the release rates would help to improve simulation results in the downstream areas of the gasworks site however it would also lead to too low simulated contaminant concentrations at the sampling points close to the contamination sources it can be excluded that the overestimation at the distal sampling points was caused by a completely incorrect simulation of groundwater flow as the mean flow conditions were confirmed by water level samplings and were clearly defined by the vicinity of the river rhine which acted as major groundwater recipient the only way to accomplish both elevated concentrations close to the sources and lower concentrations in the downstream area was to assume contaminant degradation processes in the model this assumption was supported by the field studies and the experimental findings on contaminant degradation described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the effect of aerobic degradation processes on contaminant transport was shown for acenaphthene at a sampling point close to the river rhine gwm 17 where partly aerobic periods presumably lead to highly efficient contaminant degradation fig 6 in the supplement it is shown that degradation must have a major effect on acenaphthene fate at this sampling point for neglecting degradation in the model scenario leads to enhanced acenaphthene levels not observed in reality no anaerobic degradation was assumed for acenaphthene carbazole and 2 3 dimethylbenzofuran in the model these findings from model calibration are in agreement with the experimental findings presented in section 3 2 where the three compounds mentioned above showed no degradation under fe iii reducing conditions for benzene model calibrations suggested a relatively rapid degradation also in the reducing parts of the aquifer while the experimental studies showed no benzene degradation under fe iii reducing conditions model results also hint on a certain degradation of benzothiophene and dibenzofuran in the anaerobic part of the aquifer while microcosm studies showed no degradation under fe iii reducing conditions the reasons for these deviations are not clear naphthalene was degraded under anaerobic conditions in the model as well as in the microcosm studies in contrast to the situation in the anaerobic parts of the aquifer all seven contaminants were degraded in the model in the partially aerobic region close the riverbank where periodical flood events provided dissolved oxygen to the aquifer the rapid degradation process under aerobic conditions was implemented in the transport model by assuming enhanced degradation rates for all contaminants in the partially aerobic part aquifer as delineated by the special simulations presented in section 3 3 2 this model assumption was confirmed by the experimental studies where these species showed a rapid degradation as soon as oxygen was supplied to the system in fig 8 the effect of the aerobic area is exemplified for acenaphthene distribution for a typical low water situation in the river the assumption of an enhanced degradation process in the model for the aquifer close to the river was supported by the experimental findings for aerobic acenaphthene degradation and moreover by the low acenaphthene concentrations in the groundwater of wells gwm 17 gwm 25 and gwm 26 additionally the model was run for a hypothetical scenario where aerobic degradation near the river was not active in this scenario acenaphthene should reach the riverbank and the acenaphthene values in gwm 17 gwm 25 and gwm 26 should be enhanced which was not observed during the field studies 4 conclusions and perspectives the study demonstrated the characterisation of microbial degradation processes of tar oil contaminants under transient groundwater flow and redox conditions at a tar oil contaminated site located in the upper rhine valley south west germany a multiple evidence concept was thus considered including field studies microcosm studies in the laboratory and groundwater modelling the following aspects were demonstrated microbial degradation was observed as key process of na processes at the contaminated site based on the analysis of 78 pollutants indane indene and several nso het like carbazole benzothiophene and 2 methyldibenzofuran are recommended for consideration in na monitoring concepts at tar oil polluted sites in addition to epa pahs and btex analysis by using sensor technique the frequent infiltration of oxygen into the aquifer could be proven which seems to have a stimulating effect on intrinsic biodegradation and plays an important role for re oxidation of fe ii and therefore a recycling of the electron acceptor fe iii frequent monitoring of pollutants proved an impact of the surface water on pollutant concentrations field and laboratory data were used to set up a groundwater flow and reactive transport model for quantification of the field mass transfer rates in conclusion the study demonstrates that na processes are very effective for tar oil pollutants under transient groundwater conditions the site conditions result in a strikingly short pollutant plume with the application of groundwater modelling the processes identified during field and laboratory studies were brought into accordance with the transient groundwater flow conditions at the site the model helped to delineate the range of influence of aerobic river water and to quantify contaminant release and degradation processes the model results suggest that na leads to a complete contaminant removal during a relatively short groundwater passage mainly triggered by the periodical influx of oxygen rich river water during flood events thus the model accords with the field data of the site to our knowledge our study shows the effects of transient groundwater conditions on na of 78 mono poly and nso heterocyclic compounds for the first time the combination of field studies including sensor techniques microcosms in the lab and reactive transport simulation can facilitate the interpretation of pronounced fluctuations of pollutant concentrations and seems a suitable concept to manage the contaminated site the study demonstrate that na can reliably contribute to pollutant elimination at contaminated sites with dynamic

1361,in this paper an experimental study of nanoparticle transport by foam is presented bubbles made of n2 gas were stabilized with either a cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab silica nanoparticles or a combination of them the concentrations of the surface active materials were selected upon foamability and stability tests column flood tests were run until steady state changing nanoparticle concentration foam quality f g and flow rate a synergistic behaviour of surfactant and nanoparticles help the formation of a strong foam the measurements were used to validate a mechanistic model presented in our earlier work li and prigiobbe 2020 which couples foam and nanoparticles transport with agglomeration and extended dlvo theory the model agrees well with the measurements and results show that an high quality ca 90 gas fraction can be used to carry nanoparticles and the efficient increases with flow velocity this opens the opportunity for the application of foam as a carrier of nanoparticles in subsurface applications such as the remediation of contaminated sites and makes the model a valuable tool to design and predict such operations keywords agglomeration bubbles foam nanoparticles population balance equation transport in porous media 1 introduction wet foam or simply foam is a complex fluid consisting of gas bubbles dispersed in a liquid phase it is often referred to waterless fluid because the volume fraction of the gas phase can be up to 97 vol foam is injected into the subsurface to improve the gas mobility control as it increases the effective gas viscosity and allows to divert the gas towards low permeability zones li et al 2010 conn et al 2014 lake et al 2014 huh and prodanovi c 2019 it has been successfully employed in gas injection operations such as enhanced oil recovery eor to overcome problems of gravity segregation viscous fingering and early gas breakthrough ransohoff and radke 1988 rossen 1996 hirasaki et al 2000 farajzadeh et al 2012 foam has also been suggested as an alternative option to continuous gas injection in geological carbon dioxide co2 storage worthen et al 2014 lotfollahi et al 2017 rognmo et al

fractional flow theories zhou et al 1995 percolation models rossen 1990 and population balance equation pbe method kovscek et al 1995 kam and rossen 2003 all these methods focus on the description of the foam and water gas saturation when only surfactants are used to stabilize the bubbles in our earlier work li and prigiobbe 2020 we proposed a mechanistic model to describe the transport of foam and nanoparticles in a coupled manner simulation results show the potential to predict the evolution of foam texture in conjunction with nanoparticle transport in porous media however the model was validated only with few experiments from the literature in this paper we present a systematic experimental study of nanoparticle transport by foam to verify the proposed model in our earlier work li and prigiobbe 2020 optimal concentrations of surface active materials made of surfactant and nanoparticles were selected upon foamability and stability tests then column flood tests were run until steady state and the mechanistic model was used to describe the measurements of pressure nanoparticle concentration and water saturation as well as to gain an insight into foam and nanoparticle behaviour 2 mathematical model of nanoparticle transport by foam 2 1 transport model the transport of foam and nanoparticles was described by a one dimensional 1d transport model following our earlier

for the magnetic properties that are relevant for nzvi nanoparticles can be found in our previous work li and prigiobbe 2020 2 3 model implementation and calibration a finite difference scheme was developed to discretize the nonlinear system of eqs 1 2 and 10 approximated with a forward upstream weighted solution and integrated explicitly kam et al 2007 the domain was divided into a grid of n x

where the particle size distribution was divided into m classes of size with m equal to 60 the discretized model was then implemented in matlab mathworks matlab r2018a 2018 further details regarding the implementation of the model can be found in our previous work li and prigiobbe 2020 all model parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2 of the supplementary information si document overall they are

experiments to ensure identificability and reduce uncertainty in the parameter estimation we determined the parameter values from selected experiments for instance the values of k att k det and r max were estimated from tests of nanoparticle transport it was then assumed the behaviour of the nanoparticles in suspension is not modified by the presence of bubbles the values of x t max p r and β g were estimated from experiments where foam was stabilized only with surfactant as they depend on the porous medium geometry kovscek et al 1995 the values of c g m c c n s w c f and c e were estimated from tests of foam and nanoparticles transport 3 material and methods 3 1 materials silicon dioxide nanoparticles sio2 99 purity 8 nm us3437 us research nanomaterials produced by laser gas phase synthesis were used in this study the nanoparticles are characterized by a negatively change surface at the operating conditions applied ph 5 in this work the zeta potential measured with zetasizer nano malvern instruments u k was equal to 23 4 mv the large absolute value of the zeta potential ensures that the nanoparticles carry the same charge and therefore the aggregation is inhibited by repulsive electric forces therefore the nanoparticle suspension is stable details regarding the nanoparticles size distribution can be found in section 2 of the si document surfactant was obtained from a commercial manufacturer namely a cationic surfactant ctab cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide sigma aldrich suspensions of nanoparticles and solution of ctab and ctab and nanoparticles were created to stabilize foam the combination of ctab and silica nanoparticles was selected because it has been observed that cationic surfactants combined with negatively charged nanoparticles have a synergistic foaming effect binks and horozov 2005 binks et al 2008 carn et al 2009 tan et al 2010 providing a remarkable stability to foam duan et al 2014 singh and mohanty 2015 2017 sonn et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the nanoparticle suspension was prepared by dissolving the powder in ultra pure water milli q germany sonicating it for 1 h and then stirring it for 24 h similarly the surfactant was dissolved into ultra pure water milli q germany and stirred for 24 h the concentration of surfactant and nanoparticles were selected upon foamability and stability tests as described in section 3 2 herein 3 2 foamability and stability tests in order to select the composition of the suspension made of nanoparticle and surfactant ctab stability and foamability tests were conducted briefly a solution of ultra pure water of 10 ml with a known amount of surfactant and nanoparticles was prepared and mixed with a stirrer colorsquid ika works u s a for 5 min at the rate of 150 rpm then it was poured into a graduated cylinder and the evolution of the volume of the generated foam and of the liquid phase at the bottom of the cylinder were recorded 3 3 experimental set up a column flood system was built to test foam transport behaviour in the presence of nanoparticles and its scheme is reported in fig 1 the experimental system consisted of a column of 15 mm of diameter and 200 mm of length cole parmer u s a a piston pump cole parmer u s a a pressure transducer p61 validyne engineering u s a for the injection of the suspension and a gas flow controller f 210cv bronkhorst u s a the values of the darcy velocity considering a porosity of about 0 4 and the selected rates of 0 05 0 9 ml min changed between 7 10 4 and 1 2 10 2 m s these flow characteristics were selected as they can be found in field applications near the injection well where most foam generation is expected the column was packed with glass beads 430 600 μm p 0230 potters industries and nitrogen gas n2 99 99 purity welding supply u s a was injected to create the foam the permeability k m2 can be estimated from the kozeny carman equation because the porous medium consisted of glass spherical beads of known size distribution with a calculated average particle size d and porosity ϕ k ϕ 3 d 2 150 1 ϕ 2 the permeability changed between 2 4 10 10 m2 the pressure transducer allowed to monitor the pressure drop through the column while the fraction collector gilson fc203b u s a was used to grab samples for offline analyses of nanoparticles concentration with the uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent u s a a calibration curve was determined at the beginning of each test and an example is reported in part b of fig 2 of the si document 3 4 experimental procedures three types of experiments were carried out using the set up shown in fig 1 namely transport of nanoparticles transport of foam stabilized with surfactant ctab and transport of foam stabilized with surfactant ctab and nanoparticles 3 4 1 tests of transport of nanoparticles before each test of transport of nanoparticles the column was initially stabilized with ultra pure water at ph equal to 5 until the conductivity corning conductivity meter 441 u s a in the effluent reached a value of 0 06 μs cm corresponding to the value of injected water then a nanoparticle suspension of concentration of 1 5 and 10 g l was supplied to the column for approximately 10 pvi i e pvi u w t vϕ with v the total volume of the granular material within the column samples were collected at the outlet of the column diluted 5 20 times and characterized with the uv vis spectrophotometer for nanoparticle concentration determination 3 4 2 tests of transport of foam 3 4 2 1 foam stabilized with surfactant preliminary tests of transport of foam were carried out to select the injection procedure and the results are reported in section 3 of the si document measurements showed that a co injection into a column containing ultra pure water instead of saturated with surfactant solution created an unstable foam this is because in an initial stage of the experiment the gas phase sweeps through the column and bubbles generated due to snap off are not stabilized leading therefore to an unstable gas front therefore co injection into a pre saturated column was selected as a standard procedure in this work then n2 gas was co injected together with surfactant solution into the column the values of the total fluid velocity u t applied in these experiments were between 0 2 and 1 2 ml min during the tests the pressure drop across the column was recorded a fraction collector was used to take samples of the effluent which were then analyzed by weight using a micro scale analytical balance ms104ts mettler toledo u s a for the determination of the water saturation s w experiments to study the behaviour of the foam at steady state were also run they were conducted at selected liquid phase velocity u w and subsequent increase of gaseous phase velocity u g until the pressure drop across the column remained constant the duration of each test varied between 2 and 24 h depending on the gas velocity 3 4 2 2 foam stabilized with surfactant and nanoparticles in these experiments the column was pre saturated with surfactant and nanoparticle suspension with a composition selected upon foamability and stability tests n2 gas and the suspension were co injected until steady state identified as the time when the pressure drop stabilized around a constant value the column was continuously monitored with the pressure transducer the effluent was collected using the fraction collector and the samples were analyzed offline to determine water saturation and concentration of nanoparticles upon bubble breakage and dilution up to 5 20 times also tests of transport of foam and nanoparticles were run until steady state with a similar procedure described in the section above 4 results and discussion in this section the experimental and modeling results are reported and discussed in particular section 4 1 reports the results of the stability and foamability tests run to select the optimal composition of the suspension containing surfactant ctab and nanoparticles section 4 2 1 reports the results of nanoparticle transport finally section 4 2 2 reports the results of transport of foam stabilized with either surfactant or surfactant and nanoparticles 4 1 foamability and stability tests the results from foamability and stability tests are shown in fig 2 they were run using different compositions of surfactant and nanoparticle concentrations in this figure parts a and b show the initial foam volume as a function of surfactant and surfactant and nanoparticle concentrations parts c and d report the evolution of the liquid phase during drainage as it is possible to see in part a the volume of the foam increases with surfactant concentration until a value of 0 3 g l which is slightly below the critical micellae concentration cmc corresponding to 0 34 g l the results of the stability tests part c of fig 2 clearly show that there is not significant difference in liquid volume evolution at increasing surfactant concentration therefore a concentration equal to 0 5 g l slightly larger than cmc was selected for this work part b of this figure shows the experimental results of foamability for ctab equal to 0 5 g ml at various nanoparticle concentrations the results show negligible effect of nanoparticle on the foam volume contrary stability increases with nanoparticle concentration as it is evident from the liquid volume evolution reported in part d of fig 2 for nanoparticle concentration larger than 10 g l the foam stability increases significantly however to avoid the blockage of the pore space kim et al 2015 phenrat et al 2007 concentrations lower than the optimum were selected namely 1 5 and 10 g l 4 2 transport experiments the operating conditions applied during the transport experiments are listed in table 1 together with model parameters estimated upon fitting initially the transport of nanoparticles was studied to estimate the values of k att k det and r max in eq 18 then transport of foam stabilized with either surfactant or surfactant and nanoparticles were carried to determine the model parameters within the constitutive equation of generation and coalescence respectively eqs 11 and 12 4 2 1 nanoparticle transport experiments in this section the results of the experiments run to investigate the transport of nanoparticles through a porous medium with water are reported and discussed the volumetric injection rate of the nanoparticle was chosen as 0 90 ml min and the concentration of nanoparticle were equal to 1 5 and 10 g l the measured breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3 in conjunction with model simulations upon fitting here it is possible to notice a good agreement between the measurements and the model and negligible different of the concentration fronts with increasing injected nanoparticle concentration the estimates of the model parameters namely k att k det and r max in the constitutive equation eq 18 are equal to correspondingly 0 22 1 s 1 6 10 4 1 s and 50 2 g kg which resemble values in the literature kim et al 2015 4 2 2 foam transport experiments during transient fig 4 shows the pressure drop δp and the water saturation s w as a function of pore volume injected redpvi for experiments where foam was stabilized only with surfactant exp 4 5 and 6 in these experiments three values of foam quality f g were tested namely 0 57 0 71 and 0 86 the value of s w shown in these figures corresponds to the water saturation at the end of column once the system is stabilized it reflects the average residual water saturation in the column as it is possible to see in this figure the pressure drop across the column decreases with f g this is because with higher percentage of gas there is not enough surfactant to stabilize the bubbles and more surfactant should be added to the solution to create a strong foam this limitation is overcome when nanoparticles are added as it can be observed in the results reported below the water saturation decreases during the experiments as expected reaching a constant value within 1 pvi upon inversion of the model on δp and s w measurements model parameters c g m c c n s w c f and c e were estimated and their values are all reported in table 1 experiments of foam transport in the presence of nanoparticles were then conducted and described with the model fig 5 shows the measurements and the model of exp 7 8 and 9 performed at the same f g applied in exp 4 to 6 in this figure the evolution of δp normalized nanoparticle concentration c c inj at the column outlet and s w are shown as a function of pore water injected contrarily to the experiments where foam was stabilized with surfactant here δp increases with f g this suggests that nanoparticles enhance bubble stability creating a strong foam even at large gas fractions moreover nanoparticles breakthrough the column earlier than 1 pvi and stabilize around a concentration which is approximately 60 of that injected the breakthrough which is earlier than that observed in exp 1 3 confirmed that a large fraction of nanoparticles is transported by the bubbles this was also observed by ding et al 2013 for nzvi nanoparticles the profile of δp is characterized by slow initial increase followed by rapid rise until δp reaches a plateau the duration of these two phases decreases with f g and the final value around which the pressure stabilizes increases with f g as observed in the previous tests s w decreases during the experiments reaching a constant value within 1 pvi the larger f g the earlier s w reaches a constant value overall these observations suggest that as f g increases foam is generated at much faster rate and a finer texture of strong foam is attained upon inversion of the model on δp c c inj and s w measurements model parameters c g m c c n s w c f and c e were estimated for all the experiments 7 through 21 and their values are all reported in table 1 the values resemble those determined in previous works kam and rossen 2003 prigiobbe et al 2016 with the largest change of c c across f g and u t this is because at large gas fraction and gas velocity the foam is more unstable prigiobbe et al 2016 fig 6 shows the measurements and the model for exp 15 13 and 12 where total velocity q t was changed from 0 4 to 1 cm3 min and f g was fixed at 0 75 in these tests the liquid and gas phase velocities were simultaneously increased to keep f g constant as it possible to see in this figure δp increases q t and the concentration of nanoparticles transported with foam increase as well becoming less scattered with velocity this suggests that as u t increases finer bubbles are formed which upon nanoparticle adsorption at the gas liquid interface create a strong stable foam fig 7 reports measurements of δp and c c inj as a function of pvi each column contains the results of tests carried out at approximately the same f g and increasing q t as it is possible to see as f g and q t increase foam is generated at faster rate and it become stronger moreover as q t increases the concentration of nanoparticles transported by the foam increases and its front becomes more stable regardless of foam quality these observations suggest that high quality foam injected at high speed helps creating fine strong bubbles that carry nanoparticles in a stable manner after steady state condition establishes the zone where the foam is generated is at least the first half of the column and the extension of the area decreases with the rate of generation this can be observed in fig 8 where texture evolution as a function of dimensionless distance is shown for three experiments namely exp 9 15 and 20 in the case of exp 20 the foam texture does not reach a plateau as the generation rate is the slowest it is important to point out that in all the experiments shown in figs 5 through 7 the accumulation of nanoparticles in the porous medium does not affect the pressure at steady state this indicates that there is not a significant pore blockage by the retained nanoparticles 4 2 3 foam transport experiments at steady state foam transport experiments with surfactant and nanoparticles were carried out as described in section 3 4 2 the results are shown as regime diagrams osterloh jante type of plot in fig 9 with contours of δp and f g at different applied gas and liquid phase velocities for foam stabilized with surfactant part a and foam stabilized with surfactant and nanoparticles part b this type of plot allows to visualize the trend of pressure and therefore of foam strength as a function of water and gas velocities and fractions therefore the plots picture a regime of the foam system and can be used for process design as it is possible to see in this figure when nanoparticles are added the pressure drop at steady state increases this is because nanoparticles stabilize more effectively the generated bubbles making the foam finer and stronger over a longer time increasing the concentration of nanoparticles does not lead however to a more stable foam but rather can cause clogging of the pore space as it is suggested by the results shown in fig 10 here a concentration of nanoparticles equal to 5 g l was added to the surfactant solution part a reports the regime diagram and part b the measured profiles of δp the dots represent the operating conditions applied in these tests and they are color coded in this figure it is possible to see that at such a high concentration of nanoparticles which the foamability and stability tests suggests to create a strong and stable foam can however clog the porous medium experiments indicated by symbols s 7 s 8 s 10 and s 11 where f g and u g were set larger than 0 7 and 0 4 respectively the pressure drop start to increase indefinitely at the early stage of the test because of sudden clogging of the pores 5 conclusions in this paper an experimental and modeling study of foam transport in porous media stabilized with surfactant and nanoparticles was reported column flood tests were run and described by a mechanistic model which couples foam and nanoparticle transport in porous media with agglomeration and extended dlvo theory experiments show that nanoparticles work synergistically with the surfactant creating a strong foam high velocity high quality foam is able to carry nanoparticles efficiently through the porous media possibly due to the generation of fine bubbles which provide larger gas liquid interface for nanoparticle adsorption although preliminary test suggests that foam stability increase with nanoparticle concentration clogging of the porous medium could occur comprising the formation overall the model agrees well with the experiments suggesting that it is a valuable tool to predict nanoparticle transport by foam in porous media under various thermodynamic and flow conditions it can be extended to account for soil heterogeneity and reactions in the subsurface and used for the design of field operations such as remediation of contaminated sites enhanced oil recovery and co2 storage author contributions qingjian

1361,in this paper an experimental study of nanoparticle transport by foam is presented bubbles made of n2 gas were stabilized with either a cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab silica nanoparticles or a combination of them the concentrations of the surface active materials were selected upon foamability and stability tests column flood tests were run until steady state changing nanoparticle concentration foam quality f g and flow rate a synergistic behaviour of surfactant and nanoparticles help the formation of a strong foam the measurements were used to validate a

agglomeration bubbles foam nanoparticles population balance equation transport in porous media 1 introduction wet foam or simply foam is a complex fluid consisting of gas bubbles dispersed in a liquid phase it is often referred to waterless fluid because the volume fraction of the gas phase can be up to 97 vol foam is injected into the subsurface to improve the gas mobility control as it increases the effective gas viscosity and allows to divert the gas towards low permeability zones li et al 2010 conn et al 2014 lake et al 2014 huh and prodanovi c 2019 it has been successfully employed in gas

fractional flow theories zhou et al 1995 percolation models rossen 1990 and population balance equation pbe method kovscek et al 1995 kam and rossen 2003 all these methods focus on the description of the foam and water gas saturation when only surfactants are used to stabilize the bubbles in our earlier work li and prigiobbe 2020 we proposed a mechanistic model to describe the transport of foam and nanoparticles in a coupled manner simulation results show the potential to predict the evolution of foam texture in conjunction with nanoparticle transport in porous media however the model was validated only with few experiments from the literature in this paper we present a systematic experimental study of nanoparticle transport by foam to verify the proposed model in our earlier work li and prigiobbe 2020 optimal concentrations of surface active materials made of surfactant and nanoparticles were selected upon foamability and stability tests then column flood tests were run until steady state and the mechanistic model was used to describe the measurements of pressure nanoparticle concentration and water saturation as well as to gain an insight into foam and nanoparticle behaviour 2 mathematical model of nanoparticle transport by foam 2 1 transport model the transport of foam and nanoparticles was described by a one dimensional 1d transport model following our earlier

for the magnetic properties that are relevant for nzvi nanoparticles can be found in our previous work li and prigiobbe 2020 2 3 model implementation and calibration a finite difference scheme was developed to discretize the nonlinear system of eqs 1 2 and 10 approximated with a forward upstream weighted solution and integrated explicitly kam et al 2007 the domain was divided into a grid of n x

was discretized implicitly and solved iteratively by the newton raphson method the nanoparticle aggregation model described by eq 20 was solved by the fixed pivot method kumar and ramkrishna 1996 where the particle size distribution was divided into m classes of size with m equal to 60 the discretized model was then implemented in matlab mathworks matlab r2018a 2018 further details regarding the implementation of the model can be found in our previous work li and prigiobbe 2020 all model parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2 of the supplementary information si document overall they are

experiments to ensure identificability and reduce uncertainty in the parameter estimation we determined the parameter values from selected experiments for instance the values of k att k det and r max were estimated from tests of nanoparticle transport it was then assumed the behaviour of the nanoparticles in suspension is not modified by the presence of bubbles the values of x t max p r and β g were estimated from experiments where foam was stabilized only with surfactant as they depend on the porous medium geometry kovscek et al 1995 the values of c g m c c n s w c f and c e were estimated from tests of foam and nanoparticles transport 3 material and methods 3 1 materials silicon dioxide nanoparticles sio2 99 purity 8 nm us3437 us research nanomaterials produced by laser gas phase synthesis were used in this study the nanoparticles are characterized by a negatively change surface at the operating conditions applied ph 5 in this work the zeta potential measured with zetasizer nano malvern instruments u k was equal to 23 4 mv the large absolute value of the zeta potential ensures that the nanoparticles carry the same charge and therefore the aggregation is inhibited by repulsive electric forces therefore the nanoparticle suspension is stable details regarding the nanoparticles size distribution can be found in section 2 of the si document surfactant was obtained from a commercial manufacturer namely a cationic surfactant ctab cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide sigma aldrich suspensions of nanoparticles and solution of ctab and ctab and nanoparticles were created to stabilize foam the combination of ctab and silica nanoparticles was selected because it has been observed that cationic surfactants combined with negatively charged nanoparticles have a synergistic foaming effect binks and horozov 2005 binks et al 2008 carn et al 2009 tan et al 2010 providing a remarkable stability to foam duan et al 2014 singh and mohanty 2015 2017 sonn et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the nanoparticle suspension was prepared by dissolving the powder in ultra pure water milli q germany sonicating it for 1 h and then stirring it for 24 h similarly the surfactant was dissolved into ultra pure water milli q germany and stirred for 24 h the concentration of surfactant and nanoparticles were selected upon foamability and stability tests as described in section 3 2 herein 3 2 foamability and stability tests in order to select the composition of the suspension made of nanoparticle and surfactant ctab stability and foamability tests were conducted briefly a solution of ultra pure water of 10 ml with a known amount of surfactant and nanoparticles was prepared and mixed with a stirrer colorsquid ika works u s a for 5 min at the rate of 150 rpm then it was poured into a graduated cylinder and the evolution of the volume of the generated foam and of the liquid phase at the bottom of the cylinder were recorded 3 3 experimental set up a column flood system was built to test foam transport behaviour in the presence of nanoparticles and its scheme is reported in fig 1 the experimental system consisted of a column of 15 mm of diameter and 200 mm of length cole parmer u s a a piston pump cole parmer u s a a pressure transducer p61 validyne engineering u s a for the injection of the suspension and a gas flow controller f 210cv bronkhorst u s a the values of the darcy velocity considering a porosity of about 0 4 and the selected rates of 0 05 0 9 ml min changed between 7 10 4 and 1 2 10 2 m s these flow characteristics were selected as they can be found in field applications near the injection well where most foam generation is expected the column was packed with glass beads 430 600 μm p 0230 potters industries and nitrogen gas n2 99 99 purity welding supply u s a was injected to create the foam the permeability k m2 can be estimated from the kozeny carman equation because the porous medium consisted of glass spherical beads of known size distribution with a calculated average particle size d and porosity ϕ k ϕ 3 d 2 150 1 ϕ 2 the permeability changed between 2 4 10 10 m2 the pressure transducer allowed to monitor the pressure drop through the column while the fraction collector gilson fc203b u s a was used to grab samples for offline analyses of nanoparticles concentration with the uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent u s a a calibration curve was determined at the beginning of each test and an example is reported in part b of fig 2 of the si document 3 4 experimental procedures three types of experiments were carried out using the set up shown in fig 1 namely transport of nanoparticles transport of foam stabilized with surfactant ctab and transport of foam stabilized with surfactant ctab and nanoparticles 3 4 1 tests of transport of nanoparticles before each test of transport of nanoparticles the column was initially stabilized with ultra pure water at ph equal to 5 until the conductivity corning conductivity meter 441 u s a in the effluent reached a value of 0 06 μs cm corresponding to the value of injected water then a nanoparticle suspension of concentration of 1 5 and 10 g l was supplied to the column for approximately 10 pvi i e pvi u w t vϕ with v the total volume of the granular material within the column samples were collected at the outlet of the column diluted 5 20 times and characterized with the uv vis spectrophotometer for nanoparticle concentration determination 3 4 2 tests of transport of foam 3 4 2 1 foam stabilized with surfactant preliminary tests of transport of foam were carried out to select the injection procedure and the results are reported in section 3 of the si document measurements showed that a co injection into a column containing ultra pure water instead of saturated with surfactant solution created an unstable foam this is because in an initial stage of the experiment the gas phase sweeps through the column and bubbles generated due to snap off are not stabilized leading therefore to an unstable gas front therefore co injection into a pre saturated column was selected as a standard procedure in this work then n2 gas was co injected together with surfactant solution into the column the values of the total fluid velocity u t applied in these experiments were between 0 2 and 1 2 ml min during the tests the pressure drop across the column was recorded a fraction collector was used to take samples of the effluent which were then analyzed by weight using a micro scale analytical balance ms104ts mettler toledo u s a for the determination of the water saturation s w experiments to study the behaviour of the foam at steady state were also run they were conducted at selected liquid phase velocity u w and subsequent increase of gaseous phase velocity u g until the pressure drop across the column remained constant the duration of each test varied between 2 and 24 h depending on the gas velocity 3 4 2 2 foam stabilized with surfactant and nanoparticles in these experiments the column was pre saturated with surfactant and nanoparticle suspension with a composition selected upon foamability and stability tests n2 gas and the suspension were co injected until steady state identified as the time when the pressure drop stabilized around a constant value the column was continuously monitored with the pressure transducer the effluent was collected using the fraction collector and the samples were analyzed offline to determine water saturation and concentration of nanoparticles upon bubble breakage and dilution up to 5 20 times also tests of transport of foam and nanoparticles were run until steady state with a similar procedure described in the section above 4 results and discussion in this section the experimental and modeling results are reported and discussed in particular section 4 1 reports the results of the stability and foamability tests run to select the optimal composition of the suspension containing surfactant ctab and nanoparticles section 4 2 1 reports the results of nanoparticle transport finally section 4 2 2 reports the results of transport of foam stabilized with either surfactant or surfactant and nanoparticles 4 1 foamability and stability tests the results from foamability and stability tests are shown in fig 2 they were run using different compositions of surfactant and nanoparticle concentrations in this figure parts a and b show the initial foam volume as a function of surfactant and surfactant and nanoparticle concentrations parts c and d report the evolution of the liquid phase during drainage as it is possible to see in part a the volume of the foam increases with surfactant concentration until a value of 0 3 g l which is slightly below the critical micellae concentration cmc corresponding to 0 34 g l the results of the stability tests part c of fig 2 clearly show that there is not significant difference in liquid volume evolution at increasing surfactant concentration therefore a concentration equal to 0 5 g l slightly larger than cmc was selected for this work part b of this figure shows the experimental results of foamability for ctab equal to 0 5 g ml at various nanoparticle concentrations the results show negligible effect of nanoparticle on the foam volume contrary stability increases with nanoparticle concentration as it is evident from the liquid volume evolution reported in part d of fig 2 for nanoparticle concentration larger than 10 g l the foam stability increases significantly however to avoid the blockage of the pore space kim et al 2015 phenrat et al 2007 concentrations lower than the optimum were selected namely 1 5 and 10 g l 4 2 transport experiments the operating conditions applied during the transport experiments are listed in table 1 together with model parameters estimated upon fitting initially the transport of nanoparticles was studied to estimate the values of k att k det and r max in eq 18 then transport of foam stabilized with either surfactant or surfactant and nanoparticles were carried to determine the model parameters within the constitutive equation of generation and coalescence respectively eqs 11 and 12 4 2 1 nanoparticle transport experiments in this section the results of the experiments run to investigate the transport of nanoparticles through a porous medium with water are reported and discussed the volumetric injection rate of the nanoparticle was chosen as 0 90 ml min and the concentration of nanoparticle were equal to 1 5 and 10 g l the measured breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3 in conjunction with model simulations upon fitting here it is possible to notice a good agreement between the measurements and the model and negligible different of the concentration fronts with increasing injected nanoparticle concentration the estimates of the model parameters namely k att k det and r max in the constitutive equation eq 18 are equal to correspondingly 0 22 1 s 1 6 10 4 1 s and 50 2 g kg which resemble values in the literature kim et al 2015 4 2 2 foam transport experiments during transient fig 4 shows the pressure drop δp and the water saturation s w as a function of pore volume injected redpvi for experiments where foam was stabilized only with surfactant exp 4 5 and 6 in these experiments three values of foam quality f g were tested namely 0 57 0 71 and 0 86 the value of s w shown in these figures corresponds to the water saturation at the end of column once the system is stabilized it reflects the average residual water saturation in the column as it is possible to see in this figure the pressure drop across the column decreases with f g this is because with higher percentage of gas there is not enough surfactant to stabilize the bubbles and more surfactant should be added to the solution to create a strong foam this limitation is overcome when nanoparticles are added as it can be observed in the results reported below the water saturation decreases during the experiments as expected reaching a constant value within 1 pvi upon inversion of the model on δp and s w measurements model parameters c g m c c n s w c f and c e were estimated and their values are all reported in table 1 experiments of foam transport in the presence of nanoparticles were then conducted and described with the model fig 5 shows the measurements and the model of exp 7 8 and 9 performed at the same f g applied in exp 4 to 6 in this figure the evolution of δp normalized nanoparticle concentration c c inj at the column outlet and s w are shown as a function of pore water injected contrarily to the experiments where foam was stabilized with surfactant here δp increases with f g this suggests that nanoparticles enhance bubble stability creating a strong foam even at large gas fractions moreover nanoparticles breakthrough the column earlier than 1 pvi and stabilize around a concentration which is approximately 60 of that injected the breakthrough which is earlier than that observed in exp 1 3 confirmed that a large fraction of nanoparticles is transported by the bubbles this was also observed by ding et al 2013 for nzvi nanoparticles the profile of δp is characterized by slow initial increase followed by rapid rise until δp reaches a plateau the duration of these two phases decreases with f g and the final value around which the pressure stabilizes increases with f g as observed in the previous tests s w decreases during the experiments reaching a constant value within 1 pvi the larger f g the earlier s w reaches a constant value overall these observations suggest that as f g increases foam is generated at much faster rate and a finer texture of strong foam is attained upon inversion of the model on δp c c inj and s w measurements model parameters c g m c c n s w c f and c e were estimated for all the experiments 7 through 21 and their values are all reported in table 1 the values resemble those determined in previous works kam and rossen 2003 prigiobbe et al 2016 with the largest change of c c across f g and u t this is because at large gas fraction and gas velocity the foam is more unstable prigiobbe et al 2016 fig 6 shows the measurements and the model for exp 15 13 and 12 where total velocity q t was changed from 0 4 to 1 cm3 min and f g was fixed at 0 75 in these tests the liquid and gas phase velocities were simultaneously increased to keep f g constant as it possible to see in this figure δp increases q t and the concentration of nanoparticles transported with foam increase as well becoming less scattered with velocity this suggests that as u t increases finer bubbles are formed which upon nanoparticle adsorption at the gas liquid interface create a strong stable foam fig 7 reports measurements of δp and c c inj as a function of pvi each column contains the results of tests carried out at approximately the same f g and increasing q t as it is possible to see as f g and q t increase foam is generated at faster rate and it become stronger moreover as q t increases the concentration of nanoparticles transported by the foam increases and its front becomes more stable regardless of foam quality these observations suggest that high quality foam injected at high speed helps creating fine strong bubbles that carry nanoparticles in a stable manner after steady state condition establishes the zone where the foam is generated is at least the first half of the column and the extension of the area decreases with the rate of generation this can be observed in fig 8 where texture evolution as a function of dimensionless distance is shown for three experiments namely exp 9 15 and 20 in the case of exp 20 the foam texture does not reach a plateau as the generation rate is the slowest it is important to point out that in all the experiments shown in figs 5 through 7 the accumulation of nanoparticles in the porous medium does not affect the pressure at steady state this indicates that there is not a significant pore blockage by the retained nanoparticles 4 2 3 foam transport experiments at steady state foam transport experiments with surfactant and nanoparticles were carried out as described in section 3 4 2 the results are shown as regime diagrams osterloh jante type of plot in fig 9 with contours of δp and f g at different applied gas and liquid phase velocities for foam stabilized with surfactant part a and foam stabilized with surfactant and nanoparticles part b this type of plot allows to visualize the trend of pressure and therefore of foam strength as a function of water and gas velocities and fractions therefore the plots picture a regime of the foam system and can be used for process design as it is possible to see in this figure when nanoparticles are added the pressure drop at steady state increases this is because nanoparticles stabilize more effectively the generated bubbles making the foam finer and stronger over a longer time increasing the concentration of nanoparticles does not lead however to a more stable foam but rather can cause clogging of the pore space as it is suggested by the results shown in fig 10 here a concentration of nanoparticles equal to 5 g l was added to the surfactant solution part a reports the regime diagram and part b the measured profiles of δp the dots represent the operating conditions applied in these tests and they are color coded in this figure it is possible to see that at such a high concentration of nanoparticles which the foamability and stability tests suggests to create a strong and stable foam can however clog the porous medium experiments indicated by symbols s 7 s 8 s 10 and s 11 where f g and u g were set larger than 0 7 and 0 4 respectively the pressure drop start to increase indefinitely at the early stage of the test because of sudden clogging of the pores 5 conclusions in this paper an experimental and modeling study of foam transport in porous media stabilized with surfactant and nanoparticles was reported column flood tests were run and described by a mechanistic model which couples foam and nanoparticle transport in porous media with agglomeration and extended dlvo theory experiments show that nanoparticles work synergistically with the surfactant creating a strong foam high velocity high quality foam is able to carry nanoparticles efficiently through the porous media possibly due to the generation of fine bubbles which provide larger gas liquid interface for nanoparticle adsorption although preliminary test suggests that foam stability increase with nanoparticle concentration clogging of the porous medium could occur comprising the formation overall the model agrees well with the experiments suggesting that it is a valuable tool to predict nanoparticle transport by foam in porous media under various thermodynamic and flow conditions it can be extended to account for soil heterogeneity and reactions in the subsurface and used for the design of field operations such as remediation of contaminated sites enhanced oil recovery and co2 storage author contributions qingjian

1362,mixing of surface water and groundwater in shallow sediments is important to biogeochemical cycling and contaminant migration and is often used to define the hyporheic zone yet knowledge of mixing processes in hyporheic zones is supported by surprisingly few rigorous lab or field observations and differ from those in deeper groundwater by presence of enhanced head gradients sediment heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in a laboratory sediment sand tank we photographed a conservative dye to analyze transverse mixing zones between upwelling groundwater and bidirectional hyporheic exchange flows we then conducted numerical modeling to investigate processes behind observed phenomena and estimate dispersivities we found that transverse mixing zones were thin i e mixing thickness measured in direction of steepest concentration gradient δ less than 5 cm consistent with a small calibrated transverse dispersivity 0 1 mm and prior lab studies conducted at similar scales in steady state experiments and simulations δ and estimated dispersion coefficients increased with the surface water head drop driving exchange flows given relatively constant deeper groundwater heads increased δh led to increased mixing zone length for both steady state and transient conditions indicating larger bedforms or weaker gaining conditions enhance subsurface mixing however peclet number and flux related dilution index simultaneously increased and decreased respectively indicating that enhancement of subsurface advection outpaced that of dispersion in transient experiments and simulations δ was greater than for steady state probably from temporary addition of longitudinal dispersion during transient experiments δ exhibited temporal noise perhaps due to the mixing zone moving past varying patterns of sediment packing our results provide basic knowledge of mixing zone behavior in hyporheic zones with implications for hyporheic zone definitions solute transport mixing dependent reaction and water quality keywords hyporheic zone hyporheic exchange dispersion mixing dependent reactions mixing controlled reactions 1 introduction surface water groundwater interaction is widespread occurring beneath and adjacent to many types of aquatic and marine water bodies cardenas 2008 kwon et al 2014 winter et al 1998 bidirectional exchange across the sediment water interface is typically known as hyporheic exchange in streams and rivers stanford and gaufin 1974 white 1993 but such shallow exchange flows also occur in estuarine and marine sediments bianchin et al 2011 huettel et al 1996 musial et al 2016 these exchange flows create hyporheic zones where hydrologic thermal biologic and water quality characteristics are different than both surface water and deeper groundwater boulton et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 hester and gooseff 2010 these characteristics make the hyporheic zone more chemically reactive with unique microbial communities brunke and gonser 1997 lowell et al 2009 with implications for freshwater aquatic organisms baxter and hauer 2000 nutrient balance gomez velez et al 2015 and attenuation of pollutants originating in surface water hester et al 2016 and groundwater conant et al 2004 hester et al 2014 shallow exchange processes similarly affect chemical reactions and biogeochemistry in marine settings cardenas et al 2008 cook et al 2006 knights et al 2017 precht et al 2004 weinstein et al 2011 common hyporheic zone definitions include where surface water advects through sediment harvey and wagner 2000 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 and where surface water and groundwater mix within sediment bencala 2000 triska et al 1989 winter et al 1998 these definitions are related but conceptually distinct hester et al 2013 here we focus on the latter because it has received less rigorous analysis yet mixing is critical because it controls a variety of water quality functions including transformation of biogeochemically important elements naranjo et al 2015 heat transfer processes kim and lee 2020 kim et al 2014 naranjo et al 2013 and penetration of surface water solutes into the sediment kessler et al 2012 transverse mixing zones in particular enable mixing dependent reactions of groundwater pollutants exiting to surface water hester et al 2014 santizo et al 2020 trauth et al 2015 hyporheic mixing also structures spatial heterogeneity of hyporheic habitat with implications for organism distribution and ecosystem function birkel et al 2016 lowell et al 2009 stegen et al 2016 field scale transverse mixing and dispersion studies from the general groundwater literature pickens and grisak 1981 may conflate mixing with spreading caused by differential advection similarly transverse hyporheic dispersion has been modeled but often with large coefficients that conflate solute spreading with true mixing hester et al 2017 and references therein hester et al 2013 lautz and siegel 2006 shuai et al 2017 most prior field and lab studies that track reactive compounds in shallow sediments suggest medium 5 cm to large 1 m hyporheic mixing zones conant et al 2004 freitas et al 2015 hedin et al 1998 kaufman et al 2017 landmeyer et al 2010 triska et al 1989 yet have not resolved the specific processes responsible e g mixing vs reactant flux thus more focused studies that spatially resolve individual hyporheic mixing processes are needed pore scale mixing studies from the general groundwater literature e g bijeljic and blunt 2007 huang et al 2002 luo and cirpka 2011 rolle et al 2012 provide useful insights but lack aspects unique to hyporheic sediments such as steep head gradients high sediment heterogeneity and rapid head fluctuations bandopadhyay et al 2018 galloway et al 2019 hester et al 2017 su et al 2020 some prior pore scale laboratory studies of hyporheic processes have shown thin transverse mixing zones thickness measured in direction of steepest concentration gradient 5 cm fox et al 2016 kaufman et al 2017 but mixing was not their focus and dispersive flux or mixing dependent reactions were not simulated more recently santizo et al 2020 conducted laboratory simulations of pore scale transverse hyporheic mixing but mixing processes were obscured by mixing dependent reactions transient conditions were not included and numerical simulations were not utilized to interpretation underlying processes furthermore we are unaware of transverse dispersivities determined for hyporheic sediments either in the field or laboratory yet they are critical to accurate simulation of hyporheic transport and reaction lastly prior laboratory and field studies generally have not linked key mixing metrics such as mixing zone thickness abarca and clement 2009 bauer et al 2008 marzadri et al 2016 robinson et al 2015 with dilution index chiogna et al 2011a chiogna et al 2011b cirpka et al 2015 rolle et al 2009 to more fully interpret mixing processes here we used conservative tracers in laboratory and numerical experiments to 1 simulate hyporheic transverse mixing zones and calculate mixing metrics such as mixing zone thickness and dilution index 2 confirm thin 5 cm mixing zones found in the few hyporheic and larger number of general groundwater laboratory conservative tracer mixing studies 3 determine transverse dispersivities 4 quantify the effect of varying steady state and transient hydraulic boundary heads and flows on relative dominance of advection and mixing dipersion processes and 5 use results from 1 to relate directly measureable mixing metrics e g mixing zone thickness with theoretical e g flux related dilution index mixing metrics addressing these objectives will provide insight into how shallow exchange zones function with implications for mixing dependent reactions that affect water quality 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 sediment tank and experimental treatments we used a hm 169 drainage and seepage tank from gunt hamburg germany or sediment tank to simulate the mixing zone between a hyporheic flow cell surface water advecting through the sediment due to pressure gradients along the sediment water interface and upwelling groundwater fig 1a this scenario represents situations where curvilinear transverse mixing zones develop in shallow sediment beneath gaining surface water bodies for example from dunes in rivers cardenas and wilson 2007 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 fig 1b in stream structures in streams azinheira et al 2014 hester and doyle 2008 lautz and siegel 2006 fig 1c and bedforms in marine settings cardenas et al 2008 huettel et al 1996 we used a conservative tracer dye rhodamine wt to visualize the mixing zone and focus on mixing of source waters clean tap water flowed into the inflow reservoir to simulate surface water inflow fig 1a to simulate the upwelling groundwater it was necessary to modify the gunt tank by adding the upwelling reservoir at the bottom the upwelling reservoir was connected to a constant head tank that provided the upwelling source water fig 1a we mixed 1 part rhodamine wt liquid dye with 20 000 parts tap water in the constant head tank to visualize groundwater upwelling through the sand we chose us silica ottawa flint silica 12 sand for its white colour to enhance dye visualization rounded grains consistent with river settings and grain size d50 0 53 mm similar to other hyporheic laboratory studies elliott and brooks 1997 marion et al 2002 packman et al 2004 packman and mackay 2003 tonina and buffington 2007 similar to these prior studies this sediment is essentially homogeneous as a useful conceptual starting point we estimated hydraulic conductivity as 6 6 10 4 m s using permeameter tests we filled the tank with tap water prior to placing the sand to avoid trapping air we placed the divider 20 cm to the right of the inflow reservoir boundary to both minimize transverse mixing zone formation time and minimize head drop needed to create a flow cell in the sediment we set the divider depth to 6 cm below the sediment water interface to eliminate blowout of sand and also keep the mixing zone centered in the tank to avoid boundary effects we induced a hyporheic flow cell by creating a hydrostatic head drop across the divider δh in fig 1a we created δh by increasing the inflow reservoir head while maintaining a constant head in the outflow reservoir table 1 this increase in δh increased the flow rate and hence velocities in the hyporheic flow cell as δh increased we simultaneously increased the head in the constant head tank feeding the upwelling reservoir but by less than we increased the inflow reservoir head this allowed the head gradient between the upwelling reservoir and the inflow reservoir to decrease table 1 which increased the size of the hyporheic flow cell and hence the length of the mixing zone while simultaneously avoiding direct flow between the two reservoirs we hypothesized that variation in δh is a key control on mixing processes as quantified by a series of metrics describe in sections 2 1 2 and 4 1 we varied steady state δh among three scenarios which we refer to as low medium and high surface water head drop δh 3 5 5 5 and 8 0 cm respectively the range of δh reflects the physical constraints of the equipment in particular 3 5 cm is almost the smallest that could induce a coherent hyporheic flow cell while 8 0 was the largest that is possible with this size sediment tank this range of δh is consistent with prior field and lab studies of dunes and in stream structures azinheira et al 2014 elliott and brooks 1997 endreny et al 2011 hester and doyle 2008 we also conducted a transient experiment where we rapidly varied δh to approximate rapid stage changes such as those from rapid changes in reservoir release rates to do this we lowered the inflow reservoir water level causing δh to decrease from 8 cm to 0 cm in less than 20 s similar to kaufman et al 2017 2 1 2 image capture and data analysis we photographed the dye and sand through the glass front of the sediment tank using a nikon d80 camera placed 1 67 m away automated by control my nikon v4 2 with 75 mm focal length iso speed 100 aperture f 10 and shutter speed 1 6 s to maximize photo resolution while maintaining proper exposure image resolution was 3872 2592 horizontal x vertical which corresponded to 0 014 0 015 cm horizontal vertical of the sand matrix per pixel we illuminated the sediment tank diagonally from above using two genaray spectro led 9 0 photographic studio lights and surrounded the tank camera and lights with a black duvetyn fabric enclosure we acquired images during the steady state and transient conditions described above and also before dye was introduced background during the steady state experiments we took photos well after the sediment tank achieved steady state transport which varied between about 30 and 60 min depending on δh during the transient experiments we took photos every 5 s from the time the tube was moved until the flow cell disappeared we converted raw nef images to 8 bit tiff images using nikon viewnx2 software and used the red channel intensities 0 225 dimensionless for analysis due to strong response to dye presence even with careful control of lighting some spatial and temporal variation of background light intensity is unavoidable castro alcala et al 2012 we corrected spatial variation within each image by dividing the light intensities for each pixel by those from the background image taken without dye tracer using matlab castro alcala et al 2012 this inverted the intensity scale so that cells with dye had lower rather than higher normalized intensities we corrected temporal variation among images by scaling the range of intensities in each image from 0 0 to 1 0 next we addressed background light intensity noise from sand grains using block processing robinson et al 2015 this replaced pixel values with the averages within larger blocks and we chose 20 20 pixel 2 8 mm blocks because these are typically 2 4 sand grains across which eliminates noise but still maintains maximum spatial resolution we calculated transverse mixing zone thickness δ as well as transverse dispersion coefficients dt peclet numbers pe and flux related dilution index eq to understand how dispersion and mixing processes varied among experimental treatments as well as to conceptually link directly observable mixing metrics with more theoretical ones here we describe how we measured δ and we discuss calculation of dt pe and eq in section 4 1 transverse mixing zone thickness δ is the distance across the mixing zone between the hyporheic flow cell without colored dye in fig 1a and upwelling groundwater with colored dye in fig 1a as measured perpendicular to the concentration contours i e along direction of steepest concentration gradient in two dimensions δ together with mixing zone length δs fig 1a comprise mixing zone size hester et al 2013 but δ increases in the downgradient direction domenico and schwartz 1998 huang et al 2002 rolle et al 2012 van breukelen and rolle 2012 such that measurements of δ at the downgradient end of the mixing zone i e dashed horizontal line in fig 1a also account for effects of δs on mixing zone size we thus use δ as a surrogate for mixing zone size when looking at the effects of controlling factors our hypothesis was that increases in δh would lead to increases in mixing and hence δ to calculate transverse δ we linearly interpolated normalized light intensities between adjacent 20 pixel blocks along a series of five vertically adjacent horizontal rows of blocks where the mixing zone is vertical average of 4 2 cm depth red dashed line in fig 1a we picked this location because a vertical mixing zone simplifies the process of calculating δ from gridded pixels because a horizontal row of pixels at this location is perpendicular to the concentration contours this location is also at the downgradient end of the mixing zone so calculated values of δ represent the cumulative effect of mixing along the length of the mixing zone we quantified δ using percentage based thresholds chiogna et al 2011a pool et al 2014 we determined the spatial distance between 16 and 84 0 16 0 84 of the maximum light intensity and repeated the procedure using 10 and 90 0 10 0 90 the 0 16 0 84 cutoffs are commonly used to delineate 2d plume margins and can be derived from gaussian plume dispersion theory domenico and schwartz 1998 as we discuss further in section 4 1 the 0 10 0 90 cutoffs are more arbitrary but have been used in the past abarca and clement 2009 pool et al 2014 and provide a second set of metrics to confirm that observed trends are not specific to a particular threshold regardless both sets of cutoffs represent the core of the mixing zone rather than the fringe we chose this approach because the fringe is more difficult to measure given the greater importance of noise in the light intensities 2 2 numerical modeling we constructed a numerical flow and transport model of our laboratory sediment tank experiments using modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the model domain was the sand portion of the tank fig 2 the main purposes of the modeling were to interpret processes behind observed results and calculate transverse dispersivities αt for the hyporheic zone to see if they are consistent with prior values for this scale of groundwater flow we simulated both our steady state and transient experimental results 2 2 1 flow model and calibration we used the finite difference groundwater hydraulic code modflow harbaugh 2005 to solve the 2d groundwater flow equation 1 x k xx h x z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx and kzz are hydraulic conductivity l t in the x and z directions respectively h is the piezometric head l w is a water source sink term t 1 ss is specific storage l 1 and t is time t we constructed the computational domain to match the internal dimensions of the sediment tank to minimize numerical dispersion while also minimizing run times we systematically reduced a uniform model grid size until modeled δ values no longer changed with further refinement see section 2 2 2 for transport model details and calibration to mixing zone this resulted in 1 25 mm 1 25 mm model cells yielding a total of 304 512 computational cells this grid size is consistent with prior modeling studies at similar spatial scales that showed minimal numerical dispersion with larger discretization hester et al 2013 hester et al 2014 we used the modflow preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve eq 1 we used specified head boundary conditions for the influent boundaries upwelling groundwater at the bottom downwelling surface water portion of the hyporheic flow cell at the top left and the effluent boundary upwelling groundwater and hyporheic flow cell at the top center and right fig 2 the remaining perimeter of the model consisted of a no flow boundary the hydraulic head values for the two specified head boundaries at the top of the model for the three steady state model runs were set to those observed in the sediment tank see section 2 1 1 including table 1 we then manually adjusted the head at the upwelling groundwater boundary of the steady state flow model to match the observed position of the tracer front in the transport model see table 1 and section 2 2 2 this tracer front matching was done at the downgradient end of the hyporheic flow cell i e at the location where we determined mixing zone thickness from the laboratory data dashed line in fig 1a once the manual calibration was complete we varied the upwelling groundwater head and thus the inflow ratio between upwelling and groundwater and downwelling surface water in a sensitivity analysis to test its influence on mixing zone characteristics in particular for each δh we varied the upwelling groundwater head from a high value that made the hyporheic flow cell nearly disappear to a low value that enlarged the hyporheic flow cell as much as possible without inducing edge effects at the bottom boundary for the transient simulation a time varying specified head condition was applied at the downwelling surface water boundary with constant specified head maintained at the upwelling groundwater boundary k was set to homogeneous and isotropic at 6 6 10 4 m s per laboratory measurements section 2 1 1 ss was set to homogeneous at 0 0005 m 1 a reasonable value for sand domenico and mifflin 1965 but we also varied this parameter in a sensitivity analysis and found our transient flow simulation to be insensitive 2 2 2 transport model and calibration we used mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to solve the advection dispersion and reaction equation in groundwater 2 θ c k t x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k w c s k r where θ is porosity of the porous media dimensionless ck is concentration of dissolved constituent k ml 3 t is time t xi j is distance along respective cartesian coordinate axes l dij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l2t 1 vi is linear pore water velocity lt 1 c s k is the source sink flux concentration for constituent k ml 3 and r is the chemical reaction term ml 3 t 1 we used the mt3dms advection package third order tvd method and dispersion package with the generalized conjugate gradient solver to solve eq 2 the dispersion package calculates d in each direction using the classic method of scheidegger 1961 by adding the apparent or bulk molecular diffusion coefficient dm l2t 1 to the product of v and a dispersivity α l we set dm to 1 0 10 5 m2 d 1 16 10 10 m2 s as a typical or medium value for dissolved solutes in porous media domenico and schwartz 1998 freeze and cherry 1979 boundary conditions for the mt3dms model included no flux conditions coinciding with the no flow boundaries in modflow a constant concentration of 100 mg l was assigned along the upwelling groundwater boundary for convenient data analysis fig 2 this concentration differs from the lab experiment but is arbitrary because in our results we report model concentrations normalized to the maximum in contrast the downwelling surface water boundary was set to 0 mg l the transport model domain was smaller than the flow model domain 116 543 grid cells to decrease run times while still including the mixing zone in the simulated domain this was done by inactivating columns of model cells on the right side of the model domain well away from the mixing zone this did not change the accuracy of the transport model because the underlying hydraulics did not change i e the modflow input files were still for the full domain discussed above and grid resolution of remaining cells did not change we manually calibrated the flow model boundary conditions to match the position of the mixing zone for the three steady state scenarios section 2 2 1 we also manually calibrated the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values 1 0 mm and 0 1 mm respectively to match the observed mixing zone thickness δ for the steady state δh 3 5 cm scenario both calibrations were done at the downgradient end of the mixing zone dashed line in fig 1a there were no solute sources sinks or reactions i e rightmost two terms in eq 2 0 3 results 3 1 steady state conditions mixing zones in the laboratory appeared quite thin to the eye as indicated by the sharp change in colour figs 3 abc the steady state model runs showed mixing zones that also appear thin figs 3def although perhaps somewhat thicker than those in the laboratory we believe any such visual discrepancy is due to the human eye s inability to see relatively low dye concentrations on the left side of the laboratory mixing zones by contrast our camera was able to see these lower concentrations indicated by good agreement between measured and modeled mixing zone thicknesses as discussed more below fig 4 mixing zone length δs increased with surface water head drop driving hyporheic exchange δh during the steady state experiments fig 5a because simultaneous variations in upwelling reservoir head were comparatively smaller with the net effect that head gradient from the upwelling to inflow reservoirs decreased allowing flow cell size to increase fig 3 mixing zone thickness δ measured between 1 0 and 1 5 cm for 0 10 0 90 and between 0 8 and 0 9 cm for 0 16 0 84 thresholds fig 5b δ increased with δh and did so more steeply for 0 10 0 90 than 0 16 0 84 variation in δ measured across the five vertically adjacent horizontal rows of blocks was minimal standard deviation shown as error bars in fig 5b as δh increased the trends in the laboratory and model derived δ values matched each other reasonably well this match is best for the δh 3 5 cm scenario because the numerical transport model was fit to experimental observations by tuning dispersivity at that δh the discrepancy between modeled and simulated δ increased somewhat with δh in particular the difference between δ for 0 10 0 90 and δ for 0 16 0 84 increased more for the laboratory measurements than for the model results fig 5b this can be seen when plotting observed and model values against one another fig 4 although there is also some systematic bias in the 0 16 0 84 results in that the model slightly over predicted the lab results in many cases we used modflow zonebudget harbaugh 1990 to determine steady state flow rates of water coming into the model through the top boundary surface water and the bottom boundary groundwater the ratio of upwelling groundwater to downwelling surface water boundary flows was always 1 fig 6 because of the larger groundwater boundary fig 2 and to prevent the hyporheic flow cell from getting too large i e mixing zone approaching bottom model boundary fig 6 shows that a major control on δ in shallow sediments is balance between flows from the surface water and groundwater boundaries this makes sense because the ratio of boundary flows controls the size of the hyporheic flow cell which in turn controls δs fig 5a which in turn controls δ fig 5b δ exhibited the greatest sensitivity to the ratio of boundary flows as the balance between groundwater and surface water flows decreased toward unity conversely δ approached asymptotic minimum values as groundwater flow i e strength of upwelling exceeded surface flow by an order of magnitude and greater 3 2 transient conditions in response to the transient drop in δh and the simultaneous corresponding increase in head gradient from the upwelling reservoir to the inflow reservoir the mixing zone shifted steadily toward the divider fig 7a rapidly at first and then slowing down the simulated and observed trends line up well indicating that modflow reasonably simulated the transient experiments as δh declined δ initially increased from the steady state value for the 8 0 cm head drop 1 cm to somewhere between 1 6 and 1 8 cm at 300 s for the observed and simulated case fig 7b δ then declined to around 0 6 cm at 1000 s thus the greatest δ is concurrent with the fastest movement of the mixing zone compare fig 7a and b and the response time in the sediment 1000 s was more than ten times that of the change in surface water head 20 s the mt3dms model results matched the observations reasonably well both in magnitude of δ and timing of the peak fig 7b in addition to this longer time scale response of δ 1000 s fig 7b there were shorter scale fluctuations of δ on the order of 5 20 s fig 7c this short term variability was greater at higher δh than at lower δh fig 7b 4 discussion and analysis 4 1 dispersion coefficient peclet number and dilution index and relation to mixing zone thickness because an easily observable metric such as mixing zone thickness δ is not sufficient by itself to understand variation in transverse mixing in nonuniform flow fields rolle et al 2009 we calculated a series of more theoretical transport and mixing parameters to fully quantify and interpret transport processes table 2 here in section 4 1 we present the calculations and basic results including comparing the relative utility of observable and theoretical mixing metrics in subsequent sections we use these metrics to interpret processes occurring in the physical and numerical experiments including the effect of controlling hydraulics our calculations below make use of both laboratory and modeling results but give preference to laboratory results because of their greater accuracy and thus use modeling results only where laboratory measurements are not available e g velocities we first calculated transverse dispersion coefficients dt m s by combining domenico and schwartz 1998 3 δ 0 16 0 84 2 σ t 4 σ t 2 d t δs 4 2 v 4 2 to yield 5 d t δ 0 16 0 84 2 v 4 2 8 δs 4 2 where δ0 16 0 84 is observed mixing zone thickness for 0 16 0 84 fig 5b δs4 2 m is distance along the mixing zone visible in the sediment tank to the point where δ was observed i e those from fig 5a less the 4 2 cm depth in the sediment at which δ was measured and v4 2 is the porewater velocity along the mixing zone m s from the numerical model also at 4 2 cm depth we calculated dt for the downgradient end of the mixing zone like we did for δ because that is where our numerical model was calibrated and hence is most accurate section 2 2 and because doing so quantifies the cumulative mixing processes occurring along the length of mixing zone upgradient i e calculates an apparent dispersion coefficient rahman et al 2005 next we calculated the peclet number pe bear 1972 schnoor 1996 6 pe v 4 2 δs 4 2 d t which again is calculated with input values from the downgradient end of the mixing zone this is consistent with representing the time available for both longitudinal advection and transverse dispersion processes as the duration of transport along the length of the mixing zone finally we calculated the flux related dilution index eq l3 t from the model output using chiogna et al 2011a rolle et al 2009 rolle et al 2012 ye et al 2015b 7 e q exp x 1 x 2 p q x 0 0 ln p q x 0 0 q x 0 0 dx where the limits of integration x1 and x2 are the x coordinates l of the top layer model cells immediately to the right of the divider and at the right hand side of the transport model domain respectively q is the upward vertical darcy velocity across the top of model domain l t and pq is calculated by 8 p q c x 0 0 x 1 x 2 c x 0 0 q x 0 0 dx where c is concentration of tracer exiting the top of the model domain m l3 pe increased with δ fig 8 indicating that as advection increasingly dominated over dispersion along the mixing zone δ simultaneously increased the fact that δ increased with degree of advection may be initially counterintuitive but can be understood by recognizing that both advection and dispersion increased but that advection increased more than dispersion at the same time as pe increased eq decreased fig 8 this is consistent with advection increasing comparatively more than dispersion with less net less dilution in other words as δ increases the solute mass spreads out across more flowpaths i e is more diluted but advective velocities increase proportionally more this emphasizes that when quantifying the role of dispersion in transport a practical and readily observable metric such as mixing zone thickness provides an incomplete picture a more complete picture requires metrics such as pe and eq which are more challenging to measure in the lab or field and often require numerical simulations 4 2 magnitude of hyporheic transverse dispersion our results showed thin transverse mixing zones δ 1 2 cm and advection dominance pe 1 table 2 consistent with steady state results from prior hyporheic studies hester et al 2013 jin et al 2010 sawyer and cardenas 2009 and low opportunity for mixing dependent reactions hester et al 2014 for example a numerical model of steady state conservative tracer transverse mixing based on local dispersion coefficients in a dune induced hyporheic zone showed the mixing zone to occupy 8 2 of the domain and while δ was not quantified it appeared to be 5 cm for the base case scenario fig 3 in hester et al 2013 consistent with thin mixing zones by manually calibrating mt3dms to our sediment tank data we determined that the transverse dispersivity αt for our steady state scenarios was approximately 0 1 mm this is the first αt determined from observational data that were explicitly intended to simulate the hyporheic zone to our knowledge there are observational data for shallow sediments that quantified longitudinal dispersivity from either laboratory chou and wyseure 2009 or field liu et al 2019 shuai et al 2017 settings and there are many hyporheic studies that have simulated transport including dispersion e g gomez et al 2012 hester et al 2013 lautz and siegel 2006 naranjo et al 2013 qian et al 2008 but used larger αt however both the thin mixing zones we observed in the laboratory sediment tank and the magnitude of the corresponding values of αt from the calibrated transport model are consistent with the broader range of general groundwater literature previous small scale laboratory studies longest dimension measuring 1 2 m of conservative tracer transverse mixing in homogeneous sand have shown mixing zones that appear to range from about 1 4 cm thick bauer et al 2009 chiogna et al 2010 huang et al 2002 rolle et al 2012 with αt ranging down to 0 1 mm e g gaganis et al 2005 consistent with low mixing ballarini et al 2014 rolle et al 2013 similarly our value of 0 1 mm is 19 of our mean grain size 0 53 mm consistent with percentages previously reported for homogeneous sand benekos et al 2006 cirpka et al 2006 finally the resulting dt values table 2 are consistent with the range of values observed in other laboratory experiments of transverse dispersion of similar scale delgado 2006 rolle et al 2013 rolle et al 2009 by contrast field studies of hyporheic or shallow mixing typically show geochemically defined mixing zones as thicker sawyer et al 2009 triska et al 1989 but likely account for additional processes such as spreading dynamic head boundaries longitudinal dispersion and density gradients similarly extensive dispersivity data exist in the general groundwater literature for larger spatial scales these are often field data and report αt horizontal or vertical values down to 1 0 10 mm gelhar et al 1992 zech et al 2019 zheng and bennett 2002 which is still 10 100 times the values we found such dispersivities from field data often also account for spreading and thus plume stretching and distortion i e macrodispersivity in other words the contrast in αt values arises due to finer scale characterization of concentration gradients in the lab relative to typically larger scale field studies molz and widdowson 1988 field studies generally do not approach the spatial resolution of lab studies so cannot be directly compared although a few come close e g anneser et al 2008 thus even the smaller end of the range of dispersivities from field studies may include some degree of macrodispersivity 4 3 effect of hydraulic controls our results show that steady state mixing zone thickness δ increased with the head drop δh driving hyporheic exchange fig 5b this makes sense because the simultaneous variations in upwelling reservoir head table 1 were smaller by comparison which meant that increased δh translated to decreased head gradient from the upwelling reservoir to the inflow reservoir which in turn increased mixing zone length δs fig 5a which is known to increase the thickness of a mixing zone at its downgradient end domenico and schwartz 1998 huang et al 2002 rolle et al 2012 van breukelen and rolle 2012 this indicates that increasing height of bedforms such as steps weirs debris dams and log dams can lead to thicker mixing zones assuming relatively constant deeper groundwater heads on the other hand variation in deeper groundwater heads by themselves can strongly influence hyporheic flow cell size azinheira et al 2014 cardenas and wilson 2007 hester and doyle 2008 and hence mixing zone length and thickness in our experiments the head gradient between the upwelling reservoir and inflow reservoir was not constant but rather decreased with increasing δh table 1 which in turn increased δs and δ this is consistent with fig 6 which shows that as groundwater upwelling increased relative to flow through the hyporheic flow cell δ decreased presumably due to simultaneous decreases in δs dt also increased with δh fig 9a this make sense because we calculated dt as an apparent dispersion coefficient from δ measured toward the downgradient end of the mixing zone eq 5 meaning it represents mixing that occurred along most of the length of the mixing zone our results are thus consistent with fig 11c in hester et al 2013 which showed that overall mixing zone size i e δs multiplied by δ correlates with transverse dispersive flux across the mixing zone increased transverse dispersive flux in turn enhances mixing dependent reactions for example hester et al 2019 showed increasing surface water depth lead to increased head gradient between surface water and groundwater that drove hyporheic exchange increased δs and increased mixing dependent denitrification thus taller bedforms or lesser upwelling or gaining to surface water would lead to enhanced mixing dependent reactions pe also increased with δh fig 9a this indicates that while the dispersion process itself increased its importance relative to advection decreased advection thus increased more with δh than dispersion as velocity v4 2 increased table 2 this may explain why flux related dilution index eq simultaneously decreased table 2 fig 9b this indicates reduced dilution of the upwelling tracer by adjacent flowpaths that were initially tracer free thus changes in dispersion and dilution cannot be understood in isolation but only in the context of simultaneous changes in advection in sum increased δh led to increased v and hence increased dispersion rate dt and while comparatively smaller variations in upwelling reservoir heads i e deeper groundwater heads meant that increased δh caused greater δs and hence δ the increase in v outweighed the increase δs and thus reduced the time over which that increased dispersion rate acted leaving advection as the dominant process shown by increased pe and decreased eq 4 4 effect of transient head variation during our transient experiments δ was greater when δh was greater i e at the beginning of the high to low experiment this is consistent with our steady state results in that upwelling reservoir heads were constant during the transient experiment thus transient decreases in δh led to simultaneous increases to the head gradient from the upwelling reservoir to the inflow reservoir which decreased δs and therefore δ furthermore δ was greater during changes in δh than during steady state conditions compare figs 5b and 7b this may be due to the temporary presence of longitudinal dispersion as both the flow field and mixing zone adjust to the change in hydraulic boundary conditions when the dividing line between the hyporheic flow cell and upwelling groundwater contracts upward an advective front may form between the old location of the dividing line and the new one and longitudinal dispersion may temporarily occur in that zone such advective fronts are temporary and will dissipate as the system comes into a new hydraulic and transport steady state thus our measurements of δ during this transitory phase may include the effects of both transverse and longitudinal dispersion in other words transient conditions increased overall dispersion even if our data do not sort out the relative contributions of transverse and longitudinal dispersion we also observed shorter term fluctuations in δ fig 7c these may be due to the effects of tortuosity de anna et al 2014 on the movement of the dye through spatially varying patterns of sand grain packing these short term fluctuations were greater at greater δh or greater rate of change in δh fig 7b while no prior lab studies have evaluated these transient dynamics for hyporheic settings to our knowledge they are consistent with modeling studies which found that transient dynamics enhanced mixing even in homogeneous sediment pool and dentz 2018 this is also consistent with studies showing tidal oscillations enhance mixing in coastal settings pool et al 2014 although density gradients were also present in that case such increased mixing during transient dynamics would in turn enhance mixing dependent reactions in shallow and or hyporheic sediments hester et al 2014 trauth et al 2015 yet reactions have many other controls which could confound such expected trends for example availability of required reactants or presence of an active microbial community and necessary biogeochemical redox conditions for example hester et al 2019 conducted numerical experiments of mixing dependent denitrification in hyporheic zones with time varying boundary heads they found that fluctuating surface water boundary hydraulics increased mixing dependent reactions but not as substantially as might be expected from the result of our current study thus in those numerical experiments other factors may have partially cancelled out the enhancement to mixing from longitudinal dispersion during responses to head changes one such possible factor includes the requirement that oxygen is depleted before denitrification occurs another possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the head fluctuations in hester et al 2019 were slower than in our current experiments we recommend that future studies better sort out longitudinal from transverse mixing processes in dynamic hyporheic mixing zones this could be done in laboratory studies that create greater differences in advective and dispersive timescales which can in turn be controlled through better control of the rate of boundary head variation as well as varying sediment texture extending the work to more realistic riverbeds in flowing flumes teitelbaum et al 2021 wolke et al 2020 and incorporating mixing dependent reactions hester et al 2019 santizo et al 2020 are important longer term goals 4 5 limitations and applications calculating mixing metrics directly from light intensities rather than concentrations introduces some error into the process studies that have generated light intensity concentration calibration curves while often having substantial linear subsections can be somewhat nonlinear overall castro alcala et al 2012 huang et al 2002 however this issue should not affect our major conclusions many of our conclusions involve how changes in mixing are caused by changes in hydraulic conditions even if the light concentration calibration curve were nonlinear these conclusions would not change e g figs 5 6 7 and much of table 2 we recognize that our conclusions involving the magnitude of mixing zone thickness particularly calculated dispersitivities would be somewhat more sensitive to the shape of the calibration curve this may be one possible explanation for the modest but systematic overprediction of δ by the model figs 4 5b yet because dispersivities range over several orders of magnitude the deviations resulting from assuming linear calibration curves would be comparatively minor and the agreement between our calculated dispersivities and those of prior literature discussed earlier further support their validity our steady state model simulations with αt calibrated to the lowest δh 3 5 cm did not match the laboratory results as well for the middle and highest δh fig 5b there are a number of possible explanations for example the interpolation of blocked concentrations during image processing may introduce error that varies somewhat among different values of δh another possible explanation relates to mt3dms using the conventional formulation of scheidegger 1961 to calculate d where α is a function only of porous media characteristics this view assumes d is a linear function of v under non inertial or darcy flow conditions and only becomes a non linear function of v under inertial conditions i e for reynolds numbers re eq 9 1 10 bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 re is calculated for porous media flow as 9 re ρvd μ where ρ is density of water m l3 d is a representative pore or particle dimension l and μ is dynamic viscosity m tl yet more recent studies suggest that even under non inertial conditions α itself varies with v or dt otherwise relates nonlinearly to v chiogna et al 2010 scheven 2013 ye et al 2015a because our flow conditions were non inertial re 0 21 0 26 using d d50 and assuming 20 c this is another possible way to explain why our α derived from one δh did not apply as well to another δh nevertheless our use of our αt determined from our steady state model calibrations in our transient model did in fact capture the increase in mixing width during the transient conditions fig 7b this seems to indicate that using αt generated from steady state transport observations in transient transport models generates reasonable results yet clearly any dispersivity data drawn from the literature for use in modeling hyporheic processes must come from field or laboratory studies of similar spatial scale and resolution there are many important future directions to pursue subsequent studies could expand upon this work by using heterogeneous sediment including preferential flowpaths briggs and hare 2018 brunke 1999 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 le borgne et al 2014 lotts and hester 2020 menichino and hester 2015 menichino et al 2014 song et al 2010 reactions could be added either abiotic santizo et al 2020 or microbially mediated hester et al 2019 particulate carbon sources could be added that would form reactive microsites sawyer 2015 more fundamentally our choice of 2d analysis imposed limitations on the possible modes of mixing the most effective way to enhance transverse mixing in 2d flow fields appears to be flow focusing from spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity rolle et al 2009 werth et al 2006 possibly enhanced by temporal fluctuations hester et al 2017 however in 3d flow fields an additional mixing mechanism which is not possible in 2d is helical flows from non stationary anisotropy which creates twisting streamlines and ultimately greater stretching of solute into thin ribbons or fingers that in turn allow greater opportunity for molecular diffusion to enhance true mixing cirpka et al 2015 ye et al 2016 these concepts applied to the hyporheic zone is an important area of future research our results have many potential implications for managing water resources for example hydropower operations that create rapid stage shifts may enhance mixing dependent hyporheic reactions in rivers prior studies have shown the significance of such conditions for reactions in bank sediment shuai et al 2017 stegen et al 2016 but our results indicate their significance for reactions in bed sediment stream and river restoration practices such as in stream structures and pool riffle sequences anderson et al 2005 azinheira et al 2014 hester and doyle 2008 that enhance the length of mixing zones may also enhance such reactions finally fluctuating stage and velocity from waves or tides may enhance such reactions in coastal settings cardenas et al 2008 hester et al 2019 lamontagne et al 2018 5 conclusions we used a conservative dye to simulate transverse mixing zones between upwelling groundwater and bidirectional hyporheic exchange flows in a laboratory sediment sand tank we photographed the experiments and performed image analysis to quantify dye transport and mixing we then manually calibrated numerical models to the laboratory experiments to investigate processes behind both steady state and transient observed phenomena and estimate transverse dispersivities we calculated mixing zone thickness δ as it is proportional to transverse dispersive fluxes and therefore controls biogeochemical zonation and mixing dependent reactions we found mixing zones were thin δ 5 cm in the sediment tank consistent with prior numerical modeling studies of transverse mixing between hyporheic flow cells and upwelling groundwater e g hester et al 2013 calibration of our numerical transport model to sediment tank transport indicated transverse dispersivity values 0 1 mm smaller than those derived from field studies of deeper groundwater but consistent with prior lab studies conducted at similar spatial scales in both laboratory and modeling results for both steady state and transient conditions increases in the surface water head drop that drives exchange flows δh increased the flow rate and velocities in the induced hyporheic flow cell at the same time comparatively smaller variations in head gradients with deeper groundwater meant that increased δh also led to decreased upward head gradients leading to increased mixing zone length δs and hence increased δ and dispersion coefficients thus larger bedforms or reduced strength of gaining can enhance subsurface mixing however as δh increased the peclet number pe simultaneously increased and the dilution index eq simultaneously decreased indicating that advection processes were enhanced even more than dispersion more generally pe increased and eq decreased with increasing δ indicating that advection increased more than dispersion with increasing δ this trend emphasizes that readily observable metrics such as δ provide an incomplete picture of the relative importance of mixing a complete picture requires more theoretical metrics such as pe and eq which are more challenging to measure in the lab or field and often require numerical simulations δ was greater for transient than steady state conditions probably because the change in boundary conditions shifted the location of the flowpath dividing the hyporheic flow cell from upwelling groundwater which in turn likely added a transient advective front that experienced longitudinal dispersion δ during transient experiments in the sediment tank exhibited temporal noise perhaps due to the mixing zone moving past varying patterns of sediment packing numerical modeling showed that a major control of δ in shallow sediments is balance between flows from the surface water and groundwater boundaries our results provide basic knowledge of mixing zone behavior in hyporheic sediments

1362,mixing of surface water and groundwater in shallow sediments is important to biogeochemical cycling and contaminant migration and is often used to define the hyporheic zone yet knowledge of mixing processes in hyporheic zones is supported by surprisingly few rigorous lab or field observations and differ from those in deeper groundwater by presence of enhanced head gradients sediment heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in a laboratory sediment sand tank we photographed a conservative dye to analyze transverse mixing zones between upwelling groundwater and bidirectional hyporheic exchange flows we then conducted numerical modeling to investigate processes behind observed phenomena and estimate dispersivities we found that transverse mixing zones were thin i e mixing thickness measured in direction of steepest concentration gradient δ less than 5 cm consistent with a small calibrated transverse dispersivity 0 1 mm and prior lab studies conducted at similar scales in steady state experiments and simulations δ and estimated dispersion coefficients increased with the surface water head drop driving exchange flows given relatively constant deeper groundwater heads increased δh led to increased mixing zone length for both steady state and transient conditions indicating larger bedforms or weaker gaining conditions enhance subsurface mixing however peclet number and flux related dilution index simultaneously increased and decreased respectively indicating that enhancement of subsurface advection outpaced that of dispersion in transient experiments and simulations δ was greater than for steady state probably from temporary addition of longitudinal dispersion during transient experiments δ exhibited temporal noise perhaps due to the mixing zone moving past varying patterns of sediment packing our results provide basic knowledge of mixing zone behavior in hyporheic zones with implications for hyporheic zone definitions solute transport mixing

is widespread occurring beneath and adjacent to many types of aquatic and marine water bodies cardenas 2008 kwon et al 2014 winter et al 1998 bidirectional exchange across the sediment water interface is typically known as hyporheic exchange in streams and rivers stanford and gaufin 1974 white 1993 but such shallow exchange flows also occur in estuarine and marine sediments bianchin et al 2011 huettel et al 1996 musial et al 2016 these exchange flows create hyporheic zones where hydrologic thermal biologic and water quality characteristics are different than both surface water and deeper groundwater boulton et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 hester and gooseff 2010 these characteristics make the hyporheic zone more chemically reactive with unique microbial communities brunke and gonser 1997 lowell et al 2009 with implications for freshwater aquatic organisms baxter and hauer 2000 nutrient balance gomez velez et al 2015 and attenuation of pollutants originating in surface water hester et al 2016 and groundwater conant et al 2004 hester et al 2014 shallow exchange processes similarly affect chemical reactions and biogeochemistry in marine settings cardenas et al 2008 cook et al 2006 knights et al 2017 precht et al 2004 weinstein et al 2011 common hyporheic zone definitions include where surface water advects through sediment harvey and wagner 2000 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 and where surface water and groundwater mix within sediment bencala 2000 triska et al 1989 winter et al 1998 these definitions are related but conceptually distinct hester et al 2013 here we focus on the latter because it has received less rigorous analysis yet mixing is critical because it controls a variety of water quality functions including transformation of biogeochemically important elements naranjo et al 2015 heat transfer processes kim and lee 2020 kim et al 2014 naranjo et al 2013 and penetration of surface water solutes into the sediment kessler et al 2012 transverse mixing zones in particular enable mixing dependent reactions of groundwater pollutants exiting to surface water hester et al 2014 santizo et al 2020 trauth et al 2015 hyporheic mixing also structures spatial heterogeneity of hyporheic habitat with implications for organism distribution and ecosystem function birkel et al 2016 lowell et al 2009 stegen et al 2016 field scale transverse mixing and dispersion studies from the general groundwater literature pickens and grisak 1981 may conflate mixing with spreading caused by differential advection similarly transverse hyporheic dispersion has been modeled but often with large coefficients that conflate solute spreading with true mixing hester et al 2017 and references therein hester et al 2013 lautz and siegel 2006 shuai et al 2017 most prior field and lab studies that track reactive compounds in shallow sediments suggest medium 5 cm to large 1 m hyporheic mixing zones conant et al 2004 freitas et al 2015 hedin et al 1998 kaufman et al 2017 landmeyer et al 2010 triska et al 1989 yet have not resolved the specific processes responsible e g mixing vs reactant flux thus more focused studies that spatially resolve individual hyporheic mixing processes are needed pore scale mixing studies from the general groundwater literature e g bijeljic and blunt 2007 huang et al 2002 luo and cirpka 2011 rolle et al 2012 provide useful insights but lack aspects unique to hyporheic sediments such as steep head gradients high sediment heterogeneity and rapid head fluctuations bandopadhyay et al 2018 galloway et al 2019 hester et al 2017 su et al 2020 some prior pore scale laboratory studies of hyporheic processes have shown thin transverse mixing zones thickness measured in direction of steepest concentration gradient 5 cm fox et al 2016 kaufman et al 2017 but mixing was not their focus and dispersive flux or mixing dependent reactions were not simulated more recently santizo et al 2020 conducted laboratory simulations of pore scale transverse hyporheic mixing but mixing processes were obscured by mixing dependent reactions transient conditions were not included and numerical simulations were not utilized to interpretation underlying processes furthermore we are unaware of transverse dispersivities determined for hyporheic sediments either in the field or laboratory yet they are critical to accurate simulation of hyporheic transport and reaction lastly prior laboratory and field studies generally have not linked key mixing metrics such as mixing zone thickness abarca and clement 2009 bauer et al 2008 marzadri et al 2016 robinson et al 2015 with dilution index chiogna et al 2011a chiogna et al 2011b cirpka et al 2015 rolle et al 2009 to more fully interpret mixing processes here we used conservative tracers in laboratory and numerical experiments to 1 simulate hyporheic transverse mixing zones and calculate mixing metrics such as mixing zone thickness and dilution index 2 confirm thin 5 cm mixing zones found in the few hyporheic and larger number of general groundwater laboratory conservative tracer mixing studies 3 determine transverse dispersivities 4 quantify the effect of varying steady state and transient hydraulic boundary heads and flows on relative dominance of advection and mixing dipersion processes and 5 use results from 1 to relate directly measureable mixing metrics e g mixing zone thickness with theoretical e g flux related dilution index mixing metrics addressing these objectives will provide insight into how shallow exchange zones function with implications for mixing dependent reactions that affect water quality 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 sediment tank and experimental treatments we used a hm 169 drainage and seepage tank from gunt hamburg germany or sediment tank to simulate the mixing zone between a hyporheic flow cell surface water advecting through the sediment due to pressure gradients along the sediment water interface and upwelling groundwater fig 1a this scenario represents situations where curvilinear transverse mixing zones develop in shallow sediment beneath gaining surface water bodies for example from dunes in rivers cardenas and wilson 2007 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 fig 1b in stream structures in streams azinheira et al 2014 hester and doyle 2008 lautz and siegel 2006 fig 1c and bedforms in marine settings cardenas et al 2008 huettel et al 1996 we used a conservative tracer dye rhodamine wt to visualize the mixing zone and focus on mixing of source waters clean tap water flowed into the inflow reservoir to simulate surface water inflow fig 1a to simulate the upwelling groundwater it was necessary to modify the gunt tank by adding the upwelling reservoir at the bottom the upwelling reservoir was connected to a constant head tank that provided the upwelling source water fig 1a we mixed 1 part rhodamine wt liquid dye with 20 000 parts tap water in the constant head tank to visualize groundwater upwelling through the sand we chose us silica ottawa flint silica 12 sand for its white colour to enhance dye visualization rounded grains consistent with river settings and grain size d50 0 53 mm similar to other hyporheic laboratory studies elliott and brooks 1997 marion et al 2002 packman et al 2004 packman and mackay 2003 tonina and buffington 2007 similar to these prior studies this sediment is essentially homogeneous as a useful conceptual starting point we estimated hydraulic conductivity as 6 6 10 4 m s using permeameter tests we filled the tank with tap water prior to placing the sand to avoid trapping air we placed the divider 20 cm to the right of the inflow reservoir boundary to both minimize transverse mixing zone formation time and minimize head drop needed to create a flow cell in the sediment we set the divider depth to 6 cm below the sediment water interface to eliminate blowout of sand and also keep the mixing zone centered in the tank to avoid boundary effects we induced a hyporheic flow cell by creating a hydrostatic head drop across the divider δh in fig 1a we created δh by increasing the inflow reservoir head while maintaining a constant head in the outflow reservoir table 1 this increase in δh increased the flow rate and hence velocities in the hyporheic flow cell as δh increased we simultaneously increased the head in the constant head tank feeding the upwelling reservoir but by less than we increased the inflow reservoir head this allowed the head gradient between the upwelling reservoir and the inflow reservoir to decrease table 1 which increased the size of the hyporheic flow cell and hence the length of the mixing zone while simultaneously avoiding direct flow between the two reservoirs we hypothesized that variation in δh is a key control on mixing processes as quantified by a series of metrics describe in sections 2 1 2 and 4 1 we varied steady state δh among three scenarios which we refer to as low medium and high surface water head drop δh 3 5 5 5 and 8 0 cm respectively the range of δh reflects the physical constraints of the equipment in particular 3 5 cm is almost the smallest that could induce a coherent hyporheic flow cell while 8 0 was the largest that is possible with this size sediment tank this range of δh is consistent with prior field and lab studies of dunes and in stream structures azinheira et al 2014 elliott and brooks 1997 endreny et al 2011 hester and doyle 2008 we also conducted a transient experiment where we rapidly varied δh to approximate rapid stage changes such as those from rapid changes in reservoir release rates to do this we lowered the inflow reservoir water level causing δh to decrease from 8 cm to 0 cm in less than 20 s similar to kaufman et al 2017 2 1 2 image capture and data analysis we photographed the dye and sand through the glass front of the sediment tank using a nikon d80 camera placed 1 67 m away automated by control my nikon v4 2 with 75 mm focal length iso speed 100 aperture f 10 and shutter speed 1 6 s to maximize photo resolution while maintaining proper exposure image resolution was 3872 2592 horizontal x vertical which corresponded to 0 014 0 015 cm horizontal vertical of the sand matrix per pixel we illuminated the sediment tank diagonally from above using two genaray spectro led 9 0 photographic studio lights and surrounded the tank camera and lights with a black duvetyn fabric enclosure we acquired images during the steady state and transient conditions described above and also before dye was introduced background during the steady state experiments we took photos well after the sediment tank achieved steady state transport which varied between about 30 and 60 min depending on δh during the transient experiments we took photos every 5 s from the time the tube was moved until the flow cell disappeared we converted raw nef images to 8 bit tiff images using nikon viewnx2 software and used the red channel intensities 0 225 dimensionless for analysis due to strong response to dye presence even with careful control of lighting some spatial and temporal variation of background light intensity is unavoidable castro alcala et al 2012 we corrected spatial variation within each image by dividing the light intensities for each pixel by those from the background image taken without dye tracer using matlab castro alcala et al 2012 this inverted the intensity scale so that cells with dye had lower rather than higher normalized intensities we corrected temporal variation among images by scaling the range of intensities in each image from 0 0 to 1 0 next we addressed background light intensity noise from sand grains using block processing robinson et al 2015 this replaced pixel values with the averages within larger blocks and we chose 20 20 pixel 2 8 mm blocks because these are typically 2 4 sand grains across which eliminates noise but still maintains maximum spatial resolution we calculated transverse mixing zone thickness δ as well as transverse dispersion coefficients dt peclet numbers pe and flux related dilution index eq to understand how dispersion and mixing processes varied among experimental treatments as well as to conceptually link directly observable mixing metrics with more theoretical ones here we describe how we measured δ and we discuss calculation of dt pe and eq in section 4 1 transverse mixing zone thickness δ is the distance across the mixing zone between the hyporheic flow cell without colored dye in fig 1a and upwelling groundwater with colored dye in fig 1a as measured perpendicular to the concentration contours i e along direction of steepest concentration gradient in two dimensions δ together with mixing zone length δs fig 1a comprise mixing zone size hester et al 2013 but δ increases in the downgradient direction domenico and schwartz 1998 huang et al 2002 rolle et al 2012 van breukelen and rolle 2012 such that measurements of δ at the downgradient end of the mixing zone i e dashed horizontal line in fig 1a also account for effects of δs on mixing zone size we thus use δ as a surrogate for mixing zone size when looking at the effects of controlling factors our hypothesis was that increases in δh would lead to increases in mixing and hence δ to calculate transverse δ we linearly interpolated normalized light intensities between adjacent 20 pixel blocks along a series of five vertically adjacent horizontal rows of blocks where the mixing zone is vertical average of 4 2 cm depth red dashed line in fig 1a we picked this location because a vertical mixing zone simplifies the process of calculating δ from gridded pixels because a horizontal row of pixels at this location is perpendicular to the concentration contours this location is also at the downgradient end of the mixing zone so calculated values of δ represent the cumulative effect of mixing along the length of the mixing zone we quantified δ using percentage based thresholds chiogna et al 2011a pool et al 2014 we determined the spatial distance between 16 and 84 0 16 0 84 of the maximum light intensity and repeated the procedure using 10 and 90 0 10 0 90 the 0 16 0 84 cutoffs are commonly used to delineate 2d plume margins and can be derived from gaussian plume dispersion theory domenico and schwartz 1998 as we discuss further in section 4 1 the 0 10 0 90 cutoffs are more arbitrary but have been used in the past abarca and clement 2009 pool et al 2014 and provide a second set of metrics to confirm that observed trends are not specific to a particular threshold regardless both sets of cutoffs represent the core of the mixing zone rather than the fringe we chose this approach because the fringe is more difficult to measure given the greater importance of noise in the light intensities 2 2 numerical modeling we constructed a numerical flow and transport model of our laboratory sediment tank experiments using modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the model domain was the sand portion of the tank fig 2 the main purposes of the modeling were to interpret processes behind observed results and calculate transverse dispersivities αt for the hyporheic zone to see if they are consistent with prior values for this scale of groundwater flow we simulated both our steady state and transient experimental results 2 2 1 flow model and calibration we used the finite difference groundwater hydraulic code modflow harbaugh 2005 to solve the 2d groundwater flow equation 1 x k xx h x z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx and kzz are hydraulic conductivity l t in the x and z directions respectively h is the piezometric head l w is a water source sink term t 1 ss is specific storage l 1 and t is time t we constructed the computational domain to match the internal dimensions of the sediment tank to minimize numerical dispersion while also minimizing run times we systematically reduced a uniform model grid size until modeled δ values no longer changed with further refinement see section 2 2 2 for transport model details and calibration to mixing zone this resulted in 1 25 mm 1 25 mm model cells yielding a total of 304 512 computational cells this grid size is consistent with prior modeling studies at similar spatial scales that showed minimal numerical dispersion with larger discretization hester et al 2013 hester et al 2014 we used the modflow preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve eq 1 we used specified head boundary conditions for the influent boundaries upwelling groundwater at the bottom downwelling surface water portion of the hyporheic flow cell at the top left and the effluent boundary upwelling groundwater and hyporheic flow cell at the top center and right fig 2 the remaining perimeter of the model consisted of a no flow boundary the hydraulic head values for the two specified head boundaries at the top of the model for the three steady state model runs were set to those observed in the sediment tank see section 2 1 1 including table 1 we then manually adjusted the head at the upwelling groundwater boundary of the steady state flow model to match the observed position of the tracer front in the transport model see table 1 and section 2 2 2 this tracer front matching was done at the downgradient end of the hyporheic flow cell i e at the location where we determined mixing zone thickness from the laboratory data dashed line in fig 1a once the manual calibration was complete we varied the upwelling groundwater head and thus the inflow ratio between upwelling and groundwater and downwelling surface water in a sensitivity analysis to test its influence on mixing zone characteristics in particular for each δh we varied the upwelling groundwater head from a high value that made the hyporheic flow cell nearly disappear to a low value that enlarged the hyporheic flow cell as much as possible without inducing edge effects at the bottom boundary for the transient simulation a time varying specified head condition was applied at the downwelling surface water boundary with constant specified head maintained at the upwelling groundwater boundary k was set to homogeneous and isotropic at 6 6 10 4 m s per laboratory measurements section 2 1 1 ss was set to homogeneous at 0 0005 m 1 a reasonable value for sand domenico and mifflin 1965 but we also varied this parameter in a sensitivity analysis and found our transient flow simulation to be insensitive 2 2 2 transport model and calibration we used mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to solve the advection dispersion and reaction equation in groundwater 2 θ c k t x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k w c s k r where θ is porosity of the porous media dimensionless ck is concentration of dissolved constituent k ml 3 t is time t xi j is distance along respective cartesian coordinate axes l dij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l2t 1 vi is linear pore water velocity lt 1 c s k is the source sink flux concentration for constituent k ml 3 and r is the chemical reaction term ml 3 t 1 we used the mt3dms advection package third order tvd method and dispersion package with the generalized conjugate gradient solver to solve eq 2 the dispersion package calculates d in each direction using the classic method of scheidegger 1961 by adding the apparent or bulk molecular diffusion coefficient dm l2t 1 to the product of v and a dispersivity α l we set dm to 1 0 10 5 m2 d 1 16 10 10 m2 s as a typical or medium value for dissolved solutes in porous media domenico and schwartz 1998 freeze and cherry 1979 boundary conditions for the mt3dms model included no flux conditions coinciding with the no flow boundaries in modflow a constant concentration of 100 mg l was assigned along the upwelling groundwater boundary for convenient data analysis fig 2 this concentration differs from the lab experiment but is arbitrary because in our results we report model concentrations normalized to the maximum in contrast the downwelling surface water boundary was set to 0 mg l the transport model domain was smaller than the flow model domain 116 543 grid cells to decrease run times while still including the mixing zone in the simulated domain this was done by inactivating columns of model cells on the right side of the model domain well away from the mixing zone this did not change the accuracy of the transport model because the underlying hydraulics did not change i e the modflow input files were still for the full domain discussed above and grid resolution of remaining cells did not change we manually calibrated the flow model boundary conditions to match the position of the mixing zone for the three steady state scenarios section 2 2 1 we also manually calibrated the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values 1 0 mm and 0 1 mm respectively to match the observed mixing zone thickness δ for the steady state δh 3 5 cm scenario both calibrations were done at the downgradient end of the mixing zone dashed line in fig 1a there were no solute sources sinks or reactions i e rightmost two terms in eq 2 0 3 results 3 1 steady state conditions mixing zones in the laboratory appeared quite thin to the eye as indicated by the sharp change in colour figs 3 abc the steady state model runs showed mixing zones that also appear thin figs 3def although perhaps somewhat thicker than those in the laboratory we believe any such visual discrepancy is due to the human eye s inability to see relatively low dye concentrations on the left side of the laboratory mixing zones by contrast our camera was able to see these lower concentrations indicated by good agreement between measured and modeled mixing zone thicknesses as discussed more below fig 4 mixing zone length δs increased with surface water head drop driving hyporheic exchange δh during the steady state experiments fig 5a because simultaneous variations in upwelling reservoir head were comparatively smaller with the net effect that head gradient from the upwelling to inflow reservoirs decreased allowing flow cell size to increase fig 3 mixing zone thickness δ measured between 1 0 and 1 5 cm for 0 10 0 90 and between 0 8 and 0 9 cm for 0 16 0 84 thresholds fig 5b δ increased with δh and did so more steeply for 0 10 0 90 than 0 16 0 84 variation in δ measured across the five vertically adjacent horizontal rows of blocks was minimal standard deviation shown as error bars in fig 5b as δh increased the trends in the laboratory and model derived δ values matched each other reasonably well this match is best for the δh 3 5 cm scenario because the numerical transport model was fit to experimental observations by tuning dispersivity at that δh the discrepancy between modeled and simulated δ increased somewhat with δh in particular the difference between δ for 0 10 0 90 and δ for 0 16 0 84 increased more for the laboratory measurements than for the model results fig 5b this can be seen when plotting observed and model values against one another fig 4 although there is also some systematic bias in the 0 16 0 84 results in that the model slightly over predicted the lab results in many cases we used modflow zonebudget harbaugh 1990 to determine steady state flow rates of water coming into the model through the top boundary surface water and the bottom boundary groundwater the ratio of upwelling groundwater to downwelling surface water boundary flows was always 1 fig 6 because of the larger groundwater boundary fig 2 and to prevent the hyporheic flow cell from getting too large i e mixing zone approaching bottom model boundary fig 6 shows that a major control on δ in shallow sediments is balance between flows from the surface water and groundwater boundaries this makes sense because the ratio of boundary flows controls the size of the hyporheic flow cell which in turn controls δs fig 5a which in turn controls δ fig 5b δ exhibited the greatest sensitivity to the ratio of boundary flows as the balance between groundwater and surface water flows decreased toward unity conversely δ approached asymptotic minimum values as groundwater flow i e strength of upwelling exceeded surface flow by an order of magnitude and greater 3 2 transient conditions in response to the transient drop in δh and the simultaneous corresponding increase in head gradient from the upwelling reservoir to the inflow reservoir the mixing zone shifted steadily toward the divider fig 7a rapidly at first and then slowing down the simulated and observed trends line up well indicating that modflow reasonably simulated the transient experiments as δh declined δ initially increased from the steady state value for the 8 0 cm head drop 1 cm to somewhere between 1 6 and 1 8 cm at 300 s for the observed and simulated case fig 7b δ then declined to around 0 6 cm at 1000 s thus the greatest δ is concurrent with the fastest movement of the mixing zone compare fig 7a and b and the response time in the sediment 1000 s was more than ten times that of the change in surface water head 20 s the mt3dms model results matched the observations reasonably well both in magnitude of δ and timing of the peak fig 7b in addition to this longer time scale response of δ 1000 s fig 7b there were shorter scale fluctuations of δ on the order of 5 20 s fig 7c this short term variability was greater at higher δh than at lower δh fig 7b 4 discussion and analysis 4 1 dispersion coefficient peclet number and dilution index and relation to mixing zone thickness because an easily observable metric such as mixing zone thickness δ is not sufficient by itself to understand variation in transverse mixing in nonuniform flow fields rolle et al 2009 we calculated a series of more theoretical transport and mixing parameters to fully quantify and interpret transport processes table 2 here in section 4 1 we present the calculations and basic results including comparing the relative utility of observable and theoretical mixing metrics in subsequent sections we use these metrics to interpret processes occurring in the physical and numerical experiments including the effect of controlling hydraulics our calculations below make use of both laboratory and modeling results but give preference to laboratory results because of their greater accuracy and thus use modeling results only where laboratory measurements are not available e g velocities we first calculated transverse dispersion coefficients dt m s by combining domenico and schwartz 1998 3 δ 0 16 0 84 2 σ t 4 σ t 2 d t δs 4 2 v 4 2 to yield 5 d t δ 0 16 0 84 2 v 4 2 8 δs 4 2 where δ0 16 0 84 is observed mixing zone thickness for 0 16 0 84 fig 5b δs4 2 m is distance along the mixing zone visible in the sediment tank to the point where δ was observed i e those from fig 5a less the 4 2 cm depth in the sediment at which δ was measured and v4 2 is the porewater velocity along the mixing zone m s from the numerical model also at 4 2 cm depth we calculated dt for the downgradient end of the mixing zone like we did for δ because that is where our numerical model was calibrated and hence is most accurate section 2 2 and because doing so quantifies the cumulative mixing processes occurring along the length of mixing zone upgradient i e calculates an apparent dispersion coefficient rahman et al 2005 next we calculated the peclet number pe bear 1972 schnoor 1996 6 pe v 4 2 δs 4 2 d t which again is calculated with input values from the downgradient end of the mixing zone this is consistent with representing the time available for both longitudinal advection and transverse dispersion processes as the duration of transport along the length of the mixing zone finally we calculated the flux related dilution index eq l3 t from the model output using chiogna et al 2011a rolle et al 2009 rolle et al 2012 ye et al 2015b 7 e q exp x 1 x 2 p q x 0 0 ln p q x 0 0 q x 0 0 dx where the limits of integration x1 and x2 are the x coordinates l of the top layer model cells immediately to the right of the divider and at the right hand side of the transport model domain respectively q is the upward vertical darcy velocity across the top of model domain l t and pq is calculated by 8 p q c x 0 0 x 1 x 2 c x 0 0 q x 0 0 dx where c is concentration of tracer exiting the top of the model domain m l3 pe increased with δ fig 8 indicating that as advection increasingly dominated over dispersion along the mixing zone δ simultaneously increased the fact that δ increased with degree of advection may be initially counterintuitive but can be understood by recognizing that both advection and dispersion increased but that advection increased more than dispersion at the same time as pe increased eq decreased fig 8 this is consistent with advection increasing comparatively more than dispersion with less net less dilution in other words as δ increases the solute mass spreads out across more flowpaths i e is more diluted but advective velocities increase proportionally more this emphasizes that when quantifying the role of dispersion in transport a practical and readily observable metric such as mixing zone thickness provides an incomplete picture a more complete picture requires metrics such as pe and eq which are more challenging to measure in the lab or field and often require numerical simulations 4 2 magnitude of hyporheic transverse dispersion our results showed thin transverse mixing zones δ 1 2 cm and advection dominance pe 1 table 2 consistent with steady state results from prior hyporheic studies hester et al 2013 jin et al 2010 sawyer and cardenas 2009 and low opportunity for mixing dependent reactions hester et al 2014 for example a numerical model of steady state conservative tracer transverse mixing based on local dispersion coefficients in a dune induced hyporheic zone showed the mixing zone to occupy 8 2 of the domain and while δ was not quantified it appeared to be 5 cm for the base case scenario fig 3 in hester et al 2013 consistent with thin mixing zones by manually calibrating mt3dms to our sediment tank data we determined that the transverse dispersivity αt for our steady state scenarios was approximately 0 1 mm this is the first αt determined from observational data that were explicitly intended to simulate the hyporheic zone to our knowledge there are observational data for shallow sediments that quantified longitudinal dispersivity from either laboratory chou and wyseure 2009 or field liu et al 2019 shuai et al 2017 settings and there are many hyporheic studies that have simulated transport including dispersion e g gomez et al 2012 hester et al 2013 lautz and siegel 2006 naranjo et al 2013 qian et al 2008 but used larger αt however both the thin mixing zones we observed in the laboratory sediment tank and the magnitude of the corresponding values of αt from the calibrated transport model are consistent with the broader range of general groundwater literature previous small scale laboratory studies longest dimension measuring 1 2 m of conservative tracer transverse mixing in homogeneous sand have shown mixing zones that appear to range from about 1 4 cm thick bauer et al 2009 chiogna et al 2010 huang et al 2002 rolle et al 2012 with αt ranging down to 0 1 mm e g gaganis et al 2005 consistent with low mixing ballarini et al 2014 rolle et al 2013 similarly our value of 0 1 mm is 19 of our mean grain size 0 53 mm consistent with percentages previously reported for homogeneous sand benekos et al 2006 cirpka et al 2006 finally the resulting dt values table 2 are consistent with the range of values observed in other laboratory experiments of transverse dispersion of similar scale delgado 2006 rolle et al 2013 rolle et al 2009 by contrast field studies of hyporheic or shallow mixing typically show geochemically defined mixing zones as thicker sawyer et al 2009 triska et al 1989 but likely account for additional processes such as spreading dynamic head boundaries longitudinal dispersion and density gradients similarly extensive dispersivity data exist in the general groundwater literature for larger spatial scales these are often field data and report αt horizontal or vertical values down to 1 0 10 mm gelhar et al 1992 zech et al 2019 zheng and bennett 2002 which is still 10 100 times the values we found such dispersivities from field data often also account for spreading and thus plume stretching and distortion i e macrodispersivity in other words the contrast in αt values arises due to finer scale characterization of concentration gradients in the lab relative to typically larger scale field studies molz and widdowson 1988 field studies generally do not approach the spatial resolution of lab studies so cannot be directly compared although a few come close e g anneser et al 2008 thus even the smaller end of the range of dispersivities from field studies may include some degree of macrodispersivity 4 3 effect of hydraulic controls our results show that steady state mixing zone thickness δ increased with the head drop δh driving hyporheic exchange fig 5b this makes sense because the simultaneous variations in upwelling reservoir head table 1 were smaller by comparison which meant that increased δh translated to decreased head gradient from the upwelling reservoir to the inflow reservoir which in turn increased mixing zone length δs fig 5a which is known to increase the thickness of a mixing zone at its downgradient end domenico and schwartz 1998 huang et al 2002 rolle et al 2012 van breukelen and rolle 2012 this indicates that increasing height of bedforms such as steps weirs debris dams and log dams can lead to thicker mixing zones assuming relatively constant deeper groundwater heads on the other hand variation in deeper groundwater heads by themselves can strongly influence hyporheic flow cell size azinheira et al 2014 cardenas and wilson 2007 hester and doyle 2008 and hence mixing zone length and thickness in our experiments the head gradient between the upwelling reservoir and inflow reservoir was not constant but rather decreased with increasing δh table 1 which in turn increased δs and δ this is consistent with fig 6 which shows that as groundwater upwelling increased relative to flow through the hyporheic flow cell δ decreased presumably due to simultaneous decreases in δs dt also increased with δh fig 9a this make sense because we calculated dt as an apparent dispersion coefficient from δ measured toward the downgradient end of the mixing zone eq 5 meaning it represents mixing that occurred along most of the length of the mixing zone our results are thus consistent with fig 11c in hester et al 2013 which showed that overall mixing zone size i e δs multiplied by δ correlates with transverse dispersive flux across the mixing zone increased transverse dispersive flux in turn enhances mixing dependent reactions for example hester et al 2019 showed increasing surface water depth lead to increased head gradient between surface water and groundwater that drove hyporheic exchange increased δs and increased mixing dependent denitrification thus taller bedforms or lesser upwelling or gaining to surface water would lead to enhanced mixing dependent reactions pe also increased with δh fig 9a this indicates that while the dispersion process itself increased its importance relative to advection decreased advection thus increased more with δh than dispersion as velocity v4 2 increased table 2 this may explain why flux related dilution index eq simultaneously decreased table 2 fig 9b this indicates reduced dilution of the upwelling tracer by adjacent flowpaths that were initially tracer free thus changes in dispersion and dilution cannot be understood in isolation but only in the context of simultaneous changes in advection in sum increased δh led to increased v and hence increased dispersion rate dt and while comparatively smaller variations in upwelling reservoir heads i e deeper groundwater heads meant that increased δh caused greater δs and hence δ the increase in v outweighed the increase δs and thus reduced the time over which that increased dispersion rate acted leaving advection as the dominant process shown by increased pe and decreased eq 4 4 effect of transient head variation during our transient experiments δ was greater when δh was greater i e at the beginning of the high to low experiment this is consistent with our steady state results in that upwelling reservoir heads were constant during the transient experiment thus transient decreases in δh led to simultaneous increases to the head gradient from the upwelling reservoir to the inflow reservoir which decreased δs and therefore δ furthermore δ was greater during changes in δh than during steady state conditions compare figs 5b and 7b this may be due to the temporary presence of longitudinal dispersion as both the flow field and mixing zone adjust to the change in hydraulic boundary conditions when the dividing line between the hyporheic flow cell and upwelling groundwater contracts upward an advective front may form between the old location of the dividing line and the new one and longitudinal dispersion may temporarily occur in that zone such advective fronts are temporary and will dissipate as the system comes into a new hydraulic and transport steady state thus our measurements of δ during this transitory phase may include the effects of both transverse and longitudinal dispersion in other words transient conditions increased overall dispersion even if our data do not sort out the relative contributions of transverse and longitudinal dispersion we also observed shorter term fluctuations in δ fig 7c these may be due to the effects of tortuosity de anna et al 2014 on the movement of the dye through spatially varying patterns of sand grain packing these short term fluctuations were greater at greater δh or greater rate of change in δh fig 7b while no prior lab studies have evaluated these transient dynamics for hyporheic settings to our knowledge they are consistent with modeling studies which found that transient dynamics enhanced mixing even in homogeneous sediment pool and dentz 2018 this is also consistent with studies showing tidal oscillations enhance mixing in coastal settings pool et al 2014 although density gradients were also present in that case such increased mixing during transient dynamics would in turn enhance mixing dependent reactions in shallow and or hyporheic sediments hester et al 2014 trauth et al 2015 yet reactions have many other controls which could confound such expected trends for example availability of required reactants or presence of an active microbial community and necessary biogeochemical redox conditions for example hester et al 2019 conducted numerical experiments of mixing dependent denitrification in hyporheic zones with time varying boundary heads they found that fluctuating surface water boundary hydraulics increased mixing dependent reactions but not as substantially as might be expected from the result of our current study thus in those numerical experiments other factors may have partially cancelled out the enhancement to mixing from longitudinal dispersion during responses to head changes one such possible factor includes the requirement that oxygen is depleted before denitrification occurs another possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the head fluctuations in hester et al 2019 were slower than in our current experiments we recommend that future studies better sort out longitudinal from transverse mixing processes in dynamic hyporheic mixing zones this could be done in laboratory studies that create greater differences in advective and dispersive timescales which can in turn be controlled through better control of the rate of boundary head variation as well as varying sediment texture extending the work to more realistic riverbeds in flowing flumes teitelbaum et al 2021 wolke et al 2020 and incorporating mixing dependent reactions hester et al 2019 santizo et al 2020 are important longer term goals 4 5 limitations and applications calculating mixing metrics directly from light intensities rather than concentrations introduces some error into the process studies that have generated light intensity concentration calibration curves while often having substantial linear subsections can be somewhat nonlinear overall castro alcala et al 2012 huang et al 2002 however this issue should not affect our major conclusions many of our conclusions involve how changes in mixing are caused by changes in hydraulic conditions even if the light concentration calibration curve were nonlinear these conclusions would not change e g figs 5 6 7 and much of table 2 we recognize that our conclusions involving the magnitude of mixing zone thickness particularly calculated dispersitivities would be somewhat more sensitive to the shape of the calibration curve this may be one possible explanation for the modest but systematic overprediction of δ by the model figs 4 5b yet because dispersivities range over several orders of magnitude the deviations resulting from assuming linear calibration curves would be comparatively minor and the agreement between our calculated dispersivities and those of prior literature discussed earlier further support their validity our steady state model simulations with αt calibrated to the lowest δh 3 5 cm did not match the laboratory results as well for the middle and highest δh fig 5b there are a number of possible explanations for example the interpolation of blocked concentrations during image processing may introduce error that varies somewhat among different values of δh another possible explanation relates to mt3dms using the conventional formulation of scheidegger 1961 to calculate d where α is a function only of porous media characteristics this view assumes d is a linear function of v under non inertial or darcy flow conditions and only becomes a non linear function of v under inertial conditions i e for reynolds numbers re eq 9 1 10 bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 re is calculated for porous media flow as 9 re ρvd μ where ρ is density of water m l3 d is a representative pore or particle dimension l and μ is dynamic viscosity m tl yet more recent studies suggest that even under non inertial conditions α itself varies with v or dt otherwise relates nonlinearly to v chiogna et al 2010 scheven 2013 ye et al 2015a because our flow conditions were non inertial re 0 21 0 26 using d d50 and assuming 20 c this is another possible way to explain why our α derived from one δh did not apply as well to another δh nevertheless our use of our αt determined from our steady state model calibrations in our transient model did in fact capture the increase in mixing width during the transient conditions fig 7b this seems to indicate that using αt generated from steady state transport observations in transient transport models generates reasonable results yet clearly any dispersivity data drawn from the literature for use in modeling hyporheic processes must come from field or laboratory studies of similar spatial scale and resolution there are many important future directions to pursue subsequent studies could expand upon this work by using heterogeneous sediment including preferential flowpaths briggs and hare 2018 brunke 1999 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 le borgne et al 2014 lotts and hester 2020 menichino and hester 2015 menichino et al 2014 song et al 2010 reactions could be added either abiotic santizo et al 2020 or microbially mediated hester et al 2019 particulate carbon sources could be added that would form reactive microsites sawyer 2015 more fundamentally our choice of 2d analysis imposed limitations on the possible modes of mixing the most effective way to enhance transverse mixing in 2d flow fields appears to be flow focusing from spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity rolle et al 2009 werth et al 2006 possibly enhanced by temporal fluctuations hester et al 2017 however in 3d flow fields an additional mixing mechanism which is not possible in 2d is helical flows from non stationary anisotropy which creates twisting streamlines and ultimately greater stretching of solute into thin ribbons or fingers that in turn allow greater opportunity for molecular diffusion to enhance true mixing cirpka et al 2015 ye et al 2016 these concepts applied to the hyporheic zone is an important area of future research our results have many potential implications for managing water resources for example hydropower operations that create rapid stage shifts may enhance mixing dependent hyporheic reactions in rivers prior studies have shown the significance of such conditions for reactions in bank sediment shuai et al 2017 stegen et al 2016 but our results indicate their significance for reactions in bed sediment stream and river restoration practices such as in stream structures and pool riffle sequences anderson et al 2005 azinheira et al 2014 hester and doyle 2008 that enhance the length of mixing zones may also enhance such reactions finally fluctuating stage and velocity from waves or tides may enhance such reactions in coastal settings cardenas et al 2008 hester et al 2019 lamontagne et al 2018 5 conclusions we used a conservative dye to simulate transverse mixing zones between upwelling groundwater and bidirectional hyporheic exchange flows in a laboratory sediment sand tank we photographed the experiments and performed image analysis to quantify dye transport and mixing we then manually calibrated numerical models to the laboratory experiments to investigate processes behind both steady state and transient observed phenomena and estimate transverse dispersivities we calculated mixing zone thickness δ as it is proportional to transverse dispersive fluxes and therefore controls biogeochemical zonation and mixing dependent reactions we found mixing zones were thin δ 5 cm in the sediment tank consistent with prior numerical modeling studies of transverse mixing between hyporheic flow cells and upwelling groundwater e g hester et al 2013 calibration of our numerical transport model to sediment tank transport indicated transverse dispersivity values 0 1 mm smaller than those derived from field studies of deeper groundwater but consistent with prior lab studies conducted at similar spatial scales in both laboratory and modeling results for both steady state and transient conditions increases in the surface water head drop that drives exchange flows δh increased the flow rate and velocities in the induced hyporheic flow cell at the same time comparatively smaller variations in head gradients with deeper groundwater meant that increased δh also led to decreased upward head gradients leading to increased mixing zone length δs and hence increased δ and dispersion coefficients thus larger bedforms or reduced strength of gaining can enhance subsurface mixing however as δh increased the peclet number pe simultaneously increased and the dilution index eq simultaneously decreased indicating that advection processes were enhanced even more than dispersion more generally pe increased and eq decreased with increasing δ indicating that advection increased more than dispersion with increasing δ this trend emphasizes that readily observable metrics such as δ provide an incomplete picture of the relative importance of mixing a complete picture requires more theoretical metrics such as pe and eq which are more challenging to measure in the lab or field and often require numerical simulations δ was greater for transient than steady state conditions probably because the change in boundary conditions shifted the location of the flowpath dividing the hyporheic flow cell from upwelling groundwater which in turn likely added a transient advective front that experienced longitudinal dispersion δ during transient experiments in the sediment tank exhibited temporal noise perhaps due to the mixing zone moving past varying patterns of sediment packing numerical modeling showed that a major control of δ in shallow sediments is balance between flows from the surface water and groundwater boundaries our results provide basic knowledge of mixing zone behavior in hyporheic sediments

1363,future changes in drought events are critical for risk assessment and associated policymaking in this study the future changes in meteorological droughts in henan province china are explored random forests downscaling model is first constructed based on era5 reanalysis data and meteorological observations the model is validated using evaluation indices such as r 2 and rmse and is shown to be able to capture the relationship between large scale predictors and monthly precipitation the validated random forests downscaling model is driven by multiple global climate models gcms from the phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 under three emission scenarios for projecting three future drought characteristics duration frequency and intensity results show that drought frequency decreases in most areas of henan while drought duration and intensity increase in various degrees some differences are also observed among different emission scenarios especially under ssp2 4 5 where the magnitudes of changes in drought duration and intensity are lower relative to other scenarios the decrease in drought frequency in most areas is found to be caused by increases in monthly mean precipitation in this study changes in drought duration and intensity are related to a combination of increases in precipitation mean and variability keywords meteorological drought precipitation statistical downscaling climate change 1 introduction drought is one of the natural hazards which bring severe disruptions to society economy and agriculture in recent decades many regions around the world have been dramatically affected by drought resulting in reduced crop yields as well as damages to local food security globally about three quarters of the harvested area 454 million hectares experienced drought induced yield losses during 1983 2009 with up to 166 billion u s dollars cumulative harvest losses kim et al 2019 droughts of even moderate severity can pose significant socioeconomic risks because they have the potential to rapidly deplete water resources shrestha and wang 2019 yu et al 2020 which can reduce the ability of an ecosystem to recover zhang et al 2018 many studies have shown that the intensifying droughts are highly related to global warming climate change is likely to cause more frequent and severe droughts exerting negative influence on water resources and food security cook et al 2015 thus understanding the variations in the spatiotemporal characteristics of future droughts in the context of climate change is of vital importance to the design of relevant adaptation and mitigation measures a large number of previous studies were focused on the projections of drought characteristics under global warming martin 2018 used future projections from 24 coupled global climate models gcms to assess how the number duration and severity of future droughts will change and concluded that drought events in humid regions are expected to be less frequent shorter in duration and weaker cook et al 2015 used empirical drought reconstructions and three soil moisture metrics from 17 gcms and predicted substantially drier conditions in the second half of the 21st century compared with those of the 20th century or earlier paleoclimate intervals spinoni et al 2018 used bias corrected data from 11 regional climate models and found that droughts are expected to become increasingly frequent and severe across the european continent with the exception of iceland li et al 2021 used data from two large ensemble simulations under the rcp8 5 scenario to construct projections of 100 year drought events the results show that as global warming continues the frequency of extreme droughts increases droughts are widely reported to worsen with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations dai et al 2018 duan et al 2021 park et al 2018 but this is not supported by observations and simulations of precipitation and other hydrological quantities giorgi et al 2019 lu et al 2019 scheff 2018 for henan province previous drought studies generally used indices such as standardized precipitation index spi xu et al 2020 or standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei chen et al 2017 shi et al 2017 the results suggest that the occurrence of drought in henan province has increased on annual seasonal and monthly scales since 1961 the frequency of drought occurrence was lowest in the central and western regions of henan the most severe droughts occurred in spring and summer followed by autumn large scale droughts occurred in 1966 1968 and 2013 the intensity of droughts was higher in north and west henan and lower in east and south henan however there are certain limitations in spi spei the assumption that the data follows a predefined probability distribution may undermine the robustness of the results since different distribution assumption may yield different result angelidis et al 2012 in addition spi spei may present unreasonable values when applied to regions with low seasonal precipitation on short time scales 1 2 or 3 months hayes et al 1999 on the other hand drought identification methods based on percentile thresholds involves no assumptions about the data distribution trenberth et al 2014 ukkola et al 2020 therefore it is desired that a percentile based index be used to characterize drought in henan province to better reflect its spatiotemporal features as an extension of previous studies the objective of this study is to explore the future changes in meteorological drought conditions of henan province in china by using a percentile based drought index specifically statistical downscaling of gcm precipitation is undertaken through random forests breiman 2001 an ensemble of five gcms from the phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 is employed to achieve robust projections cmip6 products outperform cmip5 in terms of accuracy statistics there is greater agreement among the models in cmip6 compared to cmip5 but inter model differences still exist aadhar and mishra 2020 bağçaci et al 2021 shu et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 this implies that the climate signals obtained through cmip6 are improved relative to cmip5 three scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 are considered so that the uncertainty associated with greenhouse gas emissions can be reflected next future meteorological droughts are derived from the downscaled precipitation through a percentile based drought index future changes and trends in the duration frequency and intensity of droughts are then examined the results of the study can provide an informative reference on the uncertainty that climate change brings to irrigation management 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 study area henan province is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in central china with a subtropical and temperate monsoon climate and distinct seasonal changes and is surrounded by mountains to the north west and south fig 1 henan s annual mean temperature is about 12 16 c and annual precipitation is about 500 900 mm shi et al 2017 2 2 data this study uses observations including meteorological station data and climate reanalysis data and gcm output to validate the model and generate regional climate change scenarios monthly precipitation data for 1985 2014 at 12 meteorological stations fig 1 in henan province are obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration are used as the predictands in the random forests downscaling model stations with missing values and abnormal values are removed and the monthly precipitation data used in the study are derived from the daily observations the large scale predictors are derived from the latest global reanalysis dataset era5 hersbach et al 2020 five gcms are selected based on their ability to simulate the regional climate of china bcc csm2 mr wu et al 2019 canesm5 swart et al 2019 ec earth veg döscher et al 2021 miroc6 tatebe et al 2019 and mpi esm1 2 hr müller et al 2018 historical experiment is used in this study as well as three future scenarios of each project reaching 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 w m 2 radiative forcing by 2100 the three future scenarios used are the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 1 2 6 2 4 5 and 5 8 5 ssp1 2 6 is a low ending range of future scenario ssp2 4 5 represents an intermediate middle of the road scenario and ssp5 8 5 denotes a high emissions scenario o neill et al 2016 the model output is regridded to the common 1 resolution for mapping using radial basis function interpolation in the study three 30 year time slices 1985 2014 for the historical climate 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 for future climate are used for monthly near surface climate downscaling the details of the datasets used in this study are shown in table 1 2 3 random forests downscaling method due to limited spatial resolution physical simplifications and incomplete knowledge of the climate system climate model outputs often cannot reproduce the statistical properties of regional observations under the current climate li et al 2021 in this study a downscaling method based on random forests is used to make the projections more consistent with regional characteristics random forests are an ensemble learning method that aggregates the results of multiple models to obtain better performance due to its capability and simplicity random forests have been used in many fields such as hydrological simulation prieto et al 2019 air quality forecasting hu et al 2017 downscaling of climate variables he et al 2016 random forests are an improvement of bagging method which introduces random attribute selection in the decision tree training process based on the decision tree as the base learner to build the ensemble of bagging method the random forests algorithm initially draws n tree bootstrap samples from the original data then for each sample generates an unpruned tree followed by m try randomly selected predictors then at each node the best split is chosen to split into two daughter nodes hastie et al 2009 finally the prediction is performed by aggregating the predictions of n tree trees additionally predictions from out of bag samples can be used to calculate the error rate in this study meteorological observations and large scale predictors are used to build a random forests downscaling model the large scale predictors in the random forests downscaling algorithm are intended to represent effectively the variability of precipitation over different regions in random forests downscaling large scale predictors will be introduced into the model optionally based on the magnitude of correlation with monthly precipitation the random forests downscaling in this study will make a trade off between algorithm complexity and the number of input variables with insensitivity to multicollinearity ensuring that the results are robust to missing and non equilibrium data and have satisfactory predictions of monthly precipitation moreover this process avoids overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the model so that complex meteorological states can be carved and applied to other regions with acceptable performance according to the statistical correlation between monthly precipitation observations and meteorological variables six main predictors are introduced in the random forests downscaling model to improve the generalization ability the large scale predictors include total mean precipitation rate kg m 2 s 1 near surface temperature k eastward near surface wind m s 1 northward near surface wind m s 1 surface upward sensible heat flux w m 2 and surface downwelling shortwave radiation w m 2 the detailed steps of the developed random forests downscaling model are as follows 1 the input variables should be aggregated to match the conventional resolution in this study meteorological variables from era5 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 are first interpolated onto a grid with a spatial resolution of 1 1 using radial basis functions subsequently the large scale predictors at 1 1 spatial resolution will be established with statistical relationships between station observations of monthly precipitation based on the proximity principle 2 the random forests downscaling model between monthly precipitation and explanatory large scale predictors can be expressed as 1 p f tpr nst uas vas shf sdsr where p represents the precipitation tpr represents the mean total precipitation rate nst represents the near surface temperature uas represents the eastward near surface wind vas represents the northward near surface wind shf represents the surface upward sensible heat flux and sdsr represents the surface downwelling shortwave radiation the function f indicates a nonlinear relationship between precipitation and these explanatory variables assuming the same statistical relationships between future precipitation and other large scale predictors as in the historical period multiple gcm outputs from the three scenarios are subsequently fed into the trained models to generate predictions of precipitation out of bag error is one of the most important parameters of the random forests model out of bag oob samples are samples that are not involved in the training of the model the oob samples in each tree are used as a testing dataset to ensure unbiased estimation of the errors wu and li 2019 therefore there is no need to perform cross validation to obtain an unbiased estimate of the error as an unbiased estimate can be built during model construction the optimal key parameters for the random forests model are derived from the oob error estimation traversal the number of decision trees n estimators and the maximum number of features to be split max features with n estimators of 300 and max features of 6 2 4 drought index many drought indices exist that can be used to characterize and quantify drought and its properties in this study only meteorological droughts deficiency of rainfall that can be underpinned by long term observations are considered gcms show better consistency and higher proficiency in precipitation droughts compared to runoff and soil moisture droughts ukkola et al 2018 using the percentile rather than the mean to define droughts and their variability may be a better approach as this approach does not involve assumptions about the distribution of the data trenberth et al 2014 ukkola et al 2020 the 15th percentile is used as the drought threshold in this study so any month below this threshold is classified as a drought the monthly precipitation time series is first converted to a 3 month running mean to smooth out short term variations which can reflect seasonal drought variations then the 15th percentile threshold is defined for each month separately from the 3 month running mean precipitation to account for seasonality monthly percentile thresholds are defined using the period 1985 2014 so that all drought indicators are related to this historical baseline period the common 30 year time period is used to define thresholds to account for climate variability three common metrics of drought are calculated duration frequency and intensity drought duration duration months is defined as the number of months in which the running mean precipitation is below the drought threshold drought frequency is the number of drought events over a period of time 10 years in this study drought intensity intensity mm month 1 is the mean difference between the drought threshold p 15 k mm and the monthly running mean precipitation value p k mm during a drought event the drought intensity can be expressed as 2 intensity p 15 k p k duration k i j where i refers to the start month of a drought event and j refers to the end month 3 results 3 1 model validation the random forests are applied to develop the downscaling models for monthly precipitation using the era5 reanalysis and the 12 station observations the 1985 2014 period is split into two parts 1985 2009 and 2010 2014 with one part used for calibration and the other for validation the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse between the downscaled monthly precipitation and observations for the validation period at the 12 meteorological stations are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the r 2 values are between 0 66 and 0 89 for all meteorological stations and the rmse values are between 27 68 and 49 11 mm the minimum r 2 value and the maximum rmse value appear simultaneously at the tongbai station in southern henan province fig 2k generally the monthly precipitation generated by the random forests downscaling model is in relatively good agreement with the observations in addition a set of comparative experiments is undertaken to demonstrate the superior performance of random forests there are many statistical downscaling methods available and in this study quantile regression qr and support vector machine svm are selected based on their

shown in fig 4 the strongest increase is projected in zhengzhou with increases in drought duration about 0 54 months in 2031 2060 under ssp5 8 5 fig 4e in contrast the greatest decrease in drought duration is expected in the sanmenxia in 2071 2100 under ssp1 2 6 with a decrease of about 0 58 months fig 4b for future periods the drought duration in 2071 2100 decreases over a wider area than in 2031 2060 except under ssp2 4 5 in particular the shorter droughts area is reduced in 2071 2100 than in 2031 2060 under sspp2 4 5 additionally under ssp1 2 6 the drought duration in 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 is decreasing in almost the entire province as the concentration scenario goes from low to high the longer droughts gradually spread southward from the core area of zhengzhou overall the location of the cores with longer droughts is similar under the different scenarios but the area under sspp5 8 5 is more extensive projected changes in drought frequency relative to historical baseline period under different emission scenarios are displayed in fig 5 a notable feature in fig 5 is that drought frequency exhibits an almost uniform decline across henan with the greatest decline in the western region the patterns exhibit little difference under different emission scenarios under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 the decrease of drought frequency in henan province is greater in 2071 2100 than in 2031 2060 fig 5c f the greatest decrease in the frequency of drought in henan province is found in 2071 2100 under ssp5 8 5 fig 5f specifically the magnitude and spatial distribution of the decline in drought frequency in henan province in 2071 2100 under ssp1 2 6 are generally similar to those in 2031 2060 fig 5a b overall a larger decrease in eastern henan province than in central henan province can be found fig 6 shows the multi model projection of future changes in drought intensity in henan province intensification of drought in the southern part of henan province is predicted to be the greatest in 2031 2060 under ssp5 8 5 including zhumadian nanyang and xinyang fig 6e the whole henan province presents a non homogeneous pattern of future changes in drought intensity droughts are projected to intensify in most areas in 2031 2100 under ssp1 2 6 while decreasing in intensity in most areas in 2071 2100 fig 6a b similar patterns can be found under ssp5 8 5 but with a larger magnitude of changes fig 6e f notably the drought intensity in the mountainous areas of southern henan presents a decrease under both ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 under ssp2 4 5 the changes of drought intensity in most of henan in 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 are relatively small but the drought intensity in northeastern henan shows a marked decrease fig 6c d in general drought intensity is projected to follow a diverse pattern of changes with emission scenarios 3 3 changes in precipitation mean and variability future changes in drought may come from changes in precipitation mean and variability by analyzing the changes in the mean and standard deviation of monthly precipitation this study investigates the changes in the mean and variability as drivers of future drought mean precipitation shows an increase to a large extent which is consistent with previous studies fig 7 under ssp1 2 6 the mean monthly precipitation increases and the spatial pattern is approximately similar for both 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 fig 7a b a greater magnitude but almost the same spatial pattern of increase in mean monthly precipitation in 2071 2100 compared to 2031 2060 under ssp2 4 5 fig 7c d mean monthly precipitation under ssp5 8 5 shows the same pattern but a greater increase compared to under ssp2 4 5 fig 7e f the increase in mean monthly precipitation is projected to be greater in eastern henan province than in other regions with a maximum value of about 46 44 mm month 1 the monthly precipitation trends and their statistical significance are examined by first performing a 24 month running mean followed by the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 and calculating the sen s slope estimate sen 1968 see table 2 for the results the monthly mean precipitation at all 12 stations exhibits a significant increasing trend with p values less than 0 001 the trend at anyang station is the largest among all stations with 0 0290 mm month 1 the magnitude of the trends is greater for most stations under ssp5 8 5 compared to under ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 the changes in the standard deviation of future monthly precipitation are shown in fig 8 under ssp1 2 6 the standard deviation of monthly precipitation increases over a larger area in 2071 2100 than in 2031 2060 mainly centered in northeastern henan fig 8a b the standard deviation of monthly precipitation under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 has a very similar pattern to that under ssp1 2 6 except that the area of increase is larger and the values are greater fig 8c f the greatest increase in the standard deviation of monthly precipitation appears in northeastern henan about 30 86 mm month 1 fig 8f the results of the mk test and sen s slope estimates for the 10 year running standard deviation of monthly precipitation are shown in table 3 precipitation variability will increase significantly at most stations p 0 001 under ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 the precipitation variability of a few stations will experience a slight decrease for example zhumadian at ssp1 2 6 shows a downward trend of 0 0028 p 0 001 4 discussion the results presented in this study are based on a multi model ensemble under three emission scenarios which allows this study to provide a reliable prognosis by providing a sufficient perspectives this study also applies random forests for downscaling to the gcm outputs which allows this study to succeed in achieving good performance in simulating precipitation and drought in henan therefore this study is more confident in predicting future drought events however the results do differ significantly between the three scenarios with the magnitude of change under ssp2 4 5 being even smaller compared to ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 the patterns of drought and precipitation changes are notably different in the two future periods investigated in this study extensively the changes in drought duration map to changes in mean precipitation but the intensity changes are driven by a combination of mean and variability the increase in drought duration and intensity in the regions represented by xinyang is mainly caused by increased monthly precipitation variability although precipitation variability is not as strong as drought indicators drought projections for zhengzhou are driven in part by changes in mean and variability while the increase in mean precipitation has reduced the frequency of future droughts the high variability of precipitation will cause both the drought duration and intensity to increase in some areas however some studies suggest that using long term mean precipitation to quantify drought variability is insufficient and leads to lower confidence in future drought projections apurv and cai 2021 ukkola et al 2020 the mean and standard deviation of precipitation for different emission scenarios appears to increase at different degrees their interactions contribute to diverse variations in drought characteristics under different emission scenarios changes in other meteorological variables can also have potential influence on meteorological drought projection results therefore it is recommended that more meteorological variables be considered in future studies 5 conclusion in this study meteorological drought is projected by downscaled five global climate model outputs under three emission scenarios through random forests method the changes in the 3 metrics of meteorological drought i e duration frequency and intensity relative to the historical period are analyzed to evaluate the impact of climate change on meteorological drought based on the trends of drought duration frequency and intensity this study provides a reliable outlook of drought risks in henan for two future periods it is found that the drought duration and intensity in southern henan increase in 2031 2060 under ssp5 8 5 given the increase in monthly precipitation variability in henan the region would probably face a high meteorological drought risk in the middle of this century on the other hand although drought frequency decreases increases are to occur in both drought duration and intensity highlighting the need for a water system adjustments for addressing high drought risk levels beyond those observed in the past furthermore many areas in henan are short of groundwater urgent action should be considered for areas with high drought risk in the near term droughts are projected with higher variability under scenarios with more intense emissions drought risk management strategies should be developed that take into account the heterogeneous and nonlinear impacts of

1363,future changes in drought events are critical for risk assessment and associated policymaking in this study the future changes in meteorological droughts in henan province china are explored random forests downscaling model is first constructed based on era5 reanalysis data and meteorological observations the model is validated using evaluation indices such as r 2 and rmse and is shown to be able to capture the relationship between large scale predictors and monthly precipitation the validated random forests downscaling model is driven by multiple global climate models gcms from the phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 under three emission scenarios for projecting three future drought characteristics duration frequency and intensity results show that drought frequency decreases in most areas of henan while drought duration and intensity increase in various degrees some differences are also observed among different emission scenarios especially under ssp2 4 5 where the magnitudes of changes in drought duration and intensity are lower relative to other scenarios the decrease in drought frequency in most areas is found to be caused by increases in monthly mean precipitation in this study changes in drought duration and intensity are related to a combination of increases in precipitation mean and variability keywords meteorological drought precipitation statistical downscaling climate change 1 introduction drought is one of the natural hazards which bring severe disruptions to society economy and agriculture in recent decades many regions around the world have been dramatically affected by drought resulting in reduced crop yields as well as damages to local food security globally about three quarters of the harvested area 454 million hectares experienced drought induced yield losses during 1983 2009 with up to 166 billion u s dollars cumulative harvest losses kim et al 2019 droughts of even moderate severity can pose significant socioeconomic risks because they have the potential to rapidly deplete water resources shrestha and wang 2019 yu et al 2020 which can reduce the ability of an ecosystem to recover zhang et al 2018 many studies have shown that the intensifying droughts are highly related to global warming climate change is likely to cause more frequent and severe droughts exerting negative influence on water resources and food security cook et al 2015 thus understanding the variations in the spatiotemporal characteristics of future droughts in the context of climate change is of vital importance to the design of relevant adaptation and mitigation measures a large number of previous studies were focused on the projections of drought characteristics under global warming martin 2018 used future projections from 24 coupled global climate models gcms to assess how the number duration and severity of future droughts will change and concluded that drought events in humid regions are expected to be less frequent shorter in duration and weaker cook et al 2015 used empirical drought reconstructions and three soil moisture metrics from 17 gcms and predicted substantially drier conditions in the second half of the 21st century compared with those of the 20th century or earlier paleoclimate intervals spinoni et al 2018 used bias corrected data from 11 regional climate models and found that droughts are expected to become increasingly frequent and severe across the european continent with the exception of iceland li et al 2021 used data from two large ensemble simulations under the rcp8 5 scenario to construct projections of 100 year drought events the results show that as global warming continues the frequency of extreme droughts increases droughts are widely reported to worsen with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations dai et al 2018 duan et al 2021 park et al 2018 but this is not supported by observations and simulations of precipitation and other hydrological quantities giorgi et al 2019 lu et al 2019 scheff 2018 for henan province previous drought studies generally used indices such as standardized precipitation index spi xu et al 2020 or standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei chen et al 2017 shi et al 2017 the results suggest that the occurrence of drought in henan province has increased on annual seasonal and monthly scales since 1961 the frequency of drought occurrence was lowest in the central and western regions of henan the most severe droughts occurred in spring and summer followed by autumn large scale droughts occurred in 1966 1968 and 2013 the intensity of droughts was higher in north and west henan and lower in east and south henan however there are certain limitations in spi spei the assumption that the data follows a predefined probability distribution may undermine the robustness of the results since different distribution assumption may yield different result angelidis et al 2012 in addition spi spei may present unreasonable values when applied to regions with low seasonal precipitation on short time scales 1 2 or 3 months hayes et al 1999 on the other hand drought identification methods based on percentile thresholds involves no assumptions about the data distribution trenberth et al 2014 ukkola et al 2020 therefore it is desired that a percentile based index be used to characterize drought in henan province to better reflect its spatiotemporal features as an extension of previous studies the objective of this study is to explore the future changes in meteorological drought conditions of henan province in china by using a percentile based drought index specifically statistical downscaling of gcm precipitation is undertaken through random forests breiman 2001 an ensemble of five gcms from the phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 is employed to achieve robust projections cmip6 products outperform cmip5 in terms of accuracy statistics there is greater agreement among the models in cmip6 compared to cmip5 but inter model differences still exist aadhar and mishra 2020 bağçaci et al 2021 shu et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 this implies that the climate signals obtained through cmip6 are improved relative to cmip5 three scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 are considered so that the uncertainty associated with greenhouse gas emissions can be reflected next future meteorological droughts are derived from the downscaled precipitation through a percentile based drought index future changes and trends in the duration frequency and intensity of droughts are then examined the results of the study can provide an informative reference on the uncertainty that climate change brings to irrigation management 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 study area henan province is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in central china with a subtropical and temperate monsoon climate and distinct seasonal changes and is surrounded by mountains to the north west and south fig 1 henan s annual mean temperature is about 12 16 c and annual precipitation is about 500 900 mm shi et al 2017 2 2 data this study uses observations including meteorological station data and climate reanalysis data and gcm output to validate the model and generate regional climate change scenarios monthly precipitation data for 1985 2014 at 12 meteorological stations fig 1 in henan province are obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration are used as the predictands in the random forests downscaling model stations with missing values and abnormal values are removed and the monthly precipitation data used in the study are derived from the daily observations the large scale predictors are derived from the latest global reanalysis dataset era5 hersbach et al 2020 five gcms are selected based on their ability to simulate the regional climate of china bcc csm2 mr wu et al 2019 canesm5 swart et al 2019 ec earth veg döscher et al 2021 miroc6 tatebe et al 2019 and mpi esm1 2 hr müller et al 2018 historical experiment is used in this study as well as three future scenarios of each project reaching 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 w m 2 radiative forcing by 2100 the three future scenarios used are the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 1 2 6 2 4 5 and 5 8 5 ssp1 2 6 is a low ending range of future scenario ssp2 4 5 represents an intermediate middle of the road scenario and ssp5 8 5 denotes a high emissions scenario o neill et al 2016 the model output is regridded to the common 1 resolution for mapping using radial basis function interpolation in the study three 30 year time slices 1985 2014 for the historical climate 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 for future climate are used for monthly near surface climate downscaling the details of the datasets used in this study are shown in table 1 2 3 random forests downscaling method due to limited spatial resolution physical simplifications and incomplete knowledge of the climate system climate model outputs often cannot reproduce the statistical properties of regional observations under the current climate li et al 2021 in this study a downscaling method based on random forests is used to make the projections more consistent with regional characteristics random forests are an ensemble learning method that aggregates the results of multiple models to obtain better performance due to its capability and simplicity random forests have been used in many fields such as hydrological simulation prieto et al 2019 air quality forecasting hu et al 2017 downscaling of climate variables he et al 2016 random forests are an improvement of bagging method which introduces random attribute selection in the decision tree training process based on the decision tree as the base learner to build the ensemble of bagging method the random forests algorithm initially draws n tree bootstrap samples from the original data then for each sample generates an unpruned tree followed by m try randomly selected predictors then at each node the best split is chosen to split into two daughter nodes hastie et al 2009 finally the prediction is performed by aggregating the predictions of n tree trees additionally predictions from out of bag samples can be used to calculate the error rate in this study meteorological observations and large scale predictors are used to build a random forests downscaling model the large scale predictors in the random forests downscaling algorithm are intended to represent effectively the variability of precipitation over different regions in random forests downscaling large scale predictors will be introduced into the model optionally based on the magnitude of correlation with monthly precipitation the random forests downscaling in this study will make a trade off between algorithm complexity and the number of input variables with insensitivity to multicollinearity ensuring that the results are robust to missing and non equilibrium data and have satisfactory predictions of monthly precipitation moreover this process avoids overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the model so that complex meteorological states can be carved and applied to other regions with acceptable performance according to the statistical correlation between monthly precipitation observations and meteorological variables six main predictors are introduced in the random forests downscaling model to improve the generalization ability the large scale predictors include total mean precipitation rate kg m 2 s 1 near surface temperature k eastward near surface wind m s 1 northward near surface wind m s 1 surface upward sensible heat flux w m 2 and surface downwelling shortwave radiation w m 2 the detailed steps of the developed random forests downscaling model are as follows 1 the input variables should be aggregated to match the conventional resolution in this study meteorological variables from era5 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 are first interpolated onto a grid with a spatial resolution of 1 1 using radial basis functions subsequently the large scale predictors at 1 1 spatial resolution will be established with statistical relationships between station observations of monthly precipitation based on the proximity principle 2 the random forests downscaling model between monthly precipitation and explanatory large scale predictors can be expressed as 1 p f tpr nst uas vas shf sdsr where p represents the precipitation tpr represents the mean total precipitation rate nst represents the near surface temperature uas represents the eastward near surface wind vas represents the northward near surface wind shf represents the surface upward sensible heat flux and sdsr represents the surface downwelling shortwave radiation the function f indicates a nonlinear relationship between precipitation and these explanatory variables assuming the same statistical relationships between future precipitation and other large scale predictors as in the historical period multiple gcm outputs from the three scenarios are subsequently fed into the trained models to generate predictions of precipitation out of bag error is one of the most important parameters of the random forests model out of bag oob samples are samples that are not involved in the training of the model the oob samples in each tree are used as a testing dataset to ensure unbiased estimation of the errors wu and li 2019 therefore there is no need to perform cross validation to obtain an unbiased estimate of the error as an unbiased estimate can be built during model construction the optimal key parameters for the random forests model are derived from the oob error estimation traversal the number of decision trees n estimators and the maximum number of features to be split max features with n estimators of 300 and max features of 6 2 4 drought index many drought indices exist that can be used to characterize and quantify drought and its properties in this study only meteorological droughts deficiency of rainfall that can be underpinned by long term observations are considered gcms show better consistency and higher proficiency in precipitation droughts compared to runoff and soil moisture droughts ukkola et al 2018 using the percentile rather than the mean to define droughts and their variability may be a better approach as this approach does not involve assumptions about the distribution of the data trenberth et al 2014 ukkola et al 2020 the 15th percentile is used as the drought threshold in this study so any month below this threshold is classified as a drought the monthly precipitation time series is first converted to a 3 month running mean to smooth out short term variations which can reflect seasonal drought variations then the 15th percentile threshold is defined for each month separately from the 3 month running mean precipitation to account for seasonality monthly percentile thresholds are defined using the period 1985 2014 so that all drought indicators are related to this historical baseline period the common 30 year time period is used to define thresholds to account for climate variability three common metrics of drought are calculated duration frequency and intensity drought duration duration months is defined as the number of months in which the running mean precipitation is below the drought threshold drought frequency is the number of drought events over a period of time 10 years in this study drought intensity intensity mm month 1 is the mean difference between the drought threshold p 15 k mm and the monthly running mean precipitation value p k mm during a drought event the drought intensity can be expressed as 2 intensity p 15 k p k duration k i j where i refers to the start month of a drought event and j refers to the end month 3 results 3 1 model validation the random forests are applied to develop the downscaling models for monthly precipitation using the era5 reanalysis and the 12 station observations the 1985 2014 period is split into two parts 1985 2009 and 2010 2014 with one part used for calibration and the other for validation the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse between the downscaled monthly precipitation and observations for the validation period at the 12 meteorological stations are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the r 2 values are between 0 66 and 0 89 for all meteorological stations and the rmse values are between 27 68 and 49 11 mm the minimum r 2 value and the maximum rmse value appear simultaneously at the tongbai station in southern henan province fig 2k generally the monthly precipitation generated by the random forests downscaling model is in relatively good agreement with the observations in addition a set of comparative experiments is undertaken to demonstrate the superior performance of random forests there are many statistical downscaling methods available and in this study quantile regression qr and support vector machine svm are selected based on their popularity of use qr is a method used to estimate the quantile of the response variable distribution conditional on a given set of predictor variables using a linear model it provides a more complete statistical view than classical expectation regression svm can be represented as a two layer neural network and can be used for both linear and nonlinear regression the principle of svm is based on

precipitation in henan province the rmse and r 2 are calculated to indicate the performance of the three methods fig 3 shows the performance of these three methods in simulating precipitation in henan province from 2010 to 2014 it can be seen that random forests have a smaller rmse and a larger r 2 value which demonstrates that rf outperforms qr and svm in simulating precipitation in henan province

1364,the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in water poses a serious threat to the human health due to their toxic effects therefore the removal of these compounds from drinking water in potable water treatment plants pwtps should be evaluated and optimized to assure the quality of water intended for human consumption in this work changes in pahs levels during drinking water treatment processes have been monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional processes in the removal of these recalcitrant pollutants several chemical treatment methods based on the addition of kmno4 fecl3 and naclo were evaluated through jar tests the analysis of pah content of aqueous samples was carried out by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry the highest removal efficiency over 90 was obtained for benzo a anthracene benzo a pyrene and dibenzo a h anthracene the most recalcitrant compounds to degradation were fluorene anthracene phenanthrene and flouranthene with reduction rates between 45 and 57 the conventional treatment processes assessed have been proved to be effective reducing the pah below the legal limits of drinking water quality the definition of a parameter based on chemical properties of pahs i e sorption capacity and energy required to remove an electron enabled the prediction of removal rate of pollutants which represents a valuable information for the plant operation keywords potable water purification plant pahs removal conventional treatment jar tests 1 introduction over the last decades the presence of persistent organic pollutant such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs has been detected in aquatic environment these hazardous organic pollutants containing two or more fused benzene rings are generally characterized by low solubility low vapor pressure and high melting and boiling points some pahs have been classified as priority contaminants due to their toxic mutagenic carcinogenic and estrogenic effects on humans bojes and pope 2007 in general pahs are formed as product of incomplete combustion from natural coal oil and wood and man made combustion sources automobile emissions abdel shafy and mansour 2016 in addition to pyrogenic sources pahs can be of petrogenic and biologic origin petrogenic pahs are formed during crude oil maturation and similar processes the pahs produced by bacteria and plants are classified as biologic harrison et al 1975 hence the production of pahs can be associated with either anthropogenic processes or natural activities being the anthropogenic contribution the most relevant fernández et al 2000 pahs has been commonly detected in air soil and water entailing a ubiquitous environment risk the low solubility of pahs in water causes their attachment to the surface of particular matter which promotes they reach the hydrosphere he et al 2021 according to karyab et al 2013 pahs enter water sources predominantly through fossils fuels combustion petroleum spill road runoff industrial wastewater leaching from creosote impregnate wood and dry and wet deposition karyab et al 2013 hence pahs have been reported in drinking water rivers and lakes groundwater wastewater seawater and sediments mojiri et al 2019 provided a comprehensive review on the most relevant pahs contained in water environments they reported benz a anthracene and phenanthrene in treated and untreated drinking water respectively biological and physical chemical methods have been explored to effectively remove pahs from aqueous solutions among biological treatment methods bioreactor phytoremediation and bioremediation are the most common approaches proposed to reduce pah contaminants in municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps the biodegradation of organic pollutant occurring both aerobically and anaerobically is achieved through activated sludge process sequencing batch reactors and membrane bioreactors fatone et al 2011 giordano et al 2005 qiao et al 2016 concerning physical chemical treatment methods the most commonly applied to remove pahs from water are membrane filtration i e microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis li et al 2019 adsorption dai et al 2020 advanced oxidation processes i e ozonation electrochemical oxidation fenton reagents and uv badawy et al 2006 gaurav et al 2021 and chemical precipitation smol and włodarczyk makuła 2017 pah oxidation by the addition of chemical reagents includes hydroxyl radical ozone and permanganate ion boulangé et al 2019 the production of hydroxyl radicals could be achieved by several methods such as adding fenton reagents and hydrogen peroxide uv reaction and ultrasonic cavitation rubio clemente et al 2014 the degradation of pahs using ozone is produced not only by direct oxidation of the target compounds by o3 but also by indirect radical oxidation at basic ph beltran et al 1995 the oxidation of pahs contained in water using permanganate shows some important advantages effectiveness across a wide ph range low cost easy and safe to use high stability and mobility stewart 1964 the oxidation of organic contaminant by permanganate ion is based on the formation of mno4 ions in aqueous systems which are an efficient and strong oxidant to break alkene cc double bonds of the pahs structure in general the oxidation of organic contaminant by permanganate ion generates manganese dioxide plus organic intermediates rox or co2 de souza e silva et al 2009 and could be represented as r mno 4 mno 2 co 2 r mno 4 mno 2 rox the specific mechanisms of permanganate oxidation of pahs are complex due to the numerous reactions in which mn can be involved as a consequence of its multiple mineral forms and valence states ferrarese et al 2008 furthermore some studies have concluded that the reactivity of chemical degradation of pahs by permanganate depends on the molecular structure of the pollutant brown et al 2003 at this point it should be highlighted that individual pahs can differ significantly in their physical and chemical properties which difficult the development of remediation techniques for pahs contaminated sites therefore studies dealing with the simultaneous removal of pahs from real matrices are required for a better understanding of the pollutant behaviour these results would be really valuable not only to propose new remediation techniques but also to develop tools for the prediction of the pollutant removal under different experimental conditions the aim of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional treatment processes from a potable water treatment plant pwtp in the simultaneous removal of several pahs the role of three chemicals used commonly in water potabilization i e potassium permanganate as oxidant fecl3 as coagulant and naclo as disinfectant in the degradation of pahs from aqueous solutions has been explored through the simulation of the plant by means of jar tests the analysis of pah samples was carried out using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms experimental results allowed to develop an approach to predict the percentage of the removal of several pahs from water based on their chemical properties 2 material and method 2 1 water purification plant this study was performed in the potable water treatment plant pwtp of atabal fig 1 operated by the municipal water company of malaga emasa the plant is designed to treat a water influent of 2500 l s 1 collected from natural supply sources the treatment process for potable supplies involves several steps including coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration the conventional treatment embraces the chemical addition system first potassium permanganate kmno4 is fed into the raw water in a concentration of 0 35 mg l 1 with a reaction time of 8 min then sodium hypochlorite naclo is added as chemical disinfectant with a final concentration of 2 mg l 1 of free chlorine at the same time ferric chloride fecl3 is added to water as coagulant in a concentration of 18 mg l 1 the contact time is also of 8 min after chemical addition sedimentation is performed to remove solid particles from water the clarification system of the plant consists of an accelerator clarifier with a capacity of 500 l s 1 and two accelerator is clarifiers equipped with a mobile diametric girded braced and a sludge scraper system with a total capacity of 2000 l s 1 the clarified water is submitted to filtration to separate suspended and colloidal particles the filtration system consists of twenty sand filters acuzur type v with a total capacity of 2500 l s 1 the treated water could be directly transported to the water supply network or pumped to the desalination plant the generated sludge during the described process is treated in a clarifier densadeg which combines the principle of lamellar settling with an integrated sludge thickener after centrifugation the dehydrated sludge is transported to the nearest wastewater treatment plant wwtp 2 2 water sampling and analysis water samples were collected from the entrance of the pwtp the main physicochemical parameters were determined using normalized methods accredited by une iso iec 17025 the parameters analysed were colour turbidity ph value conductivity chloride calcium magnesium and sodium content hardness oxidability free residual and combined chlorine and langelier saturation index experiments were performed using three different water samples to assure reproducibility of experimental conditions this work was focused on 13 pahs categorized by the usepa as priority contaminants including benzo ghi perylene bghip chrysene chy benz a anthracene baa benzo b fluoranthene bbf anthracene ant benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap fluoranthene flu indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene icdp phenanthrene phe dibenz a h anthracene daha fluorene fl and pyrene pyr their chemical properties can be found in table 1 for extraction the commercial stir bar twister was employed for all pahs measurement the stirring of the aqueous sample was carried out during 16 h at 850 rpm when this step had been completed the twister was transferred to thermal desorption unit to obtain the organic compounds in aqueous samples to be analysed gas chromatography gc coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms provides reliability and sensitivity for the trace analysis of organic pollutant in the environment the advantages of using gc ms rely on the efficiency of gas chromatography separation and the good qualitative information and high sensitivity provided by mass spectrometry ms santos and galceran 2003 therefore the pahs content of samples was determined by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer 6890 n agilent according to the method 525 3 epa 600 r 12 010 munch 2012 the column used was db5ms ui with helium as carrier gas the oven temperature was programmed starting at 70 c for 2 min gradually increased to 285 c where it held for 5 min the injection was set at 40 c increased to 325 c where it held for 7 min 2 3 jar tests jar tests were selected as a well known tool to simulate full scale pwtp the multiple stirrer jar test apparatus used stuart provides a constant rotational speed of the stainless steel paddles to assure reproducible results the experimental procedure is schematically presented in fig 2 the concentration of pahs in raw water sample 1 was almost negligible fl 2 25 10 3 μg l 1 phe 3 05 10 3 μg l 1 ant 3 35 10 3 μg l 1 flu 2 00 10 3 μg l 1 pyr 7 50 10 4

experiments first a standard mixture solution of the aforementioned pahs 100 μg l 1 in methanol acetone was added to the real water samples to obtain a total concentration of each pah of 0 1 μg l 1 as can be seen in table 1 the selected concentration is close to water solubility for some pahs thus the study was not only based on the study of soluble pah but also pah attached to solid particles contained in the water the experiments consisted in introducing 1 l of the spiked water sample in the jars after that the kmno4 was added and the paddles velocity was of 150 rpm during 8 min then a water sample of 100 ml was collected to analyse the pah content afterwards a known mass of naclo and fecl3 was added to the water samples and the agitator was set at 150 rpm during 8 min at last the agitation was stopped with the aim of allowing the particles to settle down during 30 min then a final water sample of 100 ml was withdrawn to determine the pah content the reagents were added in the same proportion as in the pwtp 3 results and discussion 3 1 water characterization according to the spanish legislation boe a 1988 20883 1988 the water treatment should involve intensive physicochemical treatment refine and disinfection in view of the characteristics of raw water table 2 the parametric values for potable drink water after treatment reported by the european union eu and the world health organization who european union 5ad world health organization 2017 are also presented in table 2 the error values correspond to the standard deviation of the results for the three different raw water samples used in this work the colour of raw water was within established limits whereas its level of turbidity was higher turbidity could be associated with suspended particles chemical precipitates organic particles and organism although most particles that contribute to turbidity have no health significance the aforementioned treatment entails the reduction of this parameter below the maximum recommended value the ph value was within the recommended standard which ranged from 6 5 to 9 5 the electrical conductivity directly associated with the concentration of dissolved salts was close to the maximum recommended contents of chloride and sodium were higher than the standard values according to the who these results could be associated with saline intrusion mineral deposits seawater spray sewage effluents and salt used in road de icing in this particular case high salinity is associated with saline intrusion in natural supply sources the values of calcium and magnesium content which are not considered of health concern by who were within the taste threshold the hardness was lower than 500 mg l 1 which is the maximum value that consumers usually tolerate the oxygen demand free and combined chlorine content were also below the reference values the langelier index which is used to predict calcium precipitation was slightly higher than the recommended value it should be noted that water after treatment complies with the quality values required in the current spanish regulations 3 2 jar tests results in this section results of the jar tests simulating water treatment with kmno4 are firstly discussed the chemical oxidation involving permanganate has been widely used for the destruction of organic contaminants in several matrices gates anderson et al 2001 as shown in fig 3 the pah concentration in sample 3 fig 2 for all selected contaminants was reduced after permanganate treatment the error bars for all the figures presented in this section correspond to two time the standard deviation of the triplicated experiments the rate reduction was pah specific varying between 50 and 80 the higher reduction was detected for benzo a pyrene while the most recalcitrant to degradation were fluorene phenanthrene fluoranthene benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene the divergences in pah removal could be associated with the pah chemical structure which directly influences on the mechanism reactions although several mechanisms and pathways has been reported to explain the pah oxidation the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction has been proved to be the most relevant for these compounds forsey et al 2010 for this pathway the ionization potential i e the ability to donate electrons could be used as a tool to approximate the energy involved in the pah oxidation as the ability to donate an electron decreases the rate of the reaction also decreases therefore the higher values of ionization potential for fluorene 7 93 ev phenanthrene 7 91 ev and fluoranthene 7 80 ev dewar et al 1970 could explain their lower removal compared with the rest of pahs the recalcitrant behaviour experimentally observed for benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene has been previously associated with its chemical structures highly conjugated polyaromatic compounds with a high molecular weight and with six benzene rings mojiri et al 2019 on the other hand a higher benzo a pyrene reduction 80 was achieved through permanganate treatment brown et al 2003 have previously concluded that the high reactivity of benzo a pyrene could be explained through the clar structural model brown et al 2003 more specifically they have associated the number of carbon carbon double bonds the number of stabilizing sextets and the shared carbon carbon double bonds with the permanganate reactivity results of jar tests after kmno4 naclo and fecl3 addition and sedimentation sample 4 according to fig 2 are presented in fig 4 below the effectiveness of naclo an economically available oxidizing agent widely used for disinfection of potable water and of fecl3 a coagulation reagent on the removal of pahs is discussed the results showed that the removal rate of pyrene benzo a anthracene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene and dibenzo a h anthracene was higher than 90 the most effective removal during naclo and fecl3 treatment was detected for pyrene dibenzo a h anthracene benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene which increased by more than 30 compared with water treated only with permanganate the lowest removal efficiency close to 55 was reported for fluorene anthracene phenanthrene and flouranthene the most relevant positive effect of the treatment was reported for benzo a pyrene with an almost complete removal with the purpose of comparing the behaviour of selected pahs log k ow pi ratio versus the total percentage of pah removed has been presented in fig 5 octanol water partition coefficient k ow used as indicator of sorption capacity represents the ratio of concentration of a compound between octanol and water phases substances with high log k ow values are more difficult to solubilize and tend to be adsorbed more readily to solid particles for water treatment processes the sorption entails the separation of pahs through sedimentation of solid particles regarding ionization potential as aforementioned as values of ionization potential decreases the ability to donate an electron increases and subsequently the degradation of pahs would increase as can be observed the lower degradation percentages were found for compounds with the lowest values of log k ow pi fl phe ant flu a positive linear correlation between log k ow pi and the percentage of pah r 2 0 8 was observed fig 5 from these results it could be concluded that the evaluation of log k ow pi ratio for each pah represents a useful tool to predict approximatively their removal percentage based on sorption capacity k ow and energy required to remove an electron pi according to the eu regulations the limit value of the sum of four selected pahs bbf bkf bghip icdp for drinking water is 0 1 μg l 1 european union 5ad with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment the total concentration of the aforementioned pahs has been evaluated after each treatment step fig 6 initial concentration of spiked samples was about four times higher than the standard value after permanganate treatment the pah concentration was reduced by 40 as previously discussed organic compounds decrease can be explained by its oxidation with kmno4 the sorption of pahs onto mno2 and fe oh 3 precipitated as a result of the oxidation reaction of fe ii contained in raw water with kmno4 could also contribute to the reduction of pahs level in water ersoz and barrott 2012 regarding final samples the total concentration decreased by 85 of its initial value these results showed the important role of the combined effect of naclo and fecl3 acting as oxidizing and coagulant reagents respectively on the degradation of pahs as can be observed the total concentration of pah in drinking water after treatment is below the limit value established by eu which shows an effective pollutant removal through the conventional treatment evaluated on this matter the plant has also available two deposits of activated carbon with a surface area of 1000 m2 g 1 to reduce organic contaminants by adsorption should it be required 4 conclusions the conventional treatment processes performed in a pwtp has been proved effective in the removal of pahs from drinking water experimental results suggested that the water treatment with kmno4 allows the oxidation of persistent organic pollutants such as pahs significant differences between rate reduction for each organic pollutant were detected which was related to the chemical structure of the pah a parameter based on pahs properties was defined to evaluate the role of the conventional treatment in the removal of the selected organic contaminants from these results it was established a useful methodology to predict the removal percentage of these recalcitrant organic compounds based on its chemical properties under the experimental conditions proposed the plant complies with the legal limits of drinking water quality reducing the pah concentration bbf bkf bghip

chemical structure which directly influences on the mechanism reactions although several mechanisms and pathways has been reported to explain the pah oxidation the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction has been proved to be the most relevant for these compounds forsey et al 2010 for this pathway the ionization potential i e the ability to donate electrons could be used as a tool to approximate the energy involved in the pah oxidation as the ability to donate an electron decreases the rate of the reaction also decreases therefore the higher values of ionization potential for fluorene 7 93 ev phenanthrene 7 91 ev and fluoranthene 7 80 ev dewar et al 1970 could explain their lower removal compared with the rest of pahs the recalcitrant behaviour experimentally observed for benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene has been previously associated with its chemical structures highly conjugated polyaromatic compounds with a high molecular weight and with six benzene rings mojiri et al 2019 on the other hand a higher benzo a pyrene reduction 80 was achieved through permanganate treatment brown et al 2003 have previously concluded that the high reactivity of benzo a pyrene could be explained through the clar structural model brown et al 2003 more specifically they have associated the number of carbon carbon double bonds the number of stabilizing sextets and the shared carbon carbon double bonds with the permanganate reactivity results of jar tests after kmno4 naclo and fecl3 addition and sedimentation sample 4 according to fig 2 are presented in fig 4 below the effectiveness of naclo an economically available oxidizing agent widely used for disinfection of potable water and of fecl3 a coagulation reagent on the removal of pahs is discussed the results showed that the removal rate of pyrene benzo a anthracene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene and dibenzo a h anthracene was higher than 90 the most effective removal during naclo and fecl3 treatment was detected for pyrene dibenzo a h anthracene benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene which increased by more than 30 compared with water treated only with permanganate the lowest removal efficiency close to 55 was reported for fluorene anthracene phenanthrene and flouranthene the most relevant positive effect of the treatment was reported for benzo a pyrene with an almost complete removal with the purpose of comparing the behaviour of selected pahs log k ow pi ratio versus the total percentage of pah removed has been presented in fig 5 octanol water partition coefficient k ow used as indicator of sorption capacity represents the ratio of concentration of a compound between octanol and water phases substances with high log k ow values are more difficult to solubilize and tend to be adsorbed more readily to solid particles for water treatment processes the sorption entails the separation of pahs through sedimentation of solid particles regarding ionization potential as aforementioned as values of ionization potential decreases the ability to donate an electron increases and subsequently the degradation of pahs would increase as can be observed the lower degradation percentages were found for compounds with the lowest values of log k ow pi fl phe ant flu a positive linear correlation between log k ow pi and the percentage of pah r 2 0 8 was observed fig 5 from these results it could be concluded that the evaluation of log k ow pi ratio for each pah represents a useful tool to predict approximatively their removal percentage based on sorption capacity k ow and energy required to remove an electron pi according to the eu regulations the limit value of the sum of four selected pahs bbf bkf bghip icdp for drinking water is 0 1 μg l 1 european union 5ad with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment the total concentration of the aforementioned pahs has been evaluated after each treatment step fig 6 initial concentration of spiked samples was about four times higher than the standard value after permanganate treatment the pah concentration was reduced by 40 as previously discussed organic compounds decrease can be explained by its oxidation with kmno4 the sorption of pahs onto mno2 and fe oh 3 precipitated as a result of the oxidation reaction of fe ii contained in raw water with kmno4 could also contribute to the reduction of pahs level in water ersoz and barrott 2012 regarding final samples the total concentration decreased by 85 of its initial value these results showed the important role of the combined effect of naclo and fecl3 acting as oxidizing and coagulant reagents respectively on the degradation of pahs as can be observed the total concentration of pah in drinking water after treatment is below the limit value established by eu which shows an effective pollutant removal through the conventional treatment evaluated on this matter the plant has also available two deposits of activated carbon with a surface area of 1000 m2 g 1 to reduce organic contaminants by adsorption should it be required 4 conclusions the conventional treatment processes performed in a pwtp has been proved effective in the removal of pahs from drinking water experimental results suggested that the water treatment with kmno4 allows the oxidation of persistent organic pollutants such as pahs significant differences between rate reduction for each organic pollutant were detected which was related to the chemical structure of the pah a parameter based on pahs properties was defined to evaluate the role of the conventional treatment in the removal of the selected organic contaminants from these results it was established a useful methodology to predict the removal percentage of these recalcitrant organic compounds based on its chemical properties under the experimental conditions proposed the plant complies with the legal limits of drinking water quality reducing the pah concentration bbf bkf bghip
