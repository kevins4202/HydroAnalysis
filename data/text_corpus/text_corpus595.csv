2975,identification of groundwater contaminant sources gcss relies on actual observed data and the observed data directly affects the accuracy of the identification results however the observed data inevitably contains noise due to accidental and systematic errors and the identification results of gcss based on the observed data containing noise are usually not reliable this seriously restricts the rational design of contamination remediation plans and contamination risk assessment to solve this problem complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd was applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information in this study for the first time the wavelet analysis and ceemd methods were used to reduce the noise in observed concentrations respectively and the noise reduction effect of the two methods was compared and analyzed then the simulated concentrations observed concentrations and noise reduced observed concentrations with the best noise reduction effect were then applied to identify simulation model parameters and gcss information respectively after which the corresponding identification results were compared and analyzed the results showed that ceemd could reduce the noise contained in the observed concentrations more effectively and make it closer to the actual values when compared with the wavelet analysis method the accuracy of identification results based on the noise reduced observed concentrations by was improved as the noise contained in the observed concentrations increased the noise reduction effect of the ceemd decreased nevertheless the accuracy of the identification results based on the noise reduced observed concentrations was still higher than that of those based on the observed concentrations with the same intensity noise without denoising keywords ceemd groundwater contamination gcss identification noise reduction s o data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction because groundwater contamination is below the surface it is concealed and there is often a lag in discovery as a result there are often misunderstanding regarding gcss information including the number location and release history of gcss in aquifers this has led to great difficulties in the rational design of contamination remediation plans and contamination risk assessment snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 lapworth et al 2012 accordingly research on the identification of gcss is extremely important for more than 40 years people have been attempting to identify gcss information based on observed data which has led to the development of many approaches for the identification of gcss these include direct approaches analytical solution and regression approaches probabilistic and geostatistical simulation approaches and simulation optimization s o approaches atmadja bagtzoglou 2001 michalak kitanidis 2004 yeh 2015 gorelick et al 1983 used linear programming and multiple regression analysis to identify the location and release intensity of gcss this study considered the influence of observed errors on the identification results of gcss wagner 1992 applied the maximum likelihood model to realize the simultaneous identification of gcss characteristics and simulation model parameters they pointed out that water head and contaminant concentrations had an important impact on parameters and gcss identification and advocated a reasonable design of monitoring well network layout to improve observed data quality however no advice was given on how to reduce errors in the observed data skaggs and kabala 1994 used tikhonov regularization tr to recover the release and evolution histories of a plume in one dimensional homogeneous system this study found that identification accuracy is affected by the presence of plume measurement errors even so reducing errors in measurement data has not attracted attention woodbury and ulrych 1996 used minimum relative entropy to identify the release history of gcss and predict changes of the contamination plume this study not only considered the influence of errors in observed data on the identification of gcss but applied the fourier transform and butterworth filter methods to remove the errors in observed data to improve the quality identification results however fourier transform generally suitable for limited and stable periodic signals and butterworth filters usually face the problem of signal distortion in application li 2005 li 2007 neupauer and wilson 1999 applied the adjoint equation to identify the release history of gcss in one dimensional problems chaubey and srivastava 2020 used a feedforward artificial neural network to simultaneously identify the location and release history of gcss however the two studies did not consider the impact of the observation errors on the identification results michalak and kitanidis 2003 combined bayesian theory and geostatistical techniques to identify the release history of gcss dokou and pinder 2009 used the conventional kalman filter to identify the location of gcss zeng et al 2012 used an efficient bayesian method based on adaptive sparse grid interpolation to identify the characteristics of gcss based on optimization of monitoring well patterns zhang et al 2015 applied a bayesian method based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc to gcss identification chen et al 2018 used restart ensemble kalman filter to distinguish gcss information and found when the observation error is large the identification results became worsen considerably the article also affirmed the influence of the error on the identification results mo et al 2019 applied the ensemble smoother and deep convolutional neural network to identification of the conductivity fields as well as the location and release intensity of gcss although more and more new methods had been proposed to identify gcss and most researchers had considered the observation error effect on the identification results few researchers had improved the quality of observed data by removing errors to improve the accuracy of identification results later zhao et al 2019 li et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 applied the wavelet analysis method to denoise the observed data and applied the denoised data to the identification of gcss which improved the accuracy of the identification results however when applying the wavelet analysis method to denoise the denoising effect will be unsatisfactory if the threshold function and threshold selection are unreasonable wang et al 2021 therefore it is still necessary to explore effective noise reduction methods for the identification of gcss the approaches outlined above all rely on observed data and the quality of estimated gcss characteristics is limited by the information contained concentration data to collect more effective observed data the optimal layout of monitoring well is also applied to the identification of gcss moghaddam et al 2021 however accidental and systematic errors result in observed data inevitably containing noise error which will directly affect the accuracy of gcss identification results only considering how to obtain effective data and ignoring the noise in the data is not conducive to the reliable identification of gcss indeed the presence of even very small amounts of measurement noise in observed data can lead to great variations in identification results of gcss information skaggs kabala 1994 singh et al 2004 accordingly noise often leads to obtaining unreliable identification results which influences the rational design of contamination remediation plans and contamination risk assessments therefore it is necessary to reduce the noise present in observed data as much as possible before identifying gcss percival walden 2000 to reduce noise contained in observed data and improve the accuracy of gcss identifications we applied the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the ceemd was applied to the identification of gcss ceemd was used to denoise observed concentrations containing different intensities of noise and the noise reduction effect of ceemd was analyzed at the same time to analyze the quality of the ceemd noise reduction effect the noise reduction results of ceemd and the previously applied wavelet analysis were compared the simulated concentrations observed concentrations simulated concentrations mixed with noise and noise reduced observed concentrations with the best noise reduction effect were then applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information finally the identification simulation model parameters and gcss information obtained under different scenarios were compared the influence of noise contained in the observed concentrations on the identification results and the applicability of ceemd to simulation model parameters and gcss identification were then analyzed and discussed 2 methodology and applications this study aims to solve the problem of hydraulic conductivity and gcss identification through the comprehensive application of s o kriging and ceemd methods the flow chart is shown in fig 1 2 1 case overview the study area which was a modified version of the area used by xing et al 2019 was a confined aquifer with irregular boundaries fig 2 shows the plan view of the case there were two gcss and seven observation wells the total simulation time was 120 months which was divided into 60 equal simulation periods each simulation period had a duration of 2 months the gcss were assumed to release contaminant during the first four simulation periods which means the first four simulation periods were release periods the aquifer had five different hydraulic conductivity zones and the hydraulic conductivity value of each zone was unknown this means that there are thirteen unknown variables to be identified eight release intensities for two sources four release periods and five hydraulic conductivities for five zones the aquifer had specified head boundary conditions on the ab side and cd side with no flow on other sides the head values of the ab and cd side were 100 0 m and 80 0 m respectively table 1 lists the actual values of hydraulic conductivity table 2 lists the actual values of the gcss flux and table 3 lists basic parameters of the aquifer 2 2 numerical simulation model establishment of a numerical simulation model is a key point in the identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the governing partial differential equations for groundwater flow and contaminant transport in the two dimensional aquifer system are described below singh and datta 2006 the governing partial differential equation for the groundwater flow is as follows 1 x i k ij h x j q s s h t i j 1 2 t 0 where k ij is the hydraulic conductivity h is the hydraulic head q is the volumetric flux per unit volume and s s is the storativity the governing partial differential equation for the contaminant transport is as follows 2 c t x i d ij c x j x i u i c f i j 1 2 t 0 3 u i k ij θ h x i i j 1 2 where θ is the effective porosity c is the concentrations d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor u i is the average linear velocity and f is the source or sink term the modflow and mt3dms codes in the gms software were used to solve the groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical simulation model 2 3 obtained observed concentrations the hypothetical case had no actual observed data therefore actual data for the gcss were input into the simulation model and the simulation model was run to obtain the simulated concentrations of all observation wells in each simulation period the simulation period can be regarded as the observation period when obtaining simulated concentrations according to the parameters given above the contaminant transport process can be achieved by running a simulation model fig 3 shows the distribution of the contamination plume on day 240 day 1800 and day 3600 fig 4 is the simulated concentrations curve in the actual gcss identification the actual observed concentrations inevitably contain noise to imitate this situation noise was mixed into the simulated concentrations and the simulated concentrations with noise were called the observed concentrations to analyze the applicability of ceemd during identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information five scenarios were considered namely simulated concentrations observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 and noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 the simulated concentrations containing noise were regarded as the observed concentrations the concentrations of these five scenarios were applied to identify the simulation model parameters and gcss information respectively the simulated concentrations were added noise to obtain observed concentrations mahar and datta 1997 2000 and the observed concentrations were calculated as follows mahar and datta 2001 4 c c sim ε α c sim where c is the observed concentrations c sim is the simulated concentrations ε is the white noise coefficient of the added noise which obeys a normal distribution and has a variance of 1 and a mean of 0 in this study and α is the noise intensity which has a usual variation range of 0 0 2 when α 0 1 the noise intensity is weak when 0 1 α 0 15 the noise intensity is moderate when α 0 15 the noise intensity is strong singh datta 2006 zhao et al 2019 in this study the noise intensity was set to 0 05 and 0 15 the white noise coefficient is shown in fig 5 in addition the observed concentrations can also be obtained by adding random noise to the simulated concentrations 2 4 denoising observed data 2 4 1 noise reduction effect evaluation index after obtaining observed concentrations with noise intensities of 0 05 and 0 15 ceemd and wavelet analysis method were used to reduce the noise of the observed concentrations after which the noise reduction effect was evaluated and compared in this study the signal to noise ratio snr and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the noise reduction effect of ceemd and wavelet analysis method the snr which refers to the ratio of the power of the signal to be denoised to the power of the noise was calculated as follows 5 p s 1 n i 1 n f 2 x i 6 p n 1 n i 1 n f x i f x i 2 7 snr 10 lg p s p n where n is the length of the signal to be denoised f x i is the i t h value of the signal to be denoised f x i is the i t h value of the noise reduced signal p s is the power of the signal to be denoised and p n is the power of the noise a larger snr indicates a better noise reduction effect the rmse was calculated as follows 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n f x i f x i 2 a smaller rmse indicates a better noise reduction effect 2 4 2 complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd is a noise reduction method based on empirical mode decomposition emd the ceemd can not only denoise data with gaussian noise but also denoise data with random noise emd is a new adaptive time frequency signal processing approach that has been widely used in communication machinery fault diagnosis atmospheric data analysis biomedical signal analysis and geophysical detections huang et al 1998 veltcheva and soares 2004 huang 2005 the basic principle of emd is to decompose the signal to be denoised into many intrinsic mode function imf components and a residual component then some imf components and residual component are reconstructed to obtain the noise reduction data for more details about imf components please refer to the article by huang et al 1998 however emd has the disadvantage of modal confusion which is when imf components obtained by emd decomposition contain characteristics from different time scales specifically signals from the same scale or frequency exist in multiple imf components deering kaiser 2005 daubechies et al 2009 ceemd effectively improves the modal confusion that occurs when emd is used yeh et al 2010 li wang 2017 the difference between ceemd and emd is that for ceemd two completely opposite white noise signals are added to the signal to be denoised as follows 9 imf i t 1 2 n i 1 2 n c ij t 10 x 2 j t x t z j t j 1 2 3 n where z j t is the white noise signal conforming to the normal distribution x t is the signal to be denoised x j t is the signal with white noise added and x 2 j t is the signal with the opposite white noise added then decompose each signal with white noise added in turn take the decomposition of x j t as an example identify all the maximum value points of the x j t then use the cubic spline function to connect these points in sequence to obtain the maximum value envelope e max t next all the minimum points of the x j t are identified and used to obtain the minimum envelope e min t following the same method that was used for the maximum envelope the mean of the maximum envelope and the minimum envelope are then calculated as the mean envelope e mean t 11 e mean t e max t e min t 2 by subtracting the mean envelope e mean t from x j t a new signal h 1 1 t is obtained the schematic diagram of data decomposition is shown in fig 6 12 h 1 1 t x j t e mean t in general a stable signal cannot be obtained using only one such calculation therefore the above steps are repeated for the h 1 1 t if the condition of the imf component is satisfied after m operations the first imf of x j t is obtained 13 c 1 t imf 1 t h 1 m t by subtracting the first imf component from x j t a new signal r 1 t with some high frequency signals removed can be obtained 14 r 1 t x j t c 1 t r 1 t is then used as the new signal to be processed and step a is carried out to obtain the second imf component of x j t the above steps are repeated until the obtained n t h imf component or its residual component r n t meets the termination condition at which point the decomposition process of x j t is terminated x j t after decomposition can be expressed as follows 15 x j t i 1 n c i t r n t where r n t is the trend item of the signal to be processed and represents the average trend of x j t x j t is decomposed into n imf components and a residual component based on the decomposition it should be emphasized that the frequency from high to low does not mean that c n 1 t is higher than c n t on the entire signal trend line but refers to the higher frequency of c n 1 t than c n t in a local area of the signal trend line decomposition is performed on all white noise added signals x j t and x 2 j t in turn after which the mean value of the same order imf components of all white noise added signals is calculated and used as the final decomposition result of the signal to be denoised 16 imf i t 1 2 n i 1 2 n c ij t 17 r n t 1 2 n i 1 2 n r n i t based on the imf components and the residual component a noise reduced signal is obtained by reconstructing a part of the imf components or a part of the imf components and the residual component the noise reduction process using the ceemd is shown in fig 7 maximize the objective function of the following formula as a criterion for reconstructing concentrations 18 max α rmse 1 α r x

the i t h value of the noise reduced signal x t mean is the mean value of the signal to be denoised x t mean is the mean value of the denoised signal 2 4 3 wavelet analysis method the basic principle of wavelet analysis is to decompose the data into a series of the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients based on a wavelet mother function and then perform threshold processing on the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients to achieve the purpose of suppressing noise finally the processed approximation coefficients and detail coefficients are reconstructed by wavelet inverse transform to obtain denoised data mallat 1989 jawerth sweldens 1994 if φ t is defined as the wavelet mother function then a series of wavelet basis functions can be obtained for φ t after dilation and translation 19 φ a b t 1 a φ t b a a b r a 0 where φ a b t is a wavelet basis function a and b are the dilation and translation factor respectively for any f t l 2 r where l 2 r represents the square integrable in the real number space the continuous wavelet transform can be obtained by decomposing the signal based on equation 9 20 w f a b f φ a b t 1 a f t φ t b a d t the wavelet inverse transform is defined as the following 21 f t 1 c φ 1 a 2 w f a b φ a b t d a d b for more detailed mathematical principles of the wavelet analysis method please refer to the article by daubechies and heil 1992 and mallat 2010 based on the above mathematical principles the noise reduction process by the wavelet analysis method includes the following steps the schematic diagram of wavelet three layer decomposition is shown in fig 8 the noise reduction of observed concentrations is realized by wavedec wdcbm and wdencmp functions in matlab 1 decompose noisy data select the wavelet decomposition function determine the number of wavelet decomposition layers and perform n layer wavelet decomposition on the signal in general the number of decomposition layers should be less than log 2 n after comparing and decomposing the noise reduction effects of layers three four and five this study selects the three layers decomposition with the best noise reduction effect in addition the daubechies 1 db1 and symlets 4 sym4 wavelets were selected to compare the effects of different wavelet functions on noise reduction 2 threshold processing select a threshold function hard threshold function is selected to perform threshold processing on the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients to suppress the noise in the high frequency signal 3 reconstruction process wavelet inverse transform is performed on the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients to obtain denoised data 2 5 surrogate model it is necessary to call the numerical simulation model tens of thousands of times during the iterative calculation process of identifying the information of gcss which creates a huge computational load and wastes a lot of time thus the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model with high precision for the simulation model to solve this problem a detailed introduction of the kriging method can be found in zhao et al 2016 and guo et al 2018 the process for establishment of the surrogate model used in the present study was as follows 1 determine the unknown variables variables to be identified the unknown variables were the hydraulic conductivity of five zones and the release intensity of two gcss eight release intensities for two sources four release periods and five hydraulic conductivities for five zones after determining the unknown variables latin hypercube sampling was performed within its value range a total of 360 groups were sampled the detailed principle of latin hypercube sampling can be found in mckay and conover 1979 helton and davis 2003 and hossain et al 2006 2 input all unknown variables into the simulation model in turn then run the simulation model to obtain the simulated contaminant concentrations for all observation wells in each observation period 3 five sixths of the input and output unknown variables simulated contaminant concentrations data were used to train samples for the surrogate model and one sixth of input and output data were used as test samples for the surrogate model the kriging method was used to write the training code the kriging surrogate models were trained and tested using the training and test samples the accuracy of the surrogate models was tested based on three evaluative coefficients the certainty coefficient r2 root mean square error rmsr absolute relative error are and mean relative error mre the calculation formulae for the three coefficients were as follows 22 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 23 rmsr i 1 n y i y i 2 n 24 are y i y i y i 100 25 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 in eqs 22 25 y i and y i are the simulated contaminant concentrations of the ith sample obtained from the contaminant transport simulation model and the surrogate model respectively and y i is the average of the simulated contaminant concentrations for n samples obtained from the contaminant transport simulation model smaller values for the mre and rmsr as well as values of r 2 closer to 1 indicate that the surrogate model is more accurate when mre evaluating the accuracy of identification results y i and y i are the actual value and identification value respectively 2 6 optimization model on basis of the above study s o method was used to identify hydraulic conductivity and release intensity of the gcss the s o has been widely applied to identify gcss information in recent years datta et al 2009 bashi azghadi and kerachian 2010 ayvaz 2016 jiang et al 2021 the main steps in application of this method are as follows 1 establish the groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical simulation model of the groundwater system based on specific conditions of the study area and obtain the observed concentrations from the sample wells 2 for optimization of the gcss identification determine the objective function of the optimization problem the least square sum of simulated concentrations and observed concentrations is often defined as the objective function decision variables variables to be solved including gcss information and constraints gcss information and contaminant transport rules etc an optimization model based on the above conditions is then established 3 realize coupling of the contaminant transport numerical simulation model and the optimization model 4 use optimization algorithms to solve the optimization model and identify the gcss information the general form of the optimization model applied to gcss identification is as follows 26 min g x δ min δ i x δ max i 1 2 n β j x 0 j 1 2 m where min g x is the objective function x x 1 x 2 x 3 x e are the decision variables of the optimization model e is the total number of decision variables δ i x is the inequality constraint δ min and δ max are the upper and lower bound of the inequality constraint respectively n is the total number of inequality constraints β j x is the equality constraint and m is the total number of equality constraints according to the specific goal of this study the general form of the optimization model is rewritten to make it suitable for the identification of hydraulic conductivity and release intensity of the gcss the least square sum of simulated concentrations and observed concentrations during each observation period divided by 100 was defined as the objective function the hydraulic conductivity and release intensity of the gcss were decision variables the contaminant transport simulation model replace with the surrogate model was embedded in the optimization model as an equality constraint to ensure that the contaminant transport law for a groundwater system was satisfied during the optimization process the feasible domains for the decision variables constituted the inequality constraints the objective function and constraints constituted the optimization model equation 23 is the optimization model 27 min z k m q sn t 1 60 k 1 7 c k t t c k t 0 2 100 k min k m k max m 1 2 5 q min q sn q max s 1 2 n 1 2 3 4 c k t t f k m q sn where k m is the hydraulic conductivity m represents the m th hydraulic conductivity q sn is the release intensity of the gcss s represents the s th gcss n represents the n th release intensity of the gcss c k t t is the simulated concentrations and c k t 0 is the observed concentrations 3 results 3 1 evaluation of noise reduction ceemd wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis were used to denoise the observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 and 0 15 the imf components and residual components obtained by the ceemd decomposition are shown in fig 9 using observation well 4 as an example according to the reconstruction principle in section 2 4 2 when the second to sixth imf components and the residual component was reconstructed the objective function value was the largest 0 05 noise intensity is 0 717 and 0 15 noise intensity is 0 697 thus the second to sixth imf components and the residual component were superimposed to constitute the noise reduced observed concentrations the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients obtained by the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively after the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients are processed by thresholding the denoised concentrations is obtained by wavelet inverse transform the concentrations comparison before and after noise reduction obtained were shown in figs 12 and 13 the mean absolute error mae and the mre were used to compare and analyze the closeness of the observed concentrations with different noise intensities and the noise reduced observed concentrations to the simulated concentrations as shown in table 4 greater noise was associated with a greater mae and a greater mre of the observed and simulated concentrations wavelet db1 analysis failed to reduce the noise in the observed concentrations compared with the wavelet sym4 analysis and ceemd and the difference between the noise reduced observed concentrations and simulated concentrations became larger this situation also occured when wavelet sym4 analysis was applied to denoise the concentrations with noise intensity of 0 05 the reason for those may be that the effective information in the concentrations were sharply reduced as noise when ceemd was applied to the observed concentrations the mae and mre of the noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 and the simulated concentrations were reduced by 4 33 and 1 4 respectively the mae and mre of the noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 and the simulated concentrations were reduced by 14 18 and 4 78 respectively which were reduced by 1 62 and 0 3 more than the wavelet sym4 analysis the snr and the rmse were then used to evaluate the noise reduction effect of ceemd wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis fig 14 shows a comparison of the rmse and snr of the observed concentrations before and after noise reduction as shown in fig 14 the rmse and snr were16 06 and 27 63 respectively when ceemd was applied to denoise the observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 the rmse is 61 35 and 23 26 lower than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively the snr is 13 66 and 7 78 higher than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively when ceemd was applied to denoise the observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 the rmse and snr were 45 04 and 18 81 respectively the rmse is 40 25 and 20 02 lower than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively the snr is 5 55 and 3 19 higher than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively the above analysis results show that the ceemd has the obvious and better noise reduction effect than wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods therefore the observed concentrations after noise reduction by the ceemd method was applied to the identification of hydraulic conductivity and gcss information in addition it can be seen from the noise reduction results that as the noise contained in the observed concentrations increases the noise reduction effect becomes worse which indicates that the noise reduction effect can be limited by the intensity of noise therefore it is necessary to minimize the generation of noise when obtaining the observed concentrations 3 2 accuracy analysis of surrogate models the weight of each parameter of the surrogate model is shown in table 5 the r2 rmse and mre were used to evaluate the accuracy of the surrogate model the degree of the output fitting of the surrogate and simulation models and the absolute relative error box plot are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively the dots in fig 16 represent the are for each test data the three evaluation parameters of the surrogate model are shown in table 6 as shown in fig 15 fig 16 and table 6 the r2 was higher than 0 99 rmse was higher than 13 99 and mre was higher than 2 07 indicating that the surrogate model had good approximation accuracy to the simulation model and could replace the simulation model for calculations as can be seen from fig 16 for observation wells 1 3 4 5 6 and 7 are of outliers were all within 4 which showed that the accuracy of the surrogate model to the simulation model was very high observation well 2 contained some outliers that deviated from the output of the simulation model slightly this may have occurred because well 2 located in a parameter zone with a small hydraulic conductivity and was close to the gcss resulting in a more complex relationship between input and output parameters in this study the genetic algorithm ga was applied to solve the optimization model the detailed principles of the ga can be found in davis 1991 and whitley 1994 when solving the optimization model a computer equipped with an intel i5 3 2 ghz processor and 8g ram was used for numerical calculation when solving the optimization model using this system it will take about 3322 21 h to call the simulation model for 260 000 iterative calculations while it took about 47 81 min using the kriging surrogate model which is a savings of more than 99 of the calculation time 3 3 comparative analysis of identification results the observed concentrations with the best noise reduction effect which based on the ceemd was applied to the identification of hydraulic conductivity and gcss to analyze the applicability of the ceemd five scenarios were considered simulated concentrations observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 and noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 each of these scenarios was applied to the identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the identification results of simulation model parameters and gcss information and convergence curves corresponding to the five scenarios described above are shown in fig 17 the relative error and mean relative error of the identification results are shown in fig 18 as shown in figs 17 and 18 when the simulated concentrations were used to identify the simulation model parameters and the gcss information the objective function error was smallest and the identification accuracy was highest when the observed with noise values were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the degree of deviation of the identification result from the actual value became obviously larger moreover as the mixed noise increased the degree of deviation gradually became larger for observed concentrations with the same intensity of noise when the noise reduced observed concentrations with noise generated by ceemd were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the accuracy of the identification results was significantly higher than that obtained using the observed concentrations with noise before values were denoised as the noise in the observed concentrations increased the noise reduction effect of ceemd decreased when noise reduced observed concentrations with noise intensities of 0 05 and 0 15 were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the identification effect corresponding to the noise reduced observed concentrations with noise intensity of 0 05 was better the mean relative errors of the identification results in the five scenarios were 2 7 27 77 12 06 44 76 and 20 85 respectively for the observed concentrations with noise intensities of 0 05 and 0 15 after applying ceemd to reduce their noise and then applying them to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the accuracy of the identification results obtained was increased by 15 71 and 23 91 respectively this shows that application of ceemd made an important contribution to improving the identification accuracy of the simulation model parameters and the gcss information 4 conclusion and discussion noise was shown to have a significant impact on the identification results of simulation model parameters and gcss information moreover greater the noise contained in observed concentrations were associated with greater deviations of the identification results of simulation model parameter results and gcss information from the actual values comparing with wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods ceemd has the best noise reduction effect and is more suitable for noise reduction processing of observed concentrations specifically ceemd was found to reduce the noise contained in observed concentrations and to cause observed concentrations to be closer to the actual values applying the noise reduced observed concentrations to identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information improved the accuracy of the identification results as the noise contained in the observed concentrations increased the noise reduction effect of the ceemd became worse nevertheless for observed concentrations with the same intensity noise the accuracy of the identification results based on the noise reduced observed concentrations was still higher than that based on the observed concentrations without noise reduction when noise reduced observed concentrations with large noise were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the accuracy of the identification results was higher relative to when noise reduced observed concentrations with small noise were applied therefore it is very important to avoid generation of noise as much as possible

2975,identification of groundwater contaminant sources gcss relies on actual observed data and the observed data directly affects the accuracy of the identification results however the observed data inevitably contains noise due to accidental and systematic errors and the identification results of gcss based on the observed data containing noise are usually not reliable this seriously restricts the rational design of contamination remediation plans and contamination risk assessment to solve this problem complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd was applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information in this study for the first time the wavelet analysis and ceemd methods were used to reduce the noise in observed concentrations respectively and the noise reduction effect of the two methods was compared and analyzed then the simulated concentrations observed concentrations and noise reduced observed concentrations with the best noise reduction effect were then applied to identify simulation model parameters and gcss information respectively after which the corresponding identification results were compared and analyzed the results showed that ceemd could reduce the noise contained in the observed concentrations more effectively and make it closer to the actual values when compared with the wavelet analysis method the accuracy of identification results based on the noise reduced observed concentrations by was improved as the noise contained in the observed concentrations increased the noise reduction effect of the ceemd decreased nevertheless the accuracy of the identification results based on the noise reduced observed concentrations was still higher than that of those based on the observed concentrations with the same intensity noise without denoising keywords ceemd groundwater contamination gcss identification noise reduction s o data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction because groundwater contamination is below the surface it is concealed and there is often a lag in discovery as a result there are often misunderstanding regarding gcss information including the number location and release history of gcss in aquifers this has led to great difficulties in the rational design of contamination remediation plans and contamination risk assessment snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 lapworth et al 2012 accordingly research on the identification of gcss is extremely important for more than 40 years people have been attempting to identify gcss information based on observed data which has led to the development of many approaches for the identification of gcss these include direct approaches analytical solution and regression approaches probabilistic and geostatistical simulation approaches and simulation optimization s o approaches atmadja bagtzoglou 2001 michalak kitanidis 2004 yeh 2015 gorelick et al 1983 used linear programming and multiple regression analysis to identify the location and release intensity of gcss this study considered the influence of observed errors on the identification results of gcss wagner 1992 applied the maximum likelihood model to realize the simultaneous identification of gcss characteristics and simulation model parameters they pointed out that water head and contaminant concentrations had an important impact on parameters and gcss identification and advocated a reasonable design of monitoring well network layout to improve observed data quality however no advice was given on how to reduce errors in the observed data skaggs and kabala 1994 used tikhonov regularization tr to recover the release and evolution histories of a plume in one dimensional homogeneous system this study found that identification accuracy is affected by the presence of plume measurement errors even so reducing errors in measurement data has not attracted attention woodbury and ulrych 1996 used minimum relative entropy to identify the release history of gcss and predict changes of the contamination plume this study not only considered the influence of errors in observed data on the identification of gcss but applied the fourier transform and butterworth filter methods to remove the errors in observed data to improve the quality identification results however fourier transform generally suitable for limited and stable periodic signals and butterworth filters usually face the problem of signal distortion in application li 2005 li 2007 neupauer and wilson 1999 applied the adjoint equation to identify the release history of gcss in one dimensional problems chaubey and srivastava 2020 used a feedforward artificial neural network to simultaneously identify the location and release history of gcss however the two studies did not consider the impact of the observation errors on the identification results michalak and kitanidis 2003 combined bayesian theory and geostatistical techniques to identify the release history of gcss dokou and pinder 2009 used the conventional kalman filter to identify the location of gcss zeng et al 2012 used an efficient bayesian method based on adaptive sparse grid interpolation to identify the characteristics of gcss based on optimization of monitoring well patterns zhang et al 2015 applied a bayesian method based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc to gcss identification chen et al 2018 used restart ensemble kalman filter to distinguish gcss information and found when the observation error is large the identification results became worsen considerably the article also affirmed the influence of the error on the identification results mo et al 2019 applied the ensemble smoother and deep convolutional neural network to identification of the conductivity fields as well as the location and release intensity of gcss although more and more new methods had been proposed to identify gcss and most researchers had considered the observation error effect on the identification results few researchers had improved the quality of observed data by removing errors to improve the accuracy of identification results later zhao et al 2019 li et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 applied the wavelet analysis method to denoise the observed data and applied the denoised data to the identification of gcss which improved the accuracy of the identification results however when applying the wavelet analysis method to denoise the denoising effect will be unsatisfactory if the threshold function and threshold selection are unreasonable wang et al 2021 therefore it is still necessary to explore effective noise reduction methods for the identification of gcss the approaches outlined above all rely on observed data and the quality of estimated gcss characteristics is limited by the information contained concentration data to collect more effective observed data the optimal layout of monitoring well is also applied to the identification of gcss moghaddam et al 2021 however accidental and systematic errors result in observed data inevitably containing noise error which will directly affect the accuracy of gcss identification results only considering how to obtain effective data and ignoring the noise in the data is not conducive to the reliable identification of gcss indeed the presence of even very small amounts of measurement noise in observed data can lead to great variations in identification results of gcss information skaggs kabala 1994 singh et al 2004 accordingly noise often leads to obtaining unreliable identification results which influences the rational design of contamination remediation plans and contamination risk assessments therefore it is necessary to reduce the noise present in observed data as much as possible before identifying gcss percival walden 2000 to reduce noise contained in observed data and improve the accuracy of gcss identifications we applied the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the ceemd was applied to the identification of gcss ceemd was used to denoise observed concentrations containing different intensities of noise and the noise reduction effect of ceemd was analyzed at the same time to analyze the quality of the ceemd noise reduction effect the noise reduction results of ceemd and the previously applied wavelet analysis were compared the simulated concentrations observed concentrations simulated concentrations mixed with noise and noise reduced observed concentrations with the best noise reduction effect were then applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information finally the identification simulation model parameters and gcss information obtained under different scenarios were compared the influence of noise contained in the observed concentrations on the identification results and the applicability of ceemd to simulation model parameters and gcss identification were then analyzed and discussed 2 methodology and applications this study aims to solve the problem of hydraulic conductivity and gcss identification through the comprehensive application of s o kriging and ceemd methods the flow chart is shown in fig 1 2 1 case overview the study area which was a modified version of the area used by xing et al 2019 was a confined aquifer with irregular boundaries fig 2 shows the plan view of the case there were two gcss and seven observation wells the total simulation time was 120 months which was divided into 60 equal simulation periods each simulation period had a duration of 2 months the gcss were assumed to release contaminant during the first four simulation periods which means the first four simulation periods were release periods the aquifer had five different hydraulic conductivity zones and the hydraulic conductivity value of each zone was unknown this means that there are thirteen unknown variables to be identified eight release intensities for two sources four release periods and five hydraulic conductivities for five zones the aquifer had specified head boundary conditions on the ab side and cd side with no flow on other sides the head values of the ab and cd side were 100 0 m and 80 0 m respectively table 1 lists the actual values of hydraulic conductivity table 2 lists the actual values of the gcss flux and table 3 lists basic parameters of the aquifer 2 2 numerical simulation model establishment of a numerical simulation model is a key point in the identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the governing partial differential equations for groundwater flow and contaminant transport in the two dimensional aquifer system are described below singh and datta 2006 the governing partial differential equation for the groundwater flow is as follows 1 x i k ij h x j q s s h t i j 1 2 t 0 where k ij is the hydraulic conductivity h is the hydraulic head q is the volumetric flux per unit volume and s s is the storativity the governing partial differential equation for the contaminant transport is as follows 2 c t x i d ij c x j x i u i c f i j 1 2 t 0 3 u i k ij θ h x i i j 1 2 where θ is the effective porosity c is the concentrations d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor u i is the average linear velocity and f is the source or sink term the modflow and mt3dms codes in the gms software were used to solve the groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical simulation model 2 3 obtained observed concentrations the hypothetical case had no actual observed data therefore actual data for the gcss were input into the simulation model and the simulation model was run to obtain the simulated concentrations of all observation wells in each simulation period the simulation period can be regarded as the observation period when obtaining simulated concentrations according to the parameters given above the contaminant transport process can be achieved by running a simulation model fig 3 shows the distribution of the contamination plume on day 240 day 1800 and day 3600 fig 4 is the simulated concentrations curve in the actual gcss identification the actual observed concentrations inevitably contain noise to imitate this situation noise was mixed into the simulated concentrations and the simulated concentrations with noise were called the observed concentrations to analyze the applicability of ceemd during identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information five scenarios were considered namely simulated concentrations observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 and noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 the simulated concentrations containing noise were regarded as the observed concentrations the concentrations of these five scenarios were applied to identify the simulation model parameters and gcss information respectively the simulated concentrations were added noise to obtain observed concentrations mahar and datta 1997 2000 and the observed concentrations were calculated as follows mahar and datta 2001 4 c c sim ε α c sim where c is the observed concentrations c sim is the simulated concentrations ε is the white noise coefficient of the added noise which obeys a normal distribution and has a variance of 1 and a mean of 0 in this study and α is the noise intensity which has a usual variation range of 0 0 2 when α 0 1 the noise intensity is weak when 0 1 α 0 15 the noise intensity is moderate when α 0 15 the noise intensity is strong singh datta 2006 zhao et al 2019 in this study the noise intensity was set to 0 05 and 0 15 the white noise coefficient is shown in fig 5 in addition the observed concentrations can also be obtained by adding random noise to the simulated concentrations 2 4 denoising observed data 2 4 1 noise reduction effect evaluation index after obtaining observed concentrations with noise intensities of 0 05 and 0 15 ceemd and wavelet analysis method were used to reduce the noise of the observed concentrations after which the noise reduction effect was evaluated and compared in this study the signal to noise ratio snr and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the noise reduction effect of ceemd and wavelet analysis method the snr which refers to the ratio of the power of the signal to be denoised to the power of the noise was calculated as follows 5 p s 1 n i 1 n f 2 x i 6 p n 1 n i 1 n f x i f x i 2 7 snr 10 lg p s p n where n is the length of the signal to be denoised f x i is the i t h value of the signal to be denoised f x i is the i t h value of the noise reduced signal p s is the power of the signal to be denoised and p n is the power of the noise a larger snr indicates a better noise reduction effect the rmse was calculated as follows 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n f x i f x i 2 a smaller rmse indicates a better noise reduction effect 2 4 2 complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd is a noise reduction method based on empirical mode decomposition emd the ceemd can not only denoise data with gaussian noise but also denoise data with random noise emd is a new adaptive time frequency signal processing approach that has been widely used in communication machinery fault diagnosis atmospheric data analysis biomedical signal analysis and geophysical detections huang et al 1998 veltcheva and soares 2004 huang 2005 the basic principle of emd is to decompose the signal to be denoised into many intrinsic mode function imf components and a residual component then some imf components and residual component are reconstructed to obtain the noise reduction data for more details about imf components please refer to the article by huang et al 1998 however emd has the disadvantage of modal confusion which is when imf components obtained by emd decomposition contain characteristics from different time scales specifically signals from the same scale or frequency exist in multiple imf components deering kaiser 2005 daubechies et al 2009 ceemd effectively improves the modal confusion that occurs when emd is used yeh et al 2010 li wang 2017 the difference between ceemd and emd is that for ceemd two completely opposite white noise signals are added to the signal to be denoised as follows 9 imf i t 1 2 n i 1 2 n c ij t 10 x 2 j t x t z j t j 1 2 3 n where z j t is the white noise signal conforming to the normal distribution x t is the signal to be denoised x j t is the signal with white noise added and x 2 j t is the signal with the opposite white noise added then decompose each signal with white noise added in turn take the decomposition of x j t as an example identify all the maximum value points of the x j t then use the cubic spline function to connect these points in sequence to obtain the maximum value envelope e max t next all the minimum points of the x j t are identified and used to obtain the minimum envelope e min t following the same method that was used for the maximum envelope the mean of the maximum envelope and the minimum envelope are then calculated as the mean envelope e mean t 11 e mean t e max t e min t 2 by subtracting the mean envelope e mean t from x j t a new signal h 1 1 t is obtained the schematic diagram of data decomposition is shown in fig 6 12 h 1 1 t x j t e mean t in general a stable signal cannot be obtained using only one such calculation therefore the above steps are repeated for the h 1 1 t if the condition of the imf component is satisfied after m operations the first imf of x j t is obtained 13 c 1 t imf 1 t h 1 m t by subtracting the first imf component from x j t a new signal r 1 t with some high frequency signals removed can be obtained 14 r 1 t x j t c 1 t r 1 t is then used as the new signal to be processed and step a is carried out to obtain the second imf component of x j t the above steps are repeated until the obtained n t h imf component or its residual component r n t meets the termination condition at which point the decomposition process of x j t is terminated x j t after decomposition can be expressed as follows 15 x j t i 1 n c i t r n t where r n t is the trend item of the signal to be processed and represents the average trend of x j t x j t is decomposed into n imf components and a residual component based on the decomposition it should be emphasized that the frequency from high to low does not mean that c n 1 t is higher than c n t on the entire signal trend line but refers to the higher frequency of c n 1 t than c n t in a local area of the signal trend line decomposition is performed on all white noise added signals x j t and x 2 j t in turn after which the mean value of the same order imf components of all white noise added signals is calculated and used as the final decomposition result of the signal to be denoised 16 imf i t 1 2 n i 1 2 n c ij t 17 r n t 1 2 n i 1 2 n r n i t based on the imf components and the residual component a noise reduced signal is obtained by reconstructing a part of the imf components or a part of the imf components and the residual component the noise reduction process using the ceemd is shown in fig 7 maximize the objective function of the following formula as a criterion for reconstructing concentrations 18 max α rmse 1 α r x

the i t h value of the noise reduced signal x t mean is the mean value of the signal to be denoised x t mean is the mean value of the denoised signal 2 4 3 wavelet analysis method the basic principle of wavelet analysis is to decompose the data into a series of the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients based on a wavelet mother function and then perform threshold processing on the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients to achieve the purpose of suppressing noise finally the processed approximation coefficients and detail coefficients are reconstructed by wavelet inverse transform to obtain denoised data mallat 1989 jawerth sweldens 1994 if φ t is defined as the wavelet mother function then a series of wavelet basis functions can be obtained for φ t after dilation and translation 19 φ a b t 1 a φ t b a a b r a 0 where φ a b t is a wavelet basis function a and b are the dilation and translation factor respectively for any f t l 2 r where l 2 r represents the square integrable in the real number space the continuous wavelet transform can be obtained by decomposing the signal based on equation 9 20 w f a b f φ a b t 1 a f t φ t b a d t the wavelet inverse transform is defined as the following 21 f t 1 c φ 1 a 2 w f a b φ a b t d a d b for more detailed mathematical principles of the wavelet analysis method please refer to the article by daubechies and heil 1992 and mallat 2010 based on the above mathematical principles the noise reduction process by the wavelet analysis method includes the following steps the schematic diagram of wavelet three layer decomposition is shown in fig 8 the noise reduction of observed concentrations is realized by wavedec wdcbm and wdencmp functions in matlab 1 decompose noisy data select the wavelet decomposition function determine the number of wavelet decomposition layers and perform n layer wavelet decomposition on the signal in general the number of decomposition layers should be less than log 2 n after comparing and decomposing the noise reduction effects of layers three four and five this study selects the three layers decomposition with the best noise reduction effect in addition the daubechies 1 db1 and symlets 4 sym4 wavelets were selected to compare the effects of different wavelet functions on noise reduction 2 threshold processing select a threshold function hard threshold function is selected to perform threshold processing on the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients to suppress the noise in the high frequency signal 3 reconstruction process wavelet inverse transform is performed on the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients to obtain denoised data 2 5 surrogate model it is necessary to call the numerical simulation model tens of thousands of times during the iterative calculation process of identifying the information of gcss which creates a huge computational load and wastes a lot of time thus the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model with high precision for the simulation model to solve this problem a detailed introduction of the kriging method can be found in zhao et al 2016 and guo et al 2018 the process for establishment of the surrogate model used in the present study was as follows 1 determine the unknown variables variables to be identified the unknown variables were the hydraulic conductivity of five zones and the release intensity of two gcss eight release intensities for two sources four release periods and five hydraulic conductivities for five zones after determining the unknown variables latin hypercube sampling was performed within its value range a total of 360 groups were sampled the detailed principle of latin hypercube sampling can be found in mckay and conover 1979 helton and davis 2003 and hossain et al 2006 2 input all unknown variables into the simulation model in turn then run the simulation model to obtain the simulated contaminant concentrations for all observation wells in each observation period 3 five sixths of the input and output unknown variables simulated contaminant concentrations data were used to train samples for the surrogate model and one sixth of input and output data were used as test samples for the surrogate model the kriging method was used to write the training code the kriging surrogate models were trained and tested using the training and test samples the accuracy of the surrogate models was tested based on three evaluative coefficients the certainty coefficient r2 root mean square error rmsr absolute relative error are and mean relative error mre the calculation formulae for the three coefficients were as follows 22 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 23 rmsr i 1 n y i y i 2 n 24 are y i y i y i 100 25 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 in eqs 22 25 y i and y i are the simulated contaminant concentrations of the ith sample obtained from the contaminant transport simulation model and the surrogate model respectively and y i is the average of the simulated contaminant concentrations for n samples obtained from the contaminant transport simulation model smaller values for the mre and rmsr as well as values of r 2 closer to 1 indicate that the surrogate model is more accurate when mre evaluating the accuracy of identification results y i and y i are the actual value and identification value respectively 2 6 optimization model on basis of the above study s o method was used to identify hydraulic conductivity and release intensity of the gcss the s o has been widely applied to identify gcss information in recent years datta et al 2009 bashi azghadi and kerachian 2010 ayvaz 2016 jiang et al 2021 the main steps in application of this method are as follows 1 establish the groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical simulation model of the groundwater system based on specific conditions of the study area and obtain the observed concentrations from the sample wells 2 for optimization of the gcss identification determine the objective function of the optimization problem the least square sum of simulated concentrations and observed concentrations is often defined as the objective function decision variables variables to be solved including gcss information and constraints gcss information and contaminant transport rules etc an optimization model based on the above conditions is then established 3 realize coupling of the contaminant transport numerical simulation model and the optimization model 4 use optimization algorithms to solve the optimization model and identify the gcss information the general form of the optimization model applied to gcss identification is as follows 26 min g x δ min δ i x δ max i 1 2 n β j x 0 j 1 2 m where min g x is the objective function x x 1 x 2 x 3 x e are the decision variables of the optimization model e is the total number of decision variables δ i x is the inequality constraint δ min and δ max are the upper and lower bound of the inequality constraint respectively n is the total number of inequality constraints β j x is the equality constraint and m is the total number of equality constraints according to the specific goal of this study the general form of the optimization model is rewritten to make it suitable for the identification of hydraulic conductivity and release intensity of the gcss the least square sum of simulated concentrations and observed concentrations during each observation period divided by 100 was defined as the objective function the hydraulic conductivity and release intensity of the gcss were decision variables the contaminant transport simulation model replace with the surrogate model was embedded in the optimization model as an equality constraint to ensure that the contaminant transport law for a groundwater system was satisfied during the optimization process the feasible domains for the decision variables constituted the inequality constraints the objective function and constraints constituted the optimization model equation 23 is the optimization model 27 min z k m q sn t 1 60 k 1 7 c k t t c k t 0 2 100 k min k m k max m 1 2 5 q min q sn q max s 1 2 n 1 2 3 4 c k t t f k m q sn where k m is the hydraulic conductivity m represents the m th hydraulic conductivity q sn is the release intensity of the gcss s represents the s th gcss n represents the n th release intensity of the gcss c k t t is the simulated concentrations and c k t 0 is the observed concentrations 3 results 3 1 evaluation of noise reduction ceemd wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis were used to denoise the observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 and 0 15 the imf components and residual components obtained by the ceemd decomposition are shown in fig 9 using observation well 4 as an example according to the reconstruction principle in section 2 4 2 when the second to sixth imf components and the residual component was reconstructed the objective function value was the largest 0 05 noise intensity is 0 717 and 0 15 noise intensity is 0 697 thus the second to sixth imf components and the residual component were superimposed to constitute the noise reduced observed concentrations the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients obtained by the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively after the approximation coefficients and detail coefficients are processed by thresholding the denoised concentrations is obtained by wavelet inverse transform the concentrations comparison before and after noise reduction obtained were shown in figs 12 and 13 the mean absolute error mae and the mre were used to compare and analyze the closeness of the observed concentrations with different noise intensities and the noise reduced observed concentrations to the simulated concentrations as shown in table 4 greater noise was associated with a greater mae and a greater mre of the observed and simulated concentrations wavelet db1 analysis failed to reduce the noise in the observed concentrations compared with the wavelet sym4 analysis and ceemd and the difference between the noise reduced observed concentrations and simulated concentrations became larger this situation also occured when wavelet sym4 analysis was applied to denoise the concentrations with noise intensity of 0 05 the reason for those may be that the effective information in the concentrations were sharply reduced as noise when ceemd was applied to the observed concentrations the mae and mre of the noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 and the simulated concentrations were reduced by 4 33 and 1 4 respectively the mae and mre of the noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 and the simulated concentrations were reduced by 14 18 and 4 78 respectively which were reduced by 1 62 and 0 3 more than the wavelet sym4 analysis the snr and the rmse were then used to evaluate the noise reduction effect of ceemd wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis fig 14 shows a comparison of the rmse and snr of the observed concentrations before and after noise reduction as shown in fig 14 the rmse and snr were16 06 and 27 63 respectively when ceemd was applied to denoise the observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 the rmse is 61 35 and 23 26 lower than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively the snr is 13 66 and 7 78 higher than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively when ceemd was applied to denoise the observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 the rmse and snr were 45 04 and 18 81 respectively the rmse is 40 25 and 20 02 lower than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively the snr is 5 55 and 3 19 higher than when denoising with the wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods respectively the above analysis results show that the ceemd has the obvious and better noise reduction effect than wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods therefore the observed concentrations after noise reduction by the ceemd method was applied to the identification of hydraulic conductivity and gcss information in addition it can be seen from the noise reduction results that as the noise contained in the observed concentrations increases the noise reduction effect becomes worse which indicates that the noise reduction effect can be limited by the intensity of noise therefore it is necessary to minimize the generation of noise when obtaining the observed concentrations 3 2 accuracy analysis of surrogate models the weight of each parameter of the surrogate model is shown in table 5 the r2 rmse and mre were used to evaluate the accuracy of the surrogate model the degree of the output fitting of the surrogate and simulation models and the absolute relative error box plot are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively the dots in fig 16 represent the are for each test data the three evaluation parameters of the surrogate model are shown in table 6 as shown in fig 15 fig 16 and table 6 the r2 was higher than 0 99 rmse was higher than 13 99 and mre was higher than 2 07 indicating that the surrogate model had good approximation accuracy to the simulation model and could replace the simulation model for calculations as can be seen from fig 16 for observation wells 1 3 4 5 6 and 7 are of outliers were all within 4 which showed that the accuracy of the surrogate model to the simulation model was very high observation well 2 contained some outliers that deviated from the output of the simulation model slightly this may have occurred because well 2 located in a parameter zone with a small hydraulic conductivity and was close to the gcss resulting in a more complex relationship between input and output parameters in this study the genetic algorithm ga was applied to solve the optimization model the detailed principles of the ga can be found in davis 1991 and whitley 1994 when solving the optimization model a computer equipped with an intel i5 3 2 ghz processor and 8g ram was used for numerical calculation when solving the optimization model using this system it will take about 3322 21 h to call the simulation model for 260 000 iterative calculations while it took about 47 81 min using the kriging surrogate model which is a savings of more than 99 of the calculation time 3 3 comparative analysis of identification results the observed concentrations with the best noise reduction effect which based on the ceemd was applied to the identification of hydraulic conductivity and gcss to analyze the applicability of the ceemd five scenarios were considered simulated concentrations observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 05 observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 and noise reduced observed concentrations with a noise intensity of 0 15 each of these scenarios was applied to the identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the identification results of simulation model parameters and gcss information and convergence curves corresponding to the five scenarios described above are shown in fig 17 the relative error and mean relative error of the identification results are shown in fig 18 as shown in figs 17 and 18 when the simulated concentrations were used to identify the simulation model parameters and the gcss information the objective function error was smallest and the identification accuracy was highest when the observed with noise values were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the degree of deviation of the identification result from the actual value became obviously larger moreover as the mixed noise increased the degree of deviation gradually became larger for observed concentrations with the same intensity of noise when the noise reduced observed concentrations with noise generated by ceemd were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the accuracy of the identification results was significantly higher than that obtained using the observed concentrations with noise before values were denoised as the noise in the observed concentrations increased the noise reduction effect of ceemd decreased when noise reduced observed concentrations with noise intensities of 0 05 and 0 15 were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the identification effect corresponding to the noise reduced observed concentrations with noise intensity of 0 05 was better the mean relative errors of the identification results in the five scenarios were 2 7 27 77 12 06 44 76 and 20 85 respectively for the observed concentrations with noise intensities of 0 05 and 0 15 after applying ceemd to reduce their noise and then applying them to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the accuracy of the identification results obtained was increased by 15 71 and 23 91 respectively this shows that application of ceemd made an important contribution to improving the identification accuracy of the simulation model parameters and the gcss information 4 conclusion and discussion noise was shown to have a significant impact on the identification results of simulation model parameters and gcss information moreover greater the noise contained in observed concentrations were associated with greater deviations of the identification results of simulation model parameter results and gcss information from the actual values comparing with wavelet db1 analysis and wavelet sym4 analysis methods ceemd has the best noise reduction effect and is more suitable for noise reduction processing of observed concentrations specifically ceemd was found to reduce the noise contained in observed concentrations and to cause observed concentrations to be closer to the actual values applying the noise reduced observed concentrations to identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information improved the accuracy of the identification results as the noise contained in the observed concentrations increased the noise reduction effect of the ceemd became worse nevertheless for observed concentrations with the same intensity noise the accuracy of the identification results based on the noise reduced observed concentrations was still higher than that based on the observed concentrations without noise reduction when noise reduced observed concentrations with large noise were applied to the joint identification of simulation model parameters and gcss information the accuracy of the identification results was higher relative to when noise reduced observed concentrations with small noise were applied therefore it is very important to avoid generation of noise as much as possible

2976,the taihang mountain region tmr of china is an important headwater area that provides substantial water resources supporting the social and ecological stability of the north china plain currently groundwater resources in the tmr are rapidly declining but the degree of groundwater storage gws depletion and the driving mechanism of groundwater drought remain poorly understood this study combined the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and global land data assimilation system gldas datasets to thoroughly analyze gws changes in the tmr and the dominant driving factors during 2003 2016 in addition a new index the groundwater drought potential index gdpi was established to quantify the potential of groundwater drought we found that grace derived terrestrial water storage in the tmr experienced a significant reduction 21 82 mm yr p 0 01 during 2003 2016 with a similar reduction in gws 21 22 mm yr p 0 01 human induced impacts exerted a decisive role in gws decreases in this region with a relative contribution rate of 96 compared to the climatic contribution 4 climatic impacts on gws were primarily observed in the southeastern tmr where climate change appeared to be unbeneficial to groundwater recovery and exacerbated local groundwater depletion specifically the groundwater drought potential was entirely increasing indicating a worsened climate condition that precipitation increasingly failed to fill the groundwater deficit actions should be taken urgently to address the local groundwater crisis and to maintain water security our proposed gdpi not only reflected the degree of groundwater depletion but also revealed the relationship between groundwater drought and precipitation making the index capable of being applied in drought forecasting this study delivers a new perspective to better understand the mechanisms of gws change and groundwater drought and the results are expected to provide a valuable reference for groundwater management and water sustainability goals keywords grace gldas groundwater drought terrestrial water storage taihang mountain region 1 introduction global water resources are currently facing unprecedented challenges as water land food coupled systems tend to become unsustainable fao 2021 at least four billion people have been suffering severe water scarcity globally mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water shortages have become an urgent issue to be addressed for human welfare worldwide it was estimated that the earth s freshwater totals 35 million km3 kang 2014 most of which is invisible and is stored as groundwater beneath the land surface famiglietti and ferguson 2021 groundwater accounts for approximately 1 3 of the total available freshwater globally and is becoming increasingly essential for agricultural irrigation domestic drinking and industrial production döll et al 2012 wada 2016 in addition to offering great benefits to human beings groundwater also exerts a vital role in regulating the hydrological cycle runoff recharge and precipitation storage and sustaining ecosystem stability vegetation greening and wetland protection especially in water limited arid or semiarid regions han et al 2020 taylor et al 2013 due to groundwater s slower response to meteorological changes compared with near surface water elements the recovery of groundwater depletion without external disturbances usually requires months and even a million or more years in various aquifers sturchio et al 2004 rodell et al 2009 excessive groundwater depletion not only makes groundwater use unsustainable but also results in a series of eco environmental problems such as land subsidence and groundwater drought feng et al 2013 faunt et al 2016 consequently accurate detection and knowledge of groundwater dynamics is a linchpin for protecting and managing groundwater and maintaining ecological security traditionally groundwater is monitored mainly via in situ well observations which are more suitable for detecting short term and small scale groundwater changes owing to limitations of spatial and temporal gaps and cost xie et al 2018 although climate driven land surface models can overcome the drawbacks of well observations and competently simulate continuous and large scale groundwater changes li and rodell 2015 cao et al 2019 these models are always involved in a degree of simplification of hydrological processes and lead to some empirical parameters and imprecise meteorological data introducing great uncertainties into estimates of groundwater storage gws van dijk et al 2014 soltani et al 2021 in recent decades satellite remote sensing based observations have prevailed as an effective and powerful tool for monitoring groundwater variations particularly launched in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission enables the monthly and global detection of gravity anomalies with unprecedented precision tapley et al 2004 and terrestrial water storage tws information can be retrieved from the detected grace signal where tws is mainly composed of surface waters soil moisture ice snow and groundwater accordingly groundwater changes are capable of being isolated from tws changes by using auxiliary data e g in situ measurements or land surface models to remove other components of tws rodell et al 2007 finally forming a reliable groundwater time series dataset grace based observations promote a better knowledge and understanding of terrestrial water resources and have been widely applied in climatology ecology hydrology and geography recent studies on grace groundwater have focused more on revealing the factors of gws changes rodell et al 2018 long et al 2020 and evaluating grace related climate extremes pokhrel et al 2021 tapley et al 2019 regarding human activity impacts on gws variations studies have reported that anthropogenic revegetation and coal mining pronouncedly accelerated gws consumption and led to groundwater depletion at regional scales xie et al 2018 xie et al 2019 han et al 2020 additionally human overuse of groundwater for agricultural irrigation exerted a negative impact on terrestrial water resources especially in several groundwater depletion hotspot regions worldwide such as the indo gangetic plain rodell et al 2009 north china plain feng et al 2013 guo and shen 2015a b us high plains and california central valley scanlon et al 2012 notably human activities did not always play a negative role in gws some positive human interventions are beneficial to gws recovery for example china s south to north water diversion project yang et al 2022 and the national policies to strictly limit groundwater withdrawal on the north china plain causing the local groundwater table to almost stop declining and to start to rise in comparison to anthropogenic factors climate change has a more profound impact on groundwater amount and redistribution for instance climate fluxes precipitation and evapotranspiration directly determine the amount of remaining water used for groundwater recharge taylor et al 2013 climate related teleconnection factors such as the arctic oscillation ao and el niño southern oscillation are capable of significantly altering the spatiotemporal pattern of water storage han et al 2019 despite increasing discussions of gws and its individual factors few attempts have been made to interpret the impacts of anthropogenic and climatic factors on gws changes a clear understanding of which factor dominates gws changes will assist in largely improving water resource management and understanding groundwater operation mechanisms if the gws in a given period is lower than the historical average level the deficit represents a groundwater drought state groundwater depletion under arid climatic conditions easily evolves into groundwater drought due to a lack of timely groundwater recharge which seriously disrupts the balance of groundwater recharge and discharge van lanen and peters 2000 previous studies have proposed groundwater drought indices and have applied them to discern and monitor groundwater drought thomas et al 2014 li and rodell 2015 goodarzi et al 2016 thomas et al 2017 nevertheless the indices were designed to simply reflect the degree of groundwater deficit in terms of gws and seldom considered other drought related factors different types of droughts including meteorological hydrological agricultural and groundwater droughts are almost all relevant to precipitation shortfalls van lanen and peters 2000 integrating multiple factors such as precipitation into an evaluation system and establishing a comprehensive groundwater drought indicator are crucial for accurate drought forecasting and groundwater management this study chose the taihang mountain region hereafter tmr of china as the study area in view of its geographic importance and ecological vulnerability the tmr is a natural ecological barrier and important headwater of the north china plain from which 60 of the rivers on the plain originate the mountains annually supplied approximately 3 6 billion m3 of water to the plain in the form of runoff and lateral groundwater recharge song et al 2007 liu et al 2019 equivalent to 37 of groundwater withdrawals 9 7 billion m3 on the north china plain in 2019 exerting a critical role in the water supply for a long time the agricultural development in the tmr and the piedmont plain relied highly on groundwater overexploitation combined with other high intensity human activities e g damming and revegetation upstream and therefore have severely reduced available water resources that could have been supplied downstream and the plains monitoring data showed that the surface runoff in the mountains was continuously declining du et al 2019 with available water to the plains decreasing thus causing an increasingly serious threat to agricultural outputs on the north china plain and to national food security at present the assessment of spatiotemporal change in gws and its driving mechanisms in the tmr still remain poorly understood the aims of this study are therefore to 1 reveal gws dynamics in the tmr in combination with satellite and model based observations to provide clear knowledge of water resource dynamics 2 separate the relative contributions of climate and anthropogenic activities to gws changes to better explain the driving mechanisms of groundwater change and 3 establish a new index to comprehensively evaluate groundwater drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tmr 110 10 e 114 30 e 34 30 n 40 40 n is located on the eastern border of the loess plateau of china bordering the north china plain and the shanxi plateau to the east and west respectively its total area reaches approximately 1 28 105 km2 covering 101 counties and partial regions of shanxi province henan province hebei province and beijing city of china with an elevation range of 37 3061 m fig 1 according to the statistical data the annual values of precipitation average temperature and crop reference evapotranspiration were 521 mm 3 0 mm yr p 0 23 10 3 c 0 07 c yr p 0 07 and 885 mm 0 88 mm yr p 0 25 respectively in the last 20 years and this area is characterized by a typical temperate monsoon climate approximately 68 of the total tmr is within the haihe river basin where agricultural irrigation has contributed to detectable groundwater depletion e g the groundwater level at the luancheng station on the piedmont plain continuously decreased from 12 m to 45 m during 1974 2017 increased evapotranspiration in the tmr further reduced water yield and lateral groundwater recharge flowing into the plains guo and shen 2015b therefore an assessment of gws changes and their driving mechanisms must be conducted urgently to address the water scarcity crisis in the tmr 2 2 data source and preprocessing grace gravity field solutions include spherical harmonic solutions and mass concentration mascon solutions whose data are provided by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl center for space research csr at the university of texas and goddard space flight center gsfc previous analysis pointed out that mascon decreases leakage errors from land to ocean and has a superior performance compared to traditional spherical harmonic solutions scanlon et al 2016 this study chose csr grace rl06 v02 mascon data https www2 csr utexas edu grace to acquire monthly tws anomalies twsa from january 2002 to december 2016 with a higher spatial resolution because the spatial resolution of csr data is the highest compared to other grace products and is the same as our land surface water data additionally the 0 5 spatial resolution of gsfc grace rl06 v02 mascon data https earth gsfc nasa gov geo data grace mascons and 3 spatial resolution of jpl grace rl06 v02 mascon data https grace jpl nasa gov were used in comparison with csr grace data wiese et al 2016 2018 eleven missing monthly data points in two mascon products were filled by the linear interpolation method based on neighboring months detailed information about the mascon solution can be found in the studies of save et al 2016 and save 2020 global land data assimilation system gldas datasets rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 provide four land surface models i e mosaic noah community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model https disc gsfc nasa gov gldas they have been proven to have good accuracy and can be used for the comparison of grace data wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 this study chose the gldas noah 2 1 dataset with a 0 25 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution to calculate land surface water storage compared to the other three models soil moisture from the noah dataset was found to have a higher correlation with grace tws long et al 2014 gldas derived surface water is composed of a total of storm surface runoff baseflow groundwater runoff and soil moisture at depths of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm in the soil layers here we did not consider the snow depth water equivalent plant canopy surface water and soil moisture at depths of 100 200 cm in the surface water in the tmr this is because the snow depth water equivalent is very low in the tmr therefore it can almost be ignored in surface water plant canopy surface water will be completely evaporated on a monthly scale additionally the soil thickness is usually shallower in mountainous areas than in plain areas and therefore we used soil moisture only at a depth of 0 1 m in the calculation of gldas surface water extra gws data were from gldas catchment land surface models that have a 0 25 daily resolution li et al 2019 2020 which was used to verify grace derived gws similar to the processing of grace twsa all anomaly values in this study were converted by subtracting the original average from january 2004 to december 2009 the data including groundwater burial depth were

https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculating gws anomaly gwsa changes we isolated the gwsa from garce derived twsa changes by subtracting gldas derived land surface water storage here we ignored the impact of surface water reservoirs on tws as the water storage of major water reservoirs in the tmr and surrounding areas was nearly utilized for municipal and industrial uses and had a small impact on long term tws change feng et al 2013 moreover we verified the reliability of the calculated grace gwsa by comparing the gldas gwsa the calculation of the grace derived gwsa is as follows 1 gwsa t w s a l w s a where gwsa is the grace derived gwsa twsa is the grace derived twsa and lwsa denotes the gldas derived land surface water storage anomaly including the storm surface runoff anomaly baseflow groundwater runoff anomaly and soil moisture anomaly at a depth of 0 1 m 2 3 2 quantifying the relative contributions of climate and human activities to gwsa changes to quantify climatic and anthropogenic impacts on gws changes we used the residual analysis method to calculate the relative contributions of these two factors to the gwsa residual analysis is commonly used in the attribution of vegetation changes sun et al 2015 pei et al 2021 and it is capable of separating anthropogenic and climatic impacts on one variable the principle of residual analysis is to establish one climate driven variable time series using climatic data and then suppose the residual of the observed variable and established variable as a human driven variable time series here a multiple regression model was established by the gwsa and climatic variable precipitation and temperature anomalies we considered precipitation and temperature as the main climatic factors because most climate driven water storage anomalies can be reconstructed by precipitation and temperature humphrey et al 2017 liu et al 2021 first we used the adjacent pixel method to resample gwsa raster data to a 1 km spatial resolution that coincides with the climate raster data by which each raster was divided into many small grids but these raster values were constant the aim was to meet the condition in which the spatial resolutions of the grids from different datasets were the same to successfully conduct the residual analysis then we used monthly precipitation anomalies and temperature anomalies to fit the monthly grace gwsa at a grid scale using matlab software and fitting values reconstructed monthly gwsas were identified as climate driven gwsa time series moreover the residuals of the fitting equation monthly original gwsa minus reconstructed monthly gwsa were assumed to be human activity driven gwsa changes i e nonclimatic impacts because gws changes can usually be attributed to human and climate induced consequences here we estimated the linear slopes of the original climate driven and human activity driven gwsa time series climatic and anthropogenic relative contributions to gwsa changes were expressed as the ratios of linear slopes of climate driven and human activity driven gwsas to the original gwsa calculated by equation 1 respectively a detailed quantification definition can be found in table 1 the equations are as follows 2 gws a cc a p b t 3 gws a ac g w s a or g w s a cc where gwsacc gwsaac and gwsaor denote the monthly climate driven gwsa human activity driven gwsa and the original gwsa respectively p and t denote the monthly precipitation anomaly and temperature anomaly respectively a and b are both regression coefficients estimated by the matlab tool at a raster scale and they are combined with the monthly p anomaly and t anomaly to reconstruct the climate driven gwsa time series by fitting equation 3 additionally the approach to defining the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to the gwsa is displayed as follows 2 3 3 developing a groundwater drought index groundwater drought is a special drought type that manifests itself as follows groundwater recharge first decreases and then gws and discharge decline previous studies have defined and applied groundwater drought indices which widely build on the normalized values of deseasonalized gwsas thomas et al 2014 li and rodell 2015 thomas et al 2017 whereas the index only represented the degree of gws deficit and failed to describe the internal relationship between gws and precipitation as the flood potential index did based on previous studies reager and famiglietti 2009 thomas et al 2017 we established a groundwater drought potential index gdpi and its role is to integrate precipitation into the evaluation of groundwater drought and to reassess the drought potential of groundwater the gdpi is similar with the groundwater recharge drought index proposed by goodarzi et al 2016 and it does not focus on the actual groundwater recharge but the relationship between precipitation and gws first we deseasonalized grace derived gwsas in a given month by subtracting the average of all gwsas in this month during the study period whose aim was to acquire continuous gwsa time series without seasonal variability for the deseasonalized gwsa time series the historical maximum was set to the optimal gws status we assumed the difference between the monthly deseasonalized gwsas and the deseasonalized gwsa maximum as the highest groundwater charge demand which reflected the amount of recharge needed to restore groundwater drought to its optimal status monthly precipitation was regarded as a source of recharge to judge if the highest groundwater requirement could be met by precipitation if precipitation was greater than the highest groundwater recharge demand the drought potential for groundwater was almost zero which meant that groundwater drought was unlikely to occur conversely the less precipitation compared with the demand the lower the potential for groundwater recovery to the optimum level and the higher the likelihood of groundwater drought in short the gdpi indicates the possibility of groundwater drought and it is determined by whether precipitation exceeds the groundwater charge requirement and makes the gwsas recover to the historical maximum level the gdpi aims to standardize the drought potential amount and quantify the probability of groundwater drought the detailed processes were as follows 1 deseasonalized gwsa 4 gws a deseasonalized g w s a 1 n g w s a i w h e r e i 1 2 3 12 where gwsadeseasonalized is the monthly deseasonalized gwsa i and n denotes the length of the total years of the study period for example the deseasonalized gwsa in january of a given year is equal to the original gwsa in january of that year minus the average of all gwsas in january during the 2003 2016 period 2 calculating the highest groundwater charge demand the gdpi was estimated from gwsadeseasonalized and precipitation by adjusting the approach of reager and famiglietti 2009 here the highest groundwater charge demand in each month was described as follows 5 gwc d t max gws a deseasonalized t g w s a deseasonalized t where gwcdt is the highest groundwater charge demand in month t and represents the amount of water needed to restore the monthly gwsa to the historically optimal level gwsadeseasonalized t is the deseasonalized gwsa in month t 3 determining if the highest groundwater charge demand can be met by precipitation here we presumed that precipitation would always follow a stored fullrunoff pattern and therefore precipitation was regarded as the optimal potential of groundwater recharge to determine whether the optimal charge potential can exceed the highest charge demand in a given month the drought potential amount was created as follows 6 dp a t p t g w c d t where dpat is the drought potential amount in month t and pt is precipitation in month t if dpat is 0 there is almost no potential for the occurrence of groundwater drought if dpat is 0 and when dpat is larger the potential for groundwater drought is higher and precipitation is smaller relative to the groundwater recharge demand 4 standardizing the drought potential amount to obtain the gdpi finally the gdpi was normalized based on dpat by the following equation 7 gdp i t dp a t min dp a t where gdpit is grace derived gdpi in month t if gdpi is 0 and the closer the gdpi is to 1 in a given month the smaller the precipitation relative to groundwater charge demand and the larger the groundwater depletion which is also more likely to cause groundwater drought conversely when the gdpi is 0 in a given month there is almost no potential for groundwater drought to occur as precipitation conditions have sufficient potential to restore groundwater to a historically optimal state 2 4 sen s slope and mann kendall m k significance test sen s slope sen 1968 is a nonparametric and robust statistical approach for calculating the trend of time series variables it is insensitive to missing data but requires variables to be mutually independent sen s slope approach has a powerful performance for trend accuracy and outlier resistance here we used sen s slope method to calculate the trends of grace derived gwsa changes at a raster scale as follows 8 slope m e d i a n v m v n m n where vm and vn denote the time series variable v in months m and n respectively when slope 0 v is at an uptrend in a given period otherwise its change follows a declining trend the m k test is a nonparametric statistical test of variable trend capable of measuring the significance of time series data mann 1945 kendall 1975 the m k test does not need time series variables to obey certain distributions and is also not disturbed by outliers here we utilized the m k test to judge the significance of the gwsa trend at a grid scale the calculation process of the m k significance test is as follows 9 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n v j v i 10 s g n v j v i 1 v j v i 0 0 v j v i 0 1 v j v i 0 11 s s n n 1 2 n 5 18 12 z s s s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 s s s 0 where vi and vj are the values of v in months i and j respectively n is equal to the time length of v the s statistic value is equal to the standard normal test z statistic value if n 10 and if z u 1 α 2 the trend of v changes is statistically significant at the confidence level of α in this study α 0 05 is used as the acceptable significance level 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal changes in twsa and gwsa the changes in twsas based on grace and gldas are depicted in fig 2 the correlations among the csr grace derived jpl grace derived and gsfc grace derived data were 0 95 with a range of root mean square error within 35 39 mm indicating the high credibility of grace products the results of each grace product entirely exhibits a declining trend from january 2003 to december 2016 during which a continuous upward trend occurred in 2003 specifically the jpl grace derived twsa decreased at a speed of 24 49 mm yr p 0 01 and the csr grace derived twsa also showed a statistically significant decline at a speed of 21 82 mm yr p 0 01 the historical maximum december 2003 and minimum june 2016 of the csr grace twsa reached 189 54 mm and 314 30 mm respectively representing a large decrease of 504 mm spatially the declining trends of the csr grace twsa ranged from 4 91 mm yr to 45 05 mm yr and the trends in the whole study area passed the m k statistical significance test with a 95 confidence level the regions with rapid slow decreases in twsas were primarily distributed in the southeastern northern area of the tmr and adjacent areas fig a1 isolated from the gldas derived land surface water storage anomaly the csr grace derived gwsa changes in the tmr are shown in fig 2c gldas gwsas have a strongly positive correlation with grace gwsas as a result of the correlation coefficient of 0 89 with the root mean square error of 71 mm from 2003 to 2016 grace gwsas in the tmr significantly decreased with a downward trend of 21 22 mm yr p 0 01 which was much higher than that of gldas gwsas 9 06 mm yr p 0 01 the historical maximum 134 83 mm and minimum 338 27 mm of grace gwsas occurred in january 2004 and december 2016 similar to gldas gwsas respectively with a decrease of almost 473 10 mm in terms of the raster scale shown in fig 2a sen s slope of the grace gwsa trend ranged from 2 96 mm yr to 43 86 mm yr and the trend in each grid passed the m k significance test at a confidence level of 95 which indicates that the gws in any given area in the tmr was statistically pronouncedly decreasing in the study period a significant groundwater depletion rate was observed mainly in the southeastern area of the tmr which was close to the piedmont plain a typically irrigated agricultural area on the north china plain due to groundwater over exploitation in the plains the considerable lateral recharge flowing from the mountains to the plains led to a serious groundwater shortage in the southeastern area of the tmr 3 2 multiscale characteristics of the gwsa fig 3 a depicts the monthly gwsa changes in the tmr during 2003 2016 in which we found that the gws in each month was decreasing year by year significant gws declines were increasingly concentrated in the middle of the year and gws within one year gradually tended to fluctuate extremely indicating decreased and unstable water resources in the tmr an obvious change in the gws reduction appeared in january 2009 and from then on the dry season began to come earlier than usual in terms of seasonal variations the gws in spring and summer decreased pronouncedly and the water storage failed to increase with the beginning of the rainy season this is an evident indication that spring drought started to frequently occur in the tmr thus exerting a strongly passive role in early spring sowing and crop outputs the interannual gws showed a continually decreasing trend with a high correlation with the trend of the gws in december each year indicating a final redistribution of the annual water cycle it is virtually certain that the persistence and intensity of groundwater drought increased continuously in the tmr and the local water scarcity was becoming frequent and severe as a result of the joint consequences of human activities and climate change 3 3 relative contributions of drivers to the gwsa trend fig 4 a and fig 4b spatially visualize the relative contributions of human activities and climate change to the grace gwsa trend in the tmr during 2003 2006 respectively due to the reductions in gws in the whole study area human activities and climate change both had negative impacts on gwsas in the study period the anthropogenic contribution rates of gwsa decreases in every raster reached at least 84 overall averaging 96 the climatic contribution rates ranged from 0 15 64 and the average contribution rate was approximately 4 fig 4c gwsa decreases driven only by human activities were mainly distributed in the northern and southwestern corner of the tmr with an area of 50 000 km2 where climate change had hardly dominated gwsa changes compared to anthropogenic impacts other regions with gwsa reductions were dominated jointly by human activities and climate change covering 61 of the tmr fig 4d specifically climatic factors failed to independently explain gwsa reductions in the whole tmr and hence human induced impacts exerted a decisive role in groundwater depletion in the tmr during 2003 2016 3 4 establishment of the gdpi and its comparison with the ggdi gws deficits and surpluses bounded by 0 were distinguished by the deseasonalized gwsa through monthly gwsas minus the average of all gwsas of a given month in the study period fig 5 a 5b after removing seasonal variability in gwsa time series the deseasonalized gwsa denotes the net deviation of gwsas relative to seasonal variability thomas et al 2017 we found that gwsas in the tmr maintained a surplus status from april 2003 to september 2008 and then deficit status lasted until the end of the study period except for a few months the state of groundwater drought lasted from october 2008 to december 2016 in the tmr and was most likely to continue to deteriorate in the future the monthly maximum surplus december 2004 and deficit december 2016 were approximately 202 94 mm and 255 20 mm respectively representing the highest decrease 491 14 mm without seasonal variability in the historical gws records of the tmr the difference between the deseasonalized monthly gwsa and its historical maximum was the highest recharge requirement for gws in a given month and precipitation could be fully recharged to groundwater under ideal conditions fig 5c shows temporal changes in the groundwater recharge requirement gray bar and available groundwater recharge amount i e precipitation blue bar the recharge requirements were entirely increased at a rate of 21 15 mm yr p 0 01 and there were only 10 months out of 168 months in which precipitation exceeded groundwater recharge requirements we found that the groundwater recharge requirement was often reduced to a certain extent after strong precipitation events e g in july 2012 and july 2013 but after 2014 the reduction almost disappeared during the rainy season in dry years when yearly precipitation was less than the normal levels the groundwater drought could not be mitigated and conversely continued to worsen especially in 2014 2015 after the strong precipitation input in july 2016 the groundwater recharge requirement seemed not to decrease significantly as before indicating an increasingly severe groundwater drought crisis in this region the differences in precipitation minus the groundwater recharge requirement were normalized as the gdpi and are depicted in fig 5d including a previously proposed grace groundwater drought index ggdi from thomas et al 2017 the gdpi captured well the characteristics of groundwater depletion of the ggdi as a result of a strong correlation r 0 89 with the ggdi which indicated that the lower the ggdi was i e the greater the groundwater deficit the higher the gdpi and the higher the potential of groundwater drought occurrence meanwhile the gdpi considers the role of precipitation in groundwater recharge thus compromising the degree of groundwater drought reflected by the ggdi in some rainfall rich months such as july 2012 july 2013 september 2014 august 2015 and july 2016 compared to the ggdi the gdpi exhibited a kind of seasonal characteristic due to the integration of precipitation and highlighted the high potential of groundwater drought in dry years it not only represents the degree of groundwater deficit but also reflects the relative relationship between gws and precipitation offering a more valuable reference for future drought monitoring in terms of annual scale table 2 accumulated annual gws surpluses and deficits ranged from 388 64 1 965 47 mm in 2003 2008 and 294 45 mm 1 987 09 mm in 2009 2016 respectively the annual water volume to meet the highest groundwater recharge requirement increased from 539 83 mm in 2004 to 4 492 38 mm in 2016 with a total accumulated water requirement of 35 074 09 mm during 2003 2016 a factor of 3 32 to total accumulated precipitation in the same period and the increase rate of groundwater recharge requirement 255 13 mm yr p 0 01 was 173 times higher than that of precipitation 1 47 mm yr p 0 73 accordingly total drought potential amount precipitation minus requirement reached approximately 27 514 mm normalized drought potential amount i e gdpi showed a stable annual increasing trend with a slope of 0 066 yr p 0 01 from 2003 to 2016 which reflected the increasing inability of precipitation to meet the demand for maximum groundwater recharge and a worsening crisis of groundwater drought in the tmr 4 discussion our results demonstrated that the water resources in the tmr strikingly decreased during 2003 2016 as a result of the substantial declines of 21 82 mm yr in tws and 21 22 mm yr in gws which were equivalent to the annual losses of 2 79 109 m3 yr in tws and 2 71 109 m3 yr in gws respectively similarly feng et al 2013 reported a reduction of 22 mm yr in gws in the adjacent areas the north china plain of the tmr during 2003 2010 which was very close to 23 48 mm yr in our estimates of the gwsa fig a2 additionally the changing trend of jpl mascon derived twsas in this study was almost consistent with the results of zhao et al 2021 in the mu us sandyland of china adjacent to the tmr due to the missing data and scarcity of groundwater monitoring stations in the mountains we used limited groundwater burial depth data to test the reliability of gws changes in the tmr as a result the changes in groundwater burial depth at the six monitoring stations all showed decreasing linear trends fig a3 which was consistent with observed gws changes therefore the estimates of twsas and gwsas in this study area were relatively accurate specifically we noticed that the trend of gwsas had the same spatial heterogeneity as that of twsas which indicated that the tws decrease was most likely to result from gws decreases due to a 97 ratio of trend slopes in the gwsa vs twsa here the total trend slopes in the gwsa storm surface runoff anomaly baseflow groundwater runoff anomaly and soil moisture anomaly 0 1 m fig a4 were exactly equal to the trend slope of the twsa which further confirmed the above conclusion the driving mechanism of groundwater and external factors is complex and nonlinear and there are several main factors affecting groundwater changes a significant positive correlation between groundwater consumption and vegetation greening was found on china s loess plateau where the world s largest revegetation project the grain for green project was implemented with a high priority han et al 2020 shi et al 2021 human induced revegetation caused substantial surface water to be lost to the atmosphere by vegetation transpiration and indirectly resulted in reductions in water yield runoff soil moisture and lateral recharge guo and shen 2015b jia et al 2017 ge et al 2020 pei et al 2022 thus further shrinking the available surface water used for recharging groundwater regarding the tmr an ambitious revegetation project the taihang mountain forestry ecological project has lasted for 30 years cao et al 2018 and detectable vegetation greening in the tmr was observed consistently through three ndvi products fig a5 which indicated a remarkable impact of revegetation on water resources feng et al 2016 xie et al 2019 additionally decreased precipitation was proven to exacerbate groundwater depletion in the tmr before 2002 hu et al 2002 yet we found that precipitation was increasing at a rate of 1 47 mm yr p 0 73 in the tmr during the study period albeit slowly but its recharge to groundwater cannot completely reverse the increasingly significant trend of groundwater depletion caused by other factors additionally the measures of impounding surface runoff such as water reservoirs and dams reduced stream runoff and contributed to declines in gws because surface runoff was an important source of groundwater recharge zhang et al 2002 song et al 2007 specifically some studies have claimed that revegetation and irrigation reduced surface water but increased precipitation events that offset the water volume consumed by evapotranspiration which emphasized the positive feedbacks from revegetation and irrigation to precipitation li et al 2018 kang and eltahir 2019 that indirectly recharged groundwater to some extent overall these complex effects made it more uncertain to explain the impact of individual factors on groundwater changes here we divided these factors into two types i e climatic impacts and anthropogenic impacts and utilized the residual analysis method to quantify the relative contributions of these two factors to gws the results showed that human activities exerted a decisive role in gws change due to a contribution of 96 relative to that of climate change 4 this was mainly because the climate characterized the obvious seasonal trend and relatively stable changes in the tmr but gws continually decreased due to anthropogenic interference hence the climatic variability failed to follow the gws variability during the study period additionally we examined the correlation between gws and two climatic variables revealing a very low correlation among them table a2 hence the climate driven gwsa time series established by the residual analysis method hardly explained the observed gws changes in this region which indicated that gws reductions were primarily attributed to anthropogenic impacts regions where declines in gws could be explained by climatic factors were mainly distributed in the southeastern tmr which implied that local climatic conditions were not suitable for groundwater recovery climatic conditions in the regions where gws changes were explained only by anthropogenic factors were beneficial to regional groundwater recovery in table a2 we list the counties with a climatic contribution 5 and the corresponding trends of twsas and gwsas in the study period moreover decision making on groundwater management in these counties should be tailored to local climatic conditions and focus more on controlling climate driven groundwater decline groundwater recharge processes in the tmr include precipitation recharge direct recharge from mountain runoff and mountain lateral infiltration recharge precipitation recharge is the most important source and the present study showed that the recharge coefficient of precipitation to groundwater can reach up to 0 47 in the tmr song et al 2007 based on this we integrated the precipitation recharge factor into the assessment of groundwater drought to develop the gdpi and compared it with the previously proposed ggdi we found two periods before and after september 2008 when gws was in surplus and deficit states while eliminating groundwater seasonal variability respectively in these two periods the gdpi averages reached 0 13 and 0 48 respectively and the difference was statistically significant p 0 01 based on the variance analysis method hence the gdpi accurately distinguished between surplus and deficit states of deseasonalized gwsas as the ggdi did moreover different from the ggdi the gdpi pronouncedly smoothed the degree of groundwater drought especially in rainfall rich months a reasonable explanation was that abundant precipitation in summer months greatly recharged groundwater and reduced local farmer uses for groundwater in agricultural irrigation additionally groundwater changes often had a lag effect with precipitation changes and our proposed gdpi integrated the precipitation conditions into the groundwater drought assessment this has valuable application prospects in future groundwater drought monitoring by using existing precipitation data to project the future risk of groundwater drought specifically uncertainties in our analysis included the following grace failed to provide twsa data in some months and therefore we used a linear interpolation method to fill the missing monthly twsas which inevitably ignored seasonality of tws to a certain extent and will exert a potential impact on subsequent results furthermore it should be noted that the leakage of the grace mascon signals may also be a source of uncertainties and needs to be considered with caution in regional case studies due to the lack of groundwater field data in the entire tmr the validation of grace gwsas was therefore limited but we used auxiliary data gldas gwsas and the results in feng et al 2013 to demonstrate that our results were reliable field validation of groundwater table changes is worth implementing in the future additionally our evaluation of groundwater drought covered only 14 years whereas the definition of drought was often based on a long period of observations hayes et al 2011 as a result the gdpi will fluctuate depending on the length of the study period as will the ggdi and the latest grace and grace follow on data will be a solution for extending the study period furthermore the gdpi assumed a maximum potential for precipitation to be fully recharged to groundwater nevertheless the groundwater change budget in fact was highly uncertain and this warrants further study despite these uncertainties our study establishes a new understanding and perspective for reviewing groundwater dynamics and groundwater drought the results and methods used in our study can provide a reference for subsequent similar studies and practical decision making about groundwater sustainability goals 5 conclusion in this study we combined grace satellite data and gldas model data to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in twsas and gwsas in the tmr during 2003 2016 and used the residual analysis method to separate the relative contributions of human activities and climate change to gwsa changes furthermore we developed a new index the gdpi to estimate the potential of groundwater drought the major conclusions were summarized as follows grace derived twsas and gwsas in the tmr strikingly declined during 2003 2016 as a result of 21 82 mm yr p 0 01 and 21 22 mm yr p 0 01 respectively and twsa decreases resulted primarily from gwsa reductions due to a ratio of 97 values of twsas from three grace products showed high correlations 0 95 and small root mean square errors 35 39 mm in the tmr grace derived gwsa changes were reliable as a result of the correlation r 0 89 with gldas derived gwsas human activities such as revegetation damming and agricultural irrigation exerted the dominant roles in gwsa decreases with a human induced contribution rate of 96 relative to that of climate change 4 climatic conditions appeared to be disadvantageous to groundwater recovery in the southeastern area of the tmr to which stricter measures of groundwater management and more attention should be given groundwater in the tmr experienced a special period when the gwsa state without climatic variability shifted from surplus to deficit before and after september 2008 respectively additionally our proposed gdpi also captured the characteristics of groundwater drought as the ggdi did since the maximum recharge potential of precipitation was considered for groundwater the gdpi largely compromised the degree of groundwater depletion in rainfall rich months which reflected that precipitation greatly exceeded groundwater recharge requirements it not only emphasized the degree of gws deficits but also reflected the potential of groundwater recovery and the integration of precipitation enables the projection of the future risk of groundwater drought in general this study thoroughly revealed an increasingly serious groundwater scarcity crisis that must be addressed urgently by the water management sector in the tmr the established new groundwater drought index diversifies grace application and offers new insight into mountain

2976,the taihang mountain region tmr of china is an important headwater area that provides substantial water resources supporting the social and ecological stability of the north china plain currently groundwater resources in the tmr are rapidly declining but the degree of groundwater storage gws depletion and the driving mechanism of groundwater drought remain poorly understood this study combined the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and global land data assimilation system gldas datasets to thoroughly analyze gws changes in the tmr and the dominant driving factors during 2003 2016 in addition a new index the groundwater drought potential index gdpi was established to quantify the potential of groundwater drought we found that grace derived terrestrial water storage in the tmr experienced a significant reduction 21 82 mm yr p 0 01 during 2003 2016 with a similar reduction in gws 21 22 mm yr p 0 01 human induced impacts exerted a decisive role in gws decreases in this region with a relative contribution rate of 96 compared to the climatic contribution 4 climatic impacts on gws were primarily observed in the southeastern tmr where climate change appeared to be unbeneficial to groundwater recovery and exacerbated local groundwater depletion specifically the groundwater drought potential was entirely increasing indicating a worsened climate condition that precipitation increasingly failed to fill the groundwater deficit actions should be taken urgently to address the local groundwater crisis and to maintain water security our proposed gdpi not only reflected the degree of groundwater depletion but also revealed the relationship between groundwater drought and precipitation making the index capable of being applied in drought forecasting this study delivers a new perspective to better understand the mechanisms of gws change and groundwater drought and the results are expected to provide a valuable reference for groundwater management and water sustainability goals keywords grace gldas groundwater drought terrestrial water storage taihang mountain region 1 introduction global water resources are currently facing unprecedented challenges as water land food coupled systems tend to become unsustainable fao 2021 at least four billion people have been suffering severe water scarcity globally mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water shortages have become an urgent issue to be addressed for human welfare worldwide it was estimated that the earth s freshwater totals 35 million km3 kang 2014 most of which is invisible and is stored as groundwater beneath the land surface famiglietti and ferguson 2021 groundwater accounts for approximately 1 3 of the total available freshwater globally and is becoming increasingly essential for agricultural irrigation domestic drinking and industrial production döll et al 2012 wada 2016 in addition to offering great benefits to human beings groundwater also exerts a vital role in regulating the hydrological cycle runoff recharge and precipitation storage and sustaining ecosystem stability vegetation greening and wetland protection especially in water limited arid or semiarid regions han et al 2020 taylor et al 2013 due to groundwater s slower response to meteorological changes compared with near surface water elements the recovery of groundwater depletion without external disturbances usually requires months and even a million or more years in various aquifers sturchio et al 2004 rodell et al 2009 excessive groundwater depletion not only makes groundwater use unsustainable but also results in a series of eco environmental problems such as land subsidence and groundwater drought feng et al 2013 faunt et al 2016 consequently accurate detection and knowledge of groundwater dynamics is a linchpin for protecting and managing groundwater and maintaining ecological security traditionally groundwater is monitored mainly via in situ well observations which are more suitable for detecting short term and small scale groundwater changes owing to limitations of spatial and temporal gaps and cost xie et al 2018 although climate driven land surface models can overcome the drawbacks of well observations and competently simulate continuous and large scale groundwater changes li and rodell 2015 cao et al 2019 these models are always involved in a degree of simplification of hydrological processes and lead to some empirical parameters and imprecise meteorological data introducing great uncertainties into estimates of groundwater storage gws van dijk et al 2014 soltani et al 2021 in recent decades satellite remote sensing based observations have prevailed as an effective and powerful tool for monitoring groundwater variations particularly launched in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission enables the monthly and global detection of gravity anomalies with unprecedented precision tapley et al 2004 and terrestrial water storage tws information can be retrieved from the detected grace signal where tws is mainly composed of surface waters soil moisture ice snow and groundwater accordingly groundwater changes are capable of being isolated from tws changes by using auxiliary data e g in situ measurements or land surface models to remove other components of tws rodell et al 2007 finally forming a reliable groundwater time series dataset grace based observations promote a better knowledge and understanding of terrestrial water resources and have been widely applied in climatology ecology hydrology and geography recent studies on grace groundwater have focused more on revealing the factors of gws changes rodell et al 2018 long et al 2020 and evaluating grace related climate extremes pokhrel et al 2021 tapley et al 2019 regarding human activity impacts on gws variations studies have reported that anthropogenic revegetation and coal mining pronouncedly accelerated gws consumption and led to groundwater depletion at regional scales xie et al 2018 xie et al 2019 han et al 2020 additionally human overuse of groundwater for agricultural irrigation exerted a negative impact on terrestrial water resources especially in several groundwater depletion hotspot regions worldwide such as the indo gangetic plain rodell et al 2009 north china plain feng et al 2013 guo and shen 2015a b us high plains and california central valley scanlon et al 2012 notably human activities did not always play a negative role in gws some positive human interventions are beneficial to gws recovery for example china s south to north water diversion project yang et al 2022 and the national policies to strictly limit groundwater withdrawal on the north china plain causing the local groundwater table to almost stop declining and to start to rise in comparison to anthropogenic factors climate change has a more profound impact on groundwater amount and redistribution for instance climate fluxes precipitation and evapotranspiration directly determine the amount of remaining water used for groundwater recharge taylor et al 2013 climate related teleconnection factors such as the arctic oscillation ao and el niño southern oscillation are capable of significantly altering the spatiotemporal pattern of water storage han et al 2019 despite increasing discussions of gws and its individual factors few attempts have been made to interpret the impacts of anthropogenic and climatic factors on gws changes a clear understanding of which factor dominates gws changes will assist in largely improving water resource management and understanding groundwater operation mechanisms if the gws in a given period is lower than the historical average level the deficit represents a groundwater drought state groundwater depletion under arid climatic conditions easily evolves into groundwater drought due to a lack of timely groundwater recharge which seriously disrupts the balance of groundwater recharge and discharge van lanen and peters 2000 previous studies have proposed groundwater drought indices and have applied them to discern and monitor groundwater drought thomas et al 2014 li and rodell 2015 goodarzi et al 2016 thomas et al 2017 nevertheless the indices were designed to simply reflect the degree of groundwater deficit in terms of gws and seldom considered other drought related factors different types of droughts including meteorological hydrological agricultural and groundwater droughts are almost all relevant to precipitation shortfalls van lanen and peters 2000 integrating multiple factors such as precipitation into an evaluation system and establishing a comprehensive groundwater drought indicator are crucial for accurate drought forecasting and groundwater management this study chose the taihang mountain region hereafter tmr of china as the study area in view of its geographic importance and ecological vulnerability the tmr is a natural ecological barrier and important headwater of the north china plain from which 60 of the rivers on the plain originate the mountains annually supplied approximately 3 6 billion m3 of water to the plain in the form of runoff and lateral groundwater recharge song et al 2007 liu et al 2019 equivalent to 37 of groundwater withdrawals 9 7 billion m3 on the north china plain in 2019 exerting a critical role in the water supply for a long time the agricultural development in the tmr and the piedmont plain relied highly on groundwater overexploitation combined with other high intensity human activities e g damming and revegetation upstream and therefore have severely reduced available water resources that could have been supplied downstream and the plains monitoring data showed that the surface runoff in the mountains was continuously declining du et al 2019 with available water to the plains decreasing thus causing an increasingly serious threat to agricultural outputs on the north china plain and to national food security at present the assessment of spatiotemporal change in gws and its driving mechanisms in the tmr still remain poorly understood the aims of this study are therefore to 1 reveal gws dynamics in the tmr in combination with satellite and model based observations to provide clear knowledge of water resource dynamics 2 separate the relative contributions of climate and anthropogenic activities to gws changes to better explain the driving mechanisms of groundwater change and 3 establish a new index to comprehensively evaluate groundwater drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tmr 110 10 e 114 30 e 34 30 n 40 40 n is located on the eastern border of the loess plateau of china bordering the north china plain and the shanxi plateau to the east and west respectively its total area reaches approximately 1 28 105 km2 covering 101 counties and partial regions of shanxi province henan province hebei province and beijing city of china with an elevation range of 37 3061 m fig 1 according to the statistical data the annual values of precipitation average temperature and crop reference evapotranspiration were 521 mm 3 0 mm yr p 0 23 10 3 c 0 07 c yr p 0 07 and 885 mm 0 88 mm yr p 0 25 respectively in the last 20 years and this area is characterized by a typical temperate monsoon climate approximately 68 of the total tmr is within the haihe river basin where agricultural irrigation has contributed to detectable groundwater depletion e g the groundwater level at the luancheng station on the piedmont plain continuously decreased from 12 m to 45 m during 1974 2017 increased evapotranspiration in the tmr further reduced water yield and lateral groundwater recharge flowing into the plains guo and shen 2015b therefore an assessment of gws changes and their driving mechanisms must be conducted urgently to address the water scarcity crisis in the tmr 2 2 data source and preprocessing grace gravity field solutions include spherical harmonic solutions and mass concentration mascon solutions whose data are provided by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl center for space research csr at the university of texas and goddard space flight center gsfc previous analysis pointed out that mascon decreases leakage errors from land to ocean and has a superior performance compared to traditional spherical harmonic solutions scanlon et al 2016 this study chose csr grace rl06 v02 mascon data https www2 csr utexas edu grace to acquire monthly tws anomalies twsa from january 2002 to december 2016 with a higher spatial resolution because the spatial resolution of csr data is the highest compared to other grace products and is the same as our land surface water data additionally the 0 5 spatial resolution of gsfc grace rl06 v02 mascon data https earth gsfc nasa

data points in two mascon products were filled by the linear interpolation method based on neighboring months detailed information about the mascon solution can be found in the studies of save et al 2016 and save 2020 global land data assimilation system gldas datasets rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 provide four land surface models i e mosaic noah community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model https disc gsfc nasa gov gldas they have been proven to have good accuracy and can be used for the comparison of grace data wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 this study chose the gldas noah 2 1 dataset with a 0 25 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution to calculate land surface water storage compared to the other three models soil moisture from the noah dataset was found to have a higher correlation with grace tws long et al 2014 gldas derived surface water is composed of a total of storm surface runoff baseflow groundwater runoff and soil moisture at depths of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm in the soil layers here we did not consider the snow depth water equivalent plant canopy surface water and soil moisture at depths of 100 200 cm in the surface water in the tmr this is because the snow depth water equivalent is very low in the tmr therefore it can almost be ignored in surface water plant canopy surface water will be completely evaporated on a monthly scale additionally the soil thickness is usually shallower in mountainous areas than in plain areas and therefore we used soil moisture only at a depth of 0 1 m in the calculation of gldas surface water extra gws data were from gldas catchment land surface models that have a 0 25 daily resolution li et al 2019 2020 which was used to verify grace derived gws similar to the processing of grace twsa all anomaly values in this study were converted by subtracting the original average from january 2004 to december 2009 the data including groundwater burial depth were

storage here we ignored the impact of surface water reservoirs on tws as the water storage of major water reservoirs in the tmr and surrounding areas was nearly utilized for municipal and industrial uses and had a small impact on long term tws change feng et al 2013 moreover we verified the reliability of the calculated grace gwsa by comparing the gldas gwsa the calculation of the grace derived gwsa is as follows 1 gwsa t w s a l w s a where gwsa is the grace derived gwsa twsa is the grace derived twsa and lwsa denotes the gldas derived land surface water storage anomaly including the storm surface runoff anomaly baseflow groundwater runoff anomaly and soil moisture anomaly at a depth of 0 1 m 2 3 2 quantifying the relative contributions of climate and human activities to gwsa changes to quantify climatic and anthropogenic impacts on gws changes we used the residual analysis method to calculate the relative contributions of these two factors to the gwsa residual analysis is commonly used in the attribution of vegetation changes sun et al 2015 pei et al 2021 and it is capable of separating anthropogenic and climatic impacts on one variable the principle of residual analysis is to establish one climate driven variable time series using climatic data and then suppose the residual of the observed variable and established variable as a human driven variable time series here a multiple regression model was established by the gwsa and climatic variable precipitation and temperature anomalies we considered precipitation and temperature as the main climatic factors because most climate driven water storage anomalies can be reconstructed by precipitation and temperature humphrey et al 2017 liu et al 2021 first we used the adjacent pixel method to resample gwsa raster data to a 1 km spatial resolution that coincides with the climate raster data by which each raster was divided into many small grids but these raster values were constant the aim was to meet the condition in which the spatial resolutions of the grids from different datasets were the same to successfully conduct the residual analysis then we used monthly precipitation anomalies and temperature anomalies to fit the monthly grace gwsa at a grid scale using matlab software and fitting values reconstructed monthly gwsas were identified as climate driven gwsa time series moreover the residuals of the fitting equation monthly original gwsa minus reconstructed monthly gwsa were assumed to be human activity driven gwsa changes i e nonclimatic impacts because gws changes can usually be attributed to human and climate induced consequences here we estimated the linear slopes of the original climate driven and human activity driven gwsa time series climatic and anthropogenic relative contributions to gwsa changes were expressed as the ratios of linear slopes of climate driven and human activity driven gwsas to the original gwsa calculated by equation 1 respectively a detailed quantification definition can be found in table 1 the equations are as follows 2 gws a cc a p b t 3 gws a ac g w s a or g w s a cc where gwsacc gwsaac and gwsaor denote the monthly climate driven gwsa human activity driven gwsa and the original gwsa respectively p and t denote the monthly precipitation anomaly and temperature anomaly respectively a and b are both regression coefficients estimated by the matlab tool at a raster scale and they are combined with the monthly p anomaly and t anomaly to reconstruct the climate driven gwsa time series by fitting equation 3 additionally the approach to defining the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to the gwsa is displayed as follows 2 3 3 developing a groundwater drought index groundwater drought is a special drought type that manifests itself as follows groundwater recharge first decreases and then gws and discharge decline previous studies have defined and applied groundwater drought indices which widely build on the normalized values of deseasonalized gwsas thomas et al 2014 li and rodell 2015 thomas et al 2017 whereas the index only represented the degree of gws deficit and failed to describe the internal relationship between gws and precipitation as the flood potential index did based on previous studies reager and famiglietti 2009 thomas et al 2017 we established a groundwater drought potential index gdpi and its role is to integrate precipitation into the evaluation of groundwater drought and to reassess the drought potential of groundwater the gdpi is similar with the groundwater recharge drought index proposed by goodarzi et al 2016 and it does not focus on the actual groundwater recharge but the relationship between precipitation and gws first we deseasonalized grace derived gwsas in a given month by subtracting the average of all gwsas in this month during the study period whose aim was to acquire continuous gwsa time series without seasonal variability for the deseasonalized gwsa time series the historical maximum was set to the optimal gws status we assumed the difference between the monthly deseasonalized gwsas and the deseasonalized gwsa maximum as the highest groundwater charge demand which reflected the amount of recharge needed to restore groundwater drought to its optimal status monthly precipitation was regarded as a source of recharge to judge if the highest groundwater requirement could be met by precipitation if precipitation was greater than the highest groundwater recharge demand the drought potential for groundwater was almost zero which meant that groundwater drought was unlikely to occur conversely the less precipitation compared with the demand the lower the potential for groundwater recovery to the optimum level and the higher the likelihood of groundwater drought in short the gdpi indicates the possibility of groundwater drought and it is determined by whether precipitation exceeds the groundwater charge requirement and makes the gwsas recover to the historical maximum level the gdpi aims to standardize the drought potential amount and quantify the probability of groundwater drought the detailed processes were as follows 1 deseasonalized gwsa 4 gws a deseasonalized g w s a 1 n g w s a i w h e r e i 1 2 3 12 where gwsadeseasonalized is the monthly deseasonalized gwsa i and n denotes the length of the total years of the study period for example the deseasonalized gwsa in january of a given year is equal to the original gwsa in january of that year minus the average of all gwsas in january during the 2003 2016 period 2 calculating the highest groundwater charge demand the gdpi was estimated from gwsadeseasonalized and precipitation by adjusting the approach of reager and famiglietti 2009 here the highest groundwater charge demand in each month was described as follows 5 gwc d t max gws a deseasonalized t g w s a deseasonalized t where gwcdt is the highest groundwater charge demand in month t and represents the amount of water needed to restore the monthly gwsa to the historically optimal level gwsadeseasonalized t is the deseasonalized gwsa in month t 3 determining if the highest groundwater charge demand can be met by precipitation here we presumed that precipitation would always follow a stored fullrunoff pattern and therefore precipitation was regarded as the optimal potential of groundwater recharge to determine whether the optimal charge potential can exceed the highest charge demand in a given month the drought potential amount was created as follows 6 dp a t p t g w c d t where dpat is the drought potential amount in month t and pt is precipitation in month t if dpat is 0 there is almost no potential for the occurrence of groundwater drought if dpat is 0 and when dpat is larger the potential for groundwater drought is higher and precipitation is smaller relative to the groundwater recharge demand 4 standardizing the drought potential amount to obtain the gdpi finally the gdpi was normalized based on dpat by the following equation 7 gdp i t dp a t min dp a t where gdpit is grace derived gdpi in month t if gdpi is 0 and the closer the gdpi is to 1 in a given month the smaller the precipitation relative to groundwater charge demand and the larger the groundwater depletion which is also more likely to cause groundwater drought conversely when the gdpi is 0 in a given month there is almost no potential for groundwater drought to occur as precipitation conditions have sufficient potential to restore groundwater to a historically optimal state 2 4 sen s slope and mann kendall m k significance test sen s slope sen 1968 is a nonparametric and robust statistical approach for calculating the trend of time series variables it is insensitive to missing data but requires variables to be mutually independent sen s slope approach has a powerful performance for trend accuracy and outlier resistance here we used sen s slope method to calculate the trends of grace derived gwsa changes at a raster scale as follows 8 slope m e d i a n v m v n m n where vm and vn denote the time series variable v in months m and n respectively when slope 0 v is at an uptrend in a given period otherwise its change follows a declining trend the m k test is a nonparametric statistical test of variable trend capable of measuring the significance of time series data mann 1945 kendall 1975 the m k test does not need time series variables to obey certain distributions and is also not disturbed by outliers here we utilized the m k test to judge the significance of the gwsa trend at a grid scale the calculation process of the m k significance test is as follows 9 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n v j v i 10 s g n v j v i 1 v j v i 0 0 v j v i 0 1 v j v i 0 11 s s n n 1 2

z statistic value if n 10 and if z u 1 α 2 the trend of v changes is statistically significant at the confidence level of α in this study α 0 05 is used as the acceptable significance level 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal changes in twsa and gwsa the changes in twsas based on grace and gldas are depicted in fig 2 the correlations among the csr grace derived jpl grace derived and gsfc grace derived data were 0 95 with a range of root mean square error within 35 39 mm indicating the high credibility of grace products the results of each grace product entirely exhibits a declining trend from january 2003 to december 2016 during which a continuous upward trend occurred in 2003 specifically the jpl grace derived twsa decreased at a speed of 24 49 mm yr p 0 01 and the csr grace derived twsa also showed a statistically significant decline at a speed of 21 82 mm yr p 0 01 the historical maximum december 2003 and minimum june 2016 of the csr grace twsa reached 189 54 mm and 314 30 mm respectively representing a large decrease of 504 mm spatially the declining trends of the csr grace twsa ranged from 4 91 mm yr to 45 05 mm yr and the trends in the whole study area passed the m k statistical significance test with a 95 confidence level the regions with rapid slow decreases in twsas were primarily distributed in the southeastern northern area of the tmr and adjacent areas fig a1 isolated from the gldas derived land surface water storage anomaly the csr grace derived gwsa changes in the tmr are shown in fig 2c gldas gwsas have a strongly positive correlation with grace gwsas as a result of the correlation coefficient of 0 89 with the root mean square error of 71 mm from 2003 to 2016 grace gwsas in the tmr significantly decreased with a downward trend of 21 22 mm yr p 0 01 which was much higher than that of gldas gwsas 9 06 mm yr p 0 01 the historical maximum 134 83 mm and minimum 338 27 mm of grace gwsas occurred in january 2004 and december 2016 similar to gldas gwsas respectively with a decrease of almost 473 10 mm in terms of the raster scale shown in fig 2a sen s slope of the grace gwsa trend ranged from 2 96 mm yr to 43 86 mm yr and the trend in each grid passed the m k significance test at a confidence level of 95 which indicates that the gws in any given area in the tmr was statistically pronouncedly decreasing in the study period a significant groundwater depletion rate was observed mainly in the southeastern area of the tmr which was close to the piedmont plain a typically irrigated agricultural area on the north china plain due to groundwater over exploitation in the plains the considerable lateral recharge flowing from the mountains to the plains led to a serious groundwater shortage in the southeastern area of the tmr 3 2 multiscale characteristics of the gwsa fig 3 a depicts the monthly gwsa changes in the tmr during 2003 2016 in which we found that the gws in each month was decreasing year by year significant gws declines were increasingly concentrated in the middle of the year and gws within one year gradually tended to fluctuate extremely indicating decreased and unstable water resources in the tmr an obvious change in the gws reduction appeared in january 2009 and from then on the dry season began to come earlier than usual in terms of seasonal variations the gws in spring and summer decreased pronouncedly and the water storage failed to increase with the beginning of the rainy season this is an evident indication that spring drought started to frequently occur in the tmr thus exerting a strongly passive role in early spring sowing and crop outputs the interannual gws showed a continually decreasing trend with a high correlation with the trend of the gws in december each year indicating a final redistribution of the annual water cycle it is virtually certain that the persistence and intensity of groundwater drought increased continuously in the tmr and the local water scarcity was becoming frequent and severe as a result of the joint consequences of human activities and climate change 3 3 relative contributions of drivers to the gwsa trend fig 4 a and fig 4b spatially visualize the relative contributions of human activities and climate change to the grace gwsa trend in the tmr during 2003 2006 respectively due to the reductions in gws in the whole study area human activities and climate change both had negative impacts on gwsas in the study period the anthropogenic contribution rates of gwsa decreases in every raster reached at least 84 overall averaging 96 the climatic contribution rates ranged from 0 15 64 and the average contribution rate was approximately 4 fig 4c gwsa decreases driven only by human activities were mainly distributed in the northern and southwestern corner of the tmr with an area of 50 000 km2 where climate change had hardly dominated gwsa changes compared to anthropogenic impacts other regions with gwsa reductions were dominated jointly by human activities and climate change covering 61 of the tmr fig 4d specifically climatic factors failed to independently explain gwsa reductions in the whole tmr and hence human induced impacts exerted a decisive role in groundwater depletion in the tmr during 2003 2016 3 4 establishment of the gdpi and its comparison with the ggdi gws deficits and surpluses bounded by 0 were distinguished by the deseasonalized gwsa through monthly gwsas minus the average of all gwsas of a given month in the study period fig 5 a 5b after removing seasonal variability in gwsa time series the deseasonalized gwsa denotes the net deviation of gwsas relative to seasonal variability thomas et al 2017 we found that gwsas in the tmr maintained a surplus status from april 2003 to september 2008 and then deficit status lasted until the end of the study period except for a few months the state of groundwater drought lasted from october 2008 to december 2016 in the tmr and was most likely to continue to deteriorate in the future the monthly maximum surplus december 2004 and deficit december 2016 were approximately 202 94 mm and 255 20 mm respectively representing the highest decrease 491 14 mm without seasonal variability in the historical gws records of the tmr the difference between the deseasonalized monthly gwsa and its historical maximum was the highest recharge requirement for gws in a given month and precipitation could be fully recharged to groundwater under ideal conditions fig 5c shows temporal changes in the groundwater recharge requirement gray bar and available groundwater recharge amount i e precipitation blue bar the recharge requirements were entirely increased at a rate of 21 15 mm yr p 0 01 and there were only 10 months out of 168 months in which precipitation exceeded groundwater recharge requirements we found that the groundwater recharge requirement was often reduced to a certain extent after strong precipitation events e g in july 2012 and july 2013 but after 2014 the reduction almost disappeared during the rainy season in dry years when yearly precipitation was less than the normal levels the groundwater drought could not be mitigated and conversely continued to worsen especially in 2014 2015 after the strong precipitation input in july 2016 the groundwater recharge requirement seemed not to decrease significantly as before indicating an increasingly severe groundwater drought crisis in this region the differences in precipitation minus the groundwater recharge requirement were normalized as the gdpi and are depicted in fig 5d including a previously proposed grace groundwater drought index ggdi from thomas et al 2017 the gdpi captured well the characteristics of groundwater depletion of the ggdi as a result of a strong correlation r 0 89 with the ggdi which indicated that the lower the ggdi was i e the greater the groundwater deficit the higher the gdpi and the higher the potential of groundwater drought occurrence meanwhile the gdpi considers the role of precipitation in groundwater recharge thus compromising the degree of groundwater drought reflected by the ggdi in some rainfall rich months such as july 2012 july 2013 september 2014 august 2015 and july 2016 compared to the ggdi the gdpi exhibited a kind of seasonal characteristic due to the integration of precipitation and highlighted the high potential of groundwater drought in dry years it not only represents the degree of groundwater deficit but also reflects the relative relationship between gws and precipitation offering a more valuable reference for future drought monitoring in terms of annual scale table 2 accumulated annual gws surpluses and deficits ranged from 388 64 1 965 47 mm in 2003 2008 and 294 45 mm 1 987 09 mm in 2009 2016 respectively the annual water volume to meet the highest groundwater recharge requirement increased from 539 83 mm in 2004 to 4 492 38 mm in 2016 with a total accumulated water requirement of 35 074 09 mm during 2003 2016 a factor of 3 32 to total accumulated precipitation in the same period and the increase rate of groundwater recharge requirement 255 13 mm yr p 0 01 was 173 times higher than that of precipitation 1 47 mm yr p 0 73 accordingly total drought potential amount precipitation minus requirement reached approximately 27 514 mm normalized drought potential amount i e gdpi showed a stable annual increasing trend with a slope of 0 066 yr p 0 01 from 2003 to 2016 which reflected the increasing inability of precipitation to meet the demand for maximum groundwater recharge and a worsening crisis of groundwater drought in the tmr 4 discussion our results demonstrated that the water resources in the tmr strikingly decreased during 2003 2016 as a result of the substantial declines of 21 82 mm yr in tws and 21 22 mm yr in gws which were equivalent to the annual losses of 2 79 109 m3 yr in tws and 2 71 109 m3 yr in gws respectively similarly feng et al 2013 reported a reduction of 22 mm yr in gws in the adjacent areas the north china plain of the tmr during 2003 2010 which was very close to 23 48 mm yr in our estimates of the gwsa fig a2 additionally the changing trend of jpl mascon derived twsas in this study was almost consistent with the results of zhao et al 2021 in the mu us sandyland of china adjacent to the tmr due to the missing data and scarcity of groundwater monitoring stations in the mountains we used limited groundwater burial depth data to test the reliability of gws changes in the tmr as a result the changes in groundwater burial depth at the six monitoring stations all showed decreasing linear trends fig a3 which was consistent with observed gws changes therefore the estimates of twsas and gwsas in this study area were relatively accurate specifically we noticed that the trend of gwsas had the same spatial heterogeneity as that of twsas which indicated that the tws decrease was most likely to result from gws decreases due to a 97 ratio of trend slopes in the gwsa vs twsa here the total trend slopes in the gwsa storm surface runoff anomaly baseflow groundwater runoff anomaly and soil moisture anomaly 0 1 m fig a4 were exactly equal to the trend slope of the twsa which further confirmed the above conclusion the driving mechanism of groundwater and external factors is complex and nonlinear and there are several main factors affecting groundwater changes a significant positive correlation between groundwater consumption and vegetation greening was found on china s loess plateau where the world s largest revegetation project the grain for green project was implemented with a high priority han et al 2020 shi et al 2021 human induced revegetation caused substantial surface water to be lost to the atmosphere by vegetation transpiration and indirectly resulted in reductions in water yield runoff soil moisture and lateral recharge guo and shen 2015b jia et al 2017 ge et al 2020 pei et al 2022 thus further shrinking the available surface water used for recharging groundwater regarding the tmr an ambitious revegetation project the taihang mountain forestry ecological project has lasted for 30 years cao et al 2018 and detectable vegetation greening in the tmr was observed consistently through three ndvi products fig a5 which indicated a remarkable impact of revegetation on water resources feng et al 2016 xie et al 2019 additionally decreased precipitation was proven to exacerbate groundwater depletion in the tmr before 2002 hu et al 2002 yet we found that precipitation was increasing at a rate of 1 47 mm yr p 0 73 in the tmr during the study period albeit slowly but its recharge to groundwater cannot completely reverse the increasingly significant trend of groundwater depletion caused by other factors additionally the measures of impounding surface runoff such as water reservoirs and dams reduced stream runoff and contributed to declines in gws because surface runoff was an important source of groundwater recharge zhang et al 2002 song et al 2007 specifically some studies have claimed that revegetation and irrigation reduced surface water but increased precipitation events that offset the water volume consumed by evapotranspiration which emphasized the positive feedbacks from revegetation and irrigation to precipitation li et al 2018 kang and eltahir 2019 that indirectly recharged groundwater to some extent overall these complex effects made it more uncertain to explain the impact of individual factors on groundwater changes here we divided these factors into two types i e climatic impacts and anthropogenic impacts and utilized the residual analysis method to quantify the relative contributions of these two factors to gws the results showed that human activities exerted a decisive role in gws change due to a contribution of 96 relative to that of climate change 4 this was mainly because the climate characterized the obvious seasonal trend and relatively stable changes in the tmr but gws continually decreased due to anthropogenic interference hence the climatic variability failed to follow the gws variability during the study period additionally we examined the correlation between gws and two climatic variables revealing a very low correlation among them table a2 hence the climate driven gwsa time series established by the residual analysis method hardly explained the observed gws changes in this region which indicated that gws reductions were primarily attributed to anthropogenic impacts regions where declines in gws could be explained by climatic factors were mainly distributed in the southeastern tmr which implied that local climatic conditions were not suitable for groundwater recovery climatic conditions in the regions where gws changes were explained only by anthropogenic factors were beneficial to regional groundwater recovery in table a2 we list the counties with a climatic contribution 5 and the corresponding trends of twsas and gwsas in the study period moreover decision making on groundwater management in these counties should be tailored to local climatic conditions and focus more on controlling climate driven groundwater decline groundwater recharge processes in the tmr include precipitation recharge direct recharge from mountain runoff and mountain lateral infiltration recharge precipitation recharge is the most important source and the present study showed that the recharge coefficient of precipitation to groundwater can reach up to 0 47 in the tmr song et al 2007 based on this we integrated the precipitation recharge factor into the assessment of groundwater drought to develop the gdpi and compared it with the previously proposed ggdi we found two periods before and after september 2008 when gws was in surplus and deficit states while eliminating groundwater seasonal variability respectively in these two periods the gdpi averages reached 0 13 and 0 48 respectively and the difference was statistically significant p 0 01 based on the variance analysis method hence the gdpi accurately distinguished between surplus and deficit states of deseasonalized gwsas as the ggdi did moreover different from the ggdi the gdpi pronouncedly smoothed the degree of groundwater drought especially in rainfall rich months a reasonable explanation was that abundant precipitation in summer months greatly recharged groundwater and reduced local farmer uses for groundwater in agricultural irrigation additionally groundwater changes often had a lag effect with precipitation changes and our proposed gdpi integrated the precipitation conditions into the groundwater drought assessment this has valuable application prospects in future groundwater drought monitoring by using existing precipitation data to project the future risk of groundwater drought specifically uncertainties in our analysis included the following grace failed to provide twsa data in some months and therefore we used a linear interpolation method to fill the missing monthly twsas which inevitably ignored seasonality of tws to a certain extent and will exert a potential impact on subsequent results furthermore it should be noted that the leakage of the grace mascon signals may also be a source of uncertainties and needs to be considered with caution in regional case studies due to the lack of groundwater field data in the entire tmr the validation of grace gwsas was therefore limited but we used auxiliary data gldas gwsas and the results in feng et al 2013 to demonstrate that our results were reliable field validation of groundwater table changes is worth implementing in the future additionally our evaluation of groundwater drought covered only 14 years whereas the definition of drought was often based on a long period of observations hayes et al 2011 as a result the gdpi will fluctuate depending on the length of the study period as will the ggdi and the latest grace and grace follow on data will be a solution for extending the study period furthermore the gdpi assumed a maximum potential for precipitation to be fully recharged to groundwater nevertheless the groundwater change budget in fact was highly uncertain and this warrants further study despite these uncertainties our study establishes a new understanding and perspective for reviewing groundwater dynamics and groundwater drought the results and methods used in our study can provide a reference for subsequent similar studies and practical decision making about groundwater sustainability goals 5 conclusion in this study we combined grace satellite data and gldas model data to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in twsas and gwsas in the tmr during 2003 2016 and used the residual analysis method to separate the relative contributions of human activities and climate change to gwsa changes furthermore we developed a new index the gdpi to estimate the potential of groundwater drought the major conclusions were summarized as follows grace derived twsas and gwsas in the tmr strikingly declined during 2003 2016 as a result of 21 82 mm yr p 0 01 and 21 22 mm yr p 0 01 respectively and twsa decreases resulted primarily from gwsa reductions due to a ratio of 97 values of twsas from three grace products showed high correlations 0 95 and small root mean square errors 35 39 mm in the tmr grace derived gwsa changes were reliable as a result of the correlation r 0 89 with gldas derived gwsas human activities such as revegetation damming and agricultural irrigation exerted the dominant roles in gwsa decreases with a human induced contribution rate of 96 relative to that of climate change 4 climatic conditions appeared to be disadvantageous to groundwater recovery in the southeastern area of the tmr to which stricter measures of groundwater management and more attention should be given groundwater in the tmr experienced a special period when the gwsa state without climatic variability shifted from surplus to deficit before and after september 2008 respectively additionally our proposed gdpi also captured the characteristics of groundwater drought as the ggdi did since the maximum recharge potential of precipitation was considered for groundwater the gdpi largely compromised the degree of groundwater depletion in rainfall rich months which reflected that precipitation greatly exceeded groundwater recharge requirements it not only emphasized the degree of gws deficits but also reflected the potential of groundwater recovery and the integration of precipitation enables the projection of the future risk of groundwater drought in general this study thoroughly revealed an increasingly serious groundwater scarcity crisis that must be addressed urgently by the water management sector in the tmr the established new groundwater drought index diversifies grace application and offers new insight into mountain

2977,in the arid endorheic lake basin with highly developed agriculture water scarcity drives the nexus of water environment agriculture wea while potential evapotranspiration etp is a critical element linking basin scale irrigation water demand and agro economic development the study proposes a satellite remote sensing data driven multi objective simulation optimization so framework to implement the basin scale wea nexus management the hydrological model modflow nwt combined with the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer based etp estimation with a 500 m spatial resolution simulates the monthly surface water sw and groundwater gw irrigation practices then the multi objective evolutionary algorithm ε moma is applied to solve management model which includes maximization of agro economic benefit and environmental flow and minimization of environmental risk of total nitrogen loading subject to irrigation water demand land availability and food supply the so framework is validated in an arid endorheic lake basin with intensive agricultural irrigation in northwestern china the four dimensional pareto optimal solutions are achieved to optimize crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation in order to avoid cognitive myopia triggered by low dimensional or single objective optimization the results highlight the trade off among the high value crop planting sw gw irrigation and environmental flows and indicating that lowering nitrogen loading is more sensitive to agro economic benefit historical maximum and minimum etp scenarios are tailored to quantify the impact of etp change on wea nexus management results show the increasing etp has a great negative effect on the environmental flow objectives therefore how multi sectoral interests change depending on the basin wide development goals may be difficult to regulate due to complex wea nexus and associated deep uncertainty in the future keywords evapotranspiration satellite remote sensing water environment agriculture nexus endorheic lake basin multi objective optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater gw and surface water sw resources worldwide are increasingly being stressed due to the growing populations rapid agriculture development and climate change gorelick et al 2020 sun et al 2018 ye et al 2018 tolley et al 2019 ipcc 2014 especially in the arid endorheic lake basins water scarcity drives the nexus of water resources agriculture and environment while conflicts with the basin development goals e g expanding the irrigated agriculture and minimizing the environmental risks including substantial loss of groundwater storages or declining terminal lake level which jeopardizes the balance of fragile ecosystems xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2021c in order to achieve sustainable development goals sdgs the nexus alike frameworks have been proposed for the management of sw and gw in the arid and semi arid regions sun et al 2018 zeff et al 2021 shi et al 2021 niu et al 2019 these applications demonstrate that understanding multi dimensional nexus interlinkages and trade offs across multi sectors is of critical importance to achieve basin scale sdgs and to offer a win win strategy the water environment agriculture wea nexus is a critical interlinkage across multi sectors for highly developed irrigated agriculture in the arid regions niu et al 2019 where agriculture is a major sector to produce food and economic crops for local socio economic development however agricultural production utilizes large amount of water land and fertilizer and pesticide inputs then causing severe environmental risk and interfering natural flow regimes de moraes et al 2010 cai et al 2018 for example the depletion of groundwater storage and streamflow due to conjunctive use of sw and gw irrigation leads to degradation of wetlands and shrinking of terminal lake and even results in sand storms in the arid areas cheng et al 2014 guo et al 2009 moreover the agricultural non point source pollution induced by the utilization of extraordinary fertilizers and pesticides during crop growing season also affects water supply security and even jeopardizes water quality of terminal lake valiente et al 2018 these environmental harms will eventually result in negative feedbacks between agricultural development and ecological system and be unable to achieve basin wide sgds therefore the understanding of complex feedbacks among sw gw and agricultural irrigation behaviors is significant for managing and regulating the wea nexus system in the arid areas evapotranspiration et the water loses from the land surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a major water cycle element and contributes to the majority of consumptive agricultural water use then the accurate et estimates are essential to implement agricultural water management in such areas mu et al 2013 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a however the basin wide et monitoring is a challenging task due to heterogeneous land use and land cover and variable environmental factors mu et al 2007 senay et al 2016 satellite remote sensing can achieve spatially and temporally information to estimate global et the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensors on the nasa national aeronautics and space administration eos terra and aqua satellites generate the only global potential et etp product mod16a2 at 500 m and 8 day resolution from 2001 to present mu et al 2011 the et demand etd of different crop types can be traditionally calculated as the product of crop specific empirical coefficients kc multiplied by etp defined as the maximum quantity of water capable of being evaporated from the soil and transpired from the vegetation of a specific surface that is affected by multiple atmospheric factors e g net radiation at the canopy surface air temperature vapor pressure wind speed allen et al 1998 tasumi and allen 2007 the etd can be combined with the crop planting structure to implement agricultural water management in the arid endorheic lake basin meanwhile the intricate interaction between sw gw and et induced by irrigated agriculture is a critical component of the wea nexus system therefore the hydrological model that combines satellite remote sensing information for etd estimation would provide a scientific and practical tool for elucidating the evolution of basin scale wea nexus system moreover the strong interdependence across multi sectors i e water agriculture and environment calls for identifying the optimal trade offs for their concerns cosgrove and loucks 2015 liu et al 2017 albrecht et al 2018 the multi objective simulation optimization so modeling framework maier et al 2014 woodruff et al 2013 kollat and reed 2007 could assist co optimization of multi sectors and implement physical model based sustainable development planning for basic scale agricultural water management for example niu et al 2019 proposed a multi objective linear fractional programming method combined with a statistical regression model to identify the trade offs of wea nexus management in zhangye basin northwestern china geressu et al 2020 proposed a multi sector multi objective optimized water energy food environment wefe nexus system design in the tanzania s rufiji river basin and revealed the interdependencies of wefe and the balanced development plans jiang et al 2021 developed an so model which integrated a one dimensional agro hydrological model with the elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm to optimize irrigation water allocation in heihe river basin northwestern china these researches demonstrate that optimizing competing performance indicators of interlinked resource management problem using the multi objective optimization framework would gain novel insights for basin scale development plan which is preferred for the nexus system with the strong interdependencies quinn et al 2017 the complex and strong nexus exists across the multi sectors of wea especially in the arid inland basin but yet rarely are the studies synergistically assisting real world basin development plans evaluated by multi objective optimization for environmental flows of groundwater or lake dependent ecosystem environmental risks of total nitrogen loading and agro economic benefits this study develops a multi sector multi objective so framework for wea nexus system management combining remotely sensed etp in yanqi basin yb an arid endorheic lake basin with intensive irrigated agriculture in northwestern china song et al 2020 implemented multi objective optimization for the conjunctive management of sw and gw in yb which optimized groundwater abstraction in the irrigation districts and surface water diversion in kaidu river unlike the previous study only focusing on water resources system this study aims to optimize crop planting structure available cultivation area and allocation ratio of sw to gw irrigation subject to irrigation water demand calculated by remotely sensed etp and crop specific coefficient while considering agro economic benefit total nitrogen loading and environmental flow recharge for groundwater and terminal lake dependent ecosystem so that it would help to identify pareto optimal designs for wea nexus system the irrigation behaviors including groundwater abstraction and surface water diversion and surface recharge derived from irrigation return flow and precipitation are simulated by modflow nwt packages niswonger et al 2011 the maximum and minimum etp scenarios during crop growing season are formulated to evaluate the impacts of basin scale et variations possibly affected by climate change on basin development planning subject to multi sectors trade offs finally pareto optimal solutions can be solved using ε moma an advanced many objective evolutionary algorithm developed by song et al 2019 2020 this study demonstrates that the multi objective optimization modeling can assist basin scale wea nexus system management facing multi sectors development goals and deep uncertainty of etp an indispensable element for irrigation water cycle in the arid areas in particular the optimization framework can be flexibly altered to assimilate other multi source remote sensing data with hydrological model and solve the optimal trade offs the proposed framework would be an effective and promising tool for mediating the ubiquitous human nature conflicts in the other arid inland basins with highly developed agriculture 2 materials and methods this study employs a multi objective decision making framework fig 1 to implement basin scale development plans for the typical wea nexus system in an arid endorheic lake basin we first validate the mod16 etp product using pan evaporation etpan observation data in the meteorological station and calculate the etd in yb using traditional empirical coefficient kc for different crop types which represents crop specific information including the growth patterns and soil evaporation allen et al 1998 then the etd data are combined with streamflow lake level and groundwater level observation data to calibrate and validate the numerical model evaluating basin wide irrigation water budgets according to model outputs assists the formulation of wea nexus management model also ε moma is used to search for pareto optimal solutions across the decision space subject to specific constraint conditions finally an interactive visual analytic tool is employed to explore the trade offs across multi sectors of wea nexus system with a clear perspective hadka et al 2015 matteo et al 2019 furthermore the maximum and minimum etp scenarios are formulated to evaluate the impacts of historical etp variations on wea nexus system management 2 1 regional characteristics the yb is a typical oasis in an arid endorheic lake basin in the xinjiang province northwestern china covering a total area of approximately 7600 km2 and includes yanqi county hejing county bohu county and heshuo county the basin is located in the temperate zone of continental desert climate with a mean annual temperature of 14 6 c an annual precipitation of less than 80 mm and an annual potential evaporation of more than 2000 mm respectively the modeling domain as illustrated in fig 2 located in the western part of yb covers the majority of cropland in the basin with an area of 2062 km2 approximately 76 of which is irrigated agriculture based on 30 m resolution global land cover product glc fcs30 zhang et al 2021b the kaidu river the largest river in yb originates from the tianshan mountain flows through dashankou dsk station feeds the basin agriculture with an annual mean runoff of 3 41 109 m3 wang et al 2013 and then enters bosten lake the largest endorheic freshwater lake in china covering an water surface area of about 945 km2 yao et al 2018 song et al 2020 the water resources system in yb is a common type of those worldwide especially in the central asia such as aral sea basin cretaux et al 2013 urmia lake basin in iran saemian et al 2020 and heihe river basin in western china sun et al 2018 where the forcing huge challenges derived from the expanding agriculture and fragile eco environmental system have to be coped with the cropland area in yb is expanded significantly by 1663 5 km2 from 1964 to 2009 wang et al 2014 where the irrigation water accounts for 90 of the total water consumption thus agriculture has been a major industry for the local development and the irrigation behavior plays a critical role for water cycle in yb the planting structure in yb has great temporal variations in the past decades and mainly contains wheat maize pepper and tomato according to the local government reports bmapsy 2010 the pepper and tomato are special and high value economic crops so they dominate the local agro economic development the irrigation water originates from surface water diversion in different segments of kaidu river and groundwater abstraction in different irrigation districts on the other hand surface water diversion for irrigated agriculture dominates the kaidu river inflow to bosten lake and further controls the lake level accordingly the lake level regulated by local legislation must be greater than 1045 m for ecological water conveyance project to feed the lower reaches of tarim river due to the declined lake level in the recent years groundwater became the supplementary irrigation water source and the excessive groundwater abstraction triggered the expanding depth to water table moreover due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer usage to sustain the higher crop yield nitrate as the bioavailable form of nitrogen dissolves and leaches into the underlying aquifers which causes regional non point source pollution of groundwater and even threatening the terminal lake dependent ecosystem thus the rapid and unregulated agricultural development inevitably conflicts with the irrigation water demand agro economic development and eco environmental benefit in yb the basin scale wea nexus management under the multi objective so framework is preferred for the critical trade offs among multi sectors 2 2 mod16 etp product the modis sensors generate remotely sensed etp data with a 500 m resolution and 8 day fidelity through the mod16a2 version 6 global product and estimated using the penman monteith equation the mod16 etp data from 2001 to 2020 are retrieved on the website of nasa available at https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov archive alldata 6 mod16a2 according to the latitude and longitude of yb all of the modis data are converted to a consistent geographic projection and processed in matlab the daily average etp equals the sum of 8 day etp divided by 8 day and then it is converted to monthly etp as an input to the hydrological model etpan defined as evaporation from open circular pans with a diameter of 20 cm in this study is highly correlated with etp and often taken as an indicator of etp brutsaert and parlange 1998 zhang et al 2007 in order to test the accuracy of mod16a2 product the field scale evaporation et0 is estimated by observed monthly etpan multiplied by pan coefficient kpan as the reference evaporation in the gauging stations over the simulation period and then compared with monthly etp adjacent to the stations alvarez et al 2007 the kpan is set to 0 65 derived from the field experiment for estimating reference evaporation as illustrated in fig s1 the etp trends show reasonably satisfactory correspondence with et0 at the hjm and hsm meteorological stations fig 2 where the values of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse reach 0 90 and 0 85 and the values of the root mean square error rmse reach 0 88 and 0 93 mm d respectively in hjm station the peak value of et0 shows a lager deviation compared with the satellite based etp observation in 2003 2007 2008 and 2009 which may be attributed to local atmospheric factor differences e g wind speed surface temperature however the overall trends of remotely sensed etp variations can be validated by observed pan evaporation in the meteorological stations it is noteworthy that although hsm station is not in the modeling region the station is relatively close to the area and bosten lake and has a sequence of full et0 observation data from 2003 to 2012 that can be used for the validation of basin scale etp the temporal variations of monthly and annual etp averaged in the all croplands of modeling domain from 2001 to 2020 are shown in fig 3 a the vast majority of et temporally concentrates from april to september of each year and inter annual variation of etp approaches to 250 mm yr which shows its significant difference of the basin wide et process the spatial monthly average etp data from 2001 to 2020 illustrated in fig 3b indicate that the maximum etp mainly appears in june july and august and the value adjacent to bosten lake has a slighter lift than the upstream zone of the basin which may be attributed to the higher temperature in the lower latitude region around the terminal lake etd of different crop types is calculated using the empirical crop coefficients kc and etp as follows allen et al 1998 1 et d k c et p the kc value is specified for different crop types and growth stages while the seasonal variation of kc for common crops can be achieved in fao 56 allen et al 1998 due to the absence of spatial information of crop planting structures during simulation period we combine the planting area of dominated crops i e wheat maize pepper and tomato for each county in the local government report in 2010 with kc values to calculate the weighted average comprehensive crop coefficient kmc using following equation 2 k mc i 1 n k ci a i i 1 n a i where kci is the empirical crop coefficient of the ith crop ai is the planting area of the ith crop ha the kmc values were combined with 500 m resolution etp to derive the spatial distribution of etd for all croplands over the simulation period 2 3 numerical model based on the previously developed model wu et al 2018 song et al 2020 by the modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 this study improved the temporal simulation scale for seasonal variation of water resources system in yb the model boundary was adjusted to include vast majority of croplands compared to the previous study the modeled domain includes horizontally 46 800 uniform 400 400 m cells and vertically two layers the first layer is unconfined aquifer that is a primary aquifer for irrigation water supply and the second layer is a deep confined aquifer the model is run at a monthly stress period from january 2003 to december 2012 and calibrated using observed monthly streamflow of kaidu river in the gauging station yq and blsm in fig 2 monthly average lake level and groundwater level the key packages for modflow nwt to model basin scale irrigation behaviors include streamflow routing sfr package for open channel flow in streams and aqueducts well package for groundwater abstraction and unsaturated zone flow uzf package niswonger et al 2006 for irrigation return flow infiltration and actual crop et process in the vadose zone and unconfined aquifer the etd calculated in section 2 2 was input as the uzf variable for modeling actual crop et which is a function of the depth dependent soil water contents using a kinematic wave formulation niswonger 2020 therefore irrigation return flow recharge to unconfined aquifer occurs when excessive irrigation water infiltrates beneath uzf et extinction depth rather than using an empirical irrigation efficiency factor the model calibration results fig s2 are evaluated using nse rmse and coefficient of determination r2 metrics for the streamflow simulation in kaidu river at the blsm and yq stations from 2003 to 2012 the long term dynamics can be well captured with nses of 0 90 and 0 88 rmses of 1 09 and 1 19 mcm d million cubic meters per day respectively fig s2a and s2b the monthly decline trends of bosten lake level can be adequately captured with nse of 0 94 and rmse of 0 22 m fig s2c fig s2d compares the observed and simulated groundwater levels at all monitoring wells and the r2 of the observed versus simulated values 1 1 line reaches 0 94 the long term dynamic variations of groundwater level subject to irrigation behaviors also can be simulated fig s2e and s2f in summary the well calibrated model can be utilized for prediction and updating of state variables in the wea nexus management model in order to evaluate the effects of agricultural irrigation on water resources system in yb irrigation water budget is analyzed as shown in fig s3 sw irrigation diverted from surface water of kaidu river gw irrigation abstracted from pumping wells and precipitation are input to the model based on monthly records obtained from local water authority et gw storage and gw abstraction are achieved from modflow nwt outputs of basin wide water budget fig s3a illustrates the dynamics of annual irrigation water budget over the simulation period which indicates gw storage declines and et summed from vadose zone and unconfined aquifer covers the majority of irrigation water loss moreover sw irrigation decreases while gw irrigation increases that s attributing to the declining lake level which should be alleviated to sustain enough runoff inflowing to the terminal lake the monthly irrigation water budget figs s3b and s3c demonstrates that the greater extent of increment for gw irrigation in 2012 triggers the more gw storage loss from april to september compared to the water budget in 2004 therefore optimizing allocation ratio of sw to gw irrigation is significant for the trade off between gw storage loss and runoff inflowing to lake 2 4 multi objective management model the water resources system management model involving wea nexus represents basin wide irrigation water practices in yb including sw irrigation diverted from the seven diversion gates in kaidu river and gw irrigation in the eight irrigation districts fig 4 it is noteworthy that the irrigation districts are different from the previous study song et al 2020 according to local administrative boundary of hejing yanqi bohu county and surface rivers specifically such a zonation of the irrigation districts as shown in fig 4 is well suited for the multiple water authorities to implement the crop planting structure optimization the study formulates the basin scale wea nexus management as a multi objective optimization problem composed of four objectives 1 maximizing agro economic benefits per unit of irrigation water derived from surface water diversion and groundwater abstraction in yb f ab 2 minimizing total nitrogen loading f tn to alleviate the agricultural non point source pollution risk due to overuse of fertilizers 3 minimizing basin scale groundwater storage loss of unconfined aquifer over the management period f gs and 4 maximizing environmental flow recharge from kaidu river to bosten lake f sr for lake dependent ecosystem which contributes approximately 97 4 of lake recharge in order to consider the conjunctive use of sw and gw irrigation and agro economic development in yb decision variables composed of the ratio of irrigation water from surface water diversion to groundwater abstraction crop planting structure and available cultivation area are designed for irrigation districts as shown in fig 4 there are four crop types wheat maize pepper and tomato for each irrigation district the multi objective wea nexus management model is formulated as follows 3 maximize f ab i 1 n c j 1 n r p c i y c i c a j r ij i 1 n c j 1 n r c c i c a j r ij k 1 n t i 1 n w q g i k c g h i h i k t k k 1 n t i 1 n d q s i k c s t k k 1 n t i 1 n w

planting area of food crops for food supply security in yb 2 5 implementation of multi objective optimization combining a physically based simulation model with a multi objective evolutionary search algorithm ε moma is capable of achieving the optimal trade offs between the basin scale competing development goals for multi sectors wea nexus management the simulation model explains the behaviors of water resources system and management model composed of objective functions as the performance metrics of candidate schemes and constraints defining the feasible decision space explains the evaluation criteria of management scheme the optimization is an automated iterative search process for the optimal development plans including usage ratio of sw to gw irrigation crop planting structure the interactive visual analytic tool discoverydv hadka et al 2015 is employed to explore and analyze the trade offs considering the wea nexus in the high dimensional objective space it is of critical importance for decision makers to visualize the performance objectives and select the promising trade off schemes with a clearer perspective the developed basin wide wea nexus so framework fig 1 is applied to an arid endorheic lake basin facing the intensive conflicts for the universal human nature system and implemented via matlab software 3 results 3 1 pareto optimal solutions the wea nexus management model with four objectives fab fsr ftn and fgs is solved using ε moma to search pareto optimal schemes including crop planting structure and sw gw irrigation water allocation fig 5 shows a global view of pareto optimal front in the four dimensional coordinate plot the fab fsr and ftn is plotted on the x y and z axes respectively and fgs is labeled in color in fig 5 the black arrow indicates the direction of pareto optimality for each objective the tradeoff relationship between fab and ftn can be observed which demonstrates augmenting agro economic benefit increases total nitrogen loading leading to environmental risks of agricultural non point source pollution the tradeoff relationship can be explained due to higher value economic crops accompanied with higher fertilizer usage demand moreover increasing surface runoff inflow to lake triggers the larger groundwater storage loss with the solutions marked in deep blue which indicates a clear tradeoff exists between sw and gw irrigation the scheme before optimization is marked in a red square box although the pre optimized scheme has a larger agro economic benefit per unit of irrigation water volume the other objectives fsr ftn and fgs exhibit the lower performance especially for kaidu river inflow to lake and total nitrogen loading which are even less than the lower limit of all pareto optimal solutions in order to illustrate the discrepancy of pareto optimal solutions the parallel coordinates which are composed of n equal spaced parallel axes representing an n dimensional objective vector are used each polyline intersecting its axes corresponding to objective values represents a pareto optimal scheme in fig 6 the segments with a larger fab have a higher ftn and lower fgs objective which shows that augmenting agro economic benefit increases environmental risk of agricultural non point source pollution and depletes more groundwater storage however fab presents a dispersed distribution from the viewpoint of segment color in the axes of fsr objective which indicates increasing agro economic benefit may be incapable of sacrificing larger environmental flow for terminal lake recharge the reason for the phenomenon is irrigation water supply derived from groundwater abstraction can be largely adjusted to satisfy higher value crop water demand while surface water diversion is more sensitive to the constraint of lake level the fgs and fsr objective have a clear tradeoff relationship illustrated by many slope segments due to the constraint in eq 13 that s the fixed crop et demand decided by crop planting structure therefore it is of critical importance to weigh irrigation water source from sw or gw for the environmental flow of terminal lake or groundwater storage 3 2 optimized schemes the multi objective optimization in wea nexus system can assist decision makers to fully explore the tradeoffs among agro economic benefit environmental risks from agricultural non point source pollution and environmental flows in the basin in fig 7 we firstly compare pareto solutions in the bi objectives space which includes fab and fgs fab and ftn fgs and fsr respectively due to the distinct tradeoff relationship in these objectives the pareto solutions s1 s4 are the extreme solutions and correspond to maximum fab minimum ftn maximum fsr and maximum fgs respectively as illustrated in fig 7 s1 and s4 locate in the endpoints of pareto front of fab and fgs in the bi objective space fig 7a whereas s4 exhibits the lower performance and far from 2 dimensional pareto front of fab and ftn fig 7b and s1 can be shown in the similar trend in the bi objective space of fgs and fsr fig 7c the comparison demonstrates the lower dimensional objectives cannot fully explore the intricate wea nexus management which has a sharp conflict among agricultural expansion irrigation water demand and environmental risks therefore s5 as a typical compromise solution in the four dimensional objective space is selected and closest to the middle part of non dominated front in fab and fgs fsr and fgs fab and ftn simultaneously we select four extreme solutions s1 s4 to evaluate the optimal scheme of crop planting structure and sw gw irrigation water allocation compared to the compromise solution s5 the objective values of these schemes are listed in table 2 it can be observed that s1 scheme with maximal f ab achieves 34 4 increment of agro economic profits per unit of irrigation water while depletes 160 9 mcm yr of groundwater storage compared to s5 scheme hence gw irrigation can be augmented to obtain maximal economic benefit by implementing more high value and water consuming crop planting at the cost of the greater loss of regional groundwater storage s2 scheme with minimal f tn reduces 78 6 of agro economic benefit while s3 and s4 scheme reduce 61 1 and 44 7 of the benefit respectively compared to s5 scheme which indicates lowering the environmental risks from the excess fertilizer usage causes the largest loss of agro economic benefit compared to reducing environmental flow recharge meanwhile s3 scheme with maximal f sr can achieve the increment of 101 36 mcm yr for kaidu river inflow to the terminal lake compared to s5 scheme s4 scheme with maximal f gs objective first realizes the increment of groundwater storage at the rate of 8 57 mcm yr in yb the total cultivation area and irrigation water volume also listed in table 2 it can be found that maximizing agro economic benefit increases total irrigation water demand to feed the high value and water consuming crop growing pepper and tomato rather than total cultivation area from s1 to s5 scheme for example s1 scheme has the maximal total irrigation water demand with the less cultivation area compared to s3 and s4 scheme meanwhile s2 scheme has the minimal total cultivation area in order to reduce fertilizer usage demand to a greater extent which results in the minimal agro economic benefit and irrigation water demand fig 8 illustrates the spatial pattern of crop planting and sw gw irrigation water allocation for four extreme schemes and one compromise scheme s1 scheme shows that in order to maximize agro economic benefit the high value tomato planting area is augmented largely fig 8a while the water consuming tomato planting calls for more irrigation water supply which is mainly derived from groundwater abstraction fig 8f s2 scheme shows that maize is the main crop fig 8b due to the minimal fertilizer usage demand to minimize the risks from agricultural non point source pollution and gw irrigation is a major irrigation water source fig 8g s3 scheme indicates the water saving and low value wheat is the main crop in order to maximize kaidu river inflow to the terminal lake fig 8c it is noteworthy that sw irrigation water volume in s3 scheme is greater than that in s1 and s2 scheme especially for zone 3 and f sr objective in s1 and s2 scheme is less than that in s3 scheme fig 8h the reason for the contradiction is that kaidu river leakage in s1 and s2 scheme is larger than that in s3 scheme which indicates increasing gw irrigation exacerbates the river runoff loss along the main stream of kaidu river table 2 and further reduces river inflow to the terminal lake therefore the co optimization of sw and gw irrigation under the integrated so framework is of critical importance for wea nexus management s4 scheme shows that maximizing groundwater storage needs to reduce gw irrigation and maximize sw irrigation fig 8i while wheat also is the preferred crop to lower irrigation water demand fig 8d it can be found gw irrigation in zone 4 is largely reduced due to groundwater over exploitation before optimization s5 scheme is a compromise solution in order to achieve the optimal trade off for wea nexus management objectives simultaneously it can be observed that high value economic crop tomato needs to be planted to elevate agro economic benefit and sustain minimal food supply fig 8e moreover f gs objective of s5 scheme is selected to reach the middle part of 2d pareto front of f ab and f gs fig 7a therefore gw irrigation is largely lowered for all the irrigation districts compared to s1 s3 schemes and sw irrigation is selected to satisfy total irrigation water demand especially in zones 3 and 4 fig 8j 3 3 impacts of etp change etp plays a critical role in agricultural water management in the arid inland basin and affects the basin wide development plan of wea nexus system etp records from 2001 to 2020 in yb are retrieved from mod16a2 product and analyzed to evaluate the monthly and annual variations as illustrated in fig 3a etp during crop growing season from april to october for each year determines total irrigation water demand of basin scale crop planting structure the maximum and minimum etp are presented in 2006 and 2019 respectively therefore we restart multi objective optimization process for the extreme etp scenarios in 2006 and 2019 with the duplicated model parameters inputs of source and sink terms and management model then the 2 dimensional pareto fronts of fab and ftn fab and fgs fab and fsr fgs and fsr are compared to evaluate the impacts of etp changes on pareto optimality of wea management schemes as illustrated in fig 9 the pareto front between fab and ftn has a minor difference fig 9a and the middle part of the front between fab and fgs in 2006 is slightly dominated by the front in 2019 fig 9c however pareto fronts between fab and fsr fgs and fsr in 2006 are completely dominated by the fronts in 2019 fig 9b and 9d the results indicate that increasing etp reduces river runoff recharge for the terminal lake and groundwater storage while exhibits the minor discrepancy for total nitrogen loading objective for the same agro economic benefit moreover pareto fronts of fsr and fgs in 2006 and 2019 show augmenting etp lowers pareto optimality of environmental flow objectives regardless of the agro economic benefit objective the discrepancy of pareto front between fsr and fgs increases as groundwater storage reduces which may be attributed to the increment of gw irrigation triggering the larger kaidu river leakage and smaller runoff inflowing to the terminal lake 4 discussion in order to achieve sgds in the arid endorheic lake basin with highly developed agriculture the multi dimensional cross sectoral management model is proposed to explore pareto optimal performance measures of basin scale crop planting structure and sw gw irrigation water allocation for wea nexus system the remotely sensed etp data in yb are obtained from mod16a2 product and implemented monthly state variables modeling we combine the well calibrated simulation model with wea nexus management model to assess and reconcile the basin wide development plan evaluated by the agro economic benefit environmental risk of total nitrogen loading and environmental flow including river runoff recharge for terminal lake and regional groundwater storage multi sectoral managers seek the optimal objective for their preferences whereas there is no single ideal development plan to reach all the best possible outcomes therefore the pareto optimal solutions of wea nexus design implemented in this paper accommodate different extents of concerns of the basin development goals and explore visually for each sector how the basin benefit can be balanced between water resources agricultural development and eco environmental protection in an arid inland basin 4 1 implications of trade off surface the four dimensional pareto optimal front is visually illustrated in multi dimensional and parallel coordinate plot fig 5 and fig 6 the distinct trade off can be found between agro economic benefit total nitrogen loading and groundwater storage which demonstrates that augmenting agro economic benefit requires a large amount of fertilizer usage and groundwater abstraction for high value crop planting in fig 6 the polylines with minimum fab objective accumulate in the upward of ftn axis which shows that seeking the minimum environmental risk derived from fertilizer usage i e non point source of nitrate pollution triggers the more loss of economic benefit compared to sustain higher environmental flow for water resources system the nitrate pollution caused by agricultural expansion is a critical and noteworthy environment problem due to nitrate discharge into downstream gaining reaches or terminal lake which impacts water quality in the river and finally enlarges the salinized risk of the lake in the arid regions this study shows reducing the environmental risk causes the greater loss of agro economic benefit therefore the basin managers should evaluate the current risk of non point source pollution and then weigh the sdgs of agriculture to select the optimal scheme from the pareto optimal solutions moreover the polylines with higher economic benefit can be found in the downward of f gs axis while uniformly distributed in f sr axis the phenomena indicate that for water resources system the managers can enlarge gw irrigation by groundwater abstraction while reduce sw irrigation by river runoff diversion to achieve the higher economic benefit sw irrigation is more sensitive to runoff inflow to the terminal lake than gw irrigation whereas the minimum lake level is strictly constrained by the basin legislation therefore groundwater resources can be largely exploited to elevate total irrigation water demand of high value crop the many slope polylines are found between fgs and fsr objective which shows sw and gw irrigation also can be weighed to satisfy the preferences of environmental flow i e mitigating groundwater storage loss or maintaining higher runoff inflow to the lake 4 2 comparison of management schemes the four extreme schemes for wea nexus management objectives and one compromise solution are selected to evaluate spatial distribution of crop planting and sw gw irrigation water allocation in order to maximize agro economic benefit the highest value crop tomato planting area is increased across all irrigation zones and total irrigation water demand is largest and can be reached to 1118 46 mcm yr gw irrigation is the dominated irrigation water source 763 03 mcm yr and sw irrigation can be reduced to some extent 355 43 mcm yr for the scheme minimizing total nitrogen loading the crop maize with minimum fertilizer usage table 1 is enlarged in the basin and total irrigation water demand is reduced to 881 43 mcm yr due to the smaller crop et demand moreover the economic benefit of the scheme is minimized which shows mitigating total nitrogen loading achieves the larger agro economic loss for the scheme with maximizing runoff inflow to the terminal lake the planting area of the wheat with the fewer crop et demand is increased to reduce irrigation water supply sw irrigation 458 18 mcm yr is larger and gw irrigation 525 18 mcm yr is smaller in the scheme maximizing f sr objective than the scheme minimizing f tn objective that is 288 20 mcm yr of sw irrigation and 593 23 mcm yr of gw irrigation while kaidu river inflow reaches 1906 65 and 1884 22 mcm yr respectively the comparison demonstrates that the intricate and frequent sw gw exchanges in kaidu river reinforce river leakage as a non trivial factor to reduce the runoff inflowing for the terminal lake therefore the conjunctive management of sw and gw with the coupled modeling framework is essential for wea nexus system design the scheme for minimizing groundwater storage loss similarly increases the planting area of maize in the basin while lowers gw irrigation for all the irrigation districts especially for zone 3 and 4 having a larger cultivation area the compromise solution is selected to reach the average performance on the 2 dimensional pareto front between fab and fgs fab and ftn f gs and fsr the scheme shows that the planting area of high value crop in the larger irrigation districts zone 3 and 4 can be increased to sustain agro economic benefit while sw irrigation can be implemented in these zones to avoid the excessive groundwater storage loss moreover gw irrigation in zone 1 and zone 5 7 is maintained to supply environmental flow for the terminal lake in summary it is a challenge task to achieve consensus between multi sectoral interests and the proposed novel optimization framework provides pareto optimal solutions to assist the stakeholders to understand the trade offs of wea nexus management in order to obtain an acceptable portfolio of irrigation water supply practices and crop planting structure 4 3 implications of etp variation climate change has a substantial impact on water resources system and may jeopardize the agro economic development for future projections accompanying with a greater likelihood of extreme hydrological events in the form of drought or flooding for the arid inland basin water scarcity in essence will magnifies the impacts of climate change especially for et as a critical element in wea nexus management change to etp in the arid inland basin exacerbates the variation of irrigation water demand during crop growing season april october this study retrieves etp records from 2001 to 2020 based on mod16a2 product and frames the extreme scenarios projected to have minimum and maximum etp during crop growing season the multi objective optimization is restarted to search pareto optimal solutions for the extreme etp scenarios the optimization result demonstrates that etp change is a strong driver of change to groundwater storage loss and runoff inflow to the terminal lake in order to sustain enough environmental flow the agro economic benefit has a larger reduction compared to the lower etp scenario regardless of the agro economic benefit objective the pareto front of groundwater storage and runoff inflowing to the terminal lake in the maximum etp scenario is completely dominated by the front in the minimum etp scenario consequently increasing etp exacerbates the conflict between agro economic development and environmental flow for the deep uncertainty derived from basin scale etp wea nexus system management including crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation should be adaptively adjusted under the multi objective optimization framework to improve the robustness and reliability of the nexus system management in the changing world 5 conclusions in the arid endorheic lake basin wea nexus is a typical and featured human nature system for sustainable socio economic development subject to the fragile and sensitive groundwater or lake dependent ecosystem the complex wea nexus system is difficult to manage and plan due to interdependent interests across multi sectors and intricate interventions from exogenous and endogenous factors etp as a critical water cycle element decides basin wide irrigation water demand and crop yield this study firstly combined remote sensing data product mod16a2 with hydrological model modflow nwt to implement irrigation practices modeling then the multi objective evolutionary algorithm ε moma is used to identify pareto optimal crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation scheme that reaches the optimal trade off of performance objectives including maximization of agro economic benefit and environmental flow recharge and minimization of total nitrogen loading the study results reveal the critical implications for the trade offs in wea nexus system maximizing agro economic benefit increases groundwater storage loss and total nitrogen loading which shows gw irrigation is a preferred irrigation water supply rather than sw irrigation the environmental risk of agricultural non point source pollution from the excessive fertilizer usage conflicts agro economic development to a greater extent therefore the basin managers should pay more attention to implement the optimal gw irrigation water allocation and constrain sw irrigation subject to the minimum lake level moreover it is necessary to lower total nitrogen loading by optimizing crop planting structure and reduce the nitrate discharge to the downstream reaches of river or terminal lake by the field investigation of non point source pollution and additional measures for example lowering fertilizers leaching rate and constructing water saving irrigation system are practical alternatives for mitigating the extent of agricultural pollution the four extreme solutions and one compromise solution are selected to elucidate the optimal crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation the high value and water consuming crop tomato dominates the potential of agro economic development the crop maize with minimal amount of fertilizer usage determines the reduction extent of total nitrogen loading in order to maximize environmental flow recharge the water saving crop wheat is preferred to increase plant area in the basin therefore the preferences of basin managers for the trade off of multi sectors interests will determine an optimum crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation scheme it is noteworthy that maximizing runoff inflow to lake leads to a smaller river leakage by lowering gw irrigation rather than minimizing sw irrigation which indicates the strong exchanges of sw and gw play a non trivial role in the lake recharge etp is an essential factor to implement wea nexus management the maximum and minimum etp scenarios are selected to evaluate the impacts of etp uncertainty probably related to the future climate change on pareto optimal solutions the optimization result indicates that increasing etp lowers environmental flow recharge i e runoff inflow to lake and groundwater storage for the specified agro economic benefit therefore the deep uncertainty originated from etp exacerbates the conflict between agro economic growth and irrigation water supply which reveals a general conclusion for wea nexus management in the arid inland basin that is freshwater availability is a rigid constraint for the potential of local agro economic development although the uncertainty of so modeling e g hydrological model parameters socio economic parameters and remote sensing data and complexity of eco hydrological process e g the physical feedback of irrigation water demand crop yield and nitrogen transport exhibit a huge challenge for wea nexus management in the arid inland basin the proposed optimization framework fig 1 is flexible and can be tailored to implement the multi sectoral multi objective optimization furthermore surface soil moisture is also a critical factor to determine irrigation water use estimation in the arid region the data assimilation of field scale monitoring and multi source remotely sensed hydrological variables may be a promising approach to improve the quantification of irrigation water use based hydrological model meanwhile the transition from flood to drip irrigation could trigger the higher crop et and reduction of soli evaporation and regional recharge to aquifer which may lead to uncertainties of crop coefficients and actual nitrogen loading estimation therefore the future research should focus on integrating these indispensable nexus elements and irrigation technology changes to so model while reducing the uncertainty of satellite remote sensing data for basin scale irrigation water use estimation which will improve the robustness and reliability of optimum scheme in a changing world credit authorship contribution statement jian song conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology software validation visualization

2977,in the arid endorheic lake basin with highly developed agriculture water scarcity drives the nexus of water environment agriculture wea while potential evapotranspiration etp is a critical element linking basin scale irrigation water demand and agro economic development the study proposes a satellite remote sensing data driven multi objective simulation optimization so framework to implement the basin scale wea nexus management the hydrological model modflow nwt combined with the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer based etp estimation with a 500 m spatial resolution simulates the monthly surface water sw and groundwater gw irrigation practices then the multi objective evolutionary algorithm ε moma is applied to solve management model which includes maximization of agro economic benefit and environmental flow and minimization of environmental risk of total nitrogen loading subject to irrigation water demand land availability and food supply the so framework is validated in an arid endorheic lake basin with intensive agricultural irrigation in northwestern china the four dimensional pareto optimal solutions are achieved to optimize crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation in order to avoid cognitive myopia triggered by low dimensional or single objective optimization the results highlight the trade off among the high value crop planting sw gw irrigation and environmental flows and indicating that lowering nitrogen loading is more sensitive to agro economic benefit historical maximum and minimum etp scenarios are tailored to quantify the impact of etp change on wea nexus management results show the increasing etp has a great negative effect on the environmental flow objectives therefore how multi sectoral interests change depending on the basin wide development goals may be difficult to regulate due to complex wea nexus and associated deep uncertainty in the future keywords evapotranspiration satellite remote sensing water environment agriculture nexus endorheic lake basin multi objective optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater gw and surface water sw resources worldwide are increasingly being stressed due to the growing populations rapid agriculture development and climate change gorelick et al 2020 sun et al 2018 ye et al 2018 tolley et al 2019 ipcc 2014 especially in the arid endorheic lake basins water scarcity drives the nexus of water resources agriculture and environment while conflicts with the basin development goals e g expanding the irrigated agriculture and minimizing the environmental risks including substantial loss of groundwater storages or declining terminal lake level which jeopardizes the balance of fragile ecosystems xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2021c in order to achieve sustainable development goals sdgs the nexus alike frameworks have been proposed for the management of sw and gw in the arid and semi arid regions sun et al 2018 zeff et al 2021 shi et al 2021 niu et al 2019 these applications demonstrate that understanding multi dimensional nexus interlinkages and trade offs across multi sectors is of critical importance to achieve basin scale sdgs and to offer a win win strategy the water environment agriculture wea nexus is a critical interlinkage across multi sectors for highly developed irrigated agriculture in the arid regions niu et al 2019 where agriculture is a major sector to produce food and economic crops for local socio economic development however agricultural production utilizes large amount of water land and fertilizer and pesticide inputs then causing severe environmental risk and interfering natural flow regimes de moraes et al 2010 cai et al 2018 for example the depletion of groundwater storage and streamflow due to conjunctive use of sw and gw irrigation leads to degradation of wetlands and shrinking of terminal lake and even results in sand storms in the arid areas cheng et al 2014 guo et al 2009 moreover the agricultural non point source pollution induced by the utilization of extraordinary fertilizers and pesticides during crop growing season also affects water supply security and even jeopardizes water quality of terminal lake valiente et al 2018 these environmental harms will eventually result in negative feedbacks between agricultural development and ecological system and be unable to achieve basin wide sgds therefore the understanding of complex feedbacks among sw gw and agricultural irrigation behaviors is significant for managing and regulating the wea nexus system in the arid areas evapotranspiration et the water loses from the land surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a major water cycle element and contributes to the majority of consumptive agricultural water use then the accurate et estimates are essential to implement agricultural water management in such areas mu et al 2013 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a however the basin wide et monitoring is a challenging task due to heterogeneous land use and land cover and variable environmental factors mu et al 2007 senay et al 2016 satellite remote sensing can achieve spatially and temporally information to estimate global et the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensors on the nasa national aeronautics and space administration eos terra and aqua satellites generate the only global potential et etp product mod16a2 at 500 m and 8 day resolution from 2001 to present mu et al 2011 the et demand etd of different crop types can be traditionally calculated as the product of crop specific empirical coefficients kc multiplied by etp defined as the maximum quantity of water capable of being evaporated from the soil and transpired from the vegetation of a specific surface that is affected by multiple atmospheric factors e g net radiation at the canopy surface air temperature vapor pressure wind speed allen et al 1998 tasumi and allen 2007 the etd can be combined with the crop planting structure to implement agricultural water management in the arid endorheic lake basin meanwhile the intricate interaction between sw gw and et induced by irrigated agriculture is a critical component of the wea nexus system therefore the hydrological model that combines satellite remote sensing information for etd estimation would provide a scientific and practical tool for elucidating the evolution of basin scale wea nexus system moreover the strong interdependence across multi sectors i e water agriculture and environment calls for identifying the optimal trade offs for their concerns cosgrove and loucks 2015 liu et al 2017 albrecht et al 2018 the multi objective simulation optimization so modeling framework maier et al 2014 woodruff et al 2013 kollat and reed 2007 could assist co optimization of multi sectors and implement physical model based sustainable development planning for basic scale agricultural water management for example niu et al 2019 proposed a multi objective linear fractional programming method combined with a statistical regression model to identify the trade offs of wea nexus management in zhangye basin northwestern china geressu et al 2020 proposed a multi sector multi objective optimized water energy food environment wefe nexus system design in the tanzania s rufiji river basin and revealed the interdependencies of wefe and the balanced development plans jiang et al 2021 developed an so model which integrated a one dimensional agro hydrological model with the elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm to optimize irrigation water allocation in heihe river basin northwestern china these researches demonstrate that optimizing competing performance indicators of interlinked resource management problem using the multi objective optimization framework would gain novel insights for basin scale development plan which is preferred for the nexus system with the strong interdependencies quinn et al 2017 the complex and strong nexus exists across the multi sectors of wea especially in the arid inland basin but yet rarely are the studies synergistically assisting real world basin development plans evaluated by multi objective optimization for environmental flows of groundwater or lake dependent ecosystem environmental risks of total nitrogen loading and agro economic benefits this study develops a multi sector multi objective so framework for wea nexus system management combining remotely sensed etp in yanqi basin yb an arid endorheic lake basin with intensive irrigated agriculture in northwestern china song et al 2020 implemented multi objective optimization for the conjunctive management of sw and gw in yb which optimized groundwater abstraction in the irrigation districts and surface water diversion in kaidu river unlike the previous study only focusing on water resources system this study aims to optimize crop planting structure available cultivation area and allocation ratio of sw to gw irrigation subject to irrigation water demand calculated by remotely sensed etp and crop specific coefficient while considering agro economic benefit total nitrogen loading and environmental flow recharge for groundwater and terminal lake dependent ecosystem so that it would help to identify pareto optimal designs for wea nexus system the irrigation behaviors including groundwater abstraction and surface water diversion and surface recharge derived from irrigation return flow and precipitation are simulated by modflow nwt packages niswonger et al 2011 the maximum and minimum etp scenarios during crop growing season are formulated to evaluate the impacts of basin scale et variations possibly affected by climate change on basin development planning subject to multi sectors trade offs finally pareto optimal solutions can be solved using ε moma an advanced many objective evolutionary algorithm developed by song et al 2019 2020 this study demonstrates that the multi objective optimization modeling can assist basin scale wea nexus system management facing multi sectors development goals and deep uncertainty of etp an indispensable element for irrigation water cycle in the arid areas in particular the optimization framework can be flexibly altered to assimilate other multi source remote sensing data with hydrological model and solve the optimal trade offs the proposed framework would be an effective and promising tool for mediating the ubiquitous human nature conflicts in the other arid inland basins with highly developed agriculture 2 materials and methods this study employs a multi objective decision making framework fig 1 to implement basin scale development plans for the typical wea nexus system in an arid endorheic lake basin we first validate the mod16 etp product using pan evaporation etpan observation data in the meteorological station and calculate the etd in yb using traditional empirical coefficient kc for different crop types which represents crop specific information including the growth patterns and soil evaporation allen et al 1998 then the etd data are combined with streamflow lake level and groundwater level observation data to calibrate and validate the numerical model evaluating basin wide irrigation water budgets according to model outputs assists the formulation of wea nexus management model also ε moma is used to search for pareto optimal solutions across the decision space subject to specific constraint conditions finally an interactive visual analytic tool is employed to explore the trade offs across multi sectors of wea nexus system with a clear perspective hadka et al 2015 matteo et al 2019 furthermore the maximum and minimum etp scenarios are formulated to evaluate the impacts of historical etp variations on wea nexus system management 2 1 regional characteristics the yb is a typical oasis in an arid endorheic lake basin in the xinjiang province northwestern china covering a total area of approximately 7600 km2 and includes yanqi county hejing county bohu county and heshuo county the basin is located in the temperate zone of continental desert climate with a mean annual temperature of 14 6 c an annual precipitation of less than 80 mm and an annual potential evaporation of more than 2000 mm respectively the modeling domain as illustrated in fig 2 located in the western part of yb covers the majority of cropland in the basin with an area of 2062 km2 approximately 76 of which is irrigated agriculture based on 30 m resolution global land cover product glc fcs30 zhang et al 2021b the kaidu river the largest river in yb originates from the tianshan mountain flows through dashankou dsk station feeds the basin agriculture with an annual mean runoff of 3 41 109 m3 wang et al 2013 and then enters bosten lake the largest endorheic freshwater lake in china covering an water surface area of about 945 km2 yao et al 2018 song et al 2020 the water resources system in yb is a common type of those worldwide especially in the central asia such as aral sea basin cretaux et al 2013 urmia lake basin in iran saemian et al 2020 and heihe river basin in western china sun et al 2018 where the forcing huge challenges derived from the expanding agriculture and fragile eco environmental system have to be coped with the cropland area in yb is expanded significantly by 1663 5 km2 from 1964 to 2009 wang et al 2014 where the irrigation water accounts for 90 of the total water consumption thus agriculture has been a major industry for the local development and the irrigation behavior plays a critical role for water cycle in yb the planting structure in yb has great temporal variations in the past decades and mainly contains wheat maize pepper and tomato according to the local government reports bmapsy 2010 the pepper and tomato are special and high value economic crops so they dominate the local agro economic development the irrigation water originates from surface water diversion in different segments of kaidu river and groundwater abstraction in different irrigation districts on the other hand surface water diversion for irrigated agriculture dominates the kaidu river inflow to bosten lake and further controls the lake level accordingly the lake level regulated by local legislation must be greater than 1045 m for ecological water conveyance project to feed the lower reaches of tarim river due to the declined lake level in the recent years groundwater became the supplementary irrigation water source and the excessive groundwater abstraction triggered the expanding depth to water table moreover due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer usage to sustain the higher crop yield nitrate as the bioavailable form of nitrogen dissolves and leaches into the underlying aquifers which causes regional non point source pollution of groundwater and even threatening the terminal lake dependent ecosystem thus the rapid and unregulated agricultural development inevitably conflicts with the irrigation water demand agro economic development and eco environmental benefit in yb the basin scale wea nexus management under the multi objective so framework is preferred for the critical trade offs among multi sectors 2 2 mod16 etp product the modis sensors generate remotely sensed etp data with a 500 m resolution and 8 day fidelity through the mod16a2 version 6 global product and estimated using the penman monteith equation the mod16 etp data from 2001 to 2020 are retrieved on the website of nasa available at https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov archive alldata 6 mod16a2 according to the latitude and longitude of yb all of the modis data are converted to a consistent geographic projection and processed in matlab the daily average etp equals the sum of 8 day etp divided by 8 day and then it is converted to monthly etp as an input to the hydrological model etpan defined as evaporation from open circular pans with a diameter of 20 cm in this study is highly correlated with etp and often taken as an indicator of etp brutsaert and parlange 1998 zhang et al 2007 in order to test the accuracy of mod16a2 product the field scale evaporation et0 is estimated by observed monthly etpan multiplied by pan coefficient kpan as the reference evaporation in the gauging stations over the simulation period and then compared with monthly etp adjacent to the stations alvarez et al 2007 the kpan is set to 0 65 derived from the field experiment for estimating reference evaporation as illustrated in fig s1 the etp trends show reasonably satisfactory correspondence with et0 at the hjm and hsm meteorological stations fig 2 where the values of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse reach 0 90 and 0 85 and the values of the root mean square error rmse reach 0 88 and 0 93 mm d respectively in hjm station the peak value of et0 shows a lager deviation compared with the satellite based etp observation in 2003 2007 2008 and 2009 which may be attributed to local atmospheric factor differences e g wind speed surface temperature however the overall trends of remotely sensed etp variations can be validated by observed pan evaporation in the meteorological stations it is noteworthy that although hsm station is not in the modeling region the station is relatively close to the area and bosten lake and has a sequence of full et0 observation data from 2003 to 2012 that can be used for the validation of basin scale etp the temporal variations of monthly and annual etp averaged in the all croplands of modeling domain from 2001 to 2020 are shown in fig 3 a the vast majority of et temporally concentrates from april to september of each year and inter annual variation of etp approaches to 250 mm yr which shows its significant difference of the basin wide et process the spatial monthly average etp data from 2001 to 2020 illustrated in fig 3b indicate that the maximum etp mainly appears in june july and august and the value adjacent to bosten lake has a slighter lift than the upstream zone of the basin which may be attributed to the higher temperature in the lower latitude region around the terminal lake etd of different crop types is calculated using the empirical crop coefficients kc and etp as follows allen et al 1998 1 et d k c et p the kc value is specified for different crop types and growth stages while the seasonal variation of kc for common crops can be achieved in fao 56 allen et al 1998 due to the absence of spatial information of crop planting structures during simulation period we combine the planting area of dominated crops i e wheat maize pepper and tomato for each county in the local government report in 2010 with kc values to calculate the weighted average comprehensive crop coefficient kmc using following equation 2 k mc i 1 n k ci a i i 1 n a i where kci is the empirical crop coefficient of the ith crop ai is the planting area of the ith crop ha the kmc values were combined with 500 m resolution etp to derive the spatial distribution of etd for all croplands over the simulation period 2 3 numerical model based on the previously developed model wu et al 2018 song et al 2020 by the modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 this study improved the temporal simulation scale for seasonal variation of water resources system in yb the model boundary was adjusted to include vast majority of croplands compared to the previous study the modeled domain includes horizontally 46 800 uniform 400 400 m cells and vertically two layers the first layer is unconfined aquifer that is a primary aquifer for irrigation water supply and the second layer is a deep confined aquifer the model is run at a monthly stress period from january 2003 to december 2012 and calibrated using observed monthly streamflow of kaidu river in the gauging station yq and blsm in fig 2 monthly average lake level and groundwater level the key packages for modflow nwt to model basin scale irrigation behaviors include streamflow routing sfr package for open channel flow in streams and aqueducts well package for groundwater abstraction and unsaturated zone flow uzf package niswonger et al 2006 for irrigation return flow infiltration and actual crop et process in the vadose zone and unconfined aquifer the etd calculated in section 2 2 was input as the uzf variable for modeling actual crop et which is a function of the depth dependent soil water contents using a kinematic wave formulation niswonger 2020 therefore irrigation return flow recharge to unconfined aquifer occurs when excessive irrigation water infiltrates beneath uzf et extinction depth rather than using an empirical irrigation efficiency factor the model calibration results fig s2 are evaluated using nse rmse and coefficient of determination r2 metrics for the streamflow simulation in kaidu river at the blsm and yq stations from 2003 to 2012 the long term dynamics can be well captured with nses of 0 90 and 0 88 rmses of 1 09 and 1 19 mcm d million cubic meters per day respectively fig s2a and s2b the monthly decline trends of bosten lake level can be adequately captured with nse of 0 94 and rmse of 0 22 m fig s2c fig s2d compares the observed and simulated groundwater levels at all monitoring wells and the r2 of the observed versus simulated values 1 1 line reaches 0 94 the long term dynamic variations of groundwater level subject to irrigation behaviors also can be simulated fig s2e and s2f in summary the well calibrated model can be utilized for prediction and updating of state variables in the wea nexus management model in order to evaluate the effects of agricultural irrigation on water resources system in yb irrigation water budget is analyzed as shown in fig s3 sw irrigation diverted from surface water of kaidu river gw irrigation abstracted from pumping wells and precipitation are input to the model based on monthly records obtained from local water authority et gw storage and gw abstraction are achieved from modflow nwt outputs of basin wide water budget fig s3a illustrates the dynamics of annual irrigation water budget over the simulation period which indicates gw storage declines and et summed from vadose zone and unconfined aquifer covers the majority of irrigation water loss moreover sw irrigation decreases while gw irrigation increases that s attributing to the declining lake level which should be alleviated to sustain enough runoff inflowing to the terminal lake the monthly irrigation water budget figs s3b and s3c demonstrates that the greater extent of increment for gw irrigation in 2012 triggers the more gw storage loss from april to september compared to the water budget in 2004 therefore optimizing allocation ratio of sw to gw irrigation is significant for the trade off between gw storage loss and runoff inflowing to lake 2 4 multi objective management model the water resources system management model involving wea nexus represents basin wide irrigation water practices in yb including sw irrigation diverted from the seven diversion gates in kaidu river and gw irrigation in the eight irrigation districts fig 4 it is noteworthy that the irrigation districts are different from the previous study song et al 2020 according to local administrative boundary of hejing yanqi bohu county and surface rivers specifically such a zonation of the irrigation districts as shown in fig 4 is well suited for the multiple water authorities to implement the crop planting structure optimization the study formulates the basin scale wea nexus management as a multi objective optimization problem composed of four objectives 1 maximizing agro economic benefits per unit of irrigation water derived from surface water diversion and groundwater abstraction in yb f ab 2 minimizing total nitrogen loading f tn to alleviate the agricultural non point source pollution risk due to overuse of fertilizers 3 minimizing basin scale groundwater storage loss of unconfined aquifer over the management period f gs and 4 maximizing environmental flow recharge from kaidu river to bosten lake f sr for lake dependent ecosystem which contributes approximately 97 4 of lake recharge in order to consider the conjunctive use of sw and gw irrigation and agro economic development in yb decision variables composed of the ratio of irrigation water from surface water diversion to groundwater abstraction crop planting structure and available cultivation area are designed for irrigation districts as shown in fig 4 there are four crop types wheat maize pepper and tomato for each irrigation district the multi objective wea nexus management model is formulated as follows 3 maximize f ab i 1 n c j 1 n r p c i y c i c a j r ij i 1 n c j 1 n r c c i c a j r ij k 1 n t i 1 n w q g i k c g h i h i k t k k 1 n t i 1 n d q s i k c s t k k 1 n t i 1 n w

m2 nl i is total nitrogen loading for the ith crop in the available cropland kg ha x is an irrigation water use and crop planting scheme swi gwi is usage ratio of sw to gw irrigation for the ith

for each irrigation district which is an ideal irrigation water allocation to avoid the overuse of irrigation water or excessive depletion of soil water the constraint eq 14 is to assure minimum planting area of food crops for food supply security in yb 2 5 implementation of multi objective optimization combining a physically based simulation model with a multi objective evolutionary search algorithm ε moma is capable of achieving the optimal trade offs between the basin scale competing development goals for multi sectors wea nexus management the simulation model explains the behaviors of water resources system and management model composed of objective functions as the performance metrics of candidate schemes and constraints defining the feasible decision space explains the evaluation criteria of management scheme the optimization is an automated iterative search process for the optimal development plans including usage ratio of sw to gw irrigation crop planting structure the interactive visual analytic tool discoverydv hadka et al 2015 is employed to explore and analyze the trade offs considering the wea nexus in the high dimensional objective space it is of critical importance for decision makers to visualize the performance objectives and select the promising trade off schemes with a clearer perspective the developed basin wide wea nexus so framework fig 1 is applied to an arid endorheic lake basin facing the intensive conflicts for the universal human nature system and implemented via matlab software 3 results 3 1 pareto optimal solutions the wea nexus management model with four objectives fab fsr ftn and fgs is solved using ε moma to search pareto optimal schemes including crop planting structure and sw gw irrigation water allocation fig 5 shows a global view of pareto optimal front in the four dimensional coordinate plot the fab fsr and ftn is plotted on the x y and z axes respectively and fgs is labeled in color in fig 5 the black arrow indicates the direction of pareto optimality for each objective the tradeoff relationship between fab and ftn can be observed which demonstrates augmenting agro economic benefit increases total nitrogen loading leading to environmental risks of agricultural non point source pollution the tradeoff relationship can be explained due to higher value economic crops accompanied with higher fertilizer usage demand moreover increasing surface runoff inflow to lake triggers the larger groundwater storage loss with the solutions marked in deep blue which indicates a clear tradeoff exists between sw and gw irrigation the scheme before optimization is marked in a red square box although the pre optimized scheme has a larger agro economic benefit per unit of irrigation water volume the other objectives fsr ftn and fgs exhibit the lower performance especially for kaidu river inflow to lake and total nitrogen loading which are even less than the lower limit of all pareto optimal solutions in order to illustrate the discrepancy of pareto optimal solutions the parallel coordinates which are composed of n equal spaced parallel axes representing an n dimensional objective vector are used each polyline intersecting its axes corresponding to objective values represents a pareto optimal scheme in fig 6 the segments with a larger fab have a higher ftn and lower fgs objective which shows that augmenting agro economic benefit increases environmental risk of agricultural non point source pollution and depletes more groundwater storage however fab presents a dispersed distribution from the viewpoint of segment color in the axes of fsr objective which indicates increasing agro economic benefit may be incapable of sacrificing larger environmental flow for terminal lake recharge the reason for the phenomenon is irrigation water supply derived from groundwater abstraction can be largely adjusted to satisfy higher value crop water demand while surface water diversion is more sensitive to the constraint of lake level the fgs and fsr objective have a clear tradeoff relationship illustrated by many slope segments due to the constraint in eq 13 that s the fixed crop et demand decided by crop planting structure therefore it is of critical importance to weigh irrigation water source from sw or gw for the environmental flow of terminal lake or groundwater storage 3 2 optimized schemes the multi objective optimization in wea nexus system can assist decision makers to fully explore the tradeoffs among agro economic benefit environmental risks from agricultural non point source pollution and environmental flows in the basin in fig 7 we firstly compare pareto solutions in the bi objectives space which includes fab and fgs fab and ftn fgs and fsr respectively due to the distinct tradeoff relationship in these objectives the pareto solutions s1 s4 are the extreme solutions and correspond to maximum fab minimum ftn maximum fsr and maximum fgs respectively as illustrated in fig 7 s1 and s4 locate in the endpoints of pareto front of fab and fgs in the bi objective space fig 7a whereas s4 exhibits the lower performance and far from 2 dimensional pareto front of fab and ftn fig 7b and s1 can be shown in the similar trend in the bi objective space of fgs and fsr fig 7c the comparison demonstrates the lower dimensional objectives cannot fully explore the intricate wea nexus management which has a sharp conflict among agricultural expansion irrigation water demand and environmental risks therefore s5 as a typical compromise solution in the four dimensional objective space is selected and closest to the middle part of non dominated front in fab and fgs fsr and fgs fab and ftn simultaneously we select four extreme solutions s1 s4 to evaluate the optimal scheme of crop planting structure and sw gw irrigation water allocation compared to the compromise solution s5 the objective values of these schemes are listed in table 2 it can be observed that s1 scheme with maximal f ab achieves 34 4 increment of agro economic profits per unit of irrigation water while depletes 160 9 mcm yr of groundwater storage compared to s5 scheme hence gw irrigation can be augmented to obtain maximal economic benefit by implementing more high value and water consuming crop planting at the cost of the greater loss of regional groundwater storage s2 scheme with minimal f tn reduces 78 6 of agro economic benefit while s3 and s4 scheme reduce 61 1 and 44 7 of the benefit respectively compared to s5 scheme which indicates lowering the environmental risks from the excess fertilizer usage causes the largest loss of agro economic benefit compared to reducing environmental flow recharge meanwhile s3 scheme with maximal f sr can achieve the increment of 101 36 mcm yr for kaidu river inflow to the terminal lake compared to s5 scheme s4 scheme with maximal f gs objective first realizes the increment of groundwater storage at the rate of 8 57 mcm yr in yb the total cultivation area and irrigation water volume also listed in table 2 it can be found that maximizing agro economic benefit increases total irrigation water demand to feed the high value and water consuming crop growing pepper and tomato rather than total cultivation area from s1 to s5 scheme for example s1 scheme has the maximal total irrigation water demand with the less cultivation area compared to s3 and s4 scheme meanwhile s2 scheme has the minimal total cultivation area in order to reduce fertilizer usage demand to a greater extent which results in the minimal agro economic benefit and irrigation water demand fig 8 illustrates the spatial pattern of crop planting and sw gw irrigation water allocation for four extreme schemes and one compromise scheme s1 scheme shows that in order to maximize agro economic benefit the high value tomato planting area is augmented largely fig 8a while the water consuming tomato planting calls for more irrigation water supply which is mainly derived from groundwater abstraction fig 8f s2 scheme shows that maize is the main crop fig 8b due to the minimal fertilizer usage demand to minimize the risks from agricultural non point source pollution and gw irrigation is a major irrigation water source fig 8g s3 scheme indicates the water saving and low value wheat is the main crop in order to maximize kaidu river inflow to the terminal lake fig 8c it is noteworthy that sw irrigation water volume in s3 scheme is greater than that in s1 and s2 scheme especially for zone 3 and f sr objective in s1 and s2 scheme is less than that in s3 scheme fig 8h the reason for the contradiction is that kaidu river leakage in s1 and s2 scheme is larger than that in s3 scheme which indicates increasing gw irrigation exacerbates the river runoff loss along the main stream of kaidu river table 2 and further reduces river inflow to the terminal lake therefore the co optimization of sw and gw irrigation under the integrated so framework is of critical importance for wea nexus management s4 scheme shows that maximizing groundwater storage needs to reduce gw irrigation and maximize sw irrigation fig 8i while wheat also is the preferred crop to lower irrigation water demand fig 8d it can be found gw irrigation in zone 4 is largely reduced due to groundwater over exploitation before optimization s5 scheme is a compromise solution in order to achieve the optimal trade off for wea nexus management objectives simultaneously it can be observed that high value economic crop tomato needs to be planted to elevate agro economic benefit and sustain minimal food supply fig 8e moreover f gs objective of s5 scheme is selected to reach the middle part of 2d pareto front of f ab and f gs fig 7a therefore gw irrigation is largely lowered for all the irrigation districts compared to s1 s3 schemes and sw irrigation is selected to satisfy total irrigation water demand especially in zones 3 and 4 fig 8j 3 3 impacts of etp change etp plays a critical role in agricultural water management in the arid inland basin and affects the basin wide development plan of wea nexus system etp records from 2001 to 2020 in yb are retrieved from mod16a2 product and analyzed to evaluate the monthly and annual variations as illustrated in fig 3a etp during crop growing season from april to october for each year determines total irrigation water demand of basin scale crop planting structure the maximum and minimum etp are presented in 2006 and 2019 respectively therefore we restart multi objective optimization process for the extreme etp scenarios in 2006 and 2019 with the duplicated model parameters inputs of source and sink terms and management model then the 2 dimensional pareto fronts of fab and ftn fab and fgs fab and fsr fgs and fsr are compared to evaluate the impacts of etp changes on pareto optimality of wea management schemes as illustrated in fig 9 the pareto front between fab and ftn has a minor difference fig 9a and the middle part of the front between fab and fgs in 2006 is slightly dominated by the front in 2019 fig 9c however pareto fronts between fab and fsr fgs and fsr in 2006 are completely dominated by the fronts in 2019 fig 9b and 9d the results indicate that increasing etp reduces river runoff recharge for the terminal lake and groundwater storage while exhibits the minor discrepancy for total nitrogen loading objective for the same agro economic benefit moreover pareto fronts of fsr and fgs in 2006 and 2019 show augmenting etp lowers pareto optimality of environmental flow objectives regardless of the agro economic benefit objective the discrepancy of pareto front between fsr and fgs increases as groundwater storage reduces which may be attributed to the increment of gw irrigation triggering the larger kaidu river leakage and smaller runoff inflowing to the terminal lake 4 discussion in order to achieve sgds in the arid endorheic lake basin with highly developed agriculture the multi dimensional cross sectoral management model is proposed to explore pareto optimal performance measures of basin scale crop planting structure and sw gw irrigation water allocation for wea nexus system the remotely sensed etp data in yb are obtained from mod16a2 product and implemented monthly state variables modeling we combine the well calibrated simulation model with wea nexus management model to assess and reconcile the basin wide development plan evaluated by the agro economic benefit environmental risk of total nitrogen loading and environmental flow including river runoff recharge for terminal lake and regional groundwater storage multi sectoral managers seek the optimal objective for their preferences whereas there is no single ideal development plan to reach all the best possible outcomes therefore the pareto optimal solutions of wea nexus design implemented in this paper accommodate different extents of concerns of the basin development goals and explore visually for each sector how the basin benefit can be balanced between water resources agricultural development and eco environmental protection in an arid inland basin 4 1 implications of trade off surface the four dimensional pareto optimal front is visually illustrated in multi dimensional and parallel coordinate plot fig 5 and fig 6 the distinct trade off can be found between agro economic benefit total nitrogen loading and groundwater storage which demonstrates that augmenting agro economic benefit requires a large amount of fertilizer usage and groundwater abstraction for high value crop planting in fig 6 the polylines with minimum fab objective accumulate in the upward of ftn axis which shows that seeking the minimum environmental risk derived from fertilizer usage i e non point source of nitrate pollution triggers the more loss of economic benefit compared to sustain higher environmental flow for water resources system the nitrate pollution caused by agricultural expansion is a critical and noteworthy environment problem due to nitrate discharge into downstream gaining reaches or terminal lake which impacts water quality in the river and finally enlarges the salinized risk of the lake in the arid regions this study shows reducing the environmental risk causes the greater loss of agro economic benefit therefore the basin managers should evaluate the current risk of non point source pollution and then weigh the sdgs of agriculture to select the optimal scheme from the pareto optimal solutions moreover the polylines with higher economic benefit can be found in the downward of f gs axis while uniformly distributed in f sr axis the phenomena indicate that for water resources system the managers can enlarge gw irrigation by groundwater abstraction while reduce sw irrigation by river runoff diversion to achieve the higher economic benefit sw irrigation is more sensitive to runoff inflow to the terminal lake than gw irrigation whereas the minimum lake level is strictly constrained by the basin legislation therefore groundwater resources can be largely exploited to elevate total irrigation water demand of high value crop the many slope polylines are found between fgs and fsr objective which shows sw and gw irrigation also can be weighed to satisfy the preferences of environmental flow i e mitigating groundwater storage loss or maintaining higher runoff inflow to the lake 4 2 comparison of management schemes the four extreme schemes for wea nexus management objectives and one compromise solution are selected to evaluate spatial distribution of crop planting and sw gw irrigation water allocation in order to maximize agro economic benefit the highest value crop tomato planting area is increased across all irrigation zones and total irrigation water demand is largest and can be reached to 1118 46 mcm yr gw irrigation is the dominated irrigation water source 763 03 mcm yr and sw irrigation can be reduced to some extent 355 43 mcm yr for the scheme minimizing total nitrogen loading the crop maize with minimum fertilizer usage table 1 is enlarged in the basin and total irrigation water demand is reduced to 881 43 mcm yr due to the smaller crop et demand moreover the economic benefit of the scheme is minimized which shows mitigating total nitrogen loading achieves the larger agro economic loss for the scheme with maximizing runoff inflow to the terminal lake the planting area of the wheat with the fewer crop et demand is increased to reduce irrigation water supply sw irrigation 458 18 mcm yr is larger and gw irrigation 525 18 mcm yr is smaller in the scheme maximizing f sr objective than the scheme minimizing f tn objective that is 288 20 mcm yr of sw irrigation and 593 23 mcm yr of gw irrigation while kaidu river inflow reaches 1906 65 and 1884 22 mcm yr respectively the comparison demonstrates that the intricate and frequent sw gw exchanges in kaidu river reinforce river leakage as a non trivial factor to reduce the runoff inflowing for the terminal lake therefore the conjunctive management of sw and gw with the coupled modeling framework is essential for wea nexus system design the scheme for minimizing groundwater storage loss similarly increases the planting area of maize in the basin while lowers gw irrigation for all the irrigation districts especially for zone 3 and 4 having a larger cultivation area the compromise solution is selected to reach the average performance on the 2 dimensional pareto front between fab and fgs fab and ftn f gs and fsr the scheme shows that the planting area of high value crop in the larger irrigation districts zone 3 and 4 can be increased to sustain agro economic benefit while sw irrigation can be implemented in these zones to avoid the excessive groundwater storage loss moreover gw irrigation in zone 1 and zone 5 7 is maintained to supply environmental flow for the terminal lake in summary it is a challenge task to achieve consensus between multi sectoral interests and the proposed novel optimization framework provides pareto optimal solutions to assist the stakeholders to understand the trade offs of wea nexus management in order to obtain an acceptable portfolio of irrigation water supply practices and crop planting structure 4 3 implications of etp variation climate change has a substantial impact on water resources system and may jeopardize the agro economic development for future projections accompanying with a greater likelihood of extreme hydrological events in the form of drought or flooding for the arid inland basin water scarcity in essence will magnifies the impacts of climate change especially for et as a critical element in wea nexus management change to etp in the arid inland basin exacerbates the variation of irrigation water demand during crop growing season april october this study retrieves etp records from 2001 to 2020 based on mod16a2 product and frames the extreme scenarios projected to have minimum and maximum etp during crop growing season the multi objective optimization is restarted to search pareto optimal solutions for the extreme etp scenarios the optimization result demonstrates that etp change is a strong driver of change to groundwater storage loss and runoff inflow to the terminal lake in order to sustain enough environmental flow the agro economic benefit has a larger reduction compared to the lower etp scenario regardless of the agro economic benefit objective the pareto front of groundwater storage and runoff inflowing to the terminal lake in the maximum etp scenario is completely dominated by the front in the minimum etp scenario consequently increasing etp exacerbates the conflict between agro economic development and environmental flow for the deep uncertainty derived from basin scale etp wea nexus system management including crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation should be adaptively adjusted under the multi objective optimization framework to improve the robustness and reliability of the nexus system management in the changing world 5 conclusions in the arid endorheic lake basin wea nexus is a typical and featured human nature system for sustainable socio economic development subject to the fragile and sensitive groundwater or lake dependent ecosystem the complex wea nexus system is difficult to manage and plan due to interdependent interests across multi sectors and intricate interventions from exogenous and endogenous factors etp as a critical water cycle element decides basin wide irrigation water demand and crop yield this study firstly combined remote sensing data product mod16a2 with hydrological model modflow nwt to implement irrigation practices modeling then the multi objective evolutionary algorithm ε moma is used to identify pareto optimal crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation scheme that reaches the optimal trade off of performance objectives including maximization of agro economic benefit and environmental flow recharge and minimization of total nitrogen loading the study results reveal the critical implications for the trade offs in wea nexus system maximizing agro economic benefit increases groundwater storage loss and total nitrogen loading which shows gw irrigation is a preferred irrigation water supply rather than sw irrigation the environmental risk of agricultural non point source pollution from the excessive fertilizer usage conflicts agro economic development to a greater extent therefore the basin managers should pay more attention to implement the optimal gw irrigation water allocation and constrain sw irrigation subject to the minimum lake level moreover it is necessary to lower total nitrogen loading by optimizing crop planting structure and reduce the nitrate discharge to the downstream reaches of river or terminal lake by the field investigation of non point source pollution and additional measures for example lowering fertilizers leaching rate and constructing water saving irrigation system are practical alternatives for mitigating the extent of agricultural pollution the four extreme solutions and one compromise solution are selected to elucidate the optimal crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation the high value and water consuming crop tomato dominates the potential of agro economic development the crop maize with minimal amount of fertilizer usage determines the reduction extent of total nitrogen loading in order to maximize environmental flow recharge the water saving crop wheat is preferred to increase plant area in the basin therefore the preferences of basin managers for the trade off of multi sectors interests will determine an optimum crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation scheme it is noteworthy that maximizing runoff inflow to lake leads to a smaller river leakage by lowering gw irrigation rather than minimizing sw irrigation which indicates the strong exchanges of sw and gw play a non trivial role in the lake recharge etp is an essential factor to implement wea nexus management the maximum and minimum etp scenarios are selected to evaluate the impacts of etp uncertainty probably related to the future climate change on pareto optimal solutions the optimization result indicates that increasing etp lowers environmental flow recharge i e runoff inflow to lake and groundwater storage for the specified agro economic benefit therefore the deep uncertainty originated from etp exacerbates the conflict between agro economic growth and irrigation water supply which reveals a general conclusion for wea nexus management in the arid inland basin that is freshwater availability is a rigid constraint for the potential of local agro economic development although the uncertainty of so modeling e g hydrological model parameters socio economic parameters and remote sensing data and complexity of eco hydrological process e g the physical feedback of irrigation water demand crop yield and nitrogen transport exhibit a huge challenge for wea nexus management in the arid inland basin the proposed optimization framework fig 1 is flexible and can be tailored to implement the multi sectoral multi objective optimization furthermore surface soil moisture is also a critical factor to determine irrigation water use estimation in the arid region the data assimilation of field scale monitoring and multi source remotely sensed hydrological variables may be a promising approach to improve the quantification of irrigation water use based hydrological model meanwhile the transition from flood to drip irrigation could trigger the higher crop et and reduction of soli evaporation and regional recharge to aquifer which may lead to uncertainties of crop coefficients and actual nitrogen loading estimation therefore the future research should focus on integrating these indispensable nexus elements and irrigation technology changes to so model while reducing the uncertainty of satellite remote sensing data for basin scale irrigation water use estimation which will improve the robustness and reliability of optimum scheme in a changing world credit authorship contribution statement jian song conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology software validation visualization

2978,non intrusive image based techniques for measuring surface river velocities have rapidly evolved as a cost effective and safe means for quantifying flow patterns large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv can provide instantaneous surface velocities over a large spatial footprint rapidly and with little pre calibration as compared to traditional techniques assessment of the spatial distribution of flow velocities in hydraulic models has been comparatively harder to achieve than assessment of depth due to logistical challenges but would be aided using large observational datasets that represent the variability and distribution of flow hydraulics additionally the efficacy of image velocimetry in assessing the accuracy of outputs from 2d hydraulic models has not been addressed here we demonstrate how lspiv can be used to calibrate and validate 2d model predictions in a gravel bed river reach lspiv velocities are depth averaged using standard velocity coefficients α and then using the probability concept pc a probabilistic formulation of velocity distributions that accounts for non standard velocity profiles typical in field settings uav surveys were used to acquire video for lspiv and imagery for structure from motion sfm topographic modelling we use spatially dense acoustic doppler current profiler adcp velocity data for benchmark assessment of the velocity outputs of hec ras 2d model simulations 2d model prediction error based on seeded lspiv velocities was within range 4 2 of the adcp parametrised model with improvements in modelled versus predicted velocity correlations up to 7 7 when using pc to depth average lspiv velocities validation bias reduced significantly 11 with tighter error distributions when compared to the adcp based model although additional hydraulic measurements are required to parametrise the probability concept algorithm the performance of 2d hydraulic models calibrated validated with lspiv velocities is on par with traditional techniques demonstrating the potential of this non intrusive low cost approach keywords unpiloted aerial vehicle uav image velocimetry surface velocity lspiv model validation probability concept 1 introduction two dimensional 2d hydraulic modelling has been widely used to assess flood risk at varying temporal such as hourly to daily and spatial scales including regional to catchment the assessment of 2d model simulations has previously been achieved by comparing model outputs to observations of water surface elevations extents and depths bernhofen et al 2018 cea et al 2014 and less commonly velocity barker et al 2018 fischer et al 2015 previous investigations e g gard 2008 lane et al 1999 pasternack et al 2006 williams et al 2013 utilized velocity measurements collected using conventional sensors acoustic doppler current profilers adcp to assess 2d model performance however the use of velocity observations obtained using traditional measurements to assess 2d models has notable challenges including safety considerations during high discharge events and limitations on the spatial extent of observations that can be acquired there remains a pressing need for velocity data that fully samples the range and distribution of channel velocities to validate 2d hydraulic models barker et al 2018 cea et al 2014 wagner and mueller 2001 the advent of powerful cost efficient computing power and precise remote sensing datasets has offered an avenue for new high quality fine spatial scales benchmark data for the validation of flood models wing et al 2017 in particular the use of unpiloted aerial vehicles uavs as a non contact method to investigate flood extents has eliminated the need to deploy staff in dangerous field conditions debell et al 2016 eltner et al 2020 mccabe et al 2017 perks et al 2020 tokarczyk et al 2015 the fine spatial and temporal resolution of uav data has also allowed for the mapping of velocity dynamics of flood events at unprecedented scales al mamari et al 2019 smith et al 2014 leading to improved insights into local catchment processes additionally uav topographic surveys based on structure from motion sfm are providing fine scale digital terrain models dtms which are enhancing model parametrisation efforts such as better descriptions of surface roughness for calibrating mannings roughness debell et al 2016 image velocimetry has generated considerable interest in hydrology presenting capabilities to derive spatially distributed surface flow velocities at high temporal resolution using uavs as a camera platform koutalakis et al 2019 pizarro et al 2020b tauro et al 2017 although various image velocimetry algorithms have been applied to monitor river flows cao et al 2021 perks et al 2020 large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv is the most commonly used algorithm and is in many respects considered proven and tested jodeau et al 2017 lspiv the large scale implementation of piv techniques in outdoor environments is based upon eulerian principles euler 2008 where the average displacement of cluster particles within an interrogation window is measured this can be differentiated from particle tracking velocimetry ptv methods which are based on lagrangian motion amelinckx 1971 that tracks the motion of individual particles over time depth averaged velocities may then be retrieved from lspiv surface velocities using logarithmic velocity profiles by fitting power laws to velocity profiles welber et al 2016 wilcock 1996 or using a velocity coefficient to adjust surface velocities le coz et al 2010 whilst a great deal of research has been dedicated to the development and assessment of the performance of various image velocimetry algorithms such as the impact of seeding densities under low flow conditions pearce et al 2020 inter comparisons of algorithm implementation under diverse hydro geomorphic settings perks et al 2020 and development of workflows to compute and benchmark surface flow velocities eltner et al 2019 few studies have systematically assessed the accuracy of lspiv based surface flow velocities in natural environments the need for high quality data to validate flood models coupled with a benchmark evaluation of image velocimetry data in both high and low flows has significant potential in reducing uncertainty associated with spatially distributed model predictions research evaluating the capability of 2d hydraulic models to accurately reproduce the spatial distribution of water velocity has been limited several studies have validated 2d models using adcp velocity data for example williams et al 2013 demonstrated the capability of spatially dense rtk gnss real time kinematic global navigation satellite system positioned acoustic doppler current profiler adcp data in the calibration and verification of a 2d hydraulic model meanwhile barker et al 2018 evaluated adcp and kayak positioned with rtk gnss particle surface velocity vector methods to validate a 2d model concluding that surface velocity tracking data outperforms fixed point data validation for all the statistical validation metrics in practice most 2d model assessment efforts that have used velocity data have done so using limited location samples usually with selected cross sections where 1d current meter time averaged velocity data or 2d acoustic instrumentation measurements have been collected leaving room for significant uncertainties and errors for example kasvi et al 2015 used four adcp cross sections to validate a 2 1 km long 2d model tiffan et al 2002 used two adcp cross sections to validate a 33 km long 2d model while parsapour moghaddam and rennie 2018 used one adcp cross section to validate a 0 19 km long 3d model they all concluded that more field data would have resulted in more robust validation outcomes when simulating flow dynamics using 2d models a small number of cross sections to assess model simulations are insufficient it is also time intensive to identify appropriate cross sections and then gather velocity measurements further classical wading and adcp methods are not evolving with the scales of model assessment required and they remain remarkably slow field techniques pasternack 2011 in summary the acquisition of adcp velocity measurements are limited in i shallow rivers as observations can only be acquired beyond a vertical blanking distance ii turbulent conditions due to boat instability and bedload transport and iii high velocities due to logistical challenges with respect to the latter challenge in some situations remote controlled boats flener et al 2015 and rtk gnss positioning can be used to overcome bias in bottom tracking due to bedload transport rennie and church 2010 williams et al 2015 but challenges monitoring high flows still remain prevalent in many situations although the use of non contact methods to estimate surface velocities in riverine environments has been demonstrated e g pearce et al 2020 pumo et al 2021 ran et al 2016 the majority of studies have relied on a commonly established multiplicative constant known as a velocity index typically varying between 0 70 and 0 90 for the computation of depth averaged velocity bechle and wu 2014 the use of a constant velocity index for translation of surface velocities not only fails to account for atypical velocity distributions such as when maximum velocity occurs below the water surface but it also assumes that the vertical velocity distributions in a river channel can be characterized using a logarithmic or power law which is not always true moramarco et al 2017 an alternative approach for accurately estimating two dimensional velocity distributions based on the entropy probability density function of velocity was proposed by chiu 1987 previous studies have demonstrated that the maximum entropy method can be a suitable means to constrain velocity bias towards known parameters thus serving as a suitable approach to relate surface velocities to depth averaged velocities marini et al 2011 the first objective of this paper is to investigate whether spatially continuous surface velocities computed using lspiv can be used to accurately calibrate and validate 2d hydraulic model simulations in a natural environment we aim to demonstrate the utility of models fully parametrised using lspiv as compared to those calibrated validated using spatially dense adcp data the second objective is to evaluate the utility of the entropy based surface velocity method chiu 1987 named probability concept pc as a mathematical basis for transforming lspiv derived surface velocities to depth averaged velocities in order to account for velocity distributions that do not conform to logarithmic or power laws within a shallow gravel bed river we provide an explicit assessment of the variance between numerical model velocity simulations based on adcp observations and lspiv derived estimates the spatial uncertainties in 2d model simulations based on both adcp and lspiv are assessed using standard hydraulic model performance metrics advancing prior studies in this research domain e g barker et al 2018 pasternack et al 2006 this work presents a hitherto untested application of spatially explicit high resolution lspiv derived velocities in calibrating and validating a 2d hydraulic model calibration and validation terminology used in this paper follows the definitions of refsgaard and henriksen 2004 the following sections describe the study site outline the methods that are used to generate the model topography and detail the field surveys used to acquire adcp lspiv and electromagnetic flow meter measurements the next section presents the results from 2d calibration and validation using adcp then lspiv measurements a discussion follows that examines the hydraulic predictions and assesses the uncertainty and value of both model simulations 2 study site this investigation is undertaken along a restored reach of swindale beck cumbria england fig 1 which is a 13 4 km2 sub catchment of the river eden restoration of the study reach was undertaken in 2016 and involved channel re meandering with 890 m of a new sinuous channel positioned along the course of a paleochannel replacing 750 m of straightened channel wildhaweswater 2020 post restoration the river is considerably more geomorphologically diverse being characterised by pools riffles and gravel bars and is geomorphologically active in response to high flow events the floodplain is mostly vegetated with species rich hay meadow bog and grassland catchment descriptors derived from the uk flood estimation handbook feh institute of hydrology 1999 were used to estimate the median annual

of the 2d hydraulic model domain is shown in fig 1 within this extent a set of image velocimetry and adcp observations were acquired along a reach that is approximately 540 m long 3 methodology the experiments conducted within the study reach are described in the experimental framework fig 2 which commenced with the acquisition of uav imagery still oblique used to generate a detailed terrain model using sfm photogrammetry section 3 1 uav video sequences were subsequently acquired on 24 february 2021 over two sub reaches hereafter referred to as sw1 and sw2 fig 1 conventional water velocity measurements were conducted using an adcp section 3 2 and a current meter section 3 3 adcp river velocity measurements were collected during the falling limb of a storm event that occurred on 24 february 2021 and peaked at 20 6 m3 s the adcp dataset was processed to derive velocity magnitude vectors which were used to calibrate validate the 2d hydraulic model uav videos were processed using the lspiv algorithm pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 to generate instantaneous surface velocity vectors section 3 4 a subsequent field campaign to acquire flow meter measurements was conducted on 21 june 2021 during the summer low flow period at an average discharge of 2 5 m3 s flow meter measurements provided detailed vertical velocity distribution profiles that were used to parametrise the probability concept algorithm chiu 1987 for depth averaging of lspiv surface velocities section 3 5 hydraulic modelling was then performed using a 2d model hec ras 6 0 brunner et al 2020 following which an assessment of model velocity outputs was conducted using conventional adcp measurements and lspiv measurements the following sub sections provide further details on these methods 3 1 dtm generation 3 1 1 inundated area rtk gnss and echo sounding a field campaign was undertaken using a hybrid approach to map dry and inundated areas of the study reach a leica gs10 receiver was positioned over a surveyed base station in gnss mode to survey channel bathymetry within the study reach a combination of wading surveys using a leica gs10 antenna mounted on a pole in rtk gnss mode and vertical beam echo sounding observations from a sontek m9 adcp with rtk gnss positioning from a leica gs16 rtk gnss antenna were deployed during the wading survey an operator traversed the river channel collecting bed bank toe and water edge rtk gnss points with approximately 1 m point spacing the resulting composite wading based and adcp based dataset comprised over 13 000 bed level measurements with a mean density of 1 77 points m 2 a dtm of the river channel was then generated in arcgis pro by interpolating a triangular irregular network tin from the aggregated wading and adcp based rtk gnss datasets a delaunay conforming triangulation was used ensuring that breakline segments were densified linear interpolation was then used to convert the channel tin into a 0 2 m dtm 3 1

images acquired by a dji phantom 4 rtk uav sfm photogrammetry is a technique used to generate a three dimensional point cloud i e structure from the motion of a camera across a scene of interest escobar villanueva et al 2019 dems that have been generated using sfm are now widely used to investigate river floodplain environments e g annis et al 2020 javernick et al 2014 schumann and andreadis 2019 pix4d software was used for sfm photogrammetry following the method reported in stott et al 2020 with guidance based on james et al 2019 table s1 we provide the detailed sfm processing workflow in the supplementary material figure s1 944 images from the uav were automatically geotagged with wgs84 coordinates during acquisition these were then transformed to the etrs89 geodetic reference system used in the uk as the datum for the ordnance survey reference system sfm processing in pix4d was largely automated and comprised three stages to generate both digital surface models dsms and bare terrain dems the initial step involved the computation of key points on the images to enable matching matched images were then processed using automatic aerial triangulation and bundle block adjustment to create a 3d point cloud of the study area manual classification of ground control points gcps was then carried out a matrix of 18 ground control targets each measuring 0 6 0 6 m were laid out within the study reach on dry land a leica gs10 gnss antenna mounted on a 2 m pole was used to observe each of the ground control targets for at least 5 min in gnss static mode postprocessing of the raw gnss observations relative to the base station observations was carried out using proprietary leica geooffice software to establish the true coordinates of the ground control targets to independently evaluate errors in subsequent processing 5 targets were used as check points fig 1a the second and third processing steps involved the generation of a dsm using an inverse distance weighting algorithm and generation of a bare earth dtm by classifying a dense point cloud using a proprietary pix4d machine learning algorithm the accuracy of the uav derived dem was acceptable table 1 with root mean square errors rmse for cps being 0 05 m the fused 0 2 m sfm dtm fig 1a served as the final topographic surface for 2d modelling 3 2 adcp velocity survey data acoustic survey velocity measurements were acquired using a sontek m9 riversurveyor the theory of adcp system operation is discussed in detail by kostaschuk et al 2005 and simpson 2001 the m9 riversurveyor is equipped with four profiling beams 3 0 and 1 0 mhz and one 0 5 mhz vertical beam for depth measurement due to the shallow nature of the river all velocity measurements used the 3 mhz transducers the adcp was mounted on an sontek hydroboard and calibrated as outlined by williams et al 2013 accurate positioning of the moving adcp was provided by a leica gs16 rtk gnss receiver fitted on the trimaran boat this provided rtk corrections to position depth and velocity observations field adcp surveys were conducted during a hydrograph recession in winter february 2021 average discharge during the survey was 13 1 m3 s during field measurements the adcp was dragged in a zig zag trajectory by two operators standing on opposite sides of the riverbank each survey provided over 1000 sample points at a mean spacing of 1 m between transects fig 1 b c with some minor spacing alterations being made to accommodate riverine features such as riffles and shallow gravel bars the adcp logged approximately 1 124 georeferenced velocity ensembles in the x and y directions post processing of the raw adcp outputs focused on the horizontal components x and y of mean velocity sontek s proprietary riversurveyor live software was used to export the datasets to matlab where a custom script was written to extract the horizontal velocity vectors depth averaged velocity magnitude was then calculated from the two horizontal velocity vectors x and y measurements that failed to meet location thresholds 4 gnss satellite observations or where horizontal dilution of precision hdop was 8 were discarded environment canada 2004 points close to the channel edges were also disregarded as the ability of adcps in measuring shallow water velocities is limited by side lobe interference and the instrument s blanking distance distance below the transducer where velocity cannot be measured mueller et al 2013 3 3 flow meter measurements a valeport electromagnetic em flow meter widely used for wading measurements was used to acquire two dimensional water velocities fig 3 the em flow meter has an accuracy of 0 5 of readings plus 5 mm and a range of 5 m s to 5 m s 1 with the ability to operate at a minimum depth of 0 05 m velocity data were collected at six cross sections the vertical velocity profile of each vertical was sampled beginning from the channel bottom to the water surface with a minimum of six and mean of eight individual velocities measured this procedure was repeated from the left to the right bank of each cross section to confirm the location of the vertical containing the maximum velocity the vertical containing the maximum velocity at each cross section referred to as the y axis fulton et al 2020b was then used to parametrise a probability concept algorithm chiu and hsu 2006 for depth averaging of surface velocities in subsequent field experiments 3 4 image velocimetry lspiv surface velocities hydraulic applications of lspiv are based on the conventional piv technique adrian 1991 which was first modified and applied to riverine environments by fujita et al 1998 the computation of flow velocities in lspiv is achieved by interrogating consecutive orthorectified images using cross correlation algorithms e g dobson et al 2014 ran et al 2016 surface velocity is then computed by dividing the displacement of tracer particles by the time interval δt lspiv analysis yields time averaged 2d surface velocity surfaces which can be filtered for errors commonly based on velocity magnitude thresholds a comprehensive discussion of the concepts and applications of lspiv in riverine environments is provided in muste et al 2008 and tauro et al 2017 in this study video sequences were acquired at select locations fig 1 d e along the study reach using the same dji phantom 4 rtk uav used in acquiring images for sfm photogrammetry videos were captured using the uav s default 1 cmos 20 mp camera 8 8 mm focal length at a native resolution of 4 k 3840 2160 and a frame rate of 29 97 frames per second fps in non rtk mode during the field campaign six videos were shot at a flying height of 30 m above the swindale beck with a ground sampling distance gsd of 0 82 cm pixel all videos were shot at nadir with the uav s anti shake 3 axis gimbal countering vibration effects to deliver stable video scenes we processed video sub samples of 5 min 27 sec sw1 and 4 min 04 sec sw2 both recorded at 30 m height from the videos recorded during the field campaigns a total of 856 consecutive images were extracted at a frame rate of 10 hz table 2 summarizes the experimental conditions and frames used in the lspiv analysis to enhance optical tracking of surface water features which are central to the determination of surface water velocities pizarro et al 2020b we continuously introduced biodegradable ecofoam cornstarch chips at a straight and narrow section of the stream during video recording the displacement rate of these highly contrasting artificial tracers also known as seeds in clear water where the channel bed was largely visible provided a sufficiently distinct background for surface velocity computations 3 4 1 pivlab analysis the open source toolbox pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 developed in matlab r2021a mathworks natick ma usa was used to analyse the uav images the pivlab processing workflow consists of three key stages 1 image pre processing 2 image evaluation and 3 post processing individual frames from the two videos were first extracted in pivlab at the frame windows detailed in table 2 this entailed a visual inspection of the videos to identify sequences with either relatively uniform dense seeding or plain river flow these respective windows were trimmed and extracted for further analysis although the uav flights were conducted during favorable weather conditions further stabilization of the extracted images was conducted in the rectification of image velocity results river toolbox patalano et al 2017 to counter residual camera movements stabilized images were loaded on to pivlab for the first stage of analysis image pre processing the image pre processing steps were conducted to enhance the appearance of tracers with respect to the background the pivlab algorithm applies a contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization clahe filter set to 20 pixels to enhance contrast in images we further utilized the high pass filter to supress low frequency background information from the images which helped emphasize particle tracers in the images pivlab features two different cross correlation algorithms for image evaluation d cc single pass direct cross correlation and fft window deformation fast fourier transform correlation with multiple passes and deforming windows both techniques are based on cross correlation of small sub images interrogation areas ias of image pairs to estimate the correlation between image frames this study utilized fft window deformation due to 1 its computational efficiency as compared to dcc and 2 increased accuracy due to the ability to run several passes of fft correlation on the same dataset yielding high spatial resolution velocity vectors at a high signal noise ratios according to the methodology described in thielicke and stamhuis 2014 to obtain optimal parameters for lspiv analysis we conducted sensitivity tests on the sampling rate of image sequences and number of passes of different ia kernels in pivlab figure s2 piv analysis for all scenarios was conducted using four passes with progressively reducing ia window sizes table s2 initial ia sizes were chosen based on criteria suggested by pumo et al 2021 considering values that were not lower than 50 of the minimum image dimensions and higher than twice the maximum presumable frame frame displacement the results of this sensitivity analysis are detailed in the supplementary material table s3 the width of the ias for subsequent passes was obtained by halving the width relative to the previous pass piv analysis was performed with a first pass ia of 512 512 px a second pass of 256 256 px then 128 128 px followed by 64 64 px all with 50 overlap the use of smaller ias resulted in higher resolution vector maps however this also increased noise and the number of erroneous correlations derivatives from pivlab are referenced to an image coordinate system whose origin is typically the top left of the 2d plane calibration of the analysed images was performed to convert the analysed vector units from pixels per frame to m s with reference to control points gcps positioned using the same survey techniques used to observe the position of gcps for sfm photogrammetry to georeference the velocity vectors we specified the offsets of our known co ordinate system in pivlab this shifted the image coordinates and mapped them into a projected coordinate reference system osgb 1936 british national grid that was consistent with the dtm post processing of the vector fields involved a data validation process in pivlab where erroneous vectors outliers were filtered using thresholds which were semi automatically derived by comparing each velocity vector with a lower and upper threshold horizontal velocities u 0 4 to 0 31 m s 1 vertical velocities v 0 36 to 0 35 m s 1 following tests varying the standard deviation and local median filters key determinants in the vector validation process we arrived at values of 8 and 3 respectively for removal of outliers finally residual noise in the vectors was removed by applying a data smoothing technique based on a penalized least squares method garcia 2010 3 5 lspiv depth averaged velocities 3 5 1 surface velocity index to convert the lspiv surface velocity results to depth averaged velocities a surface velocity index coefficient also referred to as alpha α in several studies e g fulton et al 2020a hauet et al 2018 moramarco et al 2017 was computed using a nonlinear generalized reduced gradient optimization algorithm solver we utilized velocities from the adcp calibrated model at the calibration sub reach sw1 to arrive at an appropriate theoretical depth averaging constant several objective functions were used to optimize solver in order to derive a α value in this case i a value of regression slope between the lspiv surface velocities and adcp model depth averaged velocities that yielded a value as close to unity 1 as possible ii the mean velocity difference between lspiv and adcp model velocities a difference of 0 m s 1 and iii a mean error of 0 the optimization algorithm referred to the gradient of each objective function as the input values changed and when the partialderivativesequalled zero an optimum solution of the surface velocity index coefficient was derived 3 5 2 probability concept pc whilst field velocity measurements from the adcp and the 2d model are depth averaged lspiv measurements represent surface flow velocities a conventional method for transforming surface velocity usurf to depth averaged velocity uvert involves the use of a constant known as a surface velocity index α e g creutin et al 2003 le coz et al 2010 legleiter and kinzel 2021 tauro et al 2017 the use of α to translate surface velocities to depth averaged velocities is a simple yet convenient method that assumes that the vertical velocity profile is monotonous and can be characterized by a logarithmic distribution or power law hauet et al 2018 huang 2018 the variability of published α values 0 70 0 90 at any given cross section with stage and variations in channel geometry makes it difficult to select an appropriate value and is thus unreliable for conversion of surface velocities to mean velocities fulton et al 2020b moreover the use of a constant α coefficient fails to account for the dip phenomenon moramarco et al 2017 where the maximum velocity umax occurs below the water surface due to the presence of secondary currents resulting in α 1 fulton and ostrowski 2008 fulton et al 2020a dramais et al 2011 and welber et al 2016 established that the principal source of error in lspiv discharge estimates is the use of a singular α coefficient since cross section specific values from field measurements differed significantly this justified the acquisition of several cross section velocity profiles in order to derive α values using the probability concept the probability concept developed by chiu 1987 is based on shannon s information entropy and can be used to characterize non standard velocity distributions where umax occurs below the water surface the probabilistic approach provides a numerical basis for the transformation of surface velocities to depth averaged velocities and provides a least biased two dimensional velocity distribution that is constrained by known parameters marini et al 2011 velocity and depth data are collected to establish a y axis which is a vertical in the stream cross section that contains the maximum surface velocity fulton et al 2020a chiu and hsu 2006 established that the location of the y axis rarely coincides with the thalweg is static and insensitive to variations in flow stage velocity or channel geometry surface velocities measured using lspiv were transformed to depth averaged velocities using the pc that is based on chiu s original velocity distribution equation chiu and chiou 1986 which maximizes entropy f u in order to find the best velocity distribution fit eqs 2 to 5 summarize the chiu equations used where the probabilistic velocity distribution at any point in the cross section y axis is represented by equation 1 1 u u max m l n 1 e m 1 f u where u velocity as a function of depth at the y axis umax maximum velocity at the y axis m dimensionless probability parameter that describes velocity distribution and f u 0 u f u d u which is the cumulative distribution function or the probability of a randomly sampled point velocity less than or equal to u at cross sections where umax falls below the water surface velocity distribution at the y axis can be characterized by equation 2 2 u u max m l n 1 e m 1 y d h exp 1 y d h where d total distance from the channel bottom to the water surface at the y axis y incremental distance from the channel bottom to the water surface h vertical distance from the water surface to umax an orthogonal coordinate system is used to translate the velocity distribution from probability space to physical space and is used to describe the variables h d and y in equation 2 where umax occurs at the water surface the velocity distribution at the y axis is defined by equation 3 3 u u max m l n 1 e m 1 y d exp 1 y d the probability distribution f u m and h d are all constant at a channel cross section where umax occurs below the water surface lspiv derived surface velocities are used to estimate umax assuming u is equal to ud which is the velocity as which y equals d chiu and hsu 2006 and is represented by equation 4 4 u max ud m ln 1 e m 1 1 1 h d exp 1 1 1 h d 1 the parameter φ which is a function of m was then derived following fulton et al 2020b using point velocities measured along the y axis from the channel bed to the water surface current meter vertical velocity and depth measurements were used to compute umax m φ and h d using a non linear least squares estimator in r v4 1 0 r core team 2013 the gauss newton nonlinear least squares method was used to solve for φ which is a surrogate for umea n umax 3 6 2d hydraulic modelling the open source hydrologic engineering centre river analysis system hec ras version 6 0 developed by the us army corps of engineers was used to simulate depth averaged flow conditions two dimensional unsteady state flow was solved using the full momentum saint venant equations despite the intensive computational demand application of the saint venant equations allowed for a detailed and accurate representation of velocity distributions pilotti et al 2020 in the relatively flat mixed flow river regime that characterizes swindale beck hec ras has previously been used to study channel hydraulics in a wide variety of studies e g afshari et al 2018 shustikova et al 2019 yalcin 2020 further details on the numerical scheme are available in brunner 2002 2018 3 6 1 model configuration and calibration a heterogenous 2d computational mesh of the swindale beck reach was generated using a cell size of 5 5 m hec ras implements a sub grid bathymetry approach that allows for implementation of a coarse grid on fine topographic surfaces which saves on model computation time to simulate fine scale flow velocity commensurate to the resolution of measurements from the adcp and image velocimetry the spatial resolution of the computational reach was refined to 0 5 0 5 m between the channel banks by enforcing a break line running along the thalweg a discharge hydrograph from the united utilities gauging station was used as the inflow boundary condition with flow scaled by a factor of 0 9 to the catchment size since the actual gauging station was located 650 m downstream from the upstream boundary an energy slope gradient equivalent to the normal depth was estimated by computing the bed slope along the terrain profile the energy slope value was used as the outflow boundary condition situated downstream of the computational mesh to avoid errors arising from downstream backwater effects and upstream velocity distributions the boundaries were located appropriately downstream from the domain of interest the 2d model was calibrated at sub reach sw1 for both the adcp model hereinafter referred to as model madcp and the lspiv model hereinafter referred to as model mlspiv by adjusting a spatially discretized manning s roughness coefficient n and eddy viscosity coefficients until model simulations closely matched observed adcp and lspiv velocities fig 4 model simulations were calibrated by varying a spatially discretized manning s roughness coefficient n whilst keeping the n of the overbank zones constant at 0 035 we further calibrated the models using the eddy viscosity terms by turning on hec ras s turbulence mixing coefficients since eddy viscosity in hec ras s numerical scheme is computed as the sum of the longitudinal mixing coefficient dl the transverse mixing coefficient dt and the dimensionless smagorinsky coefficient cs these mixing parameters were calibrated to the spatially distributed adcp model madcp and lspiv velocities model mlspiv the conservative turbulence model formulation which ensures little to no momentum loss was utilized variable time step control using the courant friedrichs lewy condition was used to ensure model stability and better model velocity distributions 3 6 2 calibration validation performance assessment lspiv and adcp observed velocities were compared to the model simulation runs with the adcp calibrated model model madcp serving as an initial benchmark of minimum validation performance indicators whilst there are no set standards for 2d model performance assessment pasternack 2011 proposed a rigorous suite of metrics which can be used to assess 2d model validation performance complemented with some of the hydrological validation metrics presented by moriasi et al 2007 and biondi et al 2012 most of the uncertainty in 2d shallow water models can be quantified thus the assessment metrics used were i regression analysis evaluating the slope of the regression line between observed versus predicted velocities the y intercept regression slope standard error regression intercept standard error and the coefficient of determination r2 ii hydrological performance metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observations rsr iii error statistics mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse standard deviation of error sde and the mean absolute percentage error mape 4 results the results are presented as follows first we report the 2d model calibration results at sub reach sw1 using a subset of adcp data which formed the benchmark for field velocity observations model madcp section 4 1 results of a separate model similarly calibrated at sw1 using lspiv surface velocity data model mlspiv are then presented section 4 1 this is followed by results from the validation model madcp using adcp data at sub reach sw2 section 4 2 1 results of the validation performance of model mlspiv using lspiv surface velocities depth averaged using a spatially constant theoretical coefficient referred to as lspiv α are then presented section 4 2 2 further detailed results of the validation of model mlspiv velocity simulations are reported based on a sub set of lspiv surface velocities within a 1 m distance of three field cross sections all depth averaged using the probability concept hereinafter referred to as lspivpc section 4 2 3 4 1 2d model calibration a sensitivity analysis of the appropriate bed roughness based on previous modelling studies using hec ras e g shustikova et al 2019 set starting n values in the range of 0 025 to 0 033 and was adjusted by 0 002 increments to a final value of 0 030 model madcp and 0 032 model mlspiv eddy viscosity is computed as the sum of the longitudinal dl transverse dt and smagorinsky coefficients dimensionless cs in the hec ras numerical modelling scheme fig 4 shows the calibrated model velocity predictions for sub reach sw1 using the adcp and lspiv datasets simultaneously adjusting the turbulence mixing and dispersion parameters yielded final values of dl 1 dt 0 3 and cs 0 05 for model madcp and dl 1 4 dt 0 26 and cs 0 03 for model mlspiv with both parameterisations yielding the lowest errors in the distribution of modelled velocities computational grid sizes were discretized for the channel and floodplain with a refined grid size of 0 5 m in channel and 5 m for the rest of the floodplain yielding optimum model performance table 3 shows the error analysis results from the calibrated models higher precision of all benchmarks was observed when the river s flow was seeded versus when left unseeded these results are corroborated by other studies such pearce et al 2020 dal sasso et al 2021a b and liu et al 2021 who showed that the lspiv algorithm performs better when tracers which are important for mapping flow fields between image frames whether natural or artificial are abundant on the water surface because of the drastic drop in most assessment benchmarks when using the unseeded flow scenario to calibrate the 2d hydraulic model most notably bias 13 2 and r2 37 5 we used only the seeded runs for model calibration the uncertainty associated with insufficient seeding is discussed section 5 2 1 4 2 2d model validation 4 2 1 adcp model validation adcp data were used to validate the 2d model at sub reach sw2 fig 5 and set a benchmark for comparison with model mlspiv which was fully calibrated and validated using lspiv velocity fields results from the adcp model validation are detailed in table 3 with a final r2 of 0 70 and slope of 0 85 similar studies e g gard 2008 lane et al 1999 pasternack et al 2006 have reported r2 of predicted versus modelled velocity values ranging from 0 4 to 0 99 with slopes between 0 6 and 1 the results from this study were in the upper range of published results the hydrological performance indicator nse yielded an acceptable value at 0 67 with a pbias of 0 13 this shows the 2d model tended towards an overestimation bias with high velocity values being underpredicted whilst low values were overpredicted similar to the findings of barker et al 2018 4 2 2 lspiv α model validation model mlspiv calibrated using lspiv data was validated against all the performance metrics used to evaluate the validation performance of model madcp a surface velocity index α of 0 89 derived using the method described in section 3 5 1 was used to depth average the lspiv velocities at sw2 further optimising the validation results referencing the standard error of the regression slope model mlspiv had a validation error magnitudes half that of model madcp a pbias value of 0 02 indicated a slight model overestimation bias which is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2021 and can also be attributed to the use of a singular coefficient α to transform surface velocities to depth averaged velocities overall there was a strong correlation between modelled velocities and lspiv α velocities with a r2 value of 0 75 and slope of 0 75 these high correlation values can be attributed to not only the quality of the model but also the abundance of lspiv observations which enabled the full statistical structure of the correlation to be revealed as opposed to having fewer validation points which would tend to be biased to low or intermediate velocities 4 2 3 lspivpc model validation different from the initial validation of the model mlspiv which relied on a theoretical constant α to translate lspiv surface velocities to depth averaged velocities a probability based cross sectional validation of the model was carried out using the probability concept to further understand lspiv s performance referred to as lspivpc in 2d model validation three cross sections fig 3 were collected at sub reach sw2 using an em flow meter and vertical velocity profiles sampled at these locations were used to compute φ following which lspiv velocity vectors within a 1 m range of the respective cross sections were extracted for further model validation values of φ which is constant at any cross section and used to transform umax to umean ranged from 0 571 to 0 658 which is consistent with previously published work chiu and hsu 2006 fulton et al 2020b 2018 moramarco et al 2017 where values ranging from 0 522 to 1 have been reported table 4 shows the velocity distributions at the y axis for each cross section of interest which was established through repeat current meter wading measurements goodness of fit statistics table 5 showed the model was validated with correlations outperforming the lspiv α validation results for all but one cross section xs 1 which was located slightly downstream of a riffle bend making it susceptible to well documented turbulence closure uncertainties at such points barker et al 2018 r2 correlation values ranged from 0 73 to 0 81 fig 6 a despite the reduction in data points used to evaluate 2d model performance indicating that φ represented an appropriate velocity distribution unique to each profile pbias values revealed a bias in which higher velocity values were underestimated by lspivpc and lower values overestimated similar to the findings of pasternack et al 2006 indicating the 2d model less accurately reproduced the highest and lowest flows in the channel velocity magnitude correlations between modelled and observed lspivpc velocities closely tied to 1 1 linearity with regression slopes ranging from 0 73 to 1 04 table 5 following conditioning of the regression slope at each section using φ these results are well within peer reviewed studies of 2d model validation barker et al 2018 pasternack et al 2006 comprehensive scatterplot analysis when validating a 2d model using velocity magnitude should also include results of zero intercept values which were suggested by pasternack et al 2006 to be 5 of maximum velocity all regression zero intercept values were well below this threshold mean absolute lspivpc velocity magnitude error as compared to calibrated model results across all cross sections was less than the 15 30 benchmark suggested by pasternack 2011 with the highest value being 24 35 while the highest median error was 24 01 fig 6b the negative mean velocity differences following depth averaging using φ at each cross section can all be explained by the fact that most velocity values were quite low 0 5 m s 1 yet the model typically overpredicted low velocities percent rank analysis of all deviations revealed that 98 of the velocity values had error 50 with outliers falling within a maximum error bin of 75 further mean errors from using lspivpc velocities for model validation reduced by 7 7 as compared to depth averaging using a single constant α fig 6c the histogram analysis of error distributions fig 7 revealed that 98 2 of the data from lspivpc cross sectional validation had an error of 50 or less the mean absolute velocity error across all sections was 16 86 with error peaks observed at xs 3 where 94 4 of the data had errors of 35 or less 5 discussion 5 1 advanced sampling of spatial velocity distributions the calibration and validation of a 2d model using both conventional adcp and lspiv velocities was demonstrated with the performance of the model fully calibrated validated using lspiv data being on par with results reported in peer reviewed literature table 3 4 with both approaches yielding valid performance discussion focuses on the additional novelties introduced by using lspiv surface velocity datasets combined with the probability concept pc for derivation of a velocity depth averaging index φ although field measurements of velocity using adcps can be achieved for depths 80 m e g sontek s m9 the impracticality of deploying them in very fast and deep waters precludes their ability to sample very high velocity events further adcps cannot be operated in very shallow rivers due to the instrument s blanking distance in contrast the capability of lspiv to sample a boarder range of velocities allowed for the collection of previously unattainable velocity data statistical analyses of the results revealed the first key novelty of this study which was the remarkable improvement in model validation performance when using seeded lspiv to parametrise a 2d model instead of adcp data plotting lspivpc velocities against model results yielded coefficient of determination values r2 of between 0 73 and 0 81 which was up to 10 better when compared to the model fully parametrised using adcp data madcp and among the highest values reported in peer reviewed literature for direct velocity magnitude validation of 2d models e g barker et al 2018 fischer et al 2015 gard 2008 a statistical explanation offers insight into this high performance with the ability of lspiv to sample and obtain a wide range and distribution of velocities as compared to the adcp a better characterization of the spatial patterns of velocity was available for analysis in addition the number of lspiv observations which was several orders of magnitude higher than that of the adcp at both sub reaches helped reveal the full statistical structure of the correlations as opposed to having fewer observations which would tend to be biased to either low or intermediate velocities as suggested by pasternack 2011 an appropriate benchmark for determining whether a model has been validated based on velocity simulations should be centred on the magnitude of measurements observed as the greater the number of observations the better the spread of velocity distributions and the resultant r2 correlations departing from the well established method of using selected cross sections to validate 2d models we successfully validated model performance across a wider range of velocities spanning varying morphological structures which are typically left out in velocity validation studies the lspiv surface velocity measurements were generally in very good agreement with the model simulations which can partly be attributed to the rather shallow depth and high gradient of the gravel bed channel given these hydraulic settings the accuracy of lspiv velocities tended to be higher than the adcp s which depends on extrapolation of the top and bottom subsections of the channel to compute velocities similar to an earlier study by baird et al 2021 the 2d model overpredicted high velocities and underpredicted low velocities in both modelling scenarios underlining the added benefit of lspiv that sampled a significantly wider range of velocity bins for a robust analysis of the 2d model s performance the spatially dense coverage of lspiv not only captured the diversity and transitions of low flow velocity fields but presented the possibility for mapping surface velocities in high flow steep channel sections where bankfull flow conditions could typically have ruled out model validation using adcp observations due to physical inaccessibility e g abu aly et al 2014 sawyer et al 2010 5 2 uncertainty 5 2 1 uncertainty of lspiv surface velocity measurements the accuracy of image velocimetry techniques in field conditions is heavily influenced by the ability to identify and track surface features which are central in the computation of surface velocity dal sasso et al 2021b pizarro et al 2020a tauro et al 2017 recent studies by pizarro et al 2020b introduced a tracer seeding metric known as the seeding distribution index sdi in an attempt to identify the optimal spatial distribution of tracers however the errors computed using all the image frames from their study were not different from the optimal window suggested by the sdi therefore the experimental settings adopted in this study focused on the overall performance of natural unseeded velocity estimates versus seeded estimates in assessing spatial velocity outputs from the 2d model field experiments using artificial seed tracers had better model calibration performance across all assessment metrics when compared to unseeded scenarios table 3 the coefficient of determination r2 dropped by 37 5 when the flow was left unseeded this reduction in collinearity between simulated model and observed lspiv data for the unseeded scenarios was unsurprising as the magnitude and spatial distribution of the u and v components of velocity magnitude tended to dramatically decline the nse results further underlined the strong influence of seeding on the reliability of lspiv results with differences of up to 50 in the residual variance in velocity compared to the measured variance these results are consistent with the findings of pearce et al 2020 who observed a high sensitivity of lspiv to seeding density when assessing adcp velocities although the reliability of lspiv results diminishes dramatically under unseeded conditions naves et al 2021 demonstrated that the presence of bubbles caused by raindrops could positively influence cross correlation algorithms this implies future scope for the application of these methods during flooding events which are typically accompanied by heavy rainstorms 5 2 2 variability in velocity coefficient α the accurate derivation of a velocity coefficient α which represents the ratio of surface velocity to depth averaged velocity remains a key source of uncertainty in the use of non contact methods to compute mean channel velocities dal sasso et al 2021a dramais et al 2011 identified the variability of α as the dominant source of error when using lspiv to compute velocity estimates recommending the derivation of site specific α values to the best of our knowledge previously published studies have generally utilised the standard value of α 0 85 assuming a logarithmic vertical velocity distribution e g le coz et al 2010 lewis et al 2018 or derivation of a power law exponent e g johnson and cowen 2017 when translating surface velocities to depth averaged velocities the variability of φ in gravel bed rivers has been reported to be larger lee and julien 2006 further suggesting the requirement for locally calibrated α values moreover α values derived assuming a monotonous velocity distribution fail to account for the dip phenomenon where maximum flow velocity umax occurs below the water surface resulting in α 1 using chiu s pc chiu 1987 which is based on shannon s information entropy shannon 1948 we successfully computed α at three cross sections within the study sub reaches the entropy method showed marked variability in α across xs1 3 table 4 with analysis showing that our results were on the lower end of published values 0 539 0 658 whilst the use of cross section specific α in depth averaging lspiv values had no impact the coefficient of determination r2 tests there was a notable trend in the improvement of other validation metrics such as the best fit trendline slope i e slope tending towards 1 and the values of regression slope standard error and regression intercept standard error all improving substantially results from our study propose that the use of default values of α is insufficient in gravel bed rivers likely due to the influence of bed roughness as suggested by hauet et al 2018 we suggest that probabilistically derived values of α yield better estimates of depth averaged lspiv velocity with the ability to account for the dip phenomenon overall we find that the use of locally derived α using chiu s chiu 1987 probability function more accurately constrains velocity bias at all cross sections table 5 with average errors of 27 73 probability concept φ and 18 90 α indicating a 37 9 improvement in velocity predictions these findings are expected and corroborated by other studies such as moramarco et al 2017 the median error did not exceed 24 and 34 for the probability concept and velocity index methods respectively with the 95th percentile of errors at every cross section being lower when assuming a non logarithmic velocity distribution our field experiments show that using alternative velocity distribution approaches provides better fits of depth averaged velocity profiles than reliance on theoretical a priori indices commonly used in several studies further research is necessary to ascertain the variability of φ with different discharges as well as its dependence on cross sectional distancing 6 conclusion this investigation has shown that a 2d hydraulic model can be accurately calibrated and validated using image velocimetry data yielding results comparable to traditional adcp approaches further we established that the uncertainty commonly associated with depth averaging surface flows in standard lspiv workflows can be significantly reduced using numerical methods based on the channel s hydraulic parameters φ y axis umax rather than relying on the often used constants or indices based on an assumption of logarithmic velocity distributions in channels the use of probabilistically derived φ for surface velocity averaging resulted in error reductions of up to 7 7 when validating a hydraulic model however the probability concept approach does require in channel cross section measurements to obtain y axis profile with maximum velocity data to the authors knowledge the joint deployment of lspiv with the probability concept for estimation of depth averaged channel velocities in assessing simulated flows in a natural gravel bed river has not been demonstrated previously this study allowed two other significant conclusions to be reached first whilst image velocimetry and adcp yielded comparable model performance the greater size of the lspiv dataset which spanned a wider range of flows and depths allowed for the full statistical structure of field measurements to be revealed however the limitations of lspiv derived surface velocity fields were clear in conditions where there is sparse seeding on water surfaces or in poorly illuminated conditions whilst this assessment is not a direct comparison between lspiv and adcp observations it demonstrates the capabilities of lspiv in deriving meaningful data that can be used to calibrate and validate 2d models second and more broadly the use of high quality datasets to validate model performance is key for the reduction in uncertainty in model predictions the overall reduction in error distributions and low bias during model validation demonstrates that lspiv coupled with the pc is a fit for purpose tool in evaluating reach scale hydraulic model predictions credit authorship

velocimetry lspiv can provide instantaneous surface velocities over a large spatial footprint rapidly and with little pre calibration as compared to traditional techniques assessment of the spatial distribution of flow velocities in hydraulic models has been comparatively harder to achieve than assessment of depth due to logistical challenges but would be aided using large observational datasets that represent the variability and distribution of flow hydraulics additionally the efficacy of image velocimetry in assessing the accuracy of outputs from 2d hydraulic models has not been addressed here we demonstrate how lspiv can be used to calibrate and validate 2d model predictions in a gravel bed river reach lspiv velocities are depth averaged using standard velocity coefficients α and then using the probability concept pc a probabilistic formulation of velocity distributions that accounts for non standard velocity profiles typical in field settings uav surveys were used to acquire video for lspiv and imagery for structure from motion sfm topographic modelling we use spatially dense acoustic doppler current profiler adcp velocity data for benchmark assessment of the velocity outputs of hec ras 2d model simulations 2d model prediction error based on seeded lspiv velocities was within range 4 2 of the adcp parametrised model with improvements in modelled versus predicted velocity correlations up to 7 7 when using pc to depth average lspiv velocities validation bias reduced significantly 11 with tighter error distributions when compared to the adcp based model although additional hydraulic measurements are required to parametrise the probability concept algorithm the performance of 2d hydraulic models calibrated validated with lspiv velocities is on par with traditional techniques demonstrating the potential of this non intrusive low cost approach keywords unpiloted aerial vehicle uav image velocimetry surface velocity lspiv model validation probability concept 1 introduction two dimensional 2d hydraulic modelling has been widely used to assess flood risk at varying temporal such as hourly to daily and spatial scales including regional to catchment the assessment of 2d model simulations has previously been achieved by comparing model outputs to observations of water surface elevations extents and depths bernhofen et al 2018 cea et al 2014 and less commonly velocity barker et al 2018 fischer et al 2015 previous investigations e g gard 2008 lane et al 1999 pasternack et al 2006 williams et al 2013 utilized velocity measurements collected using conventional sensors acoustic doppler current profilers adcp to assess 2d model performance however the use of velocity observations obtained using traditional measurements to assess 2d models has notable challenges including safety considerations during high discharge events and limitations on the spatial extent of observations that can be acquired there remains a pressing need for velocity data that fully samples the range and distribution of channel velocities to validate 2d hydraulic models barker et al 2018 cea et al 2014 wagner and mueller 2001 the advent of powerful cost efficient computing power and precise remote sensing datasets has offered an avenue for new high quality fine spatial scales benchmark data for the validation of flood models wing et al 2017 in particular the use of unpiloted aerial vehicles uavs as a non contact method to investigate flood extents has eliminated the need to deploy staff in dangerous field conditions debell et al 2016 eltner et al 2020 mccabe et al 2017 perks et al 2020 tokarczyk et al 2015 the fine spatial and temporal resolution of uav data has also allowed for the mapping of velocity dynamics of flood events at unprecedented scales al mamari et al 2019 smith et al 2014 leading to improved insights into local catchment processes additionally uav topographic surveys based on structure from motion sfm are providing fine scale digital terrain models dtms which are enhancing model parametrisation efforts such as better descriptions of surface roughness for calibrating mannings roughness debell et al 2016 image velocimetry has generated considerable interest in hydrology presenting capabilities to derive spatially distributed surface flow velocities at high temporal resolution using uavs as a camera platform koutalakis et al 2019 pizarro et al 2020b tauro et al 2017 although various image velocimetry algorithms have been applied to monitor river flows cao et al 2021 perks et al 2020 large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv is the most commonly used algorithm and is in many respects considered proven and tested jodeau et al 2017 lspiv the large scale implementation of piv techniques in outdoor environments is based upon eulerian principles euler 2008 where the average displacement of cluster particles within an interrogation window is measured this can be differentiated from particle tracking velocimetry ptv methods which are based on lagrangian motion amelinckx 1971 that tracks the motion of individual particles over time depth averaged velocities may then be retrieved from lspiv surface velocities using logarithmic velocity profiles by fitting power laws to velocity profiles welber et al 2016 wilcock 1996 or using a velocity coefficient to adjust surface velocities le coz et al 2010 whilst a great deal of research has been dedicated to the development and assessment of the performance of various image velocimetry algorithms such as the impact of seeding densities under low flow conditions pearce et al 2020 inter comparisons of algorithm implementation under diverse hydro geomorphic settings perks et al 2020 and development of workflows to compute and benchmark surface flow velocities eltner et al 2019 few studies have systematically assessed the accuracy of lspiv based surface flow velocities in natural environments the need for high quality data to validate flood models coupled with a benchmark evaluation of image velocimetry data in both high and low flows has significant potential in reducing uncertainty associated with spatially distributed model predictions research evaluating the capability of 2d hydraulic models to accurately reproduce the spatial distribution of water velocity has been limited several studies have validated 2d models using adcp velocity data for example williams et al 2013 demonstrated the capability of spatially dense rtk gnss real time kinematic global navigation satellite system positioned acoustic doppler current profiler adcp data in the calibration and verification of a 2d hydraulic model meanwhile barker et al 2018 evaluated adcp and kayak positioned with rtk gnss particle surface velocity vector methods to validate a 2d model concluding that surface velocity tracking data outperforms fixed point data validation for all the statistical validation metrics in practice most 2d model assessment efforts that have used velocity data have done so using limited location samples usually with selected cross sections where 1d current meter time averaged velocity data or 2d acoustic instrumentation measurements have been collected leaving room for significant uncertainties and errors for example kasvi et al 2015 used four adcp cross sections to validate a 2 1 km long 2d model tiffan et al 2002 used two adcp cross sections to validate a 33 km long 2d model while parsapour moghaddam and rennie 2018 used one adcp cross section to validate a 0 19 km long 3d model they all concluded that more field data would have resulted in more robust validation outcomes when simulating flow dynamics using 2d models a small number of cross sections to assess model simulations are insufficient it is also time intensive to identify appropriate cross sections and then gather velocity measurements further classical wading and adcp methods are not evolving with the scales of model assessment required and they remain remarkably slow field techniques pasternack 2011 in summary the acquisition of adcp velocity measurements are limited in i shallow rivers as observations can only be acquired beyond a vertical blanking distance ii turbulent conditions due to boat instability and bedload transport and iii high velocities due to logistical challenges with respect to the latter challenge in some situations remote controlled boats flener et al 2015 and rtk gnss positioning can be used to overcome bias in bottom tracking due to bedload transport rennie and church 2010 williams et al 2015 but challenges monitoring high flows still remain prevalent in many situations although the use of non contact methods to estimate surface velocities in riverine environments has been demonstrated e g pearce et al 2020 pumo et al 2021 ran et al 2016 the majority of studies have relied on a commonly established multiplicative constant known as a velocity index typically varying between 0 70 and 0 90 for the computation of depth averaged velocity bechle and wu 2014 the use of a constant velocity index for translation of surface velocities not only fails to account for atypical velocity distributions such as when maximum velocity occurs below the water surface but it also assumes that the vertical velocity distributions in a river channel can be characterized using a logarithmic or power law which is not always true moramarco et al 2017 an alternative approach for accurately estimating two dimensional velocity distributions based on the entropy probability density function of velocity was proposed by chiu 1987 previous studies have demonstrated that the maximum entropy method can be a suitable means to constrain velocity bias towards known parameters thus serving as a suitable approach to relate surface velocities to depth averaged velocities marini et al 2011 the first objective of this paper is to investigate whether spatially continuous surface velocities computed using lspiv can be used to accurately calibrate and validate 2d hydraulic model simulations in a natural environment we aim to demonstrate the utility of models fully parametrised using lspiv as compared to those calibrated validated using spatially dense adcp data the second objective is to evaluate the utility of the entropy based surface velocity method chiu 1987 named probability concept pc as a mathematical basis for transforming lspiv derived surface velocities to depth averaged velocities in order to account for velocity distributions that do not conform to logarithmic or power laws within a shallow gravel bed river we provide an explicit assessment of the variance between numerical model velocity simulations based on adcp observations and lspiv derived estimates the spatial uncertainties in 2d model simulations based on both adcp and lspiv are assessed using standard hydraulic model performance metrics advancing prior studies in this research domain e g barker et al 2018 pasternack et al 2006 this work presents a hitherto untested application of spatially explicit high resolution lspiv derived velocities in calibrating and validating a 2d hydraulic model calibration and validation terminology used in this paper follows the definitions of refsgaard and henriksen 2004 the following sections describe the study site outline the methods that are used to generate the model topography and detail the field surveys used to acquire adcp lspiv and electromagnetic flow meter measurements the next section presents the results from 2d calibration and validation using adcp then lspiv measurements a discussion follows that examines the hydraulic predictions and assesses the uncertainty and value of both model simulations 2 study site this investigation is undertaken along a restored reach of swindale beck cumbria england fig 1 which is a 13 4 km2 sub catchment of the river eden restoration of the study reach was undertaken in 2016 and involved channel re meandering with 890 m of a new sinuous channel positioned along the course of a paleochannel replacing 750 m of straightened channel wildhaweswater 2020 post restoration the river is considerably more geomorphologically diverse being characterised by pools riffles and gravel bars and is geomorphologically active in response to high flow events the floodplain is mostly vegetated with species rich hay meadow bog and grassland catchment descriptors derived from the uk flood estimation handbook feh institute of hydrology 1999 were used to estimate the median annual maximum flood qmed which is 26 96 m3 s a telemetry gauging station united utilities station 761113 records stage in the river at a weir every 15 min from 1997 to present hankin et al 2019 the extent of the 2d hydraulic model domain is shown in fig 1 within this extent a set of image velocimetry and adcp observations were acquired along a reach that is approximately 540 m long 3 methodology the experiments conducted within the study reach are described in the experimental framework fig 2 which commenced with the acquisition of uav imagery still oblique used to generate a detailed terrain model using sfm photogrammetry section 3 1 uav video sequences were subsequently acquired on 24 february 2021 over two sub reaches hereafter referred to as sw1 and sw2 fig 1 conventional water velocity measurements were conducted using an adcp section 3 2 and a current meter section 3 3 adcp river velocity measurements were collected during the falling limb of a storm event that occurred on 24 february 2021 and peaked at 20 6 m3 s the adcp dataset was processed to derive velocity magnitude vectors which were used to calibrate validate the 2d hydraulic model uav videos were processed using the lspiv algorithm pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 to generate instantaneous surface velocity vectors section 3 4 a subsequent field campaign to acquire flow meter measurements was conducted on 21 june 2021 during the summer low flow period at an average discharge of 2 5 m3 s flow meter measurements provided detailed vertical velocity distribution profiles that were used to parametrise the probability concept algorithm chiu 1987 for depth averaging of lspiv surface velocities section 3 5 hydraulic modelling was then performed using a 2d model hec ras 6 0 brunner et al 2020 following which an assessment of model velocity outputs was conducted using conventional adcp measurements and lspiv measurements the following sub sections provide further details on these methods 3 1 dtm generation 3 1 1 inundated area rtk gnss and echo sounding a field campaign was undertaken using a hybrid approach to map dry and inundated areas of the study reach a leica gs10 receiver was positioned over a surveyed base station in gnss mode to survey channel bathymetry within the study reach a combination of wading surveys using a leica gs10 antenna mounted on a pole in rtk gnss mode and vertical beam echo sounding observations from a sontek m9 adcp with rtk gnss positioning from a leica gs16 rtk gnss antenna were deployed during the wading survey an operator traversed the river channel collecting bed bank toe and water edge rtk gnss points with approximately 1 m point spacing the resulting composite wading based and adcp based dataset comprised over 13 000 bed level measurements with a mean density of 1 77 points m 2 a dtm of the river channel was then generated in arcgis pro by interpolating a triangular irregular network tin from the aggregated wading and adcp based rtk gnss datasets a delaunay conforming triangulation was used ensuring that breakline segments were densified linear interpolation was then used to convert the channel tin into a 0 2 m dtm 3 1 2 dry areas sfm photogrammetry sfm with multiview stereo photogrammetry hereafter together referred to as sfm photogrammetry carrivick and smith 2019 was used to generate a dem of the study area using images acquired by a dji phantom 4 rtk uav sfm photogrammetry is a technique used to generate a three dimensional point cloud i e structure from the motion of a camera across a scene of interest escobar villanueva et al 2019 dems that have been generated using sfm are now widely used to investigate river floodplain environments e g annis et al 2020 javernick et al 2014 schumann and andreadis 2019 pix4d software was used for sfm photogrammetry following the method reported in stott et al 2020 with guidance based on james et al 2019 table s1 we provide the detailed sfm processing workflow in the supplementary material figure s1 944 images from the uav were automatically geotagged with wgs84 coordinates during acquisition these were then transformed to the etrs89 geodetic reference system used in the uk as the datum for the ordnance survey reference system sfm processing in pix4d was largely automated and comprised three stages to generate both digital surface models dsms and bare terrain dems the initial step involved the computation of key points on the images to enable matching matched images were then processed using automatic aerial triangulation and bundle block adjustment to create a 3d point cloud of the study area manual classification of ground control points gcps was then carried out a matrix of 18 ground control targets each measuring 0 6 0 6 m were laid out within the study reach on dry land a leica gs10 gnss antenna mounted on a 2 m pole was used to observe each of the ground control targets for at least 5 min in gnss static mode postprocessing of the raw gnss observations relative to the base station observations was carried out using proprietary leica geooffice software to establish the true coordinates of the ground control targets to independently evaluate errors in subsequent processing 5 targets were used as check points fig 1a the second and third processing steps involved the generation of a dsm using an inverse distance weighting algorithm and generation of a bare earth dtm by classifying a dense point cloud using a proprietary pix4d machine learning algorithm the accuracy of the uav derived dem was acceptable table 1 with root mean square errors rmse for cps being 0 05 m the fused 0 2 m sfm dtm fig 1a served as the final topographic surface for 2d modelling 3 2 adcp velocity survey data acoustic survey velocity measurements were acquired using a sontek m9 riversurveyor the theory of adcp system operation is discussed in detail by kostaschuk et al 2005 and simpson 2001 the m9 riversurveyor is equipped with four profiling beams 3 0 and 1 0 mhz and one 0 5 mhz vertical beam for depth measurement due to the shallow nature of the river all velocity measurements used the 3 mhz transducers the adcp was mounted on an sontek hydroboard and calibrated as outlined by williams et al 2013 accurate positioning of the moving adcp was provided by a leica gs16 rtk gnss receiver fitted on the trimaran boat this provided rtk corrections to position depth and velocity observations field adcp surveys were conducted during a hydrograph recession in winter february 2021 average discharge during the survey was 13 1 m3 s during field measurements the adcp was dragged in a zig zag trajectory by two operators standing on opposite sides of the riverbank each survey provided over 1000 sample points at a mean spacing of 1 m between transects fig 1 b c with some minor spacing alterations being made to accommodate riverine features such as riffles and shallow gravel bars the adcp logged approximately 1 124 georeferenced velocity ensembles in the x and y directions post processing of the raw adcp outputs focused on the horizontal components x and y of mean velocity sontek s proprietary riversurveyor live software was used to export the datasets to matlab where a custom script was written to extract the horizontal velocity vectors depth averaged velocity magnitude was then calculated from the two horizontal velocity vectors x and y measurements that failed to meet location thresholds 4 gnss satellite observations or where horizontal dilution of precision hdop was 8 were discarded environment canada 2004 points close to the channel edges were also disregarded as the ability of adcps in measuring shallow water velocities is limited by side lobe interference and the instrument s blanking distance distance below the transducer where velocity cannot be measured mueller et al 2013 3 3 flow meter measurements a valeport electromagnetic em flow meter widely used for wading measurements was used to acquire two dimensional water velocities fig 3 the em flow meter has an accuracy of 0 5 of readings plus 5 mm and a range of 5 m s to 5 m s 1 with the ability to operate at a minimum depth of 0 05 m velocity data were collected at six cross sections the vertical velocity profile of each vertical was sampled beginning from the channel bottom to the water surface with a minimum of six and mean of eight individual velocities measured this procedure was repeated from the left to the right bank of each cross section to confirm the location of the vertical containing the maximum velocity the vertical containing the maximum velocity at each cross section referred to as the y axis fulton et al 2020b was then used to parametrise a probability concept algorithm chiu and hsu 2006 for depth averaging of surface velocities in subsequent field experiments 3 4 image velocimetry lspiv surface velocities hydraulic applications of lspiv are based on the conventional piv technique adrian 1991 which was first modified and applied to riverine environments by fujita et al 1998 the computation of flow velocities in lspiv is achieved by interrogating consecutive orthorectified images using cross correlation algorithms e g dobson et al 2014 ran et al 2016 surface velocity is then computed by dividing the displacement of tracer particles by the time interval δt lspiv analysis yields time averaged 2d surface velocity surfaces which can be filtered for errors commonly based on velocity magnitude thresholds a comprehensive discussion of the concepts and applications of lspiv in riverine environments is provided in muste et al 2008 and tauro et al 2017 in this study video sequences were acquired at select locations fig 1 d e along the study reach using the same dji phantom 4 rtk uav used in acquiring images for sfm photogrammetry videos were captured using the uav s default 1 cmos 20 mp camera 8 8 mm focal length at a native resolution of 4 k 3840 2160 and a frame rate of 29 97 frames per second fps in non rtk mode during the field campaign six videos were shot at a flying height of 30 m above the swindale beck with a ground sampling distance gsd of 0 82 cm pixel all videos were shot at nadir with the uav s anti shake 3 axis gimbal countering vibration effects to deliver stable video scenes we processed video sub samples of 5 min 27 sec sw1 and 4 min 04 sec sw2 both recorded at 30 m height from the videos recorded during the field campaigns a total of 856 consecutive images were extracted at a frame rate of 10 hz table 2 summarizes the experimental conditions and frames used in the lspiv analysis to enhance optical tracking of surface water features which are central to the determination of surface water velocities pizarro et al 2020b we continuously introduced biodegradable ecofoam cornstarch chips at a straight and narrow section of the stream during video recording the displacement rate of these highly contrasting artificial tracers also known as seeds in clear water where the channel bed was largely visible provided a sufficiently distinct background for surface velocity computations 3 4 1 pivlab analysis the open source toolbox pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 developed in matlab r2021a mathworks natick ma usa was used to analyse the uav images the pivlab processing workflow consists of three key stages 1 image pre processing 2 image evaluation and 3 post processing individual frames from the two videos were first extracted in pivlab at the frame windows detailed in table 2 this entailed a visual inspection of the videos to identify sequences with either relatively uniform dense seeding or plain river flow these respective windows were trimmed and extracted for further analysis although the uav flights were conducted during favorable weather conditions further stabilization of the extracted images was conducted in the rectification of image velocity results river toolbox patalano et al 2017 to counter residual camera movements stabilized images were loaded on to pivlab for the first stage of analysis image pre processing the image pre processing steps were conducted to enhance the appearance of tracers with respect to the background the pivlab algorithm applies a contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization clahe filter set to 20 pixels to enhance contrast in images we further utilized the high pass filter to supress low frequency background information from the images which helped emphasize particle tracers in the images pivlab features two different cross correlation algorithms for image evaluation d cc single pass direct cross correlation and fft window deformation fast fourier transform correlation with multiple passes and deforming windows both techniques are based on cross correlation of small sub images interrogation areas ias of image pairs to estimate the correlation between image frames this study utilized fft window deformation due to 1 its computational efficiency as compared to dcc and 2 increased accuracy due to the ability to run several passes of fft correlation on the same dataset yielding high spatial resolution velocity vectors at a high signal noise ratios according to the methodology described in thielicke and stamhuis 2014 to obtain optimal parameters for lspiv analysis we conducted sensitivity tests on the sampling rate of image sequences and number of passes of different ia kernels in pivlab figure s2 piv analysis for all scenarios was conducted using four passes with progressively reducing ia window sizes table s2 initial ia sizes were chosen based on criteria suggested by pumo et al 2021 considering values that were not lower than 50 of the minimum image dimensions and higher than twice the maximum presumable frame frame displacement the results of this sensitivity analysis are detailed in the supplementary material table s3 the width of the ias for subsequent passes was obtained by halving the width relative to the previous pass piv analysis was performed with a first pass ia of 512 512 px a second pass of 256 256 px then 128 128 px followed by 64 64 px all with 50 overlap the use of smaller ias resulted in higher resolution vector maps however this also increased noise and the number of erroneous correlations derivatives from pivlab are referenced to an image coordinate system whose origin is typically the top left of the 2d plane calibration of the analysed images was performed to convert the analysed vector units from pixels per frame to m s with reference to control points gcps positioned using the same survey techniques used to observe the position of gcps for sfm photogrammetry to georeference the velocity vectors we specified the offsets of our known co ordinate system in pivlab this shifted the image coordinates and mapped them into a projected coordinate reference system osgb 1936 british national grid that was consistent with the dtm post processing of the vector fields involved a data validation process in pivlab where erroneous vectors outliers were filtered using thresholds which were semi automatically derived by comparing each velocity vector with a lower and upper threshold horizontal velocities u 0 4 to 0 31 m s 1 vertical velocities v 0 36 to 0 35 m s 1 following tests varying the standard deviation and local median filters key determinants in the vector validation process we arrived at values of 8 and 3 respectively for removal of outliers finally residual noise in the vectors was removed by applying a data smoothing technique based on a penalized least squares method garcia 2010 3 5 lspiv depth averaged velocities 3 5 1 surface velocity index to convert the lspiv surface velocity results to depth averaged velocities a surface velocity index coefficient also referred to as alpha α in several studies e g fulton et al 2020a hauet et al 2018 moramarco et al 2017 was computed using a nonlinear generalized reduced gradient optimization algorithm solver we utilized velocities from the adcp calibrated model at the calibration sub reach sw1 to arrive at an appropriate theoretical depth averaging constant several objective functions were used to optimize solver in order to derive a α value in this case i a value of regression slope between the lspiv surface velocities and adcp model depth averaged velocities that yielded a value as close to unity 1 as possible ii the mean velocity difference between lspiv and adcp model velocities a difference of 0 m s 1 and iii a mean error of 0 the optimization algorithm referred to the gradient of each objective function as the input values changed and when the partialderivativesequalled zero an optimum solution of the surface velocity index coefficient was derived 3 5 2 probability concept pc whilst field velocity measurements from the adcp and the 2d model are depth averaged lspiv measurements represent surface flow velocities a conventional method for transforming surface velocity usurf to depth averaged velocity uvert involves the use of a constant known as a surface velocity index α e g creutin et al 2003 le coz et al 2010 legleiter and kinzel 2021 tauro et al 2017 the use of α to translate surface velocities to depth averaged velocities is a simple yet convenient method that assumes that the vertical velocity profile is monotonous and can be characterized by a logarithmic distribution or power law hauet et al 2018 huang 2018 the variability of published α values 0 70 0 90 at any given cross section with stage and variations in channel geometry makes it difficult to select an appropriate value and is thus unreliable for conversion of surface velocities to mean velocities fulton et al 2020b moreover the use of a constant α coefficient fails to account for the dip phenomenon moramarco et al 2017 where the maximum velocity umax occurs below the water surface due to the presence of secondary currents resulting in α 1 fulton and ostrowski 2008 fulton et al 2020a dramais et al 2011 and welber et al 2016 established that the principal source of error in lspiv discharge estimates is the use of a singular α coefficient since cross section specific values from field measurements differed significantly this justified the acquisition of several cross section velocity profiles in order to derive α values using the probability concept the probability concept developed by chiu 1987 is based on shannon s information entropy and can be used to characterize non standard velocity distributions where umax occurs below the water surface the probabilistic approach provides a numerical basis for the transformation of surface velocities to depth averaged velocities and provides a least biased two dimensional velocity distribution that is constrained by known parameters marini et al 2011 velocity and depth data are collected to establish a y axis which is a vertical in the stream cross section that contains the maximum surface velocity fulton et al 2020a chiu and hsu 2006 established that the location of the y axis rarely coincides with the thalweg is static and insensitive to variations in flow stage velocity or channel geometry surface velocities measured using lspiv were transformed to depth averaged velocities using the pc that is based on chiu s original velocity distribution equation chiu and chiou 1986 which maximizes entropy f u in order to find the best velocity distribution fit eqs 2 to 5 summarize the chiu equations used where the probabilistic velocity distribution at any point in the cross section y axis is represented by equation 1 1 u u max m l n 1 e m 1 f u where u velocity as a function of depth at the y axis umax maximum velocity at the y axis m dimensionless probability parameter that describes velocity distribution and f u 0 u f u d u which is the cumulative distribution function or the probability of a randomly sampled point velocity less than or equal to u at cross sections where umax falls below the water surface velocity distribution at the y axis can be characterized by equation 2 2 u u max m l n 1 e m 1 y d h exp 1 y d h where d total distance from the channel bottom to the water surface at the y axis y incremental distance from the channel bottom to the water surface h vertical distance from the water surface to umax an orthogonal coordinate system is used to translate the velocity distribution from probability space to physical space and is used to describe the variables h d and y in equation 2 where umax occurs at the water surface the velocity distribution at the y axis is defined by equation 3 3 u u max m l n 1 e m 1 y d exp 1 y d the probability distribution f u m and h d are all constant at a channel cross section where umax occurs below the water surface lspiv derived surface velocities are used to estimate umax assuming u is equal to ud which is the velocity as which y equals d chiu and hsu 2006 and is represented by equation 4 4 u max ud m ln 1 e m 1 1 1 h d exp 1 1 1 h d 1 the parameter φ which is a function of m was then derived following fulton et al 2020b using point velocities measured along the y axis from the channel bed to the water surface current meter vertical velocity and depth measurements were used to compute umax m φ and h d using a non linear least squares estimator in r v4 1 0 r core team 2013 the gauss newton nonlinear least squares method was used to solve for φ which is a surrogate for umea n umax 3 6 2d hydraulic modelling the open source hydrologic engineering centre river analysis system hec ras version 6 0 developed by the us army corps of engineers was used to simulate depth averaged flow conditions two dimensional unsteady state flow was solved using the full momentum saint venant equations despite the intensive computational demand application of the saint venant equations allowed for a detailed and accurate representation of velocity distributions pilotti et al 2020 in the relatively flat mixed flow river regime that characterizes swindale beck hec ras has previously been used to study channel hydraulics in a wide variety of studies e g afshari et al 2018 shustikova et al 2019 yalcin 2020 further details on the numerical scheme are available in brunner 2002 2018 3 6 1 model configuration and calibration a heterogenous 2d computational mesh of the swindale beck reach was generated using a cell size of 5 5 m hec ras implements a sub grid bathymetry approach that allows for implementation of a coarse grid on fine topographic surfaces which saves on model computation time to simulate fine scale flow velocity commensurate to the resolution of measurements from the adcp and image velocimetry the spatial resolution of the computational reach was refined to 0 5 0 5 m between the channel banks by enforcing a break line running along the thalweg a discharge hydrograph from the united utilities gauging station was used as the inflow boundary condition with flow scaled by a factor of 0 9 to the catchment size since the actual gauging station was located 650 m downstream from the upstream boundary an energy slope gradient equivalent to the normal depth was estimated by computing the bed slope along the terrain profile the energy slope value was used as the outflow boundary condition situated downstream of the computational mesh to avoid errors arising from downstream backwater effects and upstream velocity distributions the boundaries were located appropriately downstream from the domain of interest the 2d model was calibrated at sub reach sw1 for both the adcp model hereinafter referred to as model madcp and the lspiv model hereinafter referred to as model mlspiv by adjusting a spatially discretized manning s roughness coefficient n and eddy viscosity coefficients until model simulations closely matched observed adcp and lspiv velocities fig 4 model simulations were calibrated by varying a spatially discretized manning s roughness coefficient n whilst keeping the n of the overbank zones constant at 0 035 we further calibrated the models using the eddy viscosity terms by turning on hec ras s turbulence mixing coefficients since eddy viscosity in hec ras s numerical scheme is computed as the sum of the longitudinal mixing coefficient dl the transverse mixing coefficient dt and the dimensionless smagorinsky coefficient cs these mixing parameters were calibrated to the spatially distributed adcp model madcp and lspiv velocities model mlspiv the conservative turbulence model formulation which ensures little to no momentum loss was utilized variable time step control using the courant friedrichs lewy condition was used to ensure model stability and better model velocity distributions 3 6 2 calibration validation performance assessment lspiv and adcp observed velocities were compared to the model simulation runs with the adcp calibrated model model madcp serving as an initial benchmark of minimum validation performance indicators whilst there are no set standards for 2d model performance assessment pasternack 2011 proposed a rigorous suite of metrics which can be used to assess 2d model validation performance complemented with some of the hydrological validation metrics presented by moriasi et al 2007 and biondi et al 2012 most of the uncertainty in 2d shallow

for field velocity observations model madcp section 4 1 results of a separate model similarly calibrated at sw1 using lspiv surface velocity data model mlspiv are then presented section 4 1 this is followed by results from the validation model madcp using adcp data at sub reach sw2 section 4 2 1 results of the validation performance of model mlspiv using lspiv surface velocities depth averaged using a spatially constant theoretical coefficient referred to as lspiv α are then presented section 4 2 2 further detailed results of the validation of model mlspiv velocity simulations are reported based on a sub set of lspiv surface velocities within a 1 m distance of three field cross sections all depth averaged using the probability concept hereinafter referred to as lspivpc section 4 2 3 4 1 2d model calibration a sensitivity analysis of the appropriate bed roughness based on previous modelling studies using hec ras e g shustikova et al 2019 set starting n values in the range of 0 025 to 0 033 and was adjusted by 0 002 increments to a final value of 0 030 model madcp and 0 032 model mlspiv eddy viscosity is computed as the sum of the longitudinal dl transverse dt and smagorinsky coefficients dimensionless cs in the hec ras numerical modelling scheme fig 4 shows the calibrated model velocity predictions for sub reach sw1 using the adcp and lspiv datasets simultaneously adjusting the turbulence mixing and dispersion parameters yielded final values of dl 1 dt 0 3 and cs 0 05 for model madcp and dl 1 4 dt 0 26 and cs 0 03 for model mlspiv with both parameterisations yielding the lowest errors in the distribution of modelled velocities computational grid sizes were discretized for the channel and floodplain with a refined grid size of 0 5 m in channel and 5 m for the rest of the floodplain yielding optimum model performance table 3 shows the error analysis results from the calibrated models higher precision of all benchmarks was observed when the river s flow was seeded versus when left unseeded these results are corroborated by other studies such pearce et al 2020 dal sasso et al 2021a b and liu et al 2021 who showed that the lspiv algorithm performs better when tracers which are important for mapping flow fields between image frames whether natural or artificial are abundant on the water surface because of the drastic drop in most assessment benchmarks when using the unseeded flow scenario to calibrate the 2d hydraulic model most notably bias 13 2 and r2 37 5 we used only the seeded runs for model calibration the uncertainty associated with insufficient seeding is discussed section 5 2 1 4 2 2d model validation 4 2 1 adcp model validation adcp data were used to validate the 2d model at sub reach sw2 fig 5 and set a benchmark for comparison with model mlspiv which was fully calibrated and validated using lspiv velocity fields results from the adcp model validation are detailed in table 3 with a final r2 of 0 70 and slope of 0 85 similar studies e g gard 2008 lane et al 1999 pasternack et al 2006 have reported r2 of predicted versus modelled velocity values ranging from 0 4 to 0 99 with slopes between 0 6 and 1 the results from this study were in the upper range of published results the hydrological performance indicator nse yielded an acceptable value at 0 67 with a pbias of 0 13 this shows the 2d model tended towards an overestimation bias with high velocity values being underpredicted whilst low values were overpredicted similar to the findings of barker et al 2018 4 2 2 lspiv α model validation model mlspiv calibrated using lspiv data was validated against all the performance metrics used to evaluate the validation performance of model madcp a surface velocity index α of 0 89 derived using the method described in section 3 5 1 was used to depth average the lspiv velocities at sw2 further optimising the validation results referencing the standard error of the regression slope model mlspiv had a validation error magnitudes half that of model madcp a pbias value of 0 02 indicated a slight model overestimation bias which is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2021 and can also be attributed to the use of a singular coefficient α to transform surface velocities to depth averaged velocities overall there was a strong correlation between modelled velocities and lspiv α velocities with a r2 value of 0 75 and slope of 0 75 these high correlation values can be attributed to not only the quality of the model but also the abundance of lspiv observations which enabled the full statistical structure of the correlation to be revealed as opposed to having fewer validation points which would tend to be biased to low or intermediate velocities 4 2 3 lspivpc model validation different from the initial validation of the model mlspiv which relied on a theoretical constant α to translate lspiv surface velocities to depth averaged velocities a probability based cross sectional validation of the model was carried out using the probability concept to further understand lspiv s performance referred to as lspivpc in 2d model validation three cross sections fig 3 were collected at sub reach sw2 using an em flow meter and vertical velocity profiles sampled at these locations were used to compute φ following which lspiv velocity vectors within a 1 m range of the respective cross sections were extracted for further model validation values of φ which is constant at any cross section and used to transform umax to umean ranged from 0 571 to 0 658 which is consistent with previously published work chiu and hsu 2006 fulton et al 2020b 2018 moramarco et al 2017 where values ranging from 0 522 to 1 have been reported table 4 shows the velocity distributions at the y axis for each cross section of interest which was established through repeat current meter wading measurements goodness of fit statistics table 5 showed the model was validated with correlations outperforming the lspiv α validation results for all but one cross section xs 1 which was located slightly downstream of a riffle bend making it susceptible to well documented turbulence closure uncertainties at such points barker et al 2018 r2 correlation values ranged from 0 73 to 0 81 fig 6 a despite the reduction in data points used to evaluate 2d model performance indicating that φ represented an appropriate velocity distribution unique to each profile pbias values revealed a bias in which higher velocity values were underestimated by lspivpc and lower values overestimated similar to the findings of pasternack et al 2006 indicating the 2d model less accurately reproduced the highest and lowest flows in the channel velocity magnitude correlations between modelled and observed lspivpc velocities closely tied to 1 1 linearity with regression slopes ranging from 0 73 to 1 04 table 5 following conditioning of the regression slope at each section using φ these results are well within peer reviewed studies of 2d model validation barker et al 2018 pasternack et al 2006 comprehensive scatterplot analysis when validating a 2d model using velocity magnitude should also include results of zero intercept values which were suggested by pasternack et al 2006 to be 5 of maximum velocity all regression zero intercept values were well below this threshold mean absolute lspivpc velocity magnitude error as compared to calibrated model results across all cross sections was less than the 15 30 benchmark suggested by pasternack 2011 with the highest value being 24 35 while the highest median error was 24 01 fig 6b the negative mean velocity differences following depth averaging using φ at each cross section can all be explained by the fact that most velocity values were quite low 0 5 m s 1 yet the model typically overpredicted low velocities percent rank analysis of all deviations revealed that 98 of the velocity values had error 50 with outliers falling within a maximum error bin of 75 further mean errors from using lspivpc velocities for model validation reduced by 7 7 as compared to depth averaging using a single constant α fig 6c the histogram analysis of error distributions fig 7 revealed that 98 2 of the data from lspivpc cross sectional validation had an error of 50 or less the mean absolute velocity error across all sections was 16 86 with error peaks observed at xs 3 where 94 4 of the data had errors of 35 or less 5 discussion 5 1 advanced sampling of spatial velocity distributions the calibration and validation of a 2d model using both conventional adcp and lspiv velocities was demonstrated with the performance of the model fully calibrated validated using lspiv data being on par with results reported in peer reviewed literature table 3 4 with both approaches yielding valid performance discussion focuses on the additional novelties introduced by using lspiv surface velocity datasets combined with the probability concept pc for derivation of a velocity depth averaging index φ although field measurements of velocity using adcps can be achieved for depths 80 m e g sontek s m9 the impracticality of deploying them in very fast and deep waters precludes their ability to sample very high velocity events further adcps cannot be operated in very shallow rivers due to the instrument s blanking distance in contrast the capability of lspiv to sample a boarder range of velocities allowed for the collection of previously unattainable velocity data statistical analyses of the results revealed the first key novelty of this study which was the remarkable improvement in model validation performance when using seeded lspiv to parametrise a 2d model instead of adcp data plotting lspivpc velocities against model results yielded coefficient of determination values r2 of between 0 73 and 0 81 which was up to 10 better when compared to the model fully parametrised using adcp data madcp and among the highest values reported in peer reviewed literature for direct velocity magnitude validation of 2d models e g barker et al 2018 fischer et al 2015 gard 2008 a statistical explanation offers insight into this high performance with the ability of lspiv to sample and obtain a wide range and distribution of velocities as compared to the adcp a better characterization of the spatial patterns of velocity was available for analysis in addition the number of lspiv observations which was several orders of magnitude higher than that of the adcp at both sub reaches helped reveal the full statistical structure of the correlations as opposed to having fewer observations which would tend to be biased to either low or intermediate velocities as suggested by pasternack 2011 an appropriate benchmark for determining whether a model has been validated based on velocity simulations should be centred on the magnitude of measurements observed as the greater the number of observations the better the spread of velocity distributions and the resultant r2 correlations departing from the well established method of using selected cross sections to validate 2d models we successfully validated model performance across a wider range of velocities spanning varying morphological structures which are typically left out in velocity validation studies the lspiv surface velocity measurements were generally in very good agreement with the model simulations which can partly be attributed to the rather shallow depth and high gradient of the gravel bed channel given these hydraulic settings the accuracy of lspiv velocities tended to be higher than the adcp s which depends on extrapolation of the top and bottom subsections of the channel to compute velocities similar to an earlier study by baird et al 2021 the 2d model overpredicted high velocities and underpredicted low velocities in both modelling scenarios underlining the added benefit of lspiv that sampled a significantly wider range of velocity bins for a robust analysis of the 2d model s performance the spatially dense coverage of lspiv not only captured the diversity and transitions of low flow velocity fields but presented the possibility for mapping surface velocities in high flow steep channel sections where bankfull flow conditions could typically have ruled out model validation using adcp observations due to physical inaccessibility e g abu aly et al 2014 sawyer et al 2010 5 2 uncertainty 5 2 1 uncertainty of lspiv surface velocity measurements the accuracy of image velocimetry techniques in field conditions is heavily influenced by the ability to identify and track surface features which are central in the computation of surface velocity dal sasso et al 2021b pizarro et al 2020a tauro et al 2017 recent studies by pizarro et al 2020b introduced a tracer seeding metric known as the seeding distribution index sdi in an attempt to identify the optimal spatial distribution of tracers however the errors computed using all the image frames from their study were not different from the optimal window suggested by the sdi therefore the experimental settings adopted in this study focused on the overall performance of natural unseeded velocity estimates versus seeded estimates in assessing spatial velocity outputs from the 2d model field experiments using artificial seed tracers had better model calibration performance across all assessment metrics when compared to unseeded scenarios table 3 the coefficient of determination r2 dropped by 37 5 when the flow was left unseeded this reduction in collinearity between simulated model and observed lspiv data for the unseeded scenarios was unsurprising as the magnitude and spatial distribution of the u and v components of velocity magnitude tended to dramatically decline the nse results further underlined the strong influence of seeding on the reliability of lspiv results with differences of up to 50 in the residual variance in velocity compared to the measured variance these results are consistent with the findings of pearce et al 2020 who observed a high sensitivity of lspiv to seeding density when assessing adcp velocities although the reliability of lspiv results diminishes dramatically under unseeded conditions naves et al 2021 demonstrated that the presence of bubbles caused by raindrops could positively influence cross correlation algorithms this implies future scope for the application of these methods during flooding events which are typically accompanied by heavy rainstorms 5 2 2 variability in velocity coefficient α the accurate derivation of a velocity coefficient α which represents the ratio of surface velocity to depth averaged velocity remains a key source of uncertainty in the use of non contact methods to compute mean channel velocities dal sasso et al 2021a dramais et al 2011 identified the variability of α as the dominant source of error when using lspiv to compute velocity estimates recommending the derivation of site specific α values to the best of our knowledge previously published studies have generally utilised the standard value of α 0 85 assuming a logarithmic vertical velocity distribution e g le coz et al 2010 lewis et al 2018 or derivation of a power law exponent e g johnson and cowen 2017 when translating surface velocities to depth averaged velocities the variability of φ in gravel bed rivers has been reported to be larger lee and julien 2006 further suggesting the requirement for locally calibrated α values moreover α values derived assuming a monotonous velocity distribution fail to account for the dip phenomenon where maximum flow velocity umax occurs below the water surface resulting in α 1 using chiu s pc chiu 1987 which is based on shannon s information entropy shannon 1948 we successfully computed α at three cross sections within the study sub reaches the entropy method showed marked variability in α across xs1 3 table 4 with analysis showing that our results were on the lower end of published values 0 539 0 658 whilst the use of cross section specific α in depth averaging lspiv values had no impact the coefficient of determination r2 tests there was a notable trend in the improvement of other validation metrics such as the best fit trendline slope i e slope tending towards 1 and the values of regression slope standard error and regression intercept standard error all improving substantially results from our study propose that the use of default values of α is insufficient in gravel bed rivers likely due to the influence of bed roughness as suggested by hauet et al 2018 we suggest that probabilistically derived values of α yield better estimates of depth averaged lspiv velocity with the ability to account for the dip phenomenon overall we find that the use of locally derived α using chiu s chiu 1987 probability function more accurately constrains velocity bias at all cross sections table 5 with average errors of 27 73 probability concept φ and 18 90 α indicating a 37 9 improvement in velocity predictions these findings are expected and corroborated by other studies such as moramarco et al 2017 the median error did not exceed 24 and 34 for the probability concept and velocity index methods respectively with the 95th percentile of errors at every cross section being lower when assuming a non logarithmic velocity distribution our field experiments show that using alternative velocity distribution approaches provides better fits of depth averaged velocity profiles than reliance on theoretical a priori indices commonly used in several studies further research is necessary to ascertain the variability of φ with different discharges as well as its dependence on cross sectional distancing 6 conclusion this investigation has shown that a 2d hydraulic model can be accurately calibrated and validated using image velocimetry data yielding results comparable to traditional adcp approaches further we established that the uncertainty commonly associated with depth averaging surface flows in standard lspiv workflows can be significantly reduced using numerical methods based on the channel s hydraulic parameters φ y axis umax rather than relying on the often used constants or indices based on an assumption of logarithmic velocity distributions in channels the use of probabilistically derived φ for surface velocity averaging resulted in error reductions of up to 7 7 when validating a hydraulic model however the probability concept approach does require in channel cross section measurements to obtain y axis profile with maximum velocity data to the authors knowledge the joint deployment of lspiv with the probability concept for estimation of depth averaged channel velocities in assessing simulated flows in a natural gravel bed river has not been demonstrated previously this study allowed two other significant conclusions to be reached first whilst image velocimetry and adcp yielded comparable model performance the greater size of the lspiv dataset which spanned a wider range of flows and depths allowed for the full statistical structure of field measurements to be revealed however the limitations of lspiv derived surface velocity fields were clear in conditions where there is sparse seeding on water surfaces or in poorly illuminated conditions whilst this assessment is not a direct comparison between lspiv and adcp observations it demonstrates the capabilities of lspiv in deriving meaningful data that can be used to calibrate and validate 2d models second and more broadly the use of high quality datasets to validate model performance is key for the reduction in uncertainty in model predictions the overall reduction in error distributions and low bias during model validation demonstrates that lspiv coupled with the pc is a fit for purpose tool in evaluating reach scale hydraulic model predictions credit authorship

however the nasa modis et products mod16a2 and its derivatives do not have good correlations with all global paddy rice et observations in this research mod16 model sensitivity analyses and parameter

boundary layer berg et al 2016 yao et al 2019 globally paddy rice plantation areas exceeded 167 million hectares in the year 2017 with more than 90 found in cloud prone east and southeast asia faostat 2017 because paddy rice fields are conventionally flooded with different depths of the water layer from the start date of field flooding and transplanting fftd to the harvest these can be ecologically related to shallow wetlands which highly impact the surface temperature dynamics at regional scale through changes in et liu et al 2018 pan et al 2020 xue et al 2021 hence reliable assessments of et

biophysical products from new parameter retrieval algorithms improve the accuracy of et estimates according to their model principles a review of historical profiles of et model development broadly categorizes the majority of them into the following two groups temperature based et models and conductance based et models chen and liu 2020 the theoretical basis of the second model is the penman

conduct product validations and calibrations velpuri et al 2013 validated the mod16 products against eddy covariance ec tower observations in the united states and reported an underestimation in the lower et and overestimation in the high et contrasting this significant overestimation in the lower et was observed by tang et al 2015 in china miralles et al 2016 observed a considerable underestimation in et in tropical and subtropical areas by mod16 products however there were few reports to make comparisons between the mod16 products and ec et observations in paddy rice fields our previous paper found that mod16 products could not accurately regenerate 8 day et of paddy rice in south korea especially for the period from the fftd to flowering stage with distinct underestimations by two to three times xue et al 2021 a comprehensive evaluation indicated that large one to threefold underestimations at early growth stage by the 8 day mod16 products were evident in haean of south

underestimations by the 30 m et products in the continental usa conus et30m that used mod16 framework algorithm were also observed fig s1 in addition the 8 day mod16 et was significantly reduced by almost onefold than observations over the whole rice growing season in both 2013 and 2014 in internaitional rice research institute irri of the philippines fig s1 the global mod16 and conus et30m could not be used to represent daily et in paddy rice fields globally why do the mod16 et products fail to recur paddy rice et at all global observation sites to answer this question sensitivity analysis of mod16 et model parameters was conducted at the second section of the main body aiming to identify the model parameters to which prediction accuracy of the mod16 et framework algorithm was most sensitive then optimization strategies to better constrain the most important parameters were introduced at the third section in this research underestimation of daily net radiation rn in overcast conditions and less satisfactory reconstruction of crop lai growth trajectory from the fftd to the harvest were identified as two primary causes a novel light and temperature driven growth model and a phenology based lai temporal smoothing method fusion algorithm ltdg phenos and an improved rn estimation method were developed which helped to ameliorate mod16 et model accuracy significantly as shown at the fourth section 2 sensitivity analysis of mod16 model parameters although the mod16 global et model that requires no site calibration is applied on a per pixel level mu et al 2011 exclusive parameter refinements for different land cover types remain necessary khan et al 2018 he et al 2019 in lines with previous studies at regional global vegetation scales khan et al 2018 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 structural variables of the mod16 et model with potential effects on et prediction including rn canopy resistance rs lai for canopy et estimates aerodynamic resistance rtot and soil moisture constraint factor ƒsm for soil evaporation estimates were assessed to find the primary variables responsible for the observed underestimations in et by mod16 2 1 performances of the original rn estimation equation the metric time to set up model parameters in the mod16 et algorithm was divided into daytime and nighttime the daytime metric was defined as the diurnal period from early morning to late afternoon when incident solar radiations were greater than 20 0 w m 2 below which leaf transpiration completely stopped the original rn equation in the mod16 et algorithm framework mu et al 2011 running et al 2019 was 1 r n 1 α r s σ ε a ε s 273 15 t air 4 where α is the surface albedo ɛa is the atmospheric emissivity ɛs is the surface or screen level emissivity 0 97 as the default value tair is the land surface air temperature σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and rs is the incoming solar radiation the right hand second term is the formula to calculate rnl rn is the sum of the net shortwave radiations and the rnl air temperature is the only atmospheric variable for ɛa estimation under all sky conditions in the original mod16 et algorithm framework eqn 2 daytime net longwave radiation rnl and rn estimations by the original rn equation and field observations are shown in fig 1 daytime rnl observations had significant fluctuations in seasonal changing profile in both 2013 and 2014 in irri and from 2018 to 2019 in lishui fig 1a d site descriptions shown in table 2 and supporting information the mean daytime rnl in 2013 and 2014 was 1 99 and 1 43 mj m 2 daytime 1 respectively whereas coefficients of variation cvs were as high as 0 54 and 1 03 respectively the mean daytime rnl predicted by the original rnl equation was 4 16 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2013 and 4 07 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2014 which was approximately twofold lower than that of field observations the cvs of daytime rnl predicted by the original rnl equation were both 0 08 in 2013 and 2014 which were smaller in value than those of field observations meanwhile the original rnl equation failed to track the seasonal amplitude and strength of rnl from 2018 to 2019 in lishui fig 1c and d the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for daytime rnl predicted by the original rnl equation were 2 4 mj m 2 daytime 1 and 2 67 the rnl was significantly overestimated by the original mod16 et model as shown in eqn 1 rnl estimation is the second most important item for accurate rn estimation daytime rn estimations by the original rn equation are shown in fig 1e h the original rn equation could track the daily fluctuations of daytime rn observations whereas cv of the predicted rn was 0 43 which was significantly higher by 34 4 than that of field observations the rmse in rn estimation was 1 87 mj m 2 daytime 1 increasing a larger proportion of the mean observation by up to 15 64 the possible effects of rn estimation on daily et estimates are evaluated in table 1 the idso equation with changes in ɛa estimate atmospheric emissivity used for calculating the daytime and nighttime rnl idso 1981 was selected as benchmark we observed that differences in the 8 day et estimate between the original rn equation and the idso equation were less than 1 0 mm under high solar radiations under various temperature conditions which were negligible as compared to the et of 48 0 mm 8 day 1 table 1 scenario 1 for overcast days with lower rs e g 5 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 the predicted 8 day et by the original rn equation varied from 2 0 to 4 0 mm 8 day 1 under a variety of day and night temperatures however significantly higher predictions were obtained by the idso equation with the highest et of approximately 15 0 mm 8 day 1 which was four times higher than that of the original rn equation under overcast conditions the sensitive index si defined as the defference between et estimation and its benchmark which indicates the sensitive response of et predictions to the two rn estimate methods was high up to 233 14 under overcast conditions whereas it was only 1 71 under clear sky conditions these results suggested that significant underestimation in rn was likely one of the major biophysical mechanisms responsible for the observed underestimation in et prediction by the mod16 et products especially in overcast conditions 2 2 performances of the original rs estimation equation ladder type assignment method with escalating rs was applied to evaluate the effects of rs on et estimation under two contrasting types of lands i e flooded high coverage land scenario 4 in table 1 and flooded open land scenario 5 in table 1 significant impacts of different rs on daily et estimation were observed when the paddy rice field was completely covered by dense canopies fc 0 8 in scenario 4 compared to the et prediction of 50 s m 1 by rs the predicted 8 day et of 120 s m 1 by rs showed a major decline of approximately 4 0 mm and a further 4 0 mm decline was observed when rs increased to 240 s m 1 scenario 4 relatively high si was obtained between low medium high rs significant effects of escalating rs which were found in scenario 4 disappeared under the condition of low canopy coverage 0 3 of fc in scenario 5 which was supported by a narrowed si from 17 61 in scenario 4 to 4 14 in scenario 5 at the same extent of variation in rs the rs was critical in determining the daily et when plant transpiration outpaced soil evaporation this implied that et underestimation at an early growing stage by the original mod16 et algorithm was not primarily related to rs although rs values could be responsible for the observed underestimations during the rice growing season in 2013 and 2014 in irri it did not completely account for the observed onefold underestimation 2 3 performances of the original satellite lai products the mod15a2h lai products that were selected as input lai variable in the original mod16 et model were selected as the benchmark fig 2 the mod15a2h lai products failed to track canopy expansion and senescence trajectories of paddy rice in all eddy covariance ec observsation sites and years the lai predictions by the mod15a2h products showed significant underestimations in haean and mase fig 2a e the mod15a2h lai predictions were clearly higher than field measurements in esse from 2007 to 2008 fig 2f and g which might cause overestimation of et in the two years by the mod16 products lai values predicted by the mod15a2h were less than 2 5 m2 m 2 throughout the rice growing season and mismatched with rice phenology in both 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 2h and i in twt from 2009 to 2010 fig 2l s and in lishui from 2018 to 2019 fig 2j and k the effects of lai estimation on 8 day et prediction through its influences on canopy transpiration were assessed using scenario 6 in table 1 canopy transpiration reduced by half at fc of 0 4 as compared with the higher fc of up to 0 8 resulting in an escalating si of up to 100 02 this suggested the importance of lai retrieval using the remote sensing technique for accurate predictions of canopy transpiration and et satellite evi is the most powerful measure to retrieve crop lai huete et al 2002 seasonal changing profiles of cloud free landsat evi evilandsat and modis evi evimodis observations in each ec site are shown in fig 3 a s satellite data processing shown in supporting information the single rice system is practiced in haean with a peak evi in july and august fig 3a frequent heavy cloud events indicated by surface reflectance of the blue band ρblue 0 15 contaminated the landsat and mod09a1 evi products whereas the monopeak curve of evimodis overlaid with growth phenology of paddy rice was observed fig 3a the seasonal tendencies of evimodis matched well with the single rice phenology development in mase esse and twt from 2010 to 2016 fig 3b s site descriptions shown in table 2 and supporting information however the significant phenology seasonality of evimodis was not observed in the double cropping rice system in 2013 and 2014 in irri in 2009 in twt and in single cropping rice system in 2018 and 2019 in lishui fig 3h l irregular evi data that deviated from rice phenological development were also evident using the landsat products in 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 3h and i while evilandsat time series matched with rice phenology in 2009 in twt and in 2018 and 2019 in lishui fig 3j l comparable evi seasonal profiles were observed in mase in 2002 and 2004 between modis and landsat products fig 3b evilandsat was less than 0 4 in haean and the seasonal trajectory did not match well with rice phenology fig 3a there were only two high quality evilandsat observations within the rice growing season in 2003 in mase fig 3c high quality evilandsat observations were na not available in 2005 in mase and were absent in 2012 in twt fig 3e and o the maximum evilandsat values of the rice growing season were greater than the maximum evimodis from 2011 to 2016 in twt fig 3k p especially in 2013 and 2014 the absence of evilandsat modis sensitivity to rice phenology could be attributed to selective landsat image acquisition date in 2010 in haean and in 2005 in mase coarse spatial resolution of modis evi in 2018 and 2019 in lishui and in 2009 in twt and persistent slight and severe cloud cover during rainy seasons in 2013 and 2014 in irri as shown by the frequent occurrence of enhanced ρblue fig 3a h and i the daily laiobs sg lai observations smoothed by the savitzky golay model and estimated lai values by the sg smoothing modis 8 day evi time series evimodis sg shown in figure 3 and by using a general lai evi model shown in figure 5a are shown in figures 4a i large discrepancies in seasonal amplitude and strength between laiobs sg and simulated lai with the general lai evi model were found in haean mase and esse figures 4a g similar to the lai predictions using the mod15a2h lai products the lai predictions after the evimax phase by the general lai evi model were significantly lower than field observations figures 4a d f g and significant underestimation appeared before the evimax phase fig 4 b c this resulted in a statistical correlation between lai and evimodis sg insets in fig 4a i response characteristics of lai to evimodis sg throughout the rice growing season were featured by two asymmetrical non linear patterns with two significantly different lai values for one value of evi insets in fig 4a g the outstanding indicator of phenological metrics that characterized the asymmetrical patterns well was the evimax by which the lai evimodis sg seasonality could be separated into two phases the before evimax stage and the after evimax stage fig 5 b the results of the standard major axis analysis reported substantial differences in the slope of model fit between the before and after evimax phases p 0 001 the phenology dependent model fits for field lai and evi observations were also observed in three sampling sites gimje si gyehwa myeon and gwangju in south korea wherein lai and evi measurements were made using the harvest method and portable multispectral radiometer fig 5c in addition significant differences in the slope of the lai evi relationship between the before evimax stage and the after evimax stage were present p 0 04 fig 5c the rice growing season was divided into two phases according to the evimax to retrieve the lai from satellite evi observations there was no significant difference in the slopes of the non linear fit after the evimax stage between the lai evimodis sg and field lai evi p 0 93 likelihood ratio 0 01 whereas it was significant for the before evimax stage p 0 001 likelihood ratio 66 95 remarkable discrepancies in lai estimation were anticipated between lai evimodis sg and field lai evi fits especially at an evi value of more than 0 5 in this study the field in situ lai evi fits were selected for daily lai estimation in paddy rice fields as they were independent datasets collected at three locations of south korea the phenology dependent lai evimodis sg relationships were not found in 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 4h and i mainly owning to irregular performance of modis 8 day evi over rice growing seasons efforts to improve the modeling accuracy in et were strongly constrained in irri if rice lai development could not be reproduced correctly hence improper lai parameterizations in the original mod16 et model were key parameters resulting in the observed onefold underestimation in mod16 8 day et in irri these results suggested that one to twofold underestimation in mod16 8 day et during canopy expansion and senescence phases was primarily ascribed to the general lai evi model that covers the whole rice growing season and low density of high quality satellite evi observations for cloud prone and small paddy fields 2 4 performances of the original rtot and ƒsm estimation equations the et model with rtot of 20 s m 1 predicted the 8 day et that changed from 32 to 34 mm under various daytime and night temperatures scenario 3 in table 1 the et model driven by 60 and 120 s m 1 rtot resulted in a slight decline by 1 to 3 mm as compared to the initial rtot of 20 s m 1 the si values derived for varying rtot from 20 to 60 s m 1 and from 60 to 120 s m 1 were 1 91 and 5 17 respectively increasing the rtot by sixfold i e from 20 s m 1 to 120 s m 1 did not decrease the et estimate by the same extent as varying rtot furthermore replacing rtot formula of the original mod16 algorithm by thom s dynamic roughness parameters thom 1975 exerted little influence on modeling performance fig s2 although large errors in et estimation may be introduced by incorrect rtot parameterization under flooded open land rtot could not explain the observed twofold underestimations using the original mod16 et model during the early growing stage and during land preparation when canopies of rice seedlings were small and a large part of the flooded rice field was directly exposed to air we compared the daily ƒsm that was calculated by the formula settings reported by fisher et al 2008 and the original mod16 et model eqn 6 and the relative extractable water rew observations the rew observations were derived from soil sensor measurements in paddy rice and mungbean farmlands in 2013 and 2014 irri fig 6 a and b for paddy rice fields the original mod16 et algorithm resulted in significantly lower ƒsm estimations that persisted from the time of land preparation to harvesting in 2013 and 2014 nevertheless the predictions followed the field observations well in the mungbean field suggesting that the original mod16 et algorithm could predict the daily ƒsm of the non flooded mungbean farmland but not the flooded paddy rice fields in contrast fisher s formula settings efficiently tracked the daily rew in paddy rice fields as compared to the mungbean land because of the relatively higher β value in their study which released the soil water stress extent substantial overestimations by fisher s formula settings were found in the mungbean farmland in 2013 and 2014 observed differences in the ƒsm estimation between the original mod16 et algorithm and fisher s formula settings were ascribed to the determination of the β value the direct effects of ƒsm estimation on 8 day et were further evaluated by scenario 2 in table 1 the 8 day et estimated by the original mod16 et algorithm varied from 13 to 17 mm under clear sky and various air temperature conditions whereas predictions by fisher s formula settings changed from 30 to 32 mm under the same weather conditions an si as high as 110 was evident while assessing the ƒsm effects between them et estimation of the original mod16 et algorithm was reduced by almost twofold compared to that of fisher s formula settings suggesting that the ƒsm was a critical variable for accurate estimation of daily et especially for the flooded open rice fields significant underestimation in et in the flooded open rice fields by the mod16 and conus et30m is related to the constrained soil evaporation fluxes that should have approached potential soil water evaporation which is actually ascribed to uncertainty in the determination of the fftd see results in 4 4 fftd determinations as pointed by he et al 2019 3 mod16 algorithm optimization 3 1 major revisions in daily rn estimation this subsection aims at mod16 model structure optimization by making major revisions in rn estimation and fine tuning surface albedo α vegetation cover fraction fc soil moisture constraint ƒsm and canopy stomatal resistance rs we believe that warmer surroundings on an overcast night than at clear night with few or no clouds are received by the land surface in overcast conditions because of more downward radiation energy originating from the atmosphere experimental studies have indicated that actual water vapor pressure ea cloud amount and cover fraction are important atmospheric variables that influenced the atmospheric rnl emission idso 1981 iziomon et al 2003 an rnl model that considers ea effects was proposed by idso 1981 which is applicable under clear sky conditions in the improved rn equation a new ɛa estimation formular was developed based on the clear sky rnl formula proposed by idso 1981 which although considers ea effects significantly also considers cloudy effects thus the ɛa estimation formula applies to rnl estimates under all sky conditions 2 ε a 0 65 5 95 10 4 e a exp 1500 t air 273 15 1 0 z s

regression equation between the ratio of observed solar radiations to clear sky solar radiations and the ccf to estimate the cloudiness fraction across the global surface referring to fig 3 of the study by luo et al 2010 the global clear sky solar radiations are estimated using the ångström prescott equation with global parameters recommended by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao the surface albedo allows for accurate quantification of the net incoming solar radiations it is difficult to determine it over wide geographic conditions by remote sensing products such as the mcd43a3 we found that the mcd43a3 albedo values in pure paddy rice pixels with the same field environment and growth momentums varied significantly fig s3a according to paddy rice field observations in irri a non linear regression model can fit well to the relationship between field surface albedo observations and lai fig s3b hence surface albedo in paddy rice fields is simplified as a function of lai rather than referring to the mcd43a3 as follows 3 α α min lai 0 a exp lai b α mix lai 0 where the minimum surface albedo αmin is set to 0 08 when lai is zero which occurs during the land preparation process before seedling transplantation a and b are model coefficients with values 0 09 and 0 55 respectively the maximum surface albedo αmax is 0 17 according to field measurements rn is partitioned between the canopy and soil surface based on vegetation cover fraction fc the 8 day 1 km2 mod15a2 fpar products are considered as input fc values to partition the net radiations in the original mod16 et model in the improved mod16 et algorithm the fc is directly calculated by lai using a paddy rice specific model as follows 4 f c fpar the o r i g i n a l m o d 16 mod e l 1 0 exp 0 5 l a i this s t u d y in the mod16 et algorithm framework et is the sum of water lost to the atmosphere from soil surface evaporation water evaporation from wet canopy surface and transpired water from the canopy the water cover fraction of the soil evaporation module fwet is a function of relative humidity rh for paddy rice it is reasonable to assume that surface soil is kept wet and or flooded from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season hence the water cover fraction of the soil surface fwet soil is set at 1 0 in the improved mod16 et algorithm 5 f wet 0 0 rh 70 r h 4 70 rh 100 the o r i g i n a l m o d 16 mod e l f wet s o u l 1 0 this s t u d y where rh is less than 70 indicating dry soil surface in the mod16 algorithm framework the soil moisture constraint ƒsm is a function of rh raised by the ratio of vpd and the constant β the ƒsm is set at 1 0 for paddy rice fields because rice fields are conventionally kept flooded from fftd to the end of the rice growing season 6 f sm r h vpd β the o r i g i n a l m o d 16 mod e l 1 0 this s t u d y where β is 0 2 kpa in the original mod16 et algorithm framework and is 1 0 kpa in the study by fisher et al 2008 field validation in determining ƒsm was conducted in paddy rice fields in irri shown in fig 6 water lost to the atmosphere from canopy leaves is resisted by rs and rtot vpdopen under no water stress conditions which influences the rs estimation is set at 0 65 kpa in the original mod16 et algorithm framework however field measurements indicated that instantaneous water stress constrained the photosynthesis of rainfed rice when vpd exceeded 2 0 kpa whereas water stress was not observed throughout the whole growing season in paddy rice xue et al 2017 hence vpdopen of 2 0 kpa is adopted for paddy rice finally other parameters that are not mentioned here and model equations used for computing energy received by plant and soil surface soil heat flux plant transpiration canopy evaporation and soil surface evaporation are described in the study by mu et al 2011 3 2 reconstruction of crop lai growth trajectory this subsection aims at drawing lai daily time series from the fftd to the end of rice growing seasons by using the ltdg phenos algorithm the ltdg phenos algorithm consisted of two methods one was the ltdg method used for 30 m evi daily data reconstruction and the other was the phenology based lai temporal smoothing method phenos landsat 5 7 8 evi observations evilandsat with modis evi observations evimodis as supplemented information were digested by the ltdg method to predict field scale daily evi profiles few cloud free landsat evi data of very high spatial resolution are available during the rice growing season in cloud prone subtropical and tropical areas fig 3h and i which may not be practical to consider monitoring of the rapid growing rice crop hence the modis evi obserevations that fall within the rice growing season are complementary to landsat 5 7 8 evi observations the phenos method was designed to convert evi reconstructed by the ltdg to lai by using the phenology dependent lai evi models and a phenology dependent lai smoothing technique 1 the ltdg method to reconstruct crop evi trajectory the ltdg model assumed that 1 crop growth and development potentials are primarily determined by solar radiation intercepted by canopies and accumulated growing degree days accgdds connor et al 2011 2 satellite evi observations at seasonal scale tightly relate to field crop lai growth the ltdg considered the high quality satellite evi observations and daily meteorological factors i e rs and air temperature tair as input variables and daily evi profile as outcomes ltdg devi fig 7 solar radiation and temperature are main drivers for crop growth potentials adverse impacts by other factors such as nutrient deficiency on crop growth potentials are approximated through constraining the ltdg outcomes by satellite evi observations daily aboveground biomass production was estimated by using a radiation use efficiency model that was multiplied by canopy light interception and radiation use efficiency in the study of monteith 1977 canopy light interception has been commonly computed beer s law as an exponential of the product of lai and a light extinction coefficient k russell et al 1989 as follows 7 δ m agb i r u e 0 45 r s i 1 0 exp k l a i i where δmagb i is daily increase in aboveground biomass at the ith day after seedling emergence transplanting unit g rue is radiation use efficiency default 3 5 g mj 1 0 45 is fraction of total solar radiation that is photosynthetically active radiation default value rs i is daily incident solar irradiance at the ith day mj m 2 k is light extinction coefficient default 0 5 laii is green leaf area index at the ith day m2 m 2 canopy area expansion at vegetative and flowering stages and its decline at maturation stage were controlled by a biomass allocation coefficient ρ positive negative for canopy growth maturation or senescence eqn 8 the ρ determined the quantity of daily increase in aboveground biomass that is allocated to leaves which was expressed as a function of accgdds eqn 9 8 δ l a i ρ i δ m agb i s l a 9 ρ i 1 0 a exp b a c c g d d s i where ρ i is allocation coefficient of δmagb to leaves at the ith day sla is specific leaf area default 0 024 m2 g accgddsi is accumulated growing degree days at the ith day a and b are model coefficients to be iteratively determined accgdds at the ith 1 day is computed by daily air temperature and base temperature as follows 10 accgdd s i 1 a c c g d d s i g d d i 11 gd d i max t air i t base 0 where gddi is growing degree days at the ith day oc tair i is daily air temperature at the ith day oc and tbase is the base temperature below which crop growth ceases oc default 10 c for paddy rice accgdds at the initial date of seedling emergence transplanting doyini is gdd1 accumulated leaf area at the ith 1 date is a product of lai at ith day plus daily increase in leaf area at the ith day eqn 12 and evi at the i 1 date is generated by using a generic evi lai equation eqn 13 12 la i i 1 δ l a i l a i i 13 ev i i 1 e l a i i 1 f where e and f are model coefficients default 0 39 and 0 51 respectively the ltdg dynamically adjusts daily ρ and initial conditions of lai laiini default 0 002 at seedling emergence transplanting date doyini using an iterative numerical procedure until the predicted evi values match well with observations at all evi observation dates a complete life history of annual perennial crops is generally divided into four phenological phases vegetative phase flowering phase grain fruit maturation phase and senescence harvest phase the accgdds was relatively constant for each phenological phase in crops while it varied greatly among crop varieties yoshida 1981 connor et al 2011 we hoped that the ltdg method was robust to other crops besides paddy rice hence accgdds for both vegetative and flowering stages were aggregated i e fgdds because increase of canopy leaf area remain advance in morphologically indeterminate crops in which both vegetative and flowering growth occur at the same time although abundant parameters were embedded by the ltdg method satisfactory reconstruction of evi daily data for each agricultural pixel can be achieved through constraining the two parameters doyini and phenology phase specific accgdds especially fgdds for paddy rice in each site doyini was initially approximated by the date of the minimum evi observations that is closest to the consistent increase in the evi observed before the maximum evi the differences in accgdds of phenology phase between early maturing varieties and late maturating ones originate mostly from variable accgdds from transplanting sowing to flowering stage yoshida 1981 the fgdds the accgdds for maturation phase mgdds and harvest phase hgdds for temperate and tropical rice were quantified by meta analysis of published data in literature in this study the fgdds mgdds and hgdds for temperate rice in haean mase esse lishui and twt were set at 800 900 200 300 and 100 200 respectively for tropical rice at irri and early late rice at hunan of china the three parameters were set at 1500 2000 200 300 and 100 200 2 the phenology based lai temporal smoothing method seasonal daily lai profiles were retrieved from the daily evi using the phenology dependent lai evi model as follows 14 lai a b e v i c e v i 2 the b e f o r e e v i mix p h a s e the a f t e r e v i max p h a s e where a b and c are model coefficients that vary depending on the growing phase of paddy rice i e the growing phase before the maximum evi of paddy rice evimax the before evimax phase and the one after evimax the after evimax phase the values a b and c for the before and after evimax phases were 0 024 1 165 7 887 and 1 48 7 44 1 38 respectively fig 5c the ltdg method took evi daily data as outcomes rather than lai because high quality landsat evi observation density over crop growing seasons in cloud prone regions could be low and the few evi observations could be irregularly distributed in such case the evimax phase can not be well judged hence it would be difficult to convert evi into lai by using eqn 14 if the ltdg method takes lai daily data as outcomes the phenology dependent consistent expression method designed to eliminate lai disagreement around the date of the maximum lai was based on the general additive models gams lee et al 2017 the lai data in each field are normalized as a ratio of the lai to the maximum lai value the number of days as time interval between each point of the normalized lai and the date of the laimax is counted the gams are applied to the relationship to retain most of the information of time component in temporal lai data thereby capturing the variations in lai in relation to laimax 3 fftd metric seedling transplantation is the dominant method of raising paddy rice in asia countries rice seedlings with three or four leaves developed in protected upland nursery beds can be transplanted in transplanted rice conventional spacing ranges from 20 cm 20 cm 25 hills m 2 to 30 cm 30 cm 11 1 hills m 2 yoshida 1981 the lai at initial conditions right after seedling transplantation varies between 0 035 and 0 055 m2 m 2 according to our field measurements using the portable multi spectral radiometers in three sites of south korea fig 5c the corresponding evi values at initial conditions eviini ranged from 0 04 to 0 05 the average eviini range in dates evidini was considered to approximate the fftd 3 3 algorithm validations ec et observations with the fftd records in paddy rice fields in south korea in 2010 japan from 2002 to 2005 spain from 2007 to 2008 the philippines from 2013 to 2014 china from 2018 to 2019 and the usa from 2009 to 2016 table 2 were selected as independent validation sources to examine the predictability of the novel algorithms in a wide range of locations with diverse rice genetics climate and management conditions the fftd observations in 58 other paddy rice fields that were distributed in italy japan south korea china india and the philippines were compiled to validate the predictability of the ltdg phenos algorithm table 2 site descriptions and satellite data processing were shown in supporting information the satellite climatic datasets were used to drive the ltdg phenos algorithm for the fftd determination and drive the optimal mod16 model structure to predict daily et in ec observation sites historic daily air temperature incident solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were extracted from the global land data assimilation system l4 3 hourly products gldas 2 1 that supply climate data at 0 25 0 25 rodell 2007 the gldas climate products were downscaled to a finer resolution of 0 01 with high resolution covariates of aster dem advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model and slope attributes through comprehensive statistical analyses using the thin plate smoothing splines and machine learning assembling machisplin package in r xue et al 2021 as for the assessment of the mod16 et model for rn estimation in paddy rice fields the gldas downward longwave radiation flux and rn data at coarse spatial resolution 0 25 are not representative enough to capture field conditions of small land parcels local meteorological data from the ec tower were therefore used for assessing the original rn estimation equation the rmse and nse were used to evaluate the simulation capabilities of the original and optimized mod16 et algorithm workframes smaller rmse indicates better model simulation the nse ranged from to 1 0 with 1 0 indicating the highest modelcredibility and 0 indicating the acceptable level of model credibility but with larger simulation errors 15 rmse t 1 t q o t q s t 2 n n s e 1 0 t 1 t q o t q s t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o t is the observation at time t q s t is the model simulation at time t q o is the average of observations and t is the time length of the ec measurement 4 results we identified the major biophysical mechanisms of the original mod16 et model framework responsible for the observed large errors in satellite et products three subsections drafted in the results section focused on optimal strategies of the mod16 model framework for better rn estimates and lai daily data reconstruction to improve field scale et predictability some fine tuning in rs and ƒsm estimates were also supplemented in the first subsection 4 1 fine tuning in rs and ƒsm estimates and their impacts on et estimates the first subsection scheme here was to test the prediction accuracy of the improved mod16 et model through fine tuning in rs adjusting vpdopen and ƒsm in situ measurements of meteorological factors and field lai data were used et predictions in twt and lishui were not considered in fig s4 owing to a lack of field lai information as shown in fig s4a k daily et predictions by the improved mod16 algorithm tightly followed the seasonal changes in ec observations across the nine site years with an rmse of 0 82 mm day 1 that accounted for a small proportion of the sample mean 25 and nse of 0 57 fig s4l the improved mod16 algorithm could capture most of the temporal and spatial variations of et in paddy rice fields an alternative measure of rs estimation by satellite evi was proposed by yebra et al 2013 however we found marginal effects of the evi based rs on daily et estimation and significant underestimation at the early growing stage purple lines in fig s2 failure of the original mod16 et algorithm to capture evaporative strength from the fftd to the early growing stage was attributed to improper parameterization in ƒsm as shown in mod16 sentivity analysis ƒsm is actually ascribed to the determination of the fftd 4 2 better rn estimates and its impacts on et estimates the second subsection here aimed at evaluating robustness of the rn modification model for daily rn estimation and its effects on daily et predictions the method to estimate daytime rnl in the original rn equation relies merely on air temperature whereas the modification formula in this study considered air temperature water vapor pressure and cloudy index comparisons of daytime rnl and rn estimations by the two methods are shown in fig 1 the mean daytime rnl predicted by the modification method was 1 69 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2013 and 1 86 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2014 closer to field observations with smaller rmse 1 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 and higher nse of 0 37 throughout two years 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 1a and b better rnl estimations were also evident from 2018 to 2019 in lishui fig 1c and d these results demonstrated that rnl estimation by the modification method was more reasonable than that by the original rnl formular differences in daytime rn estimations between the original and modification methods are shown in fig 1e h both methods could track the daily fluctuations of daytime rn observations well whereas cv derived from the modification method closely agreed with those of field observations mean cv throughout the four years was 0 32 for field observations 0 43 for the original rn method and 0 35 for the modification method the rmse in rn estimation by the modification method was 1 11 mj m 2 daytime 1 accounting for only 9 1 of the annual mean of field observations the nse for the modification method was 0 90 which was greater than that of the original rn method by approximately 25 suggesting that the modeling accuracy in rn estimates by the modification method was better the dashed squares in fig 1e h illustrate the impacts of the modified and original rnl estimation methods on rn estimates at cloudy days where rs was less than 10 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 and rn was 7 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 the rn estimate by the original method on 11 doy in 2013 in irri was only 0 10 mj m 2 daytime 1 which was considerably lower than the field observation of 2 37 mj m 2 daytime 1 whereas the prediction by the modification method was 1 35 mj m 2 daytime 1 which was a value closer to the observation smaller errors in rn estimation by the modification method were also observed on other cloudy days resulting in a closer agreement between rn predictions and field observations fig 1j intercept 0 56 especially at the regime of lower rn as compared to the original method fig 1i intercept 2 50 results suggested that better performances in rn estimation by the modification method were primarily attributed to its superiority over the original method in rnl estimates under overcast conditions figs s4 and 10 indicate impacts of the two methods on et estimations through their controls on rn estimations the dashed squares in fig s4a k and fig 10a u highlighted the large underestimations when low et was less than 1 0 mm day 1 et prediction of overcast days by the improved mod16 model algorithm adjusting rs and ƒsm with original rn estimation methods was lower on average by onefold as compared to the ec observations leading to the emerging cocky tail when compared between predictions and observations dashed ellipses in fig s4l and fig 10w as shown in scenario 1 of table 1 the et underestimations on cloudy days were related to the imperfect performance of the rnl estimation formula the prediction performance of the improved mod16 model algorithm optimized rs and ƒsm was significantly improved when rn estimates were statistically corrected using the equation y 0 82rn 2 5 fig 1i with a regression fit closer to the 1 1 line the cyan fitting line in fig s4l this suggested the need to accurately consider rn estimation for et prediction under all sky conditions a closer agreement between ec observations and the improved mod16 model algorithm with the improved rn estimates i e the modified rn method was observed on overcast days highlighted by the dashed squares in fig s s4a k and fig 10a u ensuring that the et underestimation decreased fig s4l hence the modified rn model in eqn 2 was recommended for accurate rn and et estimation under all sky conditions 4 3 satisfactory reconstructions of crop evi and lai growth trajectory this subsection here aimed at better reconstructions of evi and lai daily data for cloud prone and small paddy rice fields using the ltdg phenos algorithm the failure to retrieve lai from satellite evi time series in rainy areas such as irri constrained the estimation of seasonal daily fc and consequent estimation of daily et in paddy rice fields in this study we made efforts to reconstruct the evi time series in each ec site by applying the ltdg method that considers evilandsat modis observations as a predictive variable the evi observations were classified to three categories landsat observations modis observations and data fusion of the landsat and modis observations the ltdg devi predictions annotated by 95 confidence band is shown in fig 8 a s the results of the ltdg method with data fusion of landsat and modis evi observations successfully reproduced the seasonal daily evi evifusion ltdg that matched well with rice phenological stages in haean mase esse lishui and twt fig 8a s with rmse being 0 07 and r2 as high as 0 92 the results successfully reconstructed the daily evi during both tropical dry and wet rice growing seasons in irri fig 8h and i the rebuilt evi time series resulted in a narrowed bell shape curve at either dry or wet season which was different from the disordered evimodis and evilandsat observations the reconstructed daily evi by the ltdg method that ingested only the modis evi observations evimodis ltdg showed results comparable to the evifusion ltdg in all ec sites except lishui from 2018 and twt in 2013 becasue the coase modis pixel can not well represent small paddy fields in the two sites and years fig 8j and p the predicted daily evi by the ltdg method using only the landsat data evilandsat ltdg showed significant underestimations in 2010 in haean in mase from 2003 to 2005 in esse from 2007 to 2008 in 2013 in irri and in lishui in 2019 in comparison to the evifusion ltdg greater values in evimax of the rice growing season from 2013 to 2016 in twt could be reproduced well by the evifusion ltdg data rather than the evimodis ltdg data fig 8m p especially in 2013 the lai prediction capability of the phenology dependent lai evi model with evifusion ltdg datasets was evaluated in all ec sites a major problem in lai seasonal profile predicted by the phenology dependent lai evi model was of the occurrence of a large difference in vicinity of the peak fig 2a s namely the predicted lai profile before the evimax could not smoothly connect to that after the evimax phase the discontinuous lai problem around the peaking stage of the rice growing season was resolved well by applying the gams method the mended lai trajectory retained most of rice growth information a closer agreement between laiobs sg and predictions was obtained in haean mase and esse with a substantial decline in rmse from 1 49 m2 m 2 lai predictions by the general lai evi model shown in fig 4a g to 0 78 m2 m 2 fig 2a g the ltdg phenos algorithm that reconstructed the daily evi and lai captured 78 of field lai observations in the three sites showing a small rmse of 0 75 m2 m 2 a close agreement between lai observations and predictions was found in the 2013 dry season and in the 2014 wet season in irri showing that almost all lai variations as high as 98 were captured resulting in a low rmse of 0 27 m2 m 2 fig 2h and i significant underestimations in lai were found at the peak stage in the 2013 wet season fig 2h and during the dry growing season in 2014 fig 2i nevertheless the lai predictions by the ltdg phenos captured 53 of lai variations in these seasons although relatively large errors in lai estimates existed in the irri 2013 wet season and 2014 dry season seasonal changing profiles of the simulated lai temporally matched well with the phenological development of rice the rapid increment in lai at the vegetative stage and at the time of the lai peaking stage was accurately reproduced by the ltdg phenos algorithm 4 4 fftd determinations regression results in fftd between evid0 04 0 05 and field observations showed that the regression slope was 0 97 and the intercept was 2 89 with a small rmse of 11 18 days fig 9 the evidini approximated the fftd observations well in paddy rice fields in south korea japan china philippines spain italy india and the usa listed in table 2 uncertainties in determining the fftd by evidini were less than 12 days suggesting that the evidini generated by the ltdg phenos algorithm that used the gldas products as input climatic datasets serves as a powerful indicator to accurately load the fftd of single and double cropping paddy rice systems 4 5 comparisons in et estimates between the ltdg phenos and original mod16 algorithm frameworks as for the validation in this section we used gldas climatic products and optimal lai estimates to test the accuracy of the improved mod16 model algorithm model results showed a close relation between et observations and predictions in each site and year green lines in fig 10a u with a low rmse of 0 90 mm day 1 and a high nse of 0 45 fig 10x in addition 70 of the global ec observations were captured by the improved mod16 model algorithm importantly seasonal changing profiles of et from the fftd to harvesting at irri were reproduced well by the improved mod16 model algorithm fig 10 h k the original mod16 et algorithm resulted in an rmse value as high as 1 92 mm day 1 and a negative sign of nse down to 1 32 5 discussion 5 1 effects of rs and rtot parameterization on et estimations stomatal cavities open during the daytime to intake ambient co2 for photosynthesis and simultaneously lose h2o passively to the overlying atmosphere canopy rs to water vapor depends on the canopy structure and leaf rs in the original mod16 et algorithm canopy rs of a specific biome type is computed by up scaling leaf rs to the canopy level by multiplying lai and meteorological dampening factors the major assumption is of a big leaf approximation of complex plant canopies that are made of both sunlit and shaded leaves the algorithm assumes that all leaf types exert the maximum stomatal conductance at ample soil water conditions simplifying the canopy rs parameterization for specific plant function type which does not consider delicate variations in stomatal physiology among leaf types of different biomes reliable estimates of rs in sunlit and shaded leaves require accurate datasets of plant height leaf clumping factor and lai and robust analytical methods to couple process based photosynthesis models ikawa et al 2018 chen and liu 2020 leaf stomatal conductance increases with increasing vpd until a threshold level over which leaf stomatal conductance declines to limit the excess water loss actual rs estimation could be approached by setting the vpdopen and vpdclose parameters according to our field observations scenario analysis in table 1 showed marginal effects of varying rs on daily et and moderate effects at low and high vegetated fields respectively the flooding environment in paddy rice fields from the time of land preparation to harvesting provides sufficient water for the growth and development of rice our field measurements in paddy rice and upland rice indicated the persistence of high leaf stomatal conductance through the rice growing season to support the high photosynthetic capacity for rapid accumulation of biomass xue et al 2017 the improved mod16 et algorithm accurately captured the daily et of the rice growing season in haean mase el saler sueca irri and twitchell with optimized rs an alternative measure of rs estimation by satellite evi was proposed by yebra et al 2013 however we found marginal effects of the evi based rs on daily et estimation and significant underestimation at the early growing stage our results recommend the rs parameterization formula of the original mod16 et algorithm with fine tuning vpdopen and vpdclose for daily et prediction at regional level the rtot estimates by the original mod16 algorithm require no soil moisture data which is conditional convenience for continental and global applications when reliable soil water content datasets are not available at larger spatial scales the rtot reported in the study of mu et al 2011 does not consider roughness parameters plant height and wind speed replacing rtot formula of the original mod16 algorithm by thom s dynamic roughness parameters thom 1975 exerted little influence on modeling performance our current results did not present robust evidence for better performance of the et model with thom s formula 1975 sensitivity analyses of manipulating rtot values in table 1 reported marginal declines by 2 9 mm when escalating ra from 20 to 120 s m 1 it implied that neglecting seasonal changes in rtot due to plant development and wind speed could introduce errors of less than 0 4 mm day 1 in et estimation accounting for 11 of seasonal mean et the same result was also reported for cropland et modeling using the same algorithm by ershadi et al 2015 the rtot estimation method reported by the original mod16 algorithm is recommended for et estimation in the improved mod16 algorithm 5 2 estimating daily rn by considering cloud index compared to the original mod16 rnl algorithm seasonal strength and fluctuation of daytime rnl under all sky conditions were captured well by the modified rnl formula rnl formula of the original mod16 et algorithm framework depends only on one atmospheric variable i e ta field experiments to evaluate ta and ea input analytical rnl models reported a poor performance by either of these models at both high and low temperatures and vapor pressures satterlund 1979 idso 1981 the physical basis for the superior performance of the modified rnl method was that the major source of total atmospheric emittance variability was associated with the continuous emission of water vapor in the 8 to 14 μm wavebands embedding cloudy fraction of the sky into the original rnl model could estimate the atmosphere radiations better as the irradiations from water vapor in the lower atmosphere increase by emissions from clouds the incorporation of cloud terms in the quadratic form in atmospheric radiation models produced rnl estimates that agreed with field observations more closely under variable sky conditions iziomon et al 2003 we obtained a close relation between rnl predictions and field observations in paddy rice fields fig 1 the lack of cloudiness index in atmosphere radiation estimation of the original mod16 et algorithm famework contributed to underestimations in rnl throughout the rice growing season especially during overcast days the cloud cover fraction is conventionally determined by trained observers who observe the entire sky it is difficult to access hourly data of the cloud cover globally by advocating local residents the rnl model derived from idso s formula is explicitly expressed by the ccf index daily ccf values of rice paddies were retrieved from a well established regression equation between the ratio of actual solar radiations to clear sky solar radiations and ccf under a wide range of geographical conditions luo et al 2010 global daily clear sky solar radiations could be estimated using the ångström prescott equation with fao recommended global settings therefore the modified rnl model was readily applicable to estimate the daily rnl and rn for global paddy rice ecosystems grown under variable sky conditions 5 3 reconstructing crop lai growth trajectory by the ltdg phenos algorithm the uncertainty in lai strongly affected the performance of the mod16 et algorithm by controlling fc the mod15a2h lai products could not reconstruct field lai conditions in all ec sites we found that uncertainty sources for lai reconstruction by remote sensing evi were related to the cloud free evi observations that match crop phenology and the lai evi relationship intensive records of the enhanced reflectance of the blue band 0 15 indicate that frequent and intensive precipitation and cloudy weather events occur in tropical sites which resulted in mismatch between rice phenology and evimodis landsat time series observations in 2013 and 2014 in irri seasonal dynamics of paddy rice lai cannot be well reproduced by the irregular evimodis landsat observations which is a major reason hindering the applications of remote sensing based et models in this site in addition it explains the fact that available reports for paddy rice et predictions using remote sensing platforms are concentrated only in the northern hemisphere than in tropical areas ikawa et al 2017 xin et al 2017 jeong et al 2020 a close relation of evi and lai between field observations and predictions by the ltdg method in south korea japan spain usa and the philippines documents the excellent prediction capability of the ltdg method in evi reconstructions of global paddy rice ecosystems a major advantage of the ltdg method is selecting the multi source open asscees satellite evi observations as a predictive variable which makes a comprehensive use of the high temporal modis evi observations and the high spatial landsat evi observations low quantity and quality of landsat 5 7 8 evi imageries due to cloud contamination coarse revisit frequency and irregular acquisition date could be compensated well by the consistent long term modis evi observations meanwhile the problem of coarse spatial resolution of the modis evi imageries could be resolved well through merging the landsat evi observations by the ltdg method thereby better reconstructing daily evi data in cloud prone and small paddy rice fields with the help of satellite evi data the general lai evi model established according to the field data did not reconstruct lai seasonal profiles well in haean in 2010 mase in 2004 and esse during 2007 2008 fig 2 we found significant underestimations after the evi peaking stage in haean in 2010 mase in 2004 esse during 2007 2008 with underestimations throughout the rice growing season in mase in 2002 and 2003 gupta et al 2000 attempted to apply a general relationship for lai ndvi in wheat and onion crops using a polynomial regression however this was hindered by the complex crop growth cycle lee et al 2017 reported that better lai prediction could be achieved by dividing a general lai evi relationship into two submodels that depended on growth phases similar to their results a phenology dependent lai evi correlation was found in paddy rice ecosystems fig 5c the evimax emergence date that was derived from the reconstructed evi time series by the ltdg method advanced application of the phenology dependent lai evi models the discontinuous lai problem around the peaking stage of the rice growing season appeared when applying the phenology dependent lai evi relationships however the problem was well mended through introducing the gams method our results found that evimax was the key phenological metric for dividing the general lai evi correlation into two lai evi submodels the before and after evimax phases the two parameters a and b for lai evi of the before evimax phase were significantly different from those for lai evi of the after evimax phase the ltdg phenos algorithm offered a powerful means to rebuild crop lai daily trajectory through reconstruction of crop evi daily data together with the phenology dependent lai evi models 5 4 fftd determination by the ltdg phenos algorithm diverse field flooding and transplanting timings exist among paddy rice fields in south korea northeast china japan and southeast asia probably because of different preferences of individual householders jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2017 wang et al 2017 cho et al 2019 previous studies have observed the cooling effect of paddy rice during spring in northeast china and south korea especially in may and june liu et al 2018 pan et al 2020 because of the advancement in the fftd during the spring for field flooding xue et al 2021 failure of the original mod16 et algorithm to capture evaporative strength from the fftd to the early growing stage was attributed to improper parameterization in ƒsm as shown in mod16 sentivity analysis ƒsm is actually ascribed to the determination of the fftd hence it is essential to accurately pinpoint the fftd of paddy rice fields for a better understanding of the regulatory roles of field flooding in land surface energy balance and climate change despite abundant efforts in determining the fftd it is still challenging to pinpoint the fftd of paddy rice fields using the optical satellite remote sensing data in temperate subtropical and tropical areas xiao et al 2005 used the optical remote sensing data to develop a spectral threshold method lswi t evi lswi land surface water index with a constant t value of 0 05 to identify the fftd in paddy rice fields however the threshold method is strongly limited for paddy rice extent detection and quantification of the fftd in rainy areas where the moist environment often results in chaos in vis time series dong and xiao 2016 higher lswi values than evi persist from january to the end of may during which any date would be designated as the fftd by the spectral threshold method meanwhile selecting either constant t at 0 05 or other values or variable t values for fftd determination were reported in northeast china south china and south korea jeong et al 2012 peng et al 2011 sun et al 2009 which impedes applications of the spectral threshold method to pinpoint the fftd sakamoto et al 2005 reported an rmse of 12 1 days in transplanting date estimation by applying the wavelet analysis technique to analyze modis evi data in japan chumkesornkulkit et al 2013 reported that the estimated transplanting date was within 16 days for irrigated areas with two rice crop cycles per year in thailand using the phenrice algorithm that ingests the modis evi data boschetti et al 2017 reported an rmse of around 10 days in the estimation of establishment date in italy india and the philippines the fftd of paddy rice in both dry and wet seasons in irri of the philippines could not be detected by the phenology extraction techniques i e the inflection or minima point methods in our research the time of the evi0 04 0 05 at the ascending part of the reconstructed daily evi time series matched well with field observations in the fftd in south korea japan spain philippines italy china india and the usa with a relatively small rmse of fewer than 12 0 days fig 9 determination of the evid0 04 0 05 is not strictly limited to remote sensing data quality and quantity of climatic data the premise to extract evid0 04 0 05 is the successful reconstruction of daily evi using the ltdg method it was suggested that the evid0 04 0 05 serves as a promising indicator to pinpoint the fftd in paddy rice fields over a wide range of climate and management types another uncertainty in et estimation is related to the measurement errors of the ec system although statistical methods adopted by a series of the eddy data package to correct the surface energy balance problem and remove spikes of observations reduced the systematic errors an average random error in et estimation because of the ec system varied from 0 18 to 0 68 mm day 1 khan et al 2018 accounting for 5 20 of the observed mean et yebra et al 2013 analyzed the systematic differences and unsystematic errors in monthly et estimation by the p m model with about 71 of the total rmse related to random errors and the rest to systematic deviations the rmse in et estimation by the improved mod16 algorithm is 0 90 mm day 1 that accounts for 19 of the amount of the observed mean et systematic errors may constitute a large proportion of the rmse of upto 0 19 mm day 1 6 conclusions paddy rice fields are conventionally flooded from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season significant changes in the latent heat flux and surface albedo which are key components of land surface energy balance were observed owing to the change in land use from rainfed upland to flooded lands however the mod16a2 and conus et30m products failed to approximate the daily et in paddy rice fields and incorrectly determined the relative importance and contribution of biophysical factors to temporal variations of et in paddy rice fields new algorithms for optimal estimations of key model parameters were introduced important results obtained in this study are 1 daytime rnl values predicted by the original mod16 rnl model were significantly higher than the field observations seasonal daily fluctuations in rnl were not reflected well the global cloudy index algorithm was proposed to ameliorate the rnl formula in the original mod16 et algorithm resulting in a substantial decline in rmse and a significant increase in nse better rn estimations under all sky conditions were obtained by the rn formula that considered the global cloudy index algorithm superior performances in rn estimation by the modification method were primarily attributed to its superiority in rnl estimates under overcast conditions 2 irregular evimodis and evilandsat time series data were present in a tropical site i e irri in the philippines that did not closely respond to field flooding events and rice phenology the ltdg method was introduced into the original mod16 et algorithm which efficiently rebuilt the time series of evi from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season at all research sites 3 a general lai evi relationship did not predict the lai well from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season the evidmax derived from reconstructed evi daily data was a critical phenological metric to divide the general lai evi relationship into two submodels that differed before and after the evidmax the discontinuous lai problem in predicted lai temporal profile by the phenology dependent lai evi model could well be mended using the phenos method 4 accurate determinations of the fftd in single and multi cropping paddy rice systems were important for drawing rice crop life history and quantifying the ƒsm of the soil evaporation module which remain challenging in remote sensing research of global paddy rice we found evidini to be promising to accurately approximate the fftd in paddy rice fields under various climate and management cycles with a

2979,reliable estimations in evapotranspiration et of paddy rice ecosystems by satellite products are critical because of their important roles in regional hydrological processes and climate change however the nasa modis et products mod16a2 and its derivatives do not have good correlations with all global paddy rice et observations in this research mod16 model sensitivity analyses and parameter optimization strategies were conducted in order to solve the problem results suggested that underestimation of daily net radiation rn in overcast conditions and less satisfactory reconstruction of field scale leaf area index lai growth trajectory from the start date of field flooding and transplanting fftd to the end of growing seasons by modis coarse vegetation index were identified as two major causes a light and temperature driven growth model and a phenology based lai temporal smoothing method fusion algorithm ltdg phenos and an improved rn estimation method were introducted and evaluated in paddy rice fields in south korea japan china philippines india spain italy and the usa from 2002 to 2019 the ltdg phenos algorithm considers landsat and modis evi observations and meteorological data as input variables and 30 m lai daily time series as outcomes introducing the global cloudy index algorithm resulted in improved estimations of daily rn under all sky conditions with a significant decrease of root mean square error rmse from 1 87 to 1 11 mj m 2 day 1 the ltdg phenos algorithm well reconstructed crop lai growth dynamics from the fftd to the end of rice growing seasons with a substantial decline of rmse from 1 49 to 0 27 m2 m 2 the fftd estimations by the ltdg phenos algorithm had an r2 of 0 97 and a small rmse of less than 12 days daily et rates estimated by novel algorithms had a substantial decline in rmse from 2 88 to 0 90 mm day 1 keywords mod16 evapotranspiration radiation crop growth trajectory landsat modis paddy rice data availability data will be made available on request 1 background terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a key determinant of the generation and change of wind turbulence and thermal processes in the mesoscale atmospheric boundary layer berg et al 2016 yao et al 2019 globally paddy rice plantation areas exceeded 167 million hectares in the year 2017 with more than 90 found in cloud prone east and southeast asia faostat 2017 because paddy rice fields are conventionally flooded with different depths of the water layer from the start date of field flooding and transplanting fftd to the harvest these can be ecologically related to shallow wetlands which highly impact the surface temperature dynamics at regional scale through changes in et liu et al 2018 pan et al 2020 xue et al 2021 hence reliable assessments of et in paddy rice fields using satellite products are of significant importance for monitoring regional hydrological cycles and climate change several et models based on satellite remote sensing at regional continental to global scales are being developed to estimate the area based et many of the model biophysical parameters can be retrieved from various remote sensing platforms and emerging biophysical products from new parameter retrieval algorithms improve the accuracy of et estimates according to their model principles a review of historical profiles of et model development broadly categorizes the majority of them into the following two groups temperature based et models and conductance based et models chen and liu 2020 the theoretical basis of the second model is the penman monteith p m equation and its derivative versions several global et products at different spatial and temporal dimensions are available including the p m 8 day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product mod16 mu et al 2011 2013 the daily priestley taylor and 0 25 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2010 and the monthly priestley taylor model from the jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 the mod16 et product uses the modis datasets as the forcing data in its p m model and has been released every year since 2000 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa it is an important et reference for global hydrology and climatology research the release of mod16 et products have attracted abundant concerns to conduct product validations and calibrations velpuri et al 2013 validated the mod16 products against eddy covariance ec tower observations in the united states and reported an underestimation in the lower et and overestimation in the high et contrasting this significant overestimation in the lower et was observed by tang et al 2015 in china miralles et al 2016 observed a considerable underestimation in et in tropical and subtropical areas by mod16 products however there were few reports to make comparisons between the mod16 products and ec et observations in paddy rice fields our previous paper found that mod16 products could not accurately regenerate 8 day et of paddy rice in south korea especially for the period from the fftd to flowering stage with distinct underestimations by two to three times xue et al 2021 a comprehensive evaluation indicated that large one to threefold underestimations at early growth stage by the 8 day mod16 products were evident in haean of south korea in 2010 mase of japan from 2002 to 2005 in el saler sueca esse of spain from 2007 to 2008 in lishui of china from 2018 to 2019 in twitchell twt of the usa from 2009 to 2016 fig s1 significant underestimations by the 30 m et products in the continental usa conus et30m that used mod16 framework algorithm were also observed fig s1 in addition the 8 day mod16 et was significantly reduced by almost onefold than observations over the whole rice growing season in both 2013 and 2014 in internaitional rice research institute irri of the philippines fig s1 the global mod16 and conus et30m could not be used to represent daily et in paddy rice fields globally why do the mod16 et products fail to recur paddy rice et at all global observation sites to answer this question sensitivity analysis of mod16 et model parameters was conducted at the second section of the main body aiming to identify the model parameters to which prediction accuracy of the mod16 et framework algorithm was most sensitive then optimization strategies to better constrain the most important parameters were introduced at the third section in this research underestimation of daily net radiation rn in overcast conditions and less satisfactory reconstruction of crop lai growth trajectory from the fftd to the harvest were identified as two primary causes a novel light and temperature driven growth model and a phenology based lai temporal smoothing method fusion algorithm ltdg phenos and an improved rn estimation method were developed which helped to ameliorate mod16 et model accuracy significantly as shown at the fourth section 2 sensitivity analysis of mod16 model parameters although the mod16 global et model that requires no site calibration is applied on a per pixel level mu et al 2011 exclusive parameter refinements for different land cover types remain necessary khan et al 2018 he et al 2019 in lines with previous studies at regional global vegetation scales khan et al 2018 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 structural variables of the mod16 et model with potential effects on et prediction including rn canopy resistance rs lai for canopy et estimates aerodynamic resistance rtot and soil moisture constraint factor ƒsm for soil evaporation estimates were assessed to find the primary variables responsible for the observed underestimations in et by mod16 2 1 performances of the original rn estimation equation the metric time to set up model parameters in the mod16 et algorithm was divided into daytime and nighttime the daytime metric was defined as the diurnal period from early morning to late afternoon when incident solar radiations were greater than 20 0 w m 2 below which leaf transpiration completely stopped the original rn equation in the mod16 et algorithm framework mu et al 2011 running et al 2019 was 1 r n 1 α r s σ ε a ε s 273 15 t air 4 where α is the surface albedo ɛa is the atmospheric emissivity ɛs is the surface or screen level emissivity 0 97 as the default value tair is the land surface air temperature σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and rs is the incoming solar radiation the right hand second term is the formula to calculate rnl rn is the sum of the net shortwave radiations and the rnl air temperature is the only atmospheric variable for ɛa estimation under all sky conditions in the original mod16 et algorithm framework eqn 2 daytime net longwave radiation rnl and rn estimations by the original rn equation and field observations are shown in fig 1 daytime rnl observations had significant fluctuations in seasonal changing profile in both 2013 and 2014 in irri and from 2018 to 2019 in lishui fig 1a d site descriptions shown in table 2 and supporting information the mean daytime rnl in 2013 and 2014 was 1 99 and 1 43 mj m 2 daytime 1 respectively whereas coefficients of variation cvs were as high as 0 54 and 1 03 respectively the mean daytime rnl predicted by the original rnl equation was 4 16 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2013 and 4 07 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2014 which was approximately twofold lower than that of field observations the cvs of daytime rnl predicted by the original rnl equation were both 0 08 in 2013 and 2014 which were smaller in value than those of field observations meanwhile the original rnl equation failed to track the seasonal amplitude and strength of rnl from 2018 to 2019 in lishui fig 1c and d the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for daytime rnl predicted by the original rnl equation were 2 4 mj m 2 daytime 1 and 2 67 the rnl was significantly overestimated by the original mod16 et model as shown in eqn 1 rnl estimation is the second most important item for accurate rn estimation daytime rn estimations by the original rn equation are shown in fig 1e h the original rn equation could track the daily fluctuations of daytime rn observations whereas cv of the predicted rn was 0 43 which was significantly higher by 34 4 than that of field observations the rmse in rn estimation was 1 87 mj m 2 daytime 1 increasing a larger proportion of the mean observation by up to 15 64 the possible effects of rn estimation on daily et estimates are evaluated in table 1 the idso equation with changes in ɛa estimate atmospheric emissivity used for calculating the daytime and nighttime rnl idso 1981 was selected as benchmark we observed that differences in the 8 day et estimate between the original rn equation and the idso equation were less than 1 0 mm under high solar radiations under various temperature conditions which were negligible as compared to the et of 48 0 mm 8 day 1 table 1 scenario 1 for overcast days with lower rs e g 5 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 the predicted 8 day et by the original rn equation varied from 2 0 to 4 0 mm 8 day 1 under a variety of day and night temperatures however significantly higher predictions were obtained by the idso equation with the highest et of approximately 15 0 mm 8 day 1 which was four times higher than that of the original rn equation under overcast conditions the sensitive index si defined as the defference between et estimation and its benchmark which indicates the sensitive response of et predictions to the two rn estimate methods was high up to 233 14 under overcast conditions whereas it was only 1 71 under clear sky conditions these results suggested that significant underestimation in rn was likely one of the major biophysical mechanisms responsible for the observed underestimation in et prediction by the mod16 et products especially in overcast conditions 2 2 performances of the original rs estimation equation ladder type assignment method with escalating rs was applied to evaluate the effects of rs on et estimation under two contrasting types of lands i e flooded high coverage land scenario 4 in table 1 and flooded open land scenario 5 in table 1 significant impacts of different rs on daily et estimation were observed when the paddy rice field was completely covered by dense canopies fc 0 8 in scenario 4 compared to the et prediction of 50 s m 1 by rs the predicted 8 day et of 120 s m 1 by rs showed a major decline of approximately 4 0 mm and a further 4 0 mm decline was observed when rs increased to 240 s m 1 scenario 4 relatively high si was obtained between low medium high rs significant effects of escalating rs which were found in scenario 4 disappeared under the condition of low canopy coverage 0 3 of fc in scenario 5 which was supported by a narrowed si from 17 61 in scenario 4 to 4 14 in scenario 5 at the same extent of variation in rs the rs was critical in determining the daily et when plant transpiration outpaced soil evaporation this implied that et underestimation at an early growing stage by the original mod16 et algorithm was not primarily related to rs although rs values could be responsible for the observed underestimations during the rice growing season in 2013 and 2014 in irri it did not completely account for the observed onefold underestimation 2 3 performances of the original satellite lai products the mod15a2h lai products that were selected as input lai variable in the original mod16 et model were selected as the benchmark fig 2 the mod15a2h lai products failed to track canopy expansion and senescence trajectories of paddy rice in all eddy covariance ec observsation sites and years the lai predictions by the mod15a2h products showed significant underestimations in haean and mase fig 2a e the mod15a2h lai predictions were clearly higher than field measurements in esse from 2007 to 2008 fig 2f and g which might cause overestimation of et in the two years by the mod16 products lai values predicted by the mod15a2h were less than 2 5 m2 m 2 throughout the rice growing season and mismatched with rice phenology in both 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 2h and i in twt from 2009 to 2010 fig 2l s and in lishui from 2018 to 2019 fig 2j and k the effects of lai estimation on 8 day et prediction through its influences on canopy transpiration were assessed using scenario 6 in table 1 canopy transpiration reduced by half at fc of 0 4 as compared with the higher fc of up to 0 8 resulting in an escalating si of up to 100 02 this suggested the importance of lai retrieval using the remote sensing technique for accurate predictions of canopy transpiration and et satellite evi is the most powerful measure to retrieve crop lai huete et al 2002 seasonal changing profiles of cloud free landsat evi evilandsat and modis evi evimodis observations in each ec site are shown in fig 3 a s satellite data processing shown in supporting information the single rice system is practiced in haean with a peak evi in july and august fig 3a frequent heavy cloud events indicated by surface reflectance of the blue band ρblue 0 15 contaminated the landsat and mod09a1 evi products whereas the monopeak curve of evimodis overlaid with growth phenology of paddy rice was observed fig 3a the seasonal tendencies of evimodis matched well with the single rice phenology development in mase esse and twt from 2010 to 2016 fig 3b s site descriptions shown in table 2 and supporting information however the significant phenology seasonality of evimodis was not observed in the double cropping rice system in 2013 and 2014 in irri in 2009 in twt and in single cropping rice system in 2018 and 2019 in lishui fig 3h l irregular evi data that deviated from rice phenological development were also evident using the landsat products in 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 3h and i while evilandsat time series matched with rice phenology in 2009 in twt and in 2018 and 2019 in lishui fig 3j l comparable evi seasonal profiles were observed in mase in 2002 and 2004 between modis and landsat products fig 3b evilandsat was less than 0 4 in haean and the seasonal trajectory did not match well with rice phenology fig 3a there were only two high quality evilandsat observations within the rice growing season in 2003 in mase fig 3c high quality evilandsat observations were na not available in 2005 in mase and were absent in 2012 in twt fig 3e and o the maximum evilandsat values of the rice growing season were greater than the maximum evimodis from 2011 to 2016 in twt fig 3k p especially in 2013 and 2014 the absence of evilandsat modis sensitivity to rice phenology could be attributed to selective landsat image acquisition date in 2010 in haean and in 2005 in mase coarse spatial resolution of modis evi in 2018 and 2019 in lishui and in 2009 in twt and persistent slight and severe cloud cover during rainy seasons in 2013 and 2014 in irri as shown by the frequent occurrence of enhanced ρblue fig 3a h and i the daily laiobs sg lai observations smoothed by the savitzky golay model and estimated lai values by the sg smoothing modis 8 day evi time series evimodis sg shown in figure 3 and by using a general lai evi model shown in figure 5a are shown in figures 4a i large discrepancies in seasonal amplitude and strength between laiobs sg and simulated lai with the general lai evi model were found in haean mase and esse figures 4a g similar to the lai predictions using the mod15a2h lai products the lai predictions after the evimax phase by the general lai evi model were significantly lower than field observations figures 4a d f g and significant underestimation appeared before the evimax phase fig 4 b c this resulted in a statistical correlation between lai and evimodis sg insets in fig 4a i response characteristics of lai to evimodis sg throughout the rice growing season were featured by two asymmetrical non linear patterns with two significantly different lai values for one value of evi insets in fig 4a g the outstanding indicator of phenological metrics that characterized the asymmetrical patterns well was the evimax by which the lai evimodis sg seasonality could be separated into two phases the before evimax stage and the after evimax stage fig 5 b the results of the standard major axis analysis reported substantial differences in the slope of model fit between the before and after evimax phases p 0 001 the phenology dependent model fits for field lai and evi observations were also observed in three sampling sites gimje si gyehwa myeon and gwangju in south korea wherein lai and evi measurements were made using the harvest method and portable multispectral radiometer fig 5c in addition significant differences in the slope of the lai evi relationship between the before evimax stage and the after evimax stage were present p 0 04 fig 5c the rice growing season was divided into two phases according to the evimax to retrieve the lai from satellite evi observations there was no significant difference in the slopes of the non linear fit after the evimax stage between the lai evimodis sg and field lai evi p 0 93 likelihood ratio 0 01 whereas it was significant for the before evimax stage p 0 001 likelihood ratio 66 95 remarkable discrepancies in lai estimation were anticipated between lai evimodis sg and field lai evi fits especially at an evi value of more than 0 5 in this study the field in situ lai evi fits were selected for daily lai estimation in paddy rice fields as they were independent datasets collected at three locations of south korea the phenology dependent lai evimodis sg relationships were not found in 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 4h and i mainly owning to irregular performance of modis 8 day evi over rice growing seasons efforts to improve the modeling accuracy in et were strongly constrained in irri if rice lai development could not be reproduced correctly hence improper lai parameterizations in the original mod16 et model were key parameters resulting in the observed onefold underestimation in mod16 8 day et in irri these results suggested that one to twofold underestimation in mod16 8 day et during canopy expansion and senescence phases was primarily ascribed to the general lai evi model that covers the whole rice growing season and low density of high quality satellite evi observations for cloud prone and small paddy fields 2 4 performances of the original rtot and ƒsm estimation equations the et model with rtot of 20 s m 1 predicted the 8 day et that changed from 32 to 34 mm under various daytime and night temperatures scenario 3 in table 1 the et model driven by 60 and 120 s m 1 rtot resulted in a slight decline by 1 to 3 mm as compared to the initial rtot of 20 s m 1 the si values derived for varying rtot from 20 to 60 s m 1 and from 60 to 120 s m 1 were 1 91 and 5 17 respectively increasing the rtot by sixfold i e from 20 s m 1 to 120 s m 1 did not decrease the et estimate by the same extent as varying rtot furthermore replacing rtot formula of the original mod16 algorithm by thom s dynamic roughness parameters thom 1975 exerted little influence on modeling performance fig s2 although large errors in et estimation may be introduced by incorrect rtot parameterization under flooded open land rtot could not explain the observed twofold underestimations using the original mod16 et model during the early growing stage and during land preparation when canopies of rice seedlings were small and a large part of the flooded rice field was directly exposed to air we compared the daily ƒsm that was calculated by the formula settings reported by fisher et al 2008 and the original mod16 et model eqn 6 and the relative extractable water rew observations the rew observations were derived from soil sensor measurements in paddy rice and mungbean farmlands in 2013 and 2014 irri fig 6 a and b for paddy rice fields the original mod16 et algorithm resulted in significantly lower ƒsm estimations that persisted from the time of land preparation to harvesting in 2013 and 2014 nevertheless the predictions followed the field observations well in the mungbean field suggesting that the original mod16 et algorithm could predict the daily ƒsm of the non flooded mungbean farmland but not the flooded paddy rice fields in contrast fisher s formula settings efficiently tracked the daily rew in paddy rice fields as compared to the mungbean land because of the relatively higher β value in their study which released the soil water stress extent substantial overestimations by fisher s formula settings were found in the mungbean farmland in 2013 and 2014 observed differences in the ƒsm estimation between the original mod16 et algorithm and fisher s formula settings were ascribed to the determination of the β value the direct effects of ƒsm estimation on 8 day et were further evaluated by scenario 2 in table 1 the 8 day et estimated by the original mod16 et algorithm varied from 13 to 17 mm under clear sky and various air temperature conditions whereas predictions by fisher s formula settings changed from 30 to 32 mm under the same weather conditions an si as high as 110 was evident while assessing the ƒsm effects between them et estimation of the original mod16 et algorithm was reduced by almost twofold compared to that of fisher s formula settings suggesting that the ƒsm was a critical variable for accurate estimation of daily et especially for the flooded open rice fields significant underestimation in et in the flooded open rice fields by the mod16 and conus et30m is related to the constrained soil evaporation fluxes that should have approached potential soil water evaporation which is actually ascribed to uncertainty in the determination of the fftd see results in 4 4 fftd determinations as pointed by he et al 2019 3 mod16 algorithm optimization 3 1 major revisions in daily rn estimation this subsection aims at mod16 model structure optimization by making major revisions in rn estimation and fine tuning surface albedo α vegetation cover fraction fc soil moisture constraint ƒsm and canopy stomatal resistance rs we believe that warmer surroundings on an overcast night than at clear night with few or no clouds are received by the land surface in overcast conditions because of more downward radiation energy originating from the atmosphere experimental studies have indicated that actual water vapor pressure ea cloud amount and cover fraction are important atmospheric variables that influenced the atmospheric rnl emission idso 1981 iziomon et al 2003 an rnl model that considers ea effects was proposed by idso 1981 which is applicable under clear sky conditions in the improved rn equation a new ɛa estimation formular was developed based on the clear sky rnl formula proposed by idso 1981 which although considers ea effects significantly also considers cloudy effects thus the ɛa estimation formula applies to rnl estimates under all sky conditions 2 ε a 0 65 5 95 10 4 e a exp 1500 t air 273 15 1 0 z s

regression equation between the ratio of observed solar radiations to clear sky solar radiations and the ccf to estimate the cloudiness fraction across the global surface referring to fig 3 of the study by luo et al 2010 the global clear sky solar radiations are estimated using the ångström prescott equation with global parameters recommended by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao the surface albedo allows for accurate quantification of the net incoming solar radiations it is difficult to determine it over wide geographic conditions by remote sensing products such as the mcd43a3 we found that the mcd43a3 albedo values in pure paddy rice pixels with the same field environment and growth momentums varied significantly fig s3a according to paddy rice field observations in irri a non linear regression model can fit well to the relationship between field surface albedo observations and lai fig s3b hence surface albedo in paddy rice fields is simplified as a function of lai rather than referring to the mcd43a3 as follows 3 α α min lai 0 a exp lai b α mix lai 0 where the minimum surface albedo αmin is set to 0 08 when lai is zero which occurs during the land preparation process before seedling transplantation a and b are model coefficients with values 0 09 and 0 55 respectively the maximum surface albedo αmax is 0 17 according to field measurements rn is partitioned between the canopy and soil surface based on vegetation cover fraction fc the 8 day 1 km2 mod15a2 fpar products are considered as input fc values to partition the net radiations in the original mod16 et model in the improved mod16 et algorithm the fc is directly calculated by lai using a paddy rice specific model as follows 4 f c fpar the o r i g i n a l m o d 16 mod e l 1 0 exp 0 5 l a i this s t u d y in the mod16 et algorithm framework et is the sum of water lost to the atmosphere from soil surface evaporation water evaporation from wet canopy surface and transpired water from the canopy the water cover fraction of the soil evaporation module fwet is a function of relative humidity rh for paddy rice it is reasonable to assume that surface soil is kept wet and or flooded from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season hence the water cover fraction of the soil surface fwet soil is set at 1 0 in the improved mod16 et algorithm 5 f wet 0 0 rh 70 r h 4 70 rh 100 the o r i g i n a l m o d 16 mod e l f wet s o u l 1 0 this s t u d y where rh is less than 70 indicating dry soil surface in the mod16 algorithm framework the soil moisture constraint ƒsm is a function of rh raised by the ratio of vpd and the constant β the ƒsm is set at 1 0 for paddy rice fields because rice fields are conventionally kept flooded from fftd to the end of the rice growing season 6 f sm r h vpd β the o r i g i n a l m o d 16 mod e l 1 0 this s t u d y where β is 0 2 kpa in the original mod16 et algorithm framework and is 1 0 kpa in the study by fisher et al 2008 field validation in determining ƒsm was conducted in paddy rice fields in irri shown in fig 6 water lost to the atmosphere from canopy leaves is resisted by rs and rtot vpdopen under no water stress conditions which influences the rs estimation is set at 0 65 kpa in the original mod16 et algorithm framework however field measurements indicated that instantaneous water stress constrained the photosynthesis of rainfed rice when vpd exceeded 2 0 kpa whereas water stress was not observed throughout the whole growing season in paddy rice xue et al 2017 hence vpdopen of 2 0 kpa is adopted for paddy rice finally other parameters that are not mentioned here and model equations used for computing energy received by plant and soil surface soil heat flux plant transpiration canopy evaporation and soil surface evaporation are described in the study by mu et al 2011 3 2 reconstruction of crop lai growth trajectory this subsection aims at drawing lai daily time series from the fftd to the end of rice growing seasons by using the ltdg phenos algorithm the ltdg phenos algorithm consisted of two methods one was the ltdg method used for 30 m evi daily data reconstruction and the other was the phenology based lai temporal smoothing method phenos landsat 5 7 8 evi observations evilandsat with modis evi observations evimodis as supplemented information were digested by the ltdg method to predict field scale daily evi profiles few cloud free landsat evi data of very high spatial resolution are available during the rice growing season in cloud prone subtropical and tropical areas fig 3h and i which may not be practical to consider monitoring of the rapid growing rice crop hence the modis evi obserevations that fall within the rice growing season are complementary to landsat 5 7 8 evi observations the phenos method was designed to convert evi reconstructed by the ltdg to lai by using the phenology dependent lai evi models and a phenology dependent lai smoothing technique 1 the ltdg method to reconstruct crop evi trajectory the ltdg model assumed that 1 crop growth and development potentials are primarily determined by solar radiation intercepted by canopies and accumulated growing degree days accgdds connor et al 2011 2 satellite evi observations at seasonal scale tightly relate to field crop lai growth the ltdg considered the high quality satellite evi observations and daily meteorological factors i e rs and air temperature tair as input variables and daily evi profile as outcomes ltdg devi fig 7 solar radiation and temperature are main drivers for crop growth potentials adverse impacts by other factors such as nutrient deficiency on crop growth potentials are approximated through constraining the ltdg outcomes by satellite evi observations daily aboveground biomass production was estimated by using a radiation use efficiency model that was multiplied by canopy light interception and radiation use efficiency in the study of monteith 1977 canopy light interception has been commonly computed beer s law as an exponential of the product of lai and a light extinction coefficient k russell et al 1989 as follows 7 δ m agb i r u e 0 45 r s i 1 0 exp k l a i i where δmagb i is daily increase in aboveground biomass at the ith day after seedling emergence transplanting unit g rue is radiation use efficiency default 3 5 g mj 1 0 45 is fraction of total solar radiation that is photosynthetically active radiation default value rs i is daily incident solar irradiance at the ith day mj m 2 k is light extinction coefficient default 0 5 laii is green leaf area index at the ith day m2 m 2 canopy area expansion at vegetative and flowering stages and its decline at maturation stage were controlled by a biomass allocation coefficient ρ positive negative for canopy growth maturation or senescence eqn 8 the ρ determined the quantity of daily increase in aboveground biomass that is allocated to leaves which was expressed as a function of accgdds eqn 9 8 δ l a i ρ i δ m agb i s l a 9 ρ i 1 0 a exp b a c c g d d s i where ρ i is allocation coefficient of δmagb to leaves at the ith day sla is specific leaf area default 0 024 m2 g accgddsi is accumulated growing degree days at the ith day a and b are model coefficients to be iteratively determined accgdds at the ith 1 day is computed by daily air temperature and base temperature as follows 10 accgdd s i 1 a c c g d d s i g d d i 11 gd d i max t air i t base 0 where gddi is growing degree days at the ith day oc tair i is daily air temperature at the ith day oc and tbase is the base temperature below which crop growth ceases oc default 10 c for paddy rice accgdds at the initial date of seedling emergence transplanting doyini is gdd1 accumulated leaf area at the ith 1 date is a product of lai at ith day plus daily increase in leaf area at the ith day eqn 12 and evi at the i 1 date is generated by using a generic evi lai equation eqn 13 12 la i i 1 δ l a i l a i i 13 ev i i 1 e l a i i 1 f where e and f are model coefficients default 0 39 and 0 51 respectively the ltdg dynamically adjusts daily ρ and initial conditions of lai laiini default 0 002 at seedling emergence transplanting date doyini using an iterative numerical procedure until the predicted evi values match well with observations at all evi observation dates a complete life history of annual perennial crops is generally divided into four phenological phases vegetative phase flowering phase grain fruit maturation phase and senescence harvest phase the accgdds was relatively constant for each phenological phase in crops while it varied greatly among crop varieties yoshida 1981 connor et al 2011 we hoped that the ltdg method was robust to other crops besides paddy rice hence accgdds for both vegetative and flowering stages were aggregated i e fgdds because increase of canopy leaf area remain advance in morphologically indeterminate crops in which both vegetative and flowering growth occur at the same time although abundant parameters were embedded by the ltdg method satisfactory reconstruction of evi daily data for each agricultural pixel can be achieved through constraining the two parameters doyini and phenology phase specific accgdds especially fgdds for paddy rice in each site doyini was initially approximated by the date of the minimum evi observations that is closest to the consistent increase in the evi observed before the maximum evi the differences in accgdds of phenology phase between early maturing varieties and late maturating ones originate mostly from variable accgdds from transplanting sowing to flowering stage yoshida 1981 the fgdds the accgdds for maturation phase mgdds and harvest phase hgdds for temperate and tropical rice were quantified by meta analysis of published data in literature in this study the fgdds mgdds and hgdds for temperate rice in haean mase esse lishui and twt were set at 800 900 200 300 and 100 200 respectively for tropical rice at irri and early late rice at hunan of china the three parameters were set at 1500 2000 200 300 and 100 200 2 the phenology based lai temporal smoothing method seasonal daily lai profiles were retrieved from the daily evi using the phenology dependent lai evi model as follows 14 lai a b e v i c e v i 2 the b e f o r e e v i mix p h a s e the a f t e r e v i max p h a s e where a b and c are model coefficients that vary depending on the growing phase of paddy rice i e the growing phase before the maximum evi of paddy rice evimax the before evimax phase and the one after evimax the after evimax phase the values a b and c for the before and after evimax phases were 0 024 1 165 7 887 and 1 48 7 44 1 38 respectively fig 5c the ltdg method took evi daily data as outcomes rather than lai because high quality landsat evi observation density over crop growing seasons in cloud prone regions could be low and the few evi observations could be irregularly distributed in such case the evimax phase can not be well judged hence it would be difficult to convert evi into lai by using eqn 14 if the ltdg method takes lai daily data as outcomes the phenology dependent consistent expression method designed to eliminate lai disagreement around the date of the maximum lai was based on the general additive models gams lee et al 2017 the lai data in each field are normalized as a ratio of the lai to the maximum lai value the number of days as time interval between each point of the normalized lai and the date of the laimax is counted the gams are applied to the relationship to retain most of the information of time component in temporal lai data thereby capturing the variations in lai in relation to laimax 3 fftd metric seedling transplantation is the dominant method of raising paddy rice in asia countries rice seedlings with three or four leaves developed in protected upland nursery beds can be transplanted in transplanted rice conventional spacing ranges from 20 cm 20 cm 25 hills m 2 to 30 cm 30 cm 11 1 hills m 2 yoshida 1981 the lai at initial conditions right after seedling transplantation varies between 0 035 and 0 055 m2 m 2 according to our field measurements using the portable multi spectral radiometers in three sites of south korea fig 5c the corresponding evi values at initial conditions eviini ranged from 0 04 to 0 05 the average eviini range in dates evidini was considered to approximate the fftd 3 3 algorithm validations ec et observations with the fftd records in paddy rice fields in south korea in 2010 japan from 2002 to 2005 spain from 2007 to 2008 the philippines from 2013 to 2014 china from 2018 to 2019 and the usa from 2009 to 2016 table 2 were selected as independent validation sources to examine the predictability of the novel algorithms in a wide range of locations with diverse rice genetics climate and management conditions the fftd observations in 58 other paddy rice fields that were distributed in italy japan south korea china india and the philippines were compiled to validate the predictability of the ltdg phenos algorithm table 2 site descriptions and satellite data processing were shown in supporting information the satellite climatic datasets were used to drive the ltdg phenos algorithm for the fftd determination and drive the optimal mod16 model structure to predict daily et in ec observation sites historic daily air temperature incident solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were extracted from the global land data assimilation system l4 3 hourly products gldas 2 1 that supply climate data at 0 25 0 25 rodell 2007 the gldas climate products were downscaled to a finer resolution of 0 01 with high resolution covariates of aster dem advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model and slope attributes through comprehensive statistical analyses using the thin plate smoothing splines and machine learning assembling machisplin package in r xue et al 2021 as for the assessment of the mod16 et model for rn estimation in paddy rice fields the gldas downward longwave radiation flux and rn data at coarse spatial resolution 0 25 are not representative enough to capture field conditions of small land parcels local meteorological data from the ec tower were therefore used for assessing the original rn estimation equation the rmse and nse were used to evaluate the simulation capabilities of the original and optimized mod16 et algorithm workframes smaller rmse indicates better model simulation the nse ranged from to 1 0 with 1 0 indicating the highest modelcredibility and 0 indicating the acceptable level of model credibility but with larger simulation errors 15 rmse t 1 t q o t q s t 2 n n s e 1 0 t 1 t q o t q s t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o t is the observation at time t q s t is the model simulation at time t q o is the average of observations and t is the time length of the ec measurement 4 results we identified the major biophysical mechanisms of the original mod16 et model framework responsible for the observed large errors in satellite et products three subsections drafted in the results section focused on optimal strategies of the mod16 model framework for better rn estimates and lai daily data reconstruction to improve field scale et predictability some fine tuning in rs and ƒsm estimates were also supplemented in the first subsection 4 1 fine tuning in rs and ƒsm estimates and their impacts on et estimates the first subsection scheme here was to test the prediction accuracy of the improved mod16 et model through fine tuning in rs adjusting vpdopen and ƒsm in situ measurements of meteorological factors and field lai data were used et predictions in twt and lishui were not considered in fig s4 owing to a lack of field lai information as shown in fig s4a k daily et predictions by the improved mod16 algorithm tightly followed the seasonal changes in ec observations across the nine site years with an rmse of 0 82 mm day 1 that accounted for a small proportion of the sample mean 25 and nse of 0 57 fig s4l the improved mod16 algorithm could capture most of the temporal and spatial variations of et in paddy rice fields an alternative measure of rs estimation by satellite evi was proposed by yebra et al 2013 however we found marginal effects of the evi based rs on daily et estimation and significant underestimation at the early growing stage purple lines in fig s2 failure of the original mod16 et algorithm to capture evaporative strength from the fftd to the early growing stage was attributed to improper parameterization in ƒsm as shown in mod16 sentivity analysis ƒsm is actually ascribed to the determination of the fftd 4 2 better rn estimates and its impacts on et estimates the second subsection here aimed at evaluating robustness of the rn modification model for daily rn estimation and its effects on daily et predictions the method to estimate daytime rnl in the original rn equation relies merely on air temperature whereas the modification formula in this study considered air temperature water vapor pressure and cloudy index comparisons of daytime rnl and rn estimations by the two methods are shown in fig 1 the mean daytime rnl predicted by the modification method was 1 69 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2013 and 1 86 mj m 2 daytime 1 in 2014 closer to field observations with smaller rmse 1 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 and higher nse of 0 37 throughout two years 2013 and 2014 in irri fig 1a and b better rnl estimations were also evident from 2018 to 2019 in lishui fig 1c and d these results demonstrated that rnl estimation by the modification method was more reasonable than that by the original rnl formular differences in daytime rn estimations between the original and modification methods are shown in fig 1e h both methods could track the daily fluctuations of daytime rn observations well whereas cv derived from the modification method closely agreed with those of field observations mean cv throughout the four years was 0 32 for field observations 0 43 for the original rn method and 0 35 for the modification method the rmse in rn estimation by the modification method was 1 11 mj m 2 daytime 1 accounting for only 9 1 of the annual mean of field observations the nse for the modification method was 0 90 which was greater than that of the original rn method by approximately 25 suggesting that the modeling accuracy in rn estimates by the modification method was better the dashed squares in fig 1e h illustrate the impacts of the modified and original rnl estimation methods on rn estimates at cloudy days where rs was less than 10 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 and rn was 7 0 mj m 2 daytime 1 the rn estimate by the original method on 11 doy in 2013 in irri was only 0 10 mj m 2 daytime 1 which was considerably lower than the field observation of 2 37 mj m 2 daytime 1 whereas the prediction by the modification method was 1 35 mj m 2 daytime 1 which was a value closer to the observation smaller errors in rn estimation by the modification method were also observed on other cloudy days resulting in a closer agreement between rn predictions and field observations fig 1j intercept 0 56 especially at the regime of lower rn as compared to the original method fig 1i intercept 2 50 results suggested that better performances in rn estimation by the modification method were primarily attributed to its superiority over the original method in rnl estimates under overcast conditions figs s4 and 10 indicate impacts of the two methods on et estimations through their controls on rn estimations the dashed squares in fig s4a k and fig 10a u highlighted the large underestimations when low et was less than 1 0 mm day 1 et prediction of overcast days by the improved mod16 model algorithm adjusting rs and ƒsm with original rn estimation methods was lower on average by onefold as compared to the ec observations leading to the emerging cocky tail when compared between predictions and observations dashed ellipses in fig s4l and fig 10w as shown in scenario 1 of table 1 the et underestimations on cloudy days were related to the imperfect performance of the rnl estimation formula the prediction performance of the improved mod16 model algorithm optimized rs and ƒsm was significantly improved when rn estimates were statistically corrected using the equation y 0 82rn 2 5 fig 1i with a regression fit closer to the 1 1 line the cyan fitting line in fig s4l this suggested the need to accurately consider rn estimation for et prediction under all sky conditions a closer agreement between ec observations and the improved mod16 model algorithm with the improved rn estimates i e the modified rn method was observed on overcast days highlighted by the dashed squares in fig s s4a k and fig 10a u ensuring that the et underestimation decreased fig s4l hence the modified rn model in eqn 2 was recommended for accurate rn and et estimation under all sky conditions 4 3 satisfactory reconstructions of crop evi and lai growth trajectory this subsection here aimed at better reconstructions of evi and lai daily data for cloud prone and small paddy rice fields using the ltdg phenos algorithm the failure to retrieve lai from satellite evi time series in rainy areas such as irri constrained the estimation of seasonal daily fc and consequent estimation of daily et in paddy rice fields in this study we made efforts to reconstruct the evi time series in each ec site by applying the ltdg method that considers evilandsat modis observations as a predictive variable the evi observations were classified to three categories landsat observations modis observations and data fusion of the landsat and modis observations the ltdg devi predictions annotated by 95 confidence band is shown in fig 8 a s the results of the ltdg method with data fusion of landsat and modis evi observations successfully reproduced the seasonal daily evi evifusion ltdg that matched well with rice phenological stages in haean mase esse lishui and twt fig 8a s with rmse being 0 07 and r2 as high as 0 92 the results successfully reconstructed the daily evi during both tropical dry and wet rice growing seasons in irri fig 8h and i the rebuilt evi time series resulted in a narrowed bell shape curve at either dry or wet season which was different from the disordered evimodis and evilandsat observations the reconstructed daily evi by the ltdg method that ingested only the modis evi observations evimodis ltdg showed results comparable to the evifusion ltdg in all ec sites except lishui from 2018 and twt in 2013 becasue the coase modis pixel can not well represent small paddy fields in the two sites and years fig 8j and p the predicted daily evi by the ltdg method using only the landsat data evilandsat ltdg showed significant underestimations in 2010 in haean in mase from 2003 to 2005 in esse from 2007 to 2008 in 2013 in irri and in lishui in 2019 in comparison to the evifusion ltdg greater values in evimax of the rice growing season from 2013 to 2016 in twt could be reproduced well by the evifusion ltdg data rather than the evimodis ltdg data fig 8m p especially in 2013 the lai prediction capability of the phenology dependent lai evi model with evifusion ltdg datasets was evaluated in all ec sites a major problem in lai seasonal profile predicted by the phenology dependent lai evi model was of the occurrence of a large difference in vicinity of the peak fig 2a s namely the predicted lai profile before the evimax could not smoothly connect to that after the evimax phase the discontinuous lai problem around the peaking stage of the rice growing season was resolved well by applying the gams method the mended lai trajectory retained most of rice growth information a closer agreement between laiobs sg and predictions was obtained in haean mase and esse with a substantial decline in rmse from 1 49 m2 m 2 lai predictions by the general lai evi model shown in fig 4a g to 0 78 m2 m 2 fig 2a g the ltdg phenos algorithm that reconstructed the daily evi and lai captured 78 of field lai observations in the three sites showing a small rmse of 0 75 m2 m 2 a close agreement between lai observations and predictions was found in the 2013 dry season and in the 2014 wet season in irri showing that almost all lai variations as high as 98 were captured resulting in a low rmse of 0 27 m2 m 2 fig 2h and i significant underestimations in lai were found at the peak stage in the 2013 wet season fig 2h and during the dry growing season in 2014 fig 2i nevertheless the lai predictions by the ltdg phenos captured 53 of lai variations in these seasons although relatively large errors in lai estimates existed in the irri 2013 wet season and 2014 dry season seasonal changing profiles of the simulated lai temporally matched well with the phenological development of rice the rapid increment in lai at the vegetative stage and at the time of the lai peaking stage was accurately reproduced by the ltdg phenos algorithm 4 4 fftd determinations regression results in fftd between evid0 04 0 05 and field observations showed that the regression slope was 0 97 and the intercept was 2 89 with a small rmse of 11 18 days fig 9 the evidini approximated the fftd observations well in paddy rice fields in south korea japan china philippines spain italy india and the usa listed in table 2 uncertainties in determining the fftd by evidini were less than 12 days suggesting that the evidini generated by the ltdg phenos algorithm that used the gldas products as input climatic datasets serves as a powerful indicator to accurately load the fftd of single and double cropping paddy rice systems 4 5 comparisons in et estimates between the ltdg phenos and original mod16 algorithm frameworks as for the validation in this section we used gldas climatic products and optimal lai estimates to test the accuracy of the improved mod16 model algorithm model results showed a close relation between et observations and predictions in each site and year green lines in fig 10a u with a low rmse of 0 90 mm day 1 and a high nse of 0 45 fig 10x in addition 70 of the global ec observations were captured by the improved mod16 model algorithm importantly seasonal changing profiles of et from the fftd to harvesting at irri were reproduced well by the improved mod16 model algorithm fig 10 h k the original mod16 et algorithm resulted in an rmse value as high as 1 92 mm day 1 and a negative sign of nse down to 1 32 5 discussion 5 1 effects of rs and rtot parameterization on et estimations stomatal cavities open during the daytime to intake ambient co2 for photosynthesis and simultaneously lose h2o passively to the overlying atmosphere canopy rs to water vapor depends on the canopy structure and leaf rs in the original mod16 et algorithm canopy rs of a specific biome type is computed by up scaling leaf rs to the canopy level by multiplying lai and meteorological dampening factors the major assumption is of a big leaf approximation of complex plant canopies that are made of both sunlit and shaded leaves the algorithm assumes that all leaf types exert the maximum stomatal conductance at ample soil water conditions simplifying the canopy rs parameterization for specific plant function type which does not consider delicate variations in stomatal physiology among leaf types of different biomes reliable estimates of rs in sunlit and shaded leaves require accurate datasets of plant height leaf clumping factor and lai and robust analytical methods to couple process based photosynthesis models ikawa et al 2018 chen and liu 2020 leaf stomatal conductance increases with increasing vpd until a threshold level over which leaf stomatal conductance declines to limit the excess water loss actual rs estimation could be approached by setting the vpdopen and vpdclose parameters according to our field observations scenario analysis in table 1 showed marginal effects of varying rs on daily et and moderate effects at low and high vegetated fields respectively the flooding environment in paddy rice fields from the time of land preparation to harvesting provides sufficient water for the growth and development of rice our field measurements in paddy rice and upland rice indicated the persistence of high leaf stomatal conductance through the rice growing season to support the high photosynthetic capacity for rapid accumulation of biomass xue et al 2017 the improved mod16 et algorithm accurately captured the daily et of the rice growing season in haean mase el saler sueca irri and twitchell with optimized rs an alternative measure of rs estimation by satellite evi was proposed by yebra et al 2013 however we found marginal effects of the evi based rs on daily et estimation and significant underestimation at the early growing stage our results recommend the rs parameterization formula of the original mod16 et algorithm with fine tuning vpdopen and vpdclose for daily et prediction at regional level the rtot estimates by the original mod16 algorithm require no soil moisture data which is conditional convenience for continental and global applications when reliable soil water content datasets are not available at larger spatial scales the rtot reported in the study of mu et al 2011 does not consider roughness parameters plant height and wind speed replacing rtot formula of the original mod16 algorithm by thom s dynamic roughness parameters thom 1975 exerted little influence on modeling performance our current results did not present robust evidence for better performance of the et model with thom s formula 1975 sensitivity analyses of manipulating rtot values in table 1 reported marginal declines by 2 9 mm when escalating ra from 20 to 120 s m 1 it implied that neglecting seasonal changes in rtot due to plant development and wind speed could introduce errors of less than 0 4 mm day 1 in et estimation accounting for 11 of seasonal mean et the same result was also reported for cropland et modeling using the same algorithm by ershadi et al 2015 the rtot estimation method reported by the original mod16 algorithm is recommended for et estimation in the improved mod16 algorithm 5 2 estimating daily rn by considering cloud index compared to the original mod16 rnl algorithm seasonal strength and fluctuation of daytime rnl under all sky conditions were captured well by the modified rnl formula rnl formula of the original mod16 et algorithm framework depends only on one atmospheric variable i e ta field experiments to evaluate ta and ea input analytical rnl models reported a poor performance by either of these models at both high and low temperatures and vapor pressures satterlund 1979 idso 1981 the physical basis for the superior performance of the modified rnl method was that the major source of total atmospheric emittance variability was associated with the continuous emission of water vapor in the 8 to 14 μm wavebands embedding cloudy fraction of the sky into the original rnl model could estimate the atmosphere radiations better as the irradiations from water vapor in the lower atmosphere increase by emissions from clouds the incorporation of cloud terms in the quadratic form in atmospheric radiation models produced rnl estimates that agreed with field observations more closely under variable sky conditions iziomon et al 2003 we obtained a close relation between rnl predictions and field observations in paddy rice fields fig 1 the lack of cloudiness index in atmosphere radiation estimation of the original mod16 et algorithm famework contributed to underestimations in rnl throughout the rice growing season especially during overcast days the cloud cover fraction is conventionally determined by trained observers who observe the entire sky it is difficult to access hourly data of the cloud cover globally by advocating local residents the rnl model derived from idso s formula is explicitly expressed by the ccf index daily ccf values of rice paddies were retrieved from a well established regression equation between the ratio of actual solar radiations to clear sky solar radiations and ccf under a wide range of geographical conditions luo et al 2010 global daily clear sky solar radiations could be estimated using the ångström prescott equation with fao recommended global settings therefore the modified rnl model was readily applicable to estimate the daily rnl and rn for global paddy rice ecosystems grown under variable sky conditions 5 3 reconstructing crop lai growth trajectory by the ltdg phenos algorithm the uncertainty in lai strongly affected the performance of the mod16 et algorithm by controlling fc the mod15a2h lai products could not reconstruct field lai conditions in all ec sites we found that uncertainty sources for lai reconstruction by remote sensing evi were related to the cloud free evi observations that match crop phenology and the lai evi relationship intensive records of the enhanced reflectance of the blue band 0 15 indicate that frequent and intensive precipitation and cloudy weather events occur in tropical sites which resulted in mismatch between rice phenology and evimodis landsat time series observations in 2013 and 2014 in irri seasonal dynamics of paddy rice lai cannot be well reproduced by the irregular evimodis landsat observations which is a major reason hindering the applications of remote sensing based et models in this site in addition it explains the fact that available reports for paddy rice et predictions using remote sensing platforms are concentrated only in the northern hemisphere than in tropical areas ikawa et al 2017 xin et al 2017 jeong et al 2020 a close relation of evi and lai between field observations and predictions by the ltdg method in south korea japan spain usa and the philippines documents the excellent prediction capability of the ltdg method in evi reconstructions of global paddy rice ecosystems a major advantage of the ltdg method is selecting the multi source open asscees satellite evi observations as a predictive variable which makes a comprehensive use of the high temporal modis evi observations and the high spatial landsat evi observations low quantity and quality of landsat 5 7 8 evi imageries due to cloud contamination coarse revisit frequency and irregular acquisition date could be compensated well by the consistent long term modis evi observations meanwhile the problem of coarse spatial resolution of the modis evi imageries could be resolved well through merging the landsat evi observations by the ltdg method thereby better reconstructing daily evi data in cloud prone and small paddy rice fields with the help of satellite evi data the general lai evi model established according to the field data did not reconstruct lai seasonal profiles well in haean in 2010 mase in 2004 and esse during 2007 2008 fig 2 we found significant underestimations after the evi peaking stage in haean in 2010 mase in 2004 esse during 2007 2008 with underestimations throughout the rice growing season in mase in 2002 and 2003 gupta et al 2000 attempted to apply a general relationship for lai ndvi in wheat and onion crops using a polynomial regression however this was hindered by the complex crop growth cycle lee et al 2017 reported that better lai prediction could be achieved by dividing a general lai evi relationship into two submodels that depended on growth phases similar to their results a phenology dependent lai evi correlation was found in paddy rice ecosystems fig 5c the evimax emergence date that was derived from the reconstructed evi time series by the ltdg method advanced application of the phenology dependent lai evi models the discontinuous lai problem around the peaking stage of the rice growing season appeared when applying the phenology dependent lai evi relationships however the problem was well mended through introducing the gams method our results found that evimax was the key phenological metric for dividing the general lai evi correlation into two lai evi submodels the before and after evimax phases the two parameters a and b for lai evi of the before evimax phase were significantly different from those for lai evi of the after evimax phase the ltdg phenos algorithm offered a powerful means to rebuild crop lai daily trajectory through reconstruction of crop evi daily data together with the phenology dependent lai evi models 5 4 fftd determination by the ltdg phenos algorithm diverse field flooding and transplanting timings exist among paddy rice fields in south korea northeast china japan and southeast asia probably because of different preferences of individual householders jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2017 wang et al 2017 cho et al 2019 previous studies have observed the cooling effect of paddy rice during spring in northeast china and south korea especially in may and june liu et al 2018 pan et al 2020 because of the advancement in the fftd during the spring for field flooding xue et al 2021 failure of the original mod16 et algorithm to capture evaporative strength from the fftd to the early growing stage was attributed to improper parameterization in ƒsm as shown in mod16 sentivity analysis ƒsm is actually ascribed to the determination of the fftd hence it is essential to accurately pinpoint the fftd of paddy rice fields for a better understanding of the regulatory roles of field flooding in land surface energy balance and climate change despite abundant efforts in determining the fftd it is still challenging to pinpoint the fftd of paddy rice fields using the optical satellite remote sensing data in temperate subtropical and tropical areas xiao et al 2005 used the optical remote sensing data to develop a spectral threshold method lswi t evi lswi land surface water index with a constant t value of 0 05 to identify the fftd in paddy rice fields however the threshold method is strongly limited for paddy rice extent detection and quantification of the fftd in rainy areas where the moist environment often results in chaos in vis time series dong and xiao 2016 higher lswi values than evi persist from january to the end of may during which any date would be designated as the fftd by the spectral threshold method meanwhile selecting either constant t at 0 05 or other values or variable t values for fftd determination were reported in northeast china south china and south korea jeong et al 2012 peng et al 2011 sun et al 2009 which impedes applications of the spectral threshold method to pinpoint the fftd sakamoto et al 2005 reported an rmse of 12 1 days in transplanting date estimation by applying the wavelet analysis technique to analyze modis evi data in japan chumkesornkulkit et al 2013 reported that the estimated transplanting date was within 16 days for irrigated areas with two rice crop cycles per year in thailand using the phenrice algorithm that ingests the modis evi data boschetti et al 2017 reported an rmse of around 10 days in the estimation of establishment date in italy india and the philippines the fftd of paddy rice in both dry and wet seasons in irri of the philippines could not be detected by the phenology extraction techniques i e the inflection or minima point methods in our research the time of the evi0 04 0 05 at the ascending part of the reconstructed daily evi time series matched well with field observations in the fftd in south korea japan spain philippines italy china india and the usa with a relatively small rmse of fewer than 12 0 days fig 9 determination of the evid0 04 0 05 is not strictly limited to remote sensing data quality and quantity of climatic data the premise to extract evid0 04 0 05 is the successful reconstruction of daily evi using the ltdg method it was suggested that the evid0 04 0 05 serves as a promising indicator to pinpoint the fftd in paddy rice fields over a wide range of climate and management types another uncertainty in et estimation is related to the measurement errors of the ec system although statistical methods adopted by a series of the eddy data package to correct the surface energy balance problem and remove spikes of observations reduced the systematic errors an average random error in et estimation because of the ec system varied from 0 18 to 0 68 mm day 1 khan et al 2018 accounting for 5 20 of the observed mean et yebra et al 2013 analyzed the systematic differences and unsystematic errors in monthly et estimation by the p m model with about 71 of the total rmse related to random errors and the rest to systematic deviations the rmse in et estimation by the improved mod16 algorithm is 0 90 mm day 1 that accounts for 19 of the amount of the observed mean et systematic errors may constitute a large proportion of the rmse of upto 0 19 mm day 1 6 conclusions paddy rice fields are conventionally flooded from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season significant changes in the latent heat flux and surface albedo which are key components of land surface energy balance were observed owing to the change in land use from rainfed upland to flooded lands however the mod16a2 and conus et30m products failed to approximate the daily et in paddy rice fields and incorrectly determined the relative importance and contribution of biophysical factors to temporal variations of et in paddy rice fields new algorithms for optimal estimations of key model parameters were introduced important results obtained in this study are 1 daytime rnl values predicted by the original mod16 rnl model were significantly higher than the field observations seasonal daily fluctuations in rnl were not reflected well the global cloudy index algorithm was proposed to ameliorate the rnl formula in the original mod16 et algorithm resulting in a substantial decline in rmse and a significant increase in nse better rn estimations under all sky conditions were obtained by the rn formula that considered the global cloudy index algorithm superior performances in rn estimation by the modification method were primarily attributed to its superiority in rnl estimates under overcast conditions 2 irregular evimodis and evilandsat time series data were present in a tropical site i e irri in the philippines that did not closely respond to field flooding events and rice phenology the ltdg method was introduced into the original mod16 et algorithm which efficiently rebuilt the time series of evi from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season at all research sites 3 a general lai evi relationship did not predict the lai well from the fftd to the end of the rice growing season the evidmax derived from reconstructed evi daily data was a critical phenological metric to divide the general lai evi relationship into two submodels that differed before and after the evidmax the discontinuous lai problem in predicted lai temporal profile by the phenology dependent lai evi model could well be mended using the phenos method 4 accurate determinations of the fftd in single and multi cropping paddy rice systems were important for drawing rice crop life history and quantifying the ƒsm of the soil evaporation module which remain challenging in remote sensing research of global paddy rice we found evidini to be promising to accurately approximate the fftd in paddy rice fields under various climate and management cycles with a
