18725,depleted oxygen o2 in the sediment and overlying water of malodorous black water poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems this study presents a method for sustainable regulation of the dissolved oxygen do levels towards the malodorous black water oxygen loaded natural porous materials were prepared by vacuum degassing to remove air from the pores and fill them with pure o2 capping anaerobic sediment with the prepared 6 oxygen loaded porous materials was effective in prompting the do concentration of the malodorous black water although granules activated carbon gac displayed the highest oxygen loading capability oxygen loaded volcanic stone additive was more efficient for long lasting combating of the anaerobic condition because the do level at sediment water interface swi and the do penetration depth showed approximately 5 38 and 3 75 fold increase respectively compared with the untreated systems the improvement in do was substantially enhanced in the presence of submerged macrophyte vallisneria natans during which the release of o2 from oxygen loaded volcanic stone facilitated the plant growth with the joint efforts of the o2 released from volcanic stone and photosynthesis by the macrophytes the do levels were maintained at approximately 6 80 mg l after a 41 day incubation which exceeded p 0 05 the value in only oxygen loaded volcanic stone or macrophytes added treatments in addition to the elevated do level the combined employment of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and macrophytes triggered a negative ammonia nh4 n flux across the swi and an 85 82 reduction of methane ch4 production compared with those without treatment accompanied by a decrease in total inorganic carbon and a 2 55 fold increasing of submerged macrophyte biomass which is presumably attributed to nitrification remineralization and assimilation the results obtained here shed a degree of light on the sustainable modulation of the anaerobic condition in malodorous black water graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic sediment black water submerged macrophyte capping microelectrode 1 introduction the occurrence of malodorous black water is a phenomenon in which water turns black and produces offensive odorous gas talaiekhozani et al 2016 due to the extensive input of industrial and municipal waste and runoff in urban and agricultural areas into rivers and lakes malodorous black water is frequently reported in china which is a serious natural ecosystem disaster that threatens numerous lakes and rivers nationwide currently the number of bodies of malodorous black waters in china is 2100 as a result the need to turn back the black tide is vital china has made considerable efforts to mitigate the pollution of malodorous black waters currently the constructions of wastewater treatment plants have paid special attention to the disposal of large volumes of wastewater before there are received by lakes and rivers however the treatment of malodorous black water is currently not satisfactory due to the high concentration of pollutants present in the discharged water such as organic matter and nitrogen even if the required removal efficiency is attained jin et al 2018 which can also enhance pollutant inputs for malodorous black waters moreover despite the implementation of pollution abatement and control programs the contaminants in the water column will mitigate to the bottom and sequentially gather in the sediment in the polluted waters thus the sediment become a pollution source in the aquatic systems borgnino et al 2006 ding et al 2015 2018 without the application of post treatments to remove the pollutants in the sediment and implement ecological restoration the tide of the malodorous black water can hardly be reverted techniques using biotechnological and engineering methods to remediate malodorous black water have been received considerable attentions removal of surface sediment has been considered as an alternative to reduce nutrients release from anaerobic sediments lürling and faassen 2012 waajen et al 2016 ex situ dredging of the anaerobic sediments is extensively employed for sediment remediation despite the encouraging results of some laboratory studies some field experiments have reported a minimal reduction in sediment nutrients flux after dredging in the long term kleeberg and kohl 1999 oldenborg and steinman 2019 recent studies evaluating the effect of sediment dredging on water quality improvement after dredging for 6 years discovered that the decomposed algae can precipitate and settle on the lake sediment in summer and autumn which favored the release of phosphorus from sediments by the exhaustion of oxygen reduction of fe oxyhydroxides to fe ii han et al 2015 and releasing of algal originated phosphorus ai et al 2019 hence impaired dredging effectiveness chen et al 2018 malodorous black water is also characterized by hypoxic low dissolved oxygen do concentration and high content of organic matter and ammonia nh4 n zhou et al 2015 which in turn is a key factor that affects the degradation of organic matter and the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen svensson et al 2015 a conventional approach to increasing oxygen o2 levels in waters is mechanical aeration which is capable of reducing organic matter since it will cause the proliferation of organic degraded related bacteria yuan et al 2018 however this methodology is becoming obsolete due to the high energy consumption and relatively low efficiency podsiadłowski et al 2018 also aeration can substantially enhance the re suspension of the polluted sediment and prompted the light attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem an alternative approach involves chemicals addition which may donate oxygen as reacting with water hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can decay to water and oxygen via chemical and biological oxidation reduction reactions matthijs et al 2012 and was assumed to be a potential way to improve the oxygen levels in water whereas h2o2 had to be continually supplied and would kill the degrading microbes at high concentrations nykänen et al 2012 the potential negative impact of h2o2 can be mitigated using granulated calcium peroxide cao2 which can release 17 of its weight as o2 as a slow oxygen releasing compound wang et al 2019b when the granulated cao2 was spread to the lake the effect was visible for the entire 40 week experiment nykänen et al 2012 however some attempts to improve the do concentration using cao2 caused an increase in the ph levels from 7 1 to 11 3 due to the generation of ca oh 2 lee et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 considering the energy input total environmental impact and public acceptance the exploration of high efficient cost effective and most importantly environmentally benign methods is recommended to treat the malodorous black waters of which the improvement in do concentration should be given high priority as previously addressed the level of do is essential for the survival of aerobic microbe and aquatic species including submerged macrophytes in desired aquatic systems particularly those dominated by submerged macrophytes the deficiency of some nutrients and high do concentration may occur due to the assimilation of nutrients and photosynthesis by the macrophytes once established submerged macrophytes are considered to have a positive effect on water clarity and the stability of aquatic ecosystems by a variety of buffer mechanisms stephen et al 1998 although the recovery of aquatic vegetation was determined to be crucial for restoring malodorous black water the oxygen exhaustion or at the minimum level 0 2 mg l zhu et al 2017 and the extreme high content of organic matter ammonium and alkaline condition wang et al 2017b deteriorated the growth of aquatic vegetation from our perspective emerging technologies that may trigger the recovery of the self organized ecosystems once the implementation of pollution abatement was achieved should be investigated the two microcosm experiments presented in this paper are concerned with sustainable improvement of do level in malodorous black waters we prepared oxygen carried porous material that can release oxygen with limited negative environmental impacts with the modified microenvironment particularly do levels at the sediment water interface swi with oxygen loaded porous material capping submerged macrophytes were subsequently incubated this study sought to develop and test a method for increasing the do level of sediments and regulation of the anaerobic environment with the joint efforts of oxygen carried porous material and submerged macrophytes and explore how the aquatic ecosystem responded 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and characterization studies granular activated carbon gac akadama clay pumice stone ceramsite volcanic stone and zeolite and were used to load oxygen the 6 natural porous materials were obtained from beixing natural minerals ltd chongqing china the specific surface area of the porous materials was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method with a micromeritics asap 2020 apparatus micromeritics inc usa the pore volumes were obtained by analyzing the 77 k n2 adsorption desorption isotherms during which the analysis was performed at a relative pressure p p0 of 0 98 the pore size distribution of the materials were calculated from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using the non local density functional theory nldft model for carbonaceous slit like pores implemented in belsorp software heo and park 2018 2 2 preparation of oxygen carried porous materials the porous materials were washed with double deionized water and dried at 90 c the materials were degassed in a sealed container for 5 min at room temperature under vacuum 0 09 mpa to remove air from their pores then pure o2 was subsequently pumped into the container and maintained at a pressure of 0 2 mpa for 5 min to enable the o2 to enter the pores oxygen loading capability of the porous materials was acquired from the o2 adsorption desorption isotherms which recorded at 77 k using a quantachrome analyzer the porous materials were dried at 200 c for 5 h before measurement oxygen uptake under dynamic pressure from 4 to 74 bars was performed by the h sorb 2600 high pressure volumetric adsorption analyzer gold app instrument corporation beijing china a known amount of oxygen was dosed into the measurement tube that contained the porous materials when equilibrium between the materials and adsorbed oxygen is attained a comprehensive final equilibrium pressure can be automatically recorded the quantity of adsorbed o2 was calculated from the generated data ahmed et al 2017 then two microcosm experiments were established to assess the do dynamics and evaluate the joint effects of the oxygen loaded porous materials and submerged macrophyte on sustainable do improvement 2 3 microcosm experiment 1 evaluation of do improvement of the oxygen carried porous materials a microcosm scale study was established to assess the do dynamics as function of oxygen carried porous materials additions fourteen plexiglas cylinders with an inner diameter of 10 cm and height of 60 cm were filled with the same amount of sediment thickness of 10 cm and water 3 5 l a depth of 45 cm which was collected from a malodorous black lake 29 36 52 n 106 19 40 e located in shapingba district chongqing china to simulate the environmental malodorous black scenario the chemical characteristics of the water are do 0 20 mg l nh4 n 9 01 mg l total organic carbon toc 20 08 mg l total inorganic carbon tic 25 07 mg l and ph 7 24 assessed using phs 3c china the 14 columns were randomly divided into 7 treatments two columns that contain water and sediment were used as controls and then sediment in other columns was capped by oxygen loaded gac akadama clay pumice stone ceramsite volcanic stone and zeolite respectively with a dose of 0 8 kg m2 and with duplicates for each a do meter yellow springs instruments ysi proplus was lightly placed into the overlying water and held at 1 2 cm above the sediment surface to assessed the do level in each column during the measurements the o2 probe was gently circulated bonaglia et al 2019 to prevent the electrode from consuming a portion of oxygen at the moment it touches the water and the measurement was conducted twice a day each experimental column was wrapped with black plastic to shield the ambient light below the sediment surface when the do concentration in the majority of the columns displayed slight alternations the do profiles across the swi in the control and the column that showed the most satisfactory do improvement were assessed using an o2 microelectrode unisense a s denmark which had a tip diameter of 100 μm and was protected by a glass tube with inner diameter of 3 mm the diameter of the glass tube exceeded the size of the porous materials to avoid damage of the sensor by the materials then the microelectrode was moved through the capping layers to some depth in the sediment by an increment of 100 μm with assistance of a unisense a s microelectrode positioning system fig s1 calibration of the do sensor was performed before each measurement three profiles per microcosm were randomly measured in the sediment samples to assess spatial heterogeneities the position of the swi was determined from the break in the o2 concentration gradient miao et al 2017 2018 2 4 microcosm experiment 2 the combined role of oxygen carried material and submerged macrophyte in do improvement the most efficient oxygen loaded porous materials can be obtained based on the evaluation of the do concentration both at the overlying water and the do profiles across the swi in microcosm experiment 1 then the joint effects of the oxygen loaded porous materials and submerged macrophyte on sustainable do improvement were assessed eight plexiglas cylinders that contain the same amount of sediment and water were divided into 4 groups 1 containing water and sediment and used as the control 2 the incubation of submerged macrophyte vallisneria natans seedling in the surface sediment 3 capping the surface sediment with the most satisfactory oxygen loaded porous material according to experiment 1 and 4 after capping the sediment with oxygen loaded porous material the vallisneria natans seedling was incubated the initial fresh biomass of the vallisneria natans seedling in groups 2 and 4 were 2 20 g with a height of 4 5 cm containing root and leaf during the incubation ph and the concentration of do at the swi were measured as described in experiment 1 the ch4 and co2 areal fluxes from the 4 treatments were monitored at 5 day interval following using a static chamber method during gas collection a plexiglas chamber with diameter of 14 cm and height of 10 cm was used to cover the outer of the column and submerge 2 cm into the water contained fig s2 which served to maintain the chamber about 10 cm above the water surface in the column meanwhile avoided gas exchange between the column and atmosphere after 3 h the gas was collected in the gas bag hb 3 cqd china using a pump wt 80 china through the sampling hole then the ch4 and co2 concentration are assessed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection 7890b agilent usa li et al 2018 and the ch4 and co2 fluxes are calculated using the method described in our previous literature ai et al 2019 ten milliliter of overlying water samples 5 cm above the sediment were also collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm sartorius filter prior to analysis of nh4 n at the beginning and end of the experiment after each sampling all the studied systems were gently supplied with the original filtered water to compensate for the water losses due to sampling and evaporation the nh4 n fluxes were calculated according to the following mass balance zhu et al 2019 f n v c a c b j 1 i 1 n v j c a c i s t where fn is the flux mg m2 d v is the volume of overlying water l ca is the nh4 n concentration mg l in the end cb is the nh4 n concentration at the start

carbon fractions of overlying water samples were analyzed concentrations of total carbon tc were determined using the vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar equipped with a thermal conductivity detector the concentrations of tic were measured with the solitic elementar module coupled with the vario el cube samples were heated to 50 c and acidified with 5 hcl the released co2 was measured with a thermal conductivity detector the toc was determined by subtracting the tic from the tc wang et al 2019a żarczyński et al 2019 during the assessment of the fresh weight of the submerged macrophyte at the start and end of the incubation the submerged macrophyte was cleaned of periphyton under running water and dried on filter paper followed by immediate measurement of the weight jasser 1995 the two microcosm experiments were performed at a constant 25 c in an illumination incubator gzx 250bsh with a light intensity of 40 μmol photons m2 s under 12 h 12 h light and dark cycles 2 5 statistical analyses the statistical package of the social science 18 0 spss 18 0 was used for statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was used to test the statistical significance of the results p values less than 0 05 were considered statistically significant the conceptual diagram was performed by adobe illustrator cs 5 3 results 3 1 characterization of porous materials akadama clay and gac showed an apparent higher surface area 220 89 and 149 17 m2 g respectively than other porous materials table 1 the total pore volume showed a distinct difference among the investigated materials and followed the order of gac akadama clay volcanic stone zeolite pumice stone and ceramsite in addition to the minimum surface area 0 41 m2 g and pore volume 0 0014 cm3 g in ceramsite the maximum average pore size 12 38 nm was also observed the distribution of pore size revealed that the narrow size less than 2 nm and the wide pore greater than 20 nm accounted for the majority of the pore distribution for gac a similar pattern was also seen in pumice stone although the surface area 71 22 m2 g and pore volume 0 11 cm3 g of volcanic stone were substantially lower than those of akadama clay and gac its pore size in the range of 2 20 nm was prevalent although the pore size in the range of 2 20 nm was also abundant in zeolite its low pore volume likely did not benefit the oxygen loading 3 2 oxygen loading capabilities under elevated pressure the o2 adsorbing capability showed constant increase for gac akadama clay volcanic stone and zeolite conversely no apparent adsorption by pumice stone and ceramsite occurred which indicates that o2 can be reversibly adsorbed in the pores at the chosen pressure theoretically the o2 adsorbing capability is approximately 0 38 mmol g for gac which showed the maximum o2 uptake among the analyzed materials followed by akadama clay 0 23 mmol g volcanic stone 0 17 mmol g and zeolite 0 16 mmol g note that o2 adsorption by volcanic stone maintained an increase with an increase in pressure fig 1 3 3 oxygen dynamic in overlying water capping sediment with the oxygen loaded porous materials had a distinct impact on the do concentrations in overlying water in the controls the do concentration remained at approximately 0 20 1 75 mg l throughout the 11 days incubation fig 2 oxygen loaded zeolite and ceramsite can elevate the do level to 2 84 mg l while the do concentration showed a dramatic decline in the oxygen loaded ceramsite capped groups although capping sediment with oxygen loaded zeolite improved the do level maximum to 3 8 mg l on day 2 5 the do showed a constant subsequent decline afterward and an insignificant p 0 05 difference with the control on day 11 in contrast with the oxygen loading capability test oxygen loaded gac substantially improved the do level 6 84 mg l when it was added in the systems while the do concentration showed a rapid decrease and the final concentration was considerable lower than that in the control groups a similar pattern was also observed in the presence of oxygen loaded akadama clay and pumice stone capping the sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone produced not only maximum do levels 11 84 mg l among the treatments but also caused sustainable improvement of the anaerobic sediment during the whole study period and the do levels were maintained at nearly 7 00 8 00 mg l since day 41 which indicated that volcanic stone can slowly release the loaded oxygen and deliver it to the sediment and aqueous phase 3 4 oxygen profile across the sediment core the effect of oxygen loaded volcanic stone on the improvement of do concentration was further measured using microelectrodes fig 3 in the bulk aqueous phase of control do ranged from 0 22 to 1 64 mg l during the 11 days experimental period the oxygen penetration was measured up to a depth of 2000 μm at the beginning of the incubation fig 3a although the do level at the swi increased to 1 64 mg l and an oxygen penetration of 7000 μm as attained after 6 days the do level decreased to 1 25 mg l with an oxygen penetration depth of 3000 μm which indicates significant oxygen consumption within the sediment capping the sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone substantially reverted the anaerobic tide and the do concentration in the bulk aqueous phase was 8 67 mg l after 6 days of exposure to the capping materials accompanied by an oxygen penetration depth of 18000 μm however after 11 days incubation both the swi do level reduced to 7 16 mg l and the oxygen penetration depth decreased to 1200 μm showed a slight reductions compared with day 6 fig 3b nevertheless the results clearly demonstrated that the presence of oxygen loaded volcanic stone produced a substantially higher oxygen concentration and a deeper o2 penetration in the sediment 3 5 combined efforts of oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte on physico chemical parameters fig 4 a illustrates the dynamics of do concentration against time for four different treatments the do concentration constantly remained at approximately 0 21 mg l during the 41 days study and the addition of submerged macrophyte did not change the profile due to the decomposition of the plant in extremely anaerobic conditions fig s3 the do concentrations showed a notable increase once the oxygen loaded volcanic stone was added however it decreased to nearly 2 50 mg l after 5 days with an insignificant difference between oxygen loaded volcanic stone capping plus submerged macrophyte incubation treatment with a continuous release of oxygen bubbles the oxygen loaded volcanic stone maximally elevated the do level to 7 76 mg l with the exhaustion of the loaded oxygen the do concentration then decreased to 1 85 mg l after 41 days conversely the joint efforts of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte induced an abrupt increase in do level which maximally reached 12 21 mg l despite a reduction to nearly 6 80 mg l after 21 days the do level became stable with time toward the end of the study which indicates the reverse of the anaerobic condition concomitantly after 41 days of exposure the nh4 n flux at the swi showed a statistically significant different p 0 05 among the treatments fig 4b in the combined oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte treatment the nh4 nflux from sediment to water across the swi was negative 0 013 mg m2 d compared to the continuous release of nh4 n in other treatments 0 032 0 064 mg m2 d the areal fluxes of ch4 significantly differed among the treatments in the controls the ch4 fluxes ranged from 0 05 to 24 62 mg m2 h and the maximum ch4 fluxes were 1 23 3 32 and 8 63 times higher than those in submerged macrophyte oxygen loaded volcanic stone and oxygen loaded volcanic stone plus submerged macrophyte treatments respectively fig 4c the investigated treatments were effective in reducing ch4 emission and the minimum was obtained for the joint efforts of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte 0 14 mg m2 h during the study co2 production was prevalent in the control but showed an abrupt decrease with time in the oxygen loaded volcanic stone plus submerged macrophyte treatments the co2 flux showed a pattern that was similar with ch4 flux and the released co2 was significantly lower than other treatments fig 4d which suggests that the co2 may be restrained in the water column both the toc concentration and tic concentration after 41 days incubation were remarkably higher in the controls than other treatments fig 5 a in compared with the control capping the sediment surface with oxygen loaded volcanic stone caused a 25 and 52 reduction in tic and toc respectively the tic and toc concentration showed a significant decline p 0 05 with oxygen loaded volcanic stone capping the effects were enhanced with the co incubation of submerged macrophyte which implies the remineralization of organic matter in aerobic conditions in oxygen loaded volcanic stone capping plus submerged macrophyte added treatments with an improvement in do in the systems also indicated by fig 5 d compared with the control fig 5e organic carbon was converted to inorganic carbon fig 5a while an abrupt decrease of tic was observed indicating the assimilation of carbon by macrophyte this finding can be confirmed by a 2 55 fold the increase in the macrophyte biomass fig 5b c d and f 4 discussion malodorous black water is generally accompanied by an extremely low do level and a high nh4 n concentration the current main solutions for oxygenation of the hypolimnion and anaerobic sediment include physical methods e g artificial aeration chemical approaches e g flocculation precipitation and biological strategies e g ecological floating bed freeman et al 2018 these approaches may require high cost and energy consumption and may disturb the settled sediment and induce internal releases of contaminants oxygen releasing material as represented by cao2 has gained great attention due to its ability to generate undesirably high ph in water wang et al 2019b in this regard seeking a green economical and efficient technology is of great importance wang et al 2019b 4 1 pore size distribution determines the oxygen releasing efficiency in this study we explored an alternative strategy to deliver o2 to the anaerobic water that involves the use of porous materials natural porous materials are considered to be promising o2 carriers due to their cost effectiveness high surface area and naturally basic surface characteristics heo and park 2018 we evaluated 6 porous materials for their oxygen loading capability and discovered that gac possess significantly stronger sorption ability for o2 0 38 mmol g followed by akadama clay 0 23 mmol g volcanic stone 0 17 mmol g zeolite 0 16 mmol g pumice stone 0 07 mmol g and ceramsite 0 02 mmol g fig 1 as indicated in table 1 the total pore volume of gac and akadama clay were several orders of magnitude higher than those of other analyzed porous materials which indicates that the oxygen loading capabilities may be linked with their total pore volume when the 6 oxygen loaded materials were applied to the sediment the improvement in the do level were observed to follow the order of volcanic stone zeolite pumice stone akadama clay ceramsite gac which revealed a distinct difference with their oxygen loading capabilities the difference in the oxygen loading capability can be explained by the specific surface area and porous size distribution while the improvement in the do in the microcosm experiment may be more linked to the existence of mesopores heo and park 2018 an ideal oxygen carrier should possess the ability to store and transport significant amounts of oxygen while the o2 releasing rate is under control the investigated 6 oxygen loaded materials showed a distinct distribution of pore size although the specific surface area of gac and akadama clay 149 17 and 220 89 m2 g respectively table 1 exceeded other porous materials with the exception of ceramsite they exhibited a predominance of larger pores 20 nm and smaller pores 2 nm table 1 which may either facilitate the bubbling off fig s4 or cause the locking of oxygen the large pore size produced a loose arrangement with oxygen bubbles which is highly beneficial for fast oxygen transfer and cause a quick release and bubbling off during the early stage of the releasing process as suggested by the drastic decrease in do concentration in the presence of oxygen loaded gac in the microcosm experiment 1 fig 1 this bubble off enables the release of larger oxygen bubbles to the aqueous phase and may eventually reduce the biologically available oxygen lee et al 2014 this result was consistent with a previous study which indicated that an ion with a small radius e g oxygen that fills a large space can produce a loose arrangement with larger voids thus cause a the fast release işıklan 2007 the highest value for oxygen loading capability by gac may also be attributed to the enhanced interaction between o2 and the adsorbent in these narrow micropores pore size less than 2 nm during which the tight arrangement with smaller pores may occur hence substantially reduce the oxygen releasing rates consequently volcanic stone which comparatively possessed a higher specific surface area and pore volume but the prevalence of mid sized mescopores of 2 10 nm table 1 helped depressing the drastic release of loaded oxygen bubbles resulting in slow release of the smaller oxygen bubbles in the water phase and benefited the improvement in the do concentrations in addition to the fact that the pore size of the porous materials exhibits a close relationship with the oxygen releasing efficiency the affinity of the oxygen towards a specific adsorbate may also affect the oxygen loading and the oxygen releasing performance plaza et al 2014 which explains the discrepancy between the oxygen loading capability and do improve efficiency a description of the linkage between the o2 affinity to the adsorbents and oxygen releasing efficiency requires further detailed studies nevertheless this study provides a potential method for improving the do concentration using an ecological approach 4 2 oxygen loaded porous materials are effective for short term anaerobic modulation this study presents a simple method for increasing the oxygen level using porous materials as oxygen carrier the results demonstrate that the material is effective for delivering oxygen to the sediment fig 4 and aqueous phase fig 2 in this study the majority of the investigated porous materials exhibited an oxygen loading capability despite the variation in loading quantity fig 1 when the oxygen loaded porous materials were applied to the water column the materials capped on the surface sediment by gravity settling and required minimum energy consumption oxygen bubbles were also observed in the sediment surface when the oxygen loaded porous materials were used as the capping layer fig 5c which indicates that they can be diffused to the surrounding water and contributed to the increase in do concentration therefore the addition of the oxygen loaded porous materials increased the do concentration from 0 20 mg l to 2 4 11 7 mg l in the short term fig 2 the retention of oxygen in the porous material facilitated the diffusion of oxygen bubbles to sediment fig 3 as revealed by the considerable increase in the do concentration across the sediment core after an 11 day incubation fig 3 which suggests that the oxygen carried by the porous material can penetrate into the sediment the elevated do concentration in the anaerobic sediment and water is of vital importance to the restoration of the catastrophic aquatic ecosystem this study showed that the concentration of do considerably increased when the oxygen loaded material was added to the system however after 0 5 9 days of application the o2 concentrations hardly increased with time with the exception of the oxygen loaded volcanic stone treatment which sustainably released oxygen during the 11 days and maintained nearly 7 80 mg l at the end of the microcosm experiment 1 fig 2 in some in situ applications the addition of cao2 can increase the do level to a high level that exceeded the demand of oxygenation and contaminants degradation and was always associated with the exhaustion of oxygen production in several hours or days lee et al 2014 wang et al 2016 compared with a recent study that determined the released oxygen from granulated cao2 lasted for 40 weeks in a pond experiment nykänen et al 2012 the oxygen improvement using porous materials was observed in a shorter time nevertheless it is promising to apply oxygen loaded porous materials in the environment considering that the porous material possesses many distinctive properties such as environmental harmless and reasonable environmental cost compared with other chemicals or mechanical aeration technology when employed as an oxygen carrier 4 3 combined efforts of oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte caused sustainable do improvement the oxygen releasing capacity of the porous materials during a long period is critical which enables the continuous oxygenation of the water bodies by supplying o2 for microbes and improvement in water quality lu et al 2017 in our microcosm study 1 the oxygen was almost totally released from the porous material in 9 days with the exception of volcanic stone fig 2 which indicates that the modulation of anaerobic sediment may be impaired although volcanic stone exhibited a lower oxygen adsorbing capability than gac fig 1 the improvement in do is the most distinct among the analyzed materials however volcanic stone that carried oxygen can be completely consumed with time probably 11 days is required to extend the release period of oxygen different methods have been developed modifications of the chemicals with other materials were made to control the o2 releasing rate for example encapsulation of cao2 in beads were demonstrated to substantially improve the performance with slow oxygen release and constant ph maintenance lee et al 2014 in the previously mentioned modifications the added cao2 significantly increased the ph and influenced the subsequent bioremediation process zhou et al 2017 therefore the development of chemical free methods for anaerobic sediment modulation is necessary submerged macrophytes which are capable of preventing sediment resuspension and increasing primary productions in aquatic systems are a key factor in maintaining a clear state in eutrophic waters wang et al 2017a the limiting factors for the growth of submerged macrophytes include light temperature and oxygen level son et al 2018 of which light and do are always depleted in malodorous black water in our microcosm study 2 the oxygen released by the oxygen loaded porous material substantially mitigated sediment anoxia and provided favorable conditions for the submerged macrophytes to growth fig 5 c d and f capping the surface sediment is also important for short time improvement of do concomitantly the elevated do level provides a window period to promote the growth and restoration of submerged vegetation and thus stabilizing the lake ecosystem can be achieved by numerous positive feedback mechanisms liu et al 2018 this conclusion can be supported both by the largely increased submerged macrophytes biomass fig 5f from initial 2 20 g to final 7 81 g and the failure of sustainable improvement of the do level when only submerged macrophytes were incubated fig 4a our result was also in accordance with previous study which determined that the metabolism of living organisms and seed germination can be enhanced in the presence of air bubbles owusu ansah and banerjee 2009 as illustrated in fig 4a compared with submerged macrophytes incubated or oxygen loaded porous material amended treatments the combined use of submerged macrophytes and oxygen loaded porous material triggered oxygen levels up to 12 mg l during the 41 days incubation and the do level was maintained at 7 0 8 0 mg l towards the end of the test which indicates the reversal of the malodorous black tide and the restoration of the aquatic ecosystems 4 4 manipulation of water quality by the interactive effect of oxygen loaded material and submerged macrophyte with the accelerated process of urbanization the problems of malodorous black water are becoming more critical and have currently evolved into one of the main environmental issues oxygen depletion is a common state of these malodorous black waters and poses a potential threat to benthic inhabitants and aquatic ecosystems nykänen et al 2012 therefore restoring the do level in water is essential for the remediation of polluted malodorous black water zhou et al 2017 in our laboratory tests application of oxygen loaded porous substantially improved the do concentration and the effects were substantially manifested with the co efforts of submerged macrophyte during which the oxygen loaded porous largely provided favorable condition for the growth of submerged macrophyte the latter can sustainably raise the do level through photosynthesis as a result the do levels were maintained at above 4 mg l throughout the 41 day experiment fig 4a the depletion of oxygen was responsible for the disappearance of aquatic species water eutrophication denitrification of nitrogen forth et al 2014 and production of undesirable greenhouse or malodorous gases liikanen and martikainen 2003 miao et al 2006 with a long lasting improvement in do concentrations the production of ch4 was reduced by 85 82 in oxygen loaded porous material capping followed by submerged macrophyte addition treatments compared to the control fig 4c which implies the depression of the anaerobic methanogenesis the do levels can also affect nitrogen transformation the nitrogen removal process particularly nitrification which was the first and rate limiting process for nitrogen transformation was largely limited by insufficient do capping the surface sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone may contribute to the reduction of nh4 n via adsorption and nitrification whereas a 1 33 fold higher nh4 n flux compared to the control was attained during the 41 day incubation this result demonstrated the weak effects of the oxygen loaded material in the long term combating of the anaerobic sediment which implies that the pristine volcanic stone may rarely induce a block effect towards nh4 release in addition the amendment of pristine volcanic stone following the incubation of submerged macrophyte did not exhibit an improvement in the water quality because the macrophyte was quickly decomposed after 7 days of incubation fig s3 with the joint efforts of the oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte the do level at the swi exhibited significant increase fig 4a which benefited the nh4 n reduction by nitrification brzozowska and gawrońska 2009 and under the combined efforts of submerged macrophyte assimilation a negative nh4 n flux across swi was observed after 41 days investigation fig 4b the biological remineralization of organic matter consumes vast quantities of o2 in sediment thus it is the most crucial cause of anoxia in waters nykänen et al 2012 the exhaustion of oxygen can affect carbon transformation processes and facilitate ch4 productions the release of ch4 from the sediments was primarily controlled by the o2 availability liikanen and martikainen 2003 thus when oxygen is present in overlying water and served as electron acceptors aerobic microbial processes including ch4 oxidation may dominate in the surface sediments this process likely prompted the co2 production however depressed co2 flux fig 4d and tic content fig 5a were recorded in our study probably due to the fact that 1 the co2 was converted in to hco3 which caused the reduction of ph as shown in fig s5 the ph was maintained at nearly 8 01 in the oxygen loaded material capping plus submerged macrophyte addition systems which indicates a more tender effect on ph while reaching 9 25 in the control and 2 the inorganic carbon produced by the mineralization of organic matter was constricted in the water column but then assimilated by the submerged macrophyte as revealed in fig 5b c d and f given the above data and discussions the combined employment of oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte triggered multiple ecological responses in malodorous black water including the sustainable improvement of do concentration promotion of the remineralization of organic matter depression of anaerobic methanogenesis meanwhile enhancement of co2 production regulation of nitrogen flux across swi and creation of favorable conditions for the growth of submerged macrophyte which may in turn contributes to increase do levels these multiple processes are illustrated in fig 6 5 conclusions ecological restoration of malodorous black water is crucial in china particularly after the implementation of pollution abatement and control programs this study proposes a simple and eco friendly approach to preparing oxygen loaded material by the removal of air from the porous materials followed by filling them with pure o2 among the studied 6 investigated porous materials the gac possessed the highest oxygen loading capability while volcanic stone were most efficient in improving do concentration at the swi this discrepancy can be explained by the pore size distribution of which the gac showed massive small 2 nm and large 20 nm pores but mid sized pores 2 10 nm were prevalent in volcanic stone capping the anaerobic sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone increased the do concentration during our 11 day experiment but can be extended to 41 days when submerged macrophyte was added the combined employment of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte triggered continuous improvement of do in malodorous black water accompanied by the reduction of ch4 and the depression of nh4 n release from sediment as well as the 2 55 fold increase in the submerged macrophyte biomass thus a sustainable modulation of the investigated malodorous black water was achieved the proposed approach can potentially help to outcompete the combat towards the restoration of malodorous black water nationwide authorship

18725,depleted oxygen o2 in the sediment and overlying water of malodorous black water poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems this study presents a method for sustainable regulation of the dissolved oxygen do levels towards the malodorous black water oxygen loaded natural porous materials were prepared by vacuum degassing to remove air from the pores and fill them with pure o2 capping anaerobic sediment with the prepared 6 oxygen loaded porous materials was effective in prompting the do concentration of the malodorous black water although granules activated carbon gac displayed the highest oxygen loading capability oxygen loaded volcanic stone additive was more efficient for long lasting combating of the anaerobic condition because the do level at sediment water interface swi and the do penetration depth showed approximately 5 38 and 3 75 fold increase respectively compared with the untreated systems the improvement in do was substantially enhanced in the presence of submerged macrophyte vallisneria natans during which the release of o2 from oxygen loaded volcanic stone facilitated the plant growth with the joint efforts of the o2 released from volcanic stone and photosynthesis by the macrophytes the do levels were maintained at approximately 6 80 mg l after a 41 day incubation which exceeded p 0 05 the value in only oxygen loaded volcanic stone or macrophytes added treatments in addition to the elevated do level the combined employment of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and macrophytes triggered a negative ammonia nh4 n flux across the swi and an 85 82 reduction of methane ch4 production compared with those without treatment accompanied by a decrease in total inorganic carbon and a 2 55 fold increasing of submerged macrophyte biomass which is presumably attributed to nitrification remineralization and assimilation the results obtained here shed a degree of light on the sustainable modulation of the anaerobic condition in malodorous black water graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic sediment black water submerged macrophyte capping microelectrode 1 introduction the occurrence of malodorous black water is a phenomenon in which water turns black and produces offensive odorous gas talaiekhozani et al 2016 due to the extensive input of industrial and municipal waste and runoff in urban and agricultural areas into rivers and lakes malodorous black water is frequently reported in china which is a serious natural ecosystem disaster that threatens numerous lakes and rivers nationwide currently the number of bodies of malodorous black waters in china is 2100 as a result the need to turn back the black tide is vital china has made considerable efforts to mitigate the pollution of malodorous black waters currently the constructions of wastewater treatment plants have paid special attention to the disposal of large volumes of wastewater before there are received by lakes and rivers however the treatment of malodorous black water is currently not satisfactory due to the high concentration of pollutants present in the discharged water such as organic matter and nitrogen even if the required removal efficiency is attained jin et al 2018 which can also enhance pollutant inputs for malodorous black waters moreover despite the implementation of pollution abatement and control programs the contaminants in the water column will mitigate to the bottom and sequentially gather in the sediment in the polluted waters thus the sediment become a pollution source in the aquatic systems borgnino et al 2006 ding et al 2015 2018 without the application of post treatments to remove the pollutants in the sediment and implement ecological restoration the tide of the malodorous black water can hardly be reverted techniques using biotechnological and engineering methods to remediate malodorous black water have been received considerable attentions removal of surface sediment has been considered as an alternative to reduce nutrients release from anaerobic sediments lürling and faassen 2012 waajen et al 2016 ex situ dredging of the anaerobic sediments is extensively employed for sediment remediation despite the encouraging results of some laboratory studies some field experiments have reported a minimal reduction in sediment nutrients flux after dredging in the long term kleeberg and kohl 1999 oldenborg and steinman 2019 recent studies evaluating the effect of sediment dredging on water quality improvement after dredging for 6 years discovered that the decomposed algae can precipitate and settle on the lake sediment in summer and autumn which favored the release of phosphorus from sediments by the exhaustion of oxygen reduction of fe oxyhydroxides to fe ii han et al 2015 and releasing of algal originated phosphorus ai et al 2019 hence impaired dredging effectiveness chen et al 2018 malodorous black water is also characterized by hypoxic low dissolved oxygen do concentration and high content of organic matter and ammonia nh4 n zhou et al 2015 which in turn is a key factor that affects the degradation of organic matter and the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen svensson et al 2015 a conventional approach to increasing oxygen o2 levels in waters is mechanical aeration which is capable of reducing organic matter since it will cause the proliferation of organic degraded related bacteria yuan et al 2018 however this methodology is becoming obsolete due to the high energy consumption and relatively low efficiency podsiadłowski et al 2018 also aeration can substantially enhance the re suspension of the polluted sediment and prompted the light attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem an alternative approach involves chemicals addition which may donate oxygen as reacting with water hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can decay to water and oxygen via chemical and biological oxidation reduction reactions matthijs et al 2012 and was assumed to be a potential way to improve the oxygen levels in water whereas h2o2 had to be continually supplied and would kill the degrading microbes at high concentrations nykänen et al 2012 the potential negative impact of h2o2 can be mitigated using granulated calcium peroxide cao2 which can release 17 of its weight as o2 as a slow oxygen releasing compound wang et al 2019b when the granulated cao2 was spread to the lake the effect was visible for the entire 40 week experiment nykänen et al 2012 however some attempts to improve the do concentration using cao2 caused an increase in the ph levels from 7 1 to 11 3 due to the generation of ca oh 2 lee et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 considering the energy input total environmental impact and public acceptance the exploration of high efficient cost effective and most importantly environmentally benign methods is recommended to treat the malodorous black waters of which the improvement in do concentration should be given high priority as previously addressed the level of do is essential for the survival of aerobic microbe and aquatic species including submerged macrophytes in desired aquatic systems particularly those dominated by submerged macrophytes the deficiency of some nutrients and high do concentration may occur due to the assimilation of nutrients and photosynthesis by the macrophytes once established submerged macrophytes are considered to have a positive effect on water clarity and the stability of aquatic ecosystems by a variety of buffer mechanisms stephen et al 1998 although the recovery of aquatic vegetation was determined to be crucial for restoring malodorous black water the oxygen exhaustion or at the minimum level 0 2 mg l zhu et al 2017 and the extreme high content of organic matter ammonium and alkaline condition wang et al 2017b deteriorated the growth of aquatic vegetation from our perspective emerging technologies that may trigger the recovery of the self organized ecosystems once the implementation of pollution abatement was achieved should be investigated the two microcosm experiments presented in this paper are concerned with sustainable improvement of do level in malodorous black waters we prepared oxygen carried porous material that can release oxygen with limited negative environmental impacts with the modified microenvironment particularly do levels at the sediment water interface swi with oxygen loaded porous material capping submerged macrophytes were subsequently incubated this study sought to develop and test a method for increasing the do level of sediments and regulation of the anaerobic environment with the joint efforts of oxygen carried porous material and submerged macrophytes and explore how the aquatic ecosystem responded 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and characterization studies granular activated carbon gac akadama clay pumice stone ceramsite volcanic stone and zeolite and were used to load oxygen the 6 natural porous materials were obtained from beixing natural minerals ltd chongqing china the specific surface area of the porous materials was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method with a micromeritics asap 2020 apparatus micromeritics inc usa the pore volumes were obtained by analyzing the 77 k n2 adsorption desorption isotherms during which the analysis was performed at a relative pressure p p0 of 0 98 the pore size distribution of the materials were calculated from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using the non local density functional theory nldft model for carbonaceous slit like pores implemented in belsorp software heo and park 2018 2 2 preparation of oxygen carried porous materials the porous materials were washed with double deionized water and dried at 90 c the materials were degassed in a sealed container for 5 min at room temperature under vacuum 0 09 mpa to remove air from their pores then pure o2 was subsequently pumped into the container and maintained at a pressure of 0 2 mpa for 5 min to enable the o2 to enter the pores oxygen loading capability of the porous materials was acquired from the o2 adsorption desorption isotherms which recorded at 77 k using a quantachrome analyzer the porous materials were dried at 200 c for 5 h before measurement oxygen uptake under dynamic pressure from 4 to 74 bars was performed by the h sorb 2600 high pressure volumetric adsorption analyzer gold app instrument corporation beijing china a known amount of oxygen was dosed into the measurement tube that contained the porous materials when equilibrium between the materials and adsorbed oxygen is attained a comprehensive final equilibrium pressure can be automatically recorded the quantity of adsorbed o2 was calculated from the generated data ahmed et al 2017 then two microcosm experiments were established to assess the do dynamics and evaluate the joint effects of the oxygen loaded porous materials and submerged macrophyte on sustainable do improvement 2 3 microcosm experiment 1 evaluation of do improvement of the oxygen carried porous materials a microcosm scale study was established to assess the do dynamics as function of oxygen carried porous materials additions fourteen plexiglas cylinders with an inner diameter of 10 cm and height of 60 cm were filled with the same amount of sediment thickness of 10 cm and water 3 5 l a depth of 45 cm which was collected from a malodorous black lake 29 36 52 n 106 19 40 e located in shapingba district chongqing china to simulate the environmental malodorous black scenario the chemical characteristics of the water are do 0 20 mg l nh4 n 9 01 mg l total organic carbon toc 20 08 mg l total inorganic carbon tic 25 07 mg l and ph 7 24 assessed using phs 3c china the 14 columns were randomly divided into 7 treatments two columns that contain water and sediment were used as controls and then sediment in other columns was capped by oxygen loaded gac akadama clay pumice stone ceramsite volcanic stone and zeolite respectively with a dose of 0 8 kg m2 and with duplicates for each a do meter yellow springs instruments ysi proplus was lightly placed into the overlying water and held at 1 2 cm above the sediment surface to assessed the do level in each column during the measurements the o2 probe was gently circulated bonaglia et al 2019 to prevent the electrode from consuming a portion of oxygen at the moment it touches the water and the measurement was conducted twice a day each experimental column was wrapped with black plastic to shield the ambient light below the sediment surface when the do concentration in the majority of the columns displayed slight alternations the do profiles across the swi in the control and the column that showed the most satisfactory do improvement were assessed using an o2 microelectrode unisense a s denmark which had a tip diameter of 100 μm and was protected by a glass tube with inner diameter of 3 mm the diameter of the glass tube exceeded the size of the porous materials to avoid damage of the sensor by the materials then the microelectrode was moved through the capping layers to some depth in the sediment by an increment of 100 μm with assistance of a unisense a s microelectrode positioning system fig s1 calibration of the do sensor was performed before each measurement three profiles per microcosm were randomly measured in the sediment samples to assess spatial heterogeneities the position of the swi was determined from the break in the o2 concentration gradient miao et al 2017 2018 2 4 microcosm experiment 2 the combined role of oxygen carried material and submerged macrophyte in do improvement the most efficient oxygen loaded porous materials can be obtained based on the evaluation of the do concentration both at the overlying water and the do profiles across the swi in microcosm experiment 1 then the joint effects of the oxygen loaded porous materials and submerged macrophyte on sustainable do improvement were assessed eight plexiglas cylinders that contain the same amount of sediment and water were divided into 4 groups 1 containing water and sediment and used as the control 2 the incubation of submerged macrophyte vallisneria natans seedling in the surface sediment 3 capping the surface sediment with the most satisfactory oxygen loaded porous material according to experiment 1 and 4 after capping the sediment with oxygen loaded porous material the vallisneria natans seedling was incubated the initial fresh biomass of the vallisneria natans seedling in groups 2 and 4 were 2 20 g with a height of 4 5 cm containing root and leaf during the incubation ph and the concentration of do at the swi were measured as described in experiment 1 the ch4 and co2 areal fluxes from the 4 treatments were monitored at 5 day interval following using a static chamber method during gas collection a plexiglas chamber with diameter of 14 cm and height of 10 cm was used to cover the outer of the column and submerge 2 cm into the water contained fig s2 which served to maintain the chamber about 10 cm above the water surface in the column meanwhile avoided gas exchange between the column and atmosphere after 3 h the gas was collected in the gas bag hb 3 cqd china using a pump wt 80 china through the sampling hole then the ch4 and co2 concentration are assessed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection 7890b agilent usa li et al 2018 and the ch4 and co2 fluxes are calculated using the method described in our previous literature ai et al 2019 ten milliliter of overlying water samples 5 cm above the sediment were also collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm sartorius filter prior to analysis of nh4 n at the beginning and end of the experiment after each sampling all the studied systems were gently supplied with the original filtered water to compensate for the water losses due to sampling and evaporation the nh4 n fluxes were calculated according to the following mass balance zhu et al 2019 f n v c a c b j 1 i 1 n v j c a c i s t where fn is the flux mg m2 d v is the volume of overlying water l ca is the nh4 n concentration mg l in the end cb is the nh4 n concentration at the start

carbon fractions of overlying water samples were analyzed concentrations of total carbon tc were determined using the vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar equipped with a thermal conductivity detector the concentrations of tic were measured with the solitic elementar module coupled with the vario el cube samples were heated to 50 c and acidified with 5 hcl the released co2 was measured with a thermal conductivity detector the toc was determined by subtracting the tic from the tc wang et al 2019a żarczyński et al 2019 during the assessment of the fresh weight of the submerged macrophyte at the start and end of the incubation the submerged macrophyte was cleaned of periphyton under running water and dried on filter paper followed by immediate measurement of the weight jasser 1995 the two microcosm experiments were performed at a constant 25 c in an illumination incubator gzx 250bsh with a light intensity of 40 μmol photons m2 s under 12 h 12 h light and dark cycles 2 5 statistical analyses the statistical package of the social science 18 0 spss 18 0 was used for statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was used to test the statistical significance of the results p values less than 0 05 were considered statistically significant the conceptual diagram was performed by adobe illustrator cs 5 3 results 3 1 characterization of porous materials akadama clay and gac showed an apparent higher surface area 220 89 and 149 17 m2 g respectively than other porous materials table 1 the total pore volume showed a distinct difference among the investigated materials and followed the order of gac akadama clay volcanic stone zeolite pumice stone and ceramsite in addition to the minimum surface area 0 41 m2 g and pore volume 0 0014 cm3 g in ceramsite the maximum average pore size 12 38 nm was also observed the distribution of pore size revealed that the narrow size less than 2 nm and the wide pore greater than 20 nm accounted for the majority of the pore distribution for gac a similar pattern was also seen in pumice stone although the surface area 71 22 m2 g and pore volume 0 11 cm3 g of volcanic stone were substantially lower than those of akadama clay and gac its pore size in the range of 2 20 nm was prevalent although the pore size in the range of 2 20 nm was also abundant in zeolite its low pore volume likely did not benefit the oxygen loading 3 2 oxygen loading capabilities under elevated pressure the o2 adsorbing capability showed constant increase for gac akadama clay volcanic stone and zeolite conversely no apparent adsorption by pumice stone and ceramsite occurred which indicates that o2 can be reversibly adsorbed in the pores at the chosen pressure theoretically the o2 adsorbing capability is approximately 0 38 mmol g for gac which showed the maximum o2 uptake among the analyzed materials followed by akadama clay 0 23 mmol g volcanic stone 0 17 mmol g and zeolite 0 16 mmol g note that o2 adsorption by volcanic stone maintained an increase with an increase in pressure fig 1 3 3 oxygen dynamic in overlying water capping sediment with the oxygen loaded porous materials had a distinct impact on the do concentrations in overlying water in the controls the do concentration remained at approximately 0 20 1 75 mg l throughout the 11 days incubation fig 2 oxygen loaded zeolite and ceramsite can elevate the do level to 2 84 mg l while the do concentration showed a dramatic decline in the oxygen loaded ceramsite capped groups although capping sediment with oxygen loaded zeolite improved the do level maximum to 3 8 mg l on day 2 5 the do showed a constant subsequent decline afterward and an insignificant p 0 05 difference with the control on day 11 in contrast with the oxygen loading capability test oxygen loaded gac substantially improved the do level 6 84 mg l when it was added in the systems while the do concentration showed a rapid decrease and the final concentration was considerable lower than that in the control groups a similar pattern was also observed in the presence of oxygen loaded akadama clay and pumice stone capping the sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone produced not only maximum do levels 11 84 mg l among the treatments but also caused sustainable improvement of the anaerobic sediment during the whole study period and the do levels were maintained at nearly 7 00 8 00 mg l since day 41 which indicated that volcanic stone can slowly release the loaded oxygen and deliver it to the sediment and aqueous phase 3 4 oxygen profile across the sediment core the effect of oxygen loaded volcanic stone on the improvement of do concentration was further measured using microelectrodes fig 3 in the bulk aqueous phase of control do ranged from 0 22 to 1 64 mg l during the 11 days experimental period the oxygen penetration was measured up to a depth of 2000 μm at the beginning of the incubation fig 3a although the do level at the swi increased to 1 64 mg l and an oxygen penetration of 7000 μm as attained after 6 days the do level decreased to 1 25 mg l with an oxygen penetration depth of 3000 μm which indicates significant oxygen consumption within the sediment capping the sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone substantially reverted the anaerobic tide and the do concentration in the bulk aqueous phase was 8 67 mg l after 6 days of exposure to the capping materials accompanied by an oxygen penetration depth of 18000 μm however after 11 days incubation both the swi do level reduced to 7 16 mg l and the oxygen penetration depth decreased to 1200 μm showed a slight reductions compared with day 6 fig 3b nevertheless the results clearly demonstrated that the presence of oxygen loaded volcanic stone produced a substantially higher oxygen concentration and a deeper o2 penetration in the sediment 3 5 combined efforts of oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte on physico chemical parameters fig 4 a illustrates the dynamics of do concentration against time for four different treatments the do concentration constantly remained at approximately 0 21 mg l during the 41 days study and the addition of submerged macrophyte did not change the profile due to the decomposition of the plant in extremely anaerobic conditions fig s3 the do concentrations showed a notable increase once the oxygen loaded volcanic stone was added however it decreased to nearly 2 50 mg l after 5 days with an insignificant difference between oxygen loaded volcanic stone capping plus submerged macrophyte incubation treatment with a continuous release of oxygen bubbles the oxygen loaded volcanic stone maximally elevated the do level to 7 76 mg l with the exhaustion of the loaded oxygen the do concentration then decreased to 1 85 mg l after 41 days conversely the joint efforts of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte induced an abrupt increase in do level which maximally reached 12 21 mg l despite a reduction to nearly 6 80 mg l after 21 days the do level became stable with time toward the end of the study which indicates the reverse of the anaerobic condition concomitantly after 41 days of exposure the nh4 n flux at the swi showed a statistically significant different p 0 05 among the treatments fig 4b in the combined oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte treatment the nh4 nflux from sediment to water across the swi was negative 0 013 mg m2 d compared to the continuous release of nh4 n in other treatments 0 032 0 064 mg m2 d the areal fluxes of ch4 significantly differed among the treatments in the controls the ch4 fluxes ranged from 0 05 to 24 62 mg m2 h and the maximum ch4 fluxes were 1 23 3 32 and 8 63 times higher than those in submerged macrophyte oxygen loaded volcanic stone and oxygen loaded volcanic stone plus submerged macrophyte treatments respectively fig 4c the investigated treatments were effective in reducing ch4 emission and the minimum was obtained for the joint efforts of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte 0 14 mg m2 h during the study co2 production was prevalent in the control but showed an abrupt decrease with time in the oxygen loaded volcanic stone plus submerged macrophyte treatments the co2 flux showed a pattern that was similar with ch4 flux and the released co2 was significantly lower than other treatments fig 4d which suggests that the co2 may be restrained in the water column both the toc concentration and tic concentration after 41 days incubation were remarkably higher in the controls than other treatments fig 5 a in compared with the control capping the sediment surface with oxygen loaded volcanic stone caused a 25 and 52 reduction in tic and toc respectively the tic and toc concentration showed a significant decline p 0 05 with oxygen loaded volcanic stone capping the effects were enhanced with the co incubation of submerged macrophyte which implies the remineralization of organic matter in aerobic conditions in oxygen loaded volcanic stone capping plus submerged macrophyte added treatments with an improvement in do in the systems also indicated by fig 5 d compared with the control fig 5e organic carbon was converted to inorganic carbon fig 5a while an abrupt decrease of tic was observed indicating the assimilation of carbon by macrophyte this finding can be confirmed by a 2 55 fold the increase in the macrophyte biomass fig 5b c d and f 4 discussion malodorous black water is generally accompanied by an extremely low do level and a high nh4 n concentration the current main solutions for oxygenation of the hypolimnion and anaerobic sediment include physical methods e g artificial aeration chemical approaches e g flocculation precipitation and biological strategies e g ecological floating bed freeman et al 2018 these approaches may require high cost and energy consumption and may disturb the settled sediment and induce internal releases of contaminants oxygen releasing material as represented by cao2 has gained great attention due to its ability to generate undesirably high ph in water wang et al 2019b in this regard seeking a green economical and efficient technology is of great importance wang et al 2019b 4 1 pore size distribution determines the oxygen releasing efficiency in this study we explored an alternative strategy to deliver o2 to the anaerobic water that involves the use of porous materials natural porous materials are considered to be promising o2 carriers due to their cost effectiveness high surface area and naturally basic surface characteristics heo and park 2018 we evaluated 6 porous materials for their oxygen loading capability and discovered that gac possess significantly stronger sorption ability for o2 0 38 mmol g followed by akadama clay 0 23 mmol g volcanic stone 0 17 mmol g zeolite 0 16 mmol g pumice stone 0 07 mmol g and ceramsite 0 02 mmol g fig 1 as indicated in table 1 the total pore volume of gac and akadama clay were several orders of magnitude higher than those of other analyzed porous materials which indicates that the oxygen loading capabilities may be linked with their total pore volume when the 6 oxygen loaded materials were applied to the sediment the improvement in the do level were observed to follow the order of volcanic stone zeolite pumice stone akadama clay ceramsite gac which revealed a distinct difference with their oxygen loading capabilities the difference in the oxygen loading capability can be explained by the specific surface area and porous size distribution while the improvement in the do in the microcosm experiment may be more linked to the existence of mesopores heo and park 2018 an ideal oxygen carrier should possess the ability to store and transport significant amounts of oxygen while the o2 releasing rate is under control the investigated 6 oxygen loaded materials showed a distinct distribution of pore size although the specific surface area of gac and akadama clay 149 17 and 220 89 m2 g respectively table 1 exceeded other porous materials with the exception of ceramsite they exhibited a predominance of larger pores 20 nm and smaller pores 2 nm table 1 which may either facilitate the bubbling off fig s4 or cause the locking of oxygen the large pore size produced a loose arrangement with oxygen bubbles which is highly beneficial for fast oxygen transfer and cause a quick release and bubbling off during the early stage of the releasing process as suggested by the drastic decrease in do concentration in the presence of oxygen loaded gac in the microcosm experiment 1 fig 1 this bubble off enables the release of larger oxygen bubbles to the aqueous phase and may eventually reduce the biologically available oxygen lee et al 2014 this result was consistent with a previous study which indicated that an ion with a small radius e g oxygen that fills a large space can produce a loose arrangement with larger voids thus cause a the fast release işıklan 2007 the highest value for oxygen loading capability by gac may also be attributed to the enhanced interaction between o2 and the adsorbent in these narrow micropores pore size less than 2 nm during which the tight arrangement with smaller pores may occur hence substantially reduce the oxygen releasing rates consequently volcanic stone which comparatively possessed a higher specific surface area and pore volume but the prevalence of mid sized mescopores of 2 10 nm table 1 helped depressing the drastic release of loaded oxygen bubbles resulting in slow release of the smaller oxygen bubbles in the water phase and benefited the improvement in the do concentrations in addition to the fact that the pore size of the porous materials exhibits a close relationship with the oxygen releasing efficiency the affinity of the oxygen towards a specific adsorbate may also affect the oxygen loading and the oxygen releasing performance plaza et al 2014 which explains the discrepancy between the oxygen loading capability and do improve efficiency a description of the linkage between the o2 affinity to the adsorbents and oxygen releasing efficiency requires further detailed studies nevertheless this study provides a potential method for improving the do concentration using an ecological approach 4 2 oxygen loaded porous materials are effective for short term anaerobic modulation this study presents a simple method for increasing the oxygen level using porous materials as oxygen carrier the results demonstrate that the material is effective for delivering oxygen to the sediment fig 4 and aqueous phase fig 2 in this study the majority of the investigated porous materials exhibited an oxygen loading capability despite the variation in loading quantity fig 1 when the oxygen loaded porous materials were applied to the water column the materials capped on the surface sediment by gravity settling and required minimum energy consumption oxygen bubbles were also observed in the sediment surface when the oxygen loaded porous materials were used as the capping layer fig 5c which indicates that they can be diffused to the surrounding water and contributed to the increase in do concentration therefore the addition of the oxygen loaded porous materials increased the do concentration from 0 20 mg l to 2 4 11 7 mg l in the short term fig 2 the retention of oxygen in the porous material facilitated the diffusion of oxygen bubbles to sediment fig 3 as revealed by the considerable increase in the do concentration across the sediment core after an 11 day incubation fig 3 which suggests that the oxygen carried by the porous material can penetrate into the sediment the elevated do concentration in the anaerobic sediment and water is of vital importance to the restoration of the catastrophic aquatic ecosystem this study showed that the concentration of do considerably increased when the oxygen loaded material was added to the system however after 0 5 9 days of application the o2 concentrations hardly increased with time with the exception of the oxygen loaded volcanic stone treatment which sustainably released oxygen during the 11 days and maintained nearly 7 80 mg l at the end of the microcosm experiment 1 fig 2 in some in situ applications the addition of cao2 can increase the do level to a high level that exceeded the demand of oxygenation and contaminants degradation and was always associated with the exhaustion of oxygen production in several hours or days lee et al 2014 wang et al 2016 compared with a recent study that determined the released oxygen from granulated cao2 lasted for 40 weeks in a pond experiment nykänen et al 2012 the oxygen improvement using porous materials was observed in a shorter time nevertheless it is promising to apply oxygen loaded porous materials in the environment considering that the porous material possesses many distinctive properties such as environmental harmless and reasonable environmental cost compared with other chemicals or mechanical aeration technology when employed as an oxygen carrier 4 3 combined efforts of oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte caused sustainable do improvement the oxygen releasing capacity of the porous materials during a long period is critical which enables the continuous oxygenation of the water bodies by supplying o2 for microbes and improvement in water quality lu et al 2017 in our microcosm study 1 the oxygen was almost totally released from the porous material in 9 days with the exception of volcanic stone fig 2 which indicates that the modulation of anaerobic sediment may be impaired although volcanic stone exhibited a lower oxygen adsorbing capability than gac fig 1 the improvement in do is the most distinct among the analyzed materials however volcanic stone that carried oxygen can be completely consumed with time probably 11 days is required to extend the release period of oxygen different methods have been developed modifications of the chemicals with other materials were made to control the o2 releasing rate for example encapsulation of cao2 in beads were demonstrated to substantially improve the performance with slow oxygen release and constant ph maintenance lee et al 2014 in the previously mentioned modifications the added cao2 significantly increased the ph and influenced the subsequent bioremediation process zhou et al 2017 therefore the development of chemical free methods for anaerobic sediment modulation is necessary submerged macrophytes which are capable of preventing sediment resuspension and increasing primary productions in aquatic systems are a key factor in maintaining a clear state in eutrophic waters wang et al 2017a the limiting factors for the growth of submerged macrophytes include light temperature and oxygen level son et al 2018 of which light and do are always depleted in malodorous black water in our microcosm study 2 the oxygen released by the oxygen loaded porous material substantially mitigated sediment anoxia and provided favorable conditions for the submerged macrophytes to growth fig 5 c d and f capping the surface sediment is also important for short time improvement of do concomitantly the elevated do level provides a window period to promote the growth and restoration of submerged vegetation and thus stabilizing the lake ecosystem can be achieved by numerous positive feedback mechanisms liu et al 2018 this conclusion can be supported both by the largely increased submerged macrophytes biomass fig 5f from initial 2 20 g to final 7 81 g and the failure of sustainable improvement of the do level when only submerged macrophytes were incubated fig 4a our result was also in accordance with previous study which determined that the metabolism of living organisms and seed germination can be enhanced in the presence of air bubbles owusu ansah and banerjee 2009 as illustrated in fig 4a compared with submerged macrophytes incubated or oxygen loaded porous material amended treatments the combined use of submerged macrophytes and oxygen loaded porous material triggered oxygen levels up to 12 mg l during the 41 days incubation and the do level was maintained at 7 0 8 0 mg l towards the end of the test which indicates the reversal of the malodorous black tide and the restoration of the aquatic ecosystems 4 4 manipulation of water quality by the interactive effect of oxygen loaded material and submerged macrophyte with the accelerated process of urbanization the problems of malodorous black water are becoming more critical and have currently evolved into one of the main environmental issues oxygen depletion is a common state of these malodorous black waters and poses a potential threat to benthic inhabitants and aquatic ecosystems nykänen et al 2012 therefore restoring the do level in water is essential for the remediation of polluted malodorous black water zhou et al 2017 in our laboratory tests application of oxygen loaded porous substantially improved the do concentration and the effects were substantially manifested with the co efforts of submerged macrophyte during which the oxygen loaded porous largely provided favorable condition for the growth of submerged macrophyte the latter can sustainably raise the do level through photosynthesis as a result the do levels were maintained at above 4 mg l throughout the 41 day experiment fig 4a the depletion of oxygen was responsible for the disappearance of aquatic species water eutrophication denitrification of nitrogen forth et al 2014 and production of undesirable greenhouse or malodorous gases liikanen and martikainen 2003 miao et al 2006 with a long lasting improvement in do concentrations the production of ch4 was reduced by 85 82 in oxygen loaded porous material capping followed by submerged macrophyte addition treatments compared to the control fig 4c which implies the depression of the anaerobic methanogenesis the do levels can also affect nitrogen transformation the nitrogen removal process particularly nitrification which was the first and rate limiting process for nitrogen transformation was largely limited by insufficient do capping the surface sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone may contribute to the reduction of nh4 n via adsorption and nitrification whereas a 1 33 fold higher nh4 n flux compared to the control was attained during the 41 day incubation this result demonstrated the weak effects of the oxygen loaded material in the long term combating of the anaerobic sediment which implies that the pristine volcanic stone may rarely induce a block effect towards nh4 release in addition the amendment of pristine volcanic stone following the incubation of submerged macrophyte did not exhibit an improvement in the water quality because the macrophyte was quickly decomposed after 7 days of incubation fig s3 with the joint efforts of the oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte the do level at the swi exhibited significant increase fig 4a which benefited the nh4 n reduction by nitrification brzozowska and gawrońska 2009 and under the combined efforts of submerged macrophyte assimilation a negative nh4 n flux across swi was observed after 41 days investigation fig 4b the biological remineralization of organic matter consumes vast quantities of o2 in sediment thus it is the most crucial cause of anoxia in waters nykänen et al 2012 the exhaustion of oxygen can affect carbon transformation processes and facilitate ch4 productions the release of ch4 from the sediments was primarily controlled by the o2 availability liikanen and martikainen 2003 thus when oxygen is present in overlying water and served as electron acceptors aerobic microbial processes including ch4 oxidation may dominate in the surface sediments this process likely prompted the co2 production however depressed co2 flux fig 4d and tic content fig 5a were recorded in our study probably due to the fact that 1 the co2 was converted in to hco3 which caused the reduction of ph as shown in fig s5 the ph was maintained at nearly 8 01 in the oxygen loaded material capping plus submerged macrophyte addition systems which indicates a more tender effect on ph while reaching 9 25 in the control and 2 the inorganic carbon produced by the mineralization of organic matter was constricted in the water column but then assimilated by the submerged macrophyte as revealed in fig 5b c d and f given the above data and discussions the combined employment of oxygen loaded porous material and submerged macrophyte triggered multiple ecological responses in malodorous black water including the sustainable improvement of do concentration promotion of the remineralization of organic matter depression of anaerobic methanogenesis meanwhile enhancement of co2 production regulation of nitrogen flux across swi and creation of favorable conditions for the growth of submerged macrophyte which may in turn contributes to increase do levels these multiple processes are illustrated in fig 6 5 conclusions ecological restoration of malodorous black water is crucial in china particularly after the implementation of pollution abatement and control programs this study proposes a simple and eco friendly approach to preparing oxygen loaded material by the removal of air from the porous materials followed by filling them with pure o2 among the studied 6 investigated porous materials the gac possessed the highest oxygen loading capability while volcanic stone were most efficient in improving do concentration at the swi this discrepancy can be explained by the pore size distribution of which the gac showed massive small 2 nm and large 20 nm pores but mid sized pores 2 10 nm were prevalent in volcanic stone capping the anaerobic sediment with oxygen loaded volcanic stone increased the do concentration during our 11 day experiment but can be extended to 41 days when submerged macrophyte was added the combined employment of oxygen loaded volcanic stone and submerged macrophyte triggered continuous improvement of do in malodorous black water accompanied by the reduction of ch4 and the depression of nh4 n release from sediment as well as the 2 55 fold increase in the submerged macrophyte biomass thus a sustainable modulation of the investigated malodorous black water was achieved the proposed approach can potentially help to outcompete the combat towards the restoration of malodorous black water nationwide authorship

18726,this study attempted to investigate the influence of operation mode and wastewater strength on startup period aerobic granular sludge ags characteristics and system effluent quality at pilot scale granulation was monitored in three pilot scale granular sequencing batch reactors gsbrs comparative evaluation of an o ax o sbr and o sbr fed with wastewater of the same composition but run with completely different sbr reaction phase arrangements alternating vs purely aerobic revealed the effect of sbr operation mode comparative study of the gsbrs operated with alternating sbr reaction phases an o ax o sbr and an o sbr and fed with wastewater of different strength high vs medium strength determined the effect of wastewater composition granulation time and granule size were regulated by wastewater strength and the resulting organic and sludge loading conditions whereas ags morphology granule structure and floccular proportion of ags were attributed to sbr operation mode effluent clarity in terms of suspended solid concentration depended on wastewater strength subtle but distinct microbial selection strategies were in effect during granulation which were also imposed by wastewater strength due to strong correlation between the effluent and ags microbial structures demonstrated by biodiversity analysis differences in the microbial composition of effluent biomass and washout patterns of the gsbrs could be explained by wastewater strength as well limited nutrient removal efficiencies restricted by organic matter concentration could be due to involvement of unorthodox nutrient removal pathways which warrants further investigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge ags characteristics effluent quality pilot scale startup wastewater strength sequencing batch reactor sbr operation mode 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has become the focus of extensive research in the last two decades due to great advantages over conventional activated sludge cas process although the effectiveness of aerobic granulation in terms of treatment performance and granule stability has been widespread demonstrated in controlled laboratory scale reactors de kreuk et al 2005 ji et al 2009 yilmaz et al 2008 its full scale application is still limited mostly due to knowledge deficit about the process scale up indeed this gap of knowledge is resulted from distinct effects of influential factors on aerobic granulation in different reactor scales which necessitates further justification of the findings derived from lab scale studies in large scale modules testing optimization step for instance pishgar et al 2018 ascertained that the hydrodynamic pattern prevailing in pilot scale reactor could severely deviate from that in the successful lab scale counterpart if the aeration pattern and gas distribution were not optimized which could eventually inhibit granulation by situating the fledging technology at the time in luyben scale up matrix de kreuk 2006 identified pilot study as the crucial testing optimization step for the scale up of ags reactors indeed the advent of nereda the first mature full scale ags technology giesen et al 2013 became feasible by design and operation of the first pilot scale granular reactor de kreuk 2006 nevertheless despite its proven importance only a handful of studies have been dedicated to aerobic granulation at pilot scale so far cetin et al 2018 isanta et al 2012 liu et al 2011 2010 long et al 2014 ni et al 2009 pishgar et al 2018 rocktäschel et al 2015 current literature regarding pilot and full scale ags investigations mainly encompass usage of actual municipal cetin et al 2018 derlon et al 2016 giesen et al 2013 isanta et al 2012 liu et al 2011 2010 ni et al 2009 and industrial morales et al 2013 wei et al 2012 wastewaters an overview of these studies demonstrates several adverse implications for granulation in larger scale modules such as i long startup periods months to about a year giesen et al 2013 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 ii development of small granules 0 2 2 mm cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 wagner and da costa 2013 iii structural and functional instability of ags which can adversely affect the treatment performance cetin et al 2018 although these studies provide good insight into ags formation and performance in real time situations they are not conducted systematically in order to lay a solid ground for different aspects of aerobic granulation in larger scale modules and thus cannot unravel the encountered scale up knots appropriately wide fluctuations in wastewater characteristics and diverse operating conditions adopted in these studies make it difficult to draw a comprehensive conclusion from their results appropriate consideration of number of factors enhances substrate conversion and effluent quality of ags systems among them alternating reaction phases anaerobic anoxic aerobic in the sequencing batch operation mode under which aerobic granules are mainly cultivated has received a great attention chen et al 2013 qin et al 2005 qin and liu 2006 wan et al 2009 in fact the benefit of such operation is linked to metabolic needs of diverse microorganisms that should proliferate in a single granule for the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal sndpr which is the key advantage of ags technology however the impact of alternating operation mode on granulation period granule size and ags morphology in pilot scale reactors has not been investigated so far most conducted large scale ags studies have focused on low strength municipal wastewater which sounds reasonable considering the adverse effect of low organic loads on granule formation derlon et al 2016 isanta et al 2012 ni et al 2009 with the global approach toward sustainable development municipalities tend to receive industrial effluents mixed with domestic wastewater to unify their treatment processes hammouda et al 2015 ileri et al 2003 resulting in variable organic substrate concentrations for municipal wastewater up to 1800 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l 1 cetin et al 2018 giesen et al 2013 liu et al 2011 2010 using medium to high strength wastewater limited substrate conversion especially in terms of nutrients has been observed during granulation liu et al 2011 pijuan et al 2011 and long term operation cetin et al 2018 guimarães et al 2018 therefore alongside addressing the issues associated with granule formation treating low strength wastewater granulation and ags structure as well as substrate conversion deficiencies should be further addressed and discussed treating higher strength wastewater being recognized as the future of wastewater treatment van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 such research seems necessary to broaden the practice scope of the technology for actual applications this paper presents the results of the startup of three pilot scale ags reactors operated with distinct sequencing batch operation modes treating wastewater with diverse strength the objectives of the study were to i determine the impact of sequencing batch reactor sbr operation mode as well as sludge loading condition translated into food to microorganisms f m ratio and imposed by wastewater strength on the startup time ags morphology and microbial selection of aerobic granules ii evaluate the treatment performance and effluent quality of ags reactors in terms of effluent suspended solid concentration microbial washout pattern and efficacy in removing soluble components 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale reactors three geometrically identical pilot scale granular sequencing batch reactors gsbrs with individual working volume of 18 l and height to diameter h d ratio of 10 were used pishgar et al 2018 the gsbrs were operated at variable volume because the effluent was discharged from a middle port in each reactor resulting in identical volumetric exchange ratios vers of 60 the gsbrs were fed from the bottom through conical sections to ensure homogenous distribution of feed during aerobic phases air was introduced to the reactors from the bottom which would ensure proper mixing along with aeration at dissolved oxygen do saturation level 8 10 mg o2 l 1 air flowrate was monitored using gas flowmeter cole parmer gr10850avb cp and the aeration pattern was controlled using custom designed air distributor pishgar et al 2018 the sbr sequencing operation was automated using electric valves and synchronized timers 2 2 operational conditions identical aeration rates and superficial upflow air velocities suav hydraulic retention times hrts and cycle times were maintained in the gsbrs table 1 only the duration and type of reaction phases were different reactor an o ax o sbr was operated with alternating anaerobic aerobic anoxic aerobic condition the short intermediate fill phase was to supplement excess organic carbon for denitrification anaerobic and anoxic phases were performed using internal recirculation of supernatant from the top to the bottom of the reactor to provide mixing and sufficient contact in the absence of aeration reactor an o sbr was operated using an anaerobic static filling followed by aeration reactor o sbr was run under purely aerobic condition in all the cases duration of the aeration phase was the remainder of cycle time after adjusting the other phases the do was not controlled but monitored and the ph in the reactors varied in the ranges as shown in table 1 the gsbrs were operated at room temperature 19 5 3 5 c 2 3 synthetic wastewater and seed sludge the principal components of the synthetic wastewaters are shown in table 2 the cod and total organic carbon toc concentrations were adjusted by sodium acetate naac 25 and sodium propionate napr 75 essential macro elements were added as described in table s1 and the composition of microelement stock solution has been described elsewhere pishgar et al 2018 influent ph was maintained at 7 7 0 3 the sbrs were individually inoculated with 6 5 l of return activated sludge ras of biological nutrient removal bnr process pine creek wastewater treatment plant calgary canada to ensure the presence of diverse microbial population from the initial stage of operation inoculum characteristics

experimental approach and data analyzing strategies to fulfill the objectives of the study two by two comparative analyses between the operated gsbrs were opted table 3 drawing a comparison between an o ax o sbr and o sbr fed with wastewater of the same composition but run with completely different sbr reaction phase arrangements alternating vs purely aerobic could reveal the effect of sbr operation mode on the startup ags characteristics and effluent quality on the other hand comparative analysis of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr fed with wastewater of different strength and nutrient supply but operated with similar sbr modes could determine the effect of wastewater composition and the resulting substrate and sludge loading conditions despite slight differences the operation modes of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr were considered similar alongside receiving favorable carbon sources naac 25 napr 75 these sbr operation modes were expected to encourage the growth of specific nutrient removing organisms i e polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos de kreuk et al 2005 lu et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2008 intermediate anoxic phase in an o ax o sbr was supposed to further proliferate anoxic denitrifying community chen et al 2011 to ultimately achieve an enhanced overall nitrogen removal efficiency however neither phosphate removing nor anoxic denitrifying functional groups were abundantly detected in the gsbrs refer to fig 8 it therefore suggested that the alternating sbr phases of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr were performing similar in terms of phylogenetic assemblage rendering the differences in the sbr reaction phase arrangements in these reactors negligible hence the discrepancies between the startup time ags characteristics and effluent quality in these gsbrs could be attributed to wastewater strength and substrate loading rather than sbr operation mode 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 influent and effluent characterization influent and effluent samples were

to the sequences tabulation of relative abundances at various taxonomic levels was carried out using phyloseq package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerobic granular sludge characterization 3 1 1 granulation progress and startup period the progress of granulation was monitored using i 50th percentile d 0 5 and ii 10t h percentile d 0 1 of particle size distribution iii svi5 and iv svi30 svi5 ratio fig 1 aerobic granules are defined as microbial aggregates with the minimum size of 200 μm de kreuk et al 2007 consequently liu et al 2010 proposed a standard sludge volume percentage with size below 200 μm svp sb200 to differentiate granular and floccular biomass accordingly the biomass becomes dominated with granules if the svp sb200 achieves a value below 50 or inversely interpreted when d 0 5 of biomass particle size distribution is above 200 μm the granulation is complete when d 0 1 attains the value of 200 μm indicating that only a negligible portion of biomass is still present in floccular form coma et al 2012 in addition settling property of the sludge tends to enhance over the course of granulation aerobic granules reach their terminal settling velocity significantly faster than floc particles thus the svi recorded at a short time e g 5 min denoted by svi5 can be a reliable indicator of granulation schwarzenbeck et al 2004 suggested by erşan and erguder 2014 the ratio svi30 svi5 can be used to interpret the extent of granulation and sludge thickening indeed the granulation is completed when svi30 svi5 ratio maintains a value over 80 the effect of sbr operation mode on granulation could be understood from comparative study of an o ax o sbr and o sbr granulation occurred within similar time intervals in these two gsbrs fig 1a and c it respectively initiated at days 16 and 12 in these gsbrs when d 0 5 reached 200 μm and completed at day 23 and 21 after which d 0 1 varied predominantly above 200 μm the granulation time demonstrated by svi profiles agreed with those suggested by psd trends fig 1d and f the svi5 generally showed drastic drops at the initial days of operation in the three gsbrs however it was a false positive indication of granulation because it in fact resulted from biomass washout during acclimatization as discussed in section 3 1 2 thereafter svi5 demonstrated increasing trends until the granulation was commenced it significantly declined from 194 to 85 ml g 1 at days 15 and 27 in an o ax o sbr and from 73 to 54 ml g 1 at days 13 and 22 in o sbr granulation phases respectively the value of svi5 remained stable afterward 88 16 and 44 9 ml g 1 in an o ax o sbr and o sbr respectively implying the occurrence of maturation phases the svi30 svi5 ratio attained the values of 0 78 and 0 87 at days 27 and 22 in these gsbrs respectively suggesting the completion of granulation the effect of wastewater complexity on granulation could be comprehended from the differences in an o ax o sbr and an o sbr performances operated with similar sbr modes but different substrate loadings granulation delayed in an o sbr compared to that in an o ax o sbr the commencement and completion of granulation demonstrated by d 50 and d 0 1 trends fig 1b happened at days 40 and 67 in an o sbr leading to 2 5 3 time longer acclimatization and granulation periods than those observed in an o ax o sbr fig 1a decrease in svi5 signaling the outset of granulation started at day 39 resulting in svi5 decline from 70 ml g 1 at this day of operation to 41 ml g 1 at day 67 fig 1e the svi30 svi5 ratio reached 0 90 at day 90 signifying the achievement of complete granulation fluctuations in d 0 1 and svi30 svi5 ratio during maturation phase could be attributed to disintegration aggregation cycles of the granular fraction of ags reflecting perturbations in the system performance the least deviations in d 0 1 and svi30 svi5 profiles were observed in o sbr indicating the occurrence of the steadiest maturation phase in this gsbr accordingly the operation stability could be categorized as o sbr an o sbr an o ax o sbr it could therefore be speculated that the floccular portion of ags in an o ax o sbr during maturation phase was more significant than those in an o sbr and o sbr as confirmed by the morphology of ags discussed in section 3 1 3 3 1 2 biomass concentration dynamics during granulation phase biomass concentration in all the three reactors considerably increased and eventually attained the values of 7 0 5 8 8 0 7 11 6 1 2 mg mlss l 1 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively fig 2 however prior to attaining an increasing trend biomass concentration in all the studied gsbrs showed a dramatic decline it was due to biomass loss resulted from a short settling time 10 min which selected for floc particles with minimum settling velocity of 4 23 m h 1 despite this preliminary washout shown on fig 2 with blue arrows which was inherent to granulation coma et al 2012 li et al 2008a several incidents of biomass washouts were encountered due to equipment maladjustment or failure at events a b c and e fig 2 biomass loss was rectified by adding fresh ras whilst at event d an o sbr biomass concentration autonomously recovered within 20 days it is worth mentioning that the washout incidents at events a and b in an o ax o sbr were not as intense as those in the other gsbrs events c and e and thus did not resulted in drastic biomass loss in the former therefore the addition of ras at the corresponding days significantly increased biomass concentration to 7 2 7 6 mg mlvss l 1 in an o ax o sbr as opposed to those in an o sbr day 17 and o sbr day 8 in response to the same remediation strategy 4 0 4 9 mg mlvss l 1 in addition more frequent recurrence of anaerobic and anoxic phases with low shearing activity in an o ax o sbr could further encourage the growth of common fast growing heterotrophs especially during acclimatization when microbial agglomeration was minimal and the shearing activity in the reactor mainly originated from hydrodynamic conditions rather than particle to particle abrasions according to the results of this study it was tempting to speculate that the simpler the operation mode of the gsbr the less disturbance in the granulation process with a simpler operation it was not only likely to achieve higher biomass concentration upon maturation as that observed in o sbr but there was also less possibility of biomass washout episodes which could otherwise disrupt the granulation process however generalization of these findings may not be applicable to systems with different microbial community features such as robust nutrient removing ags reactors whose key organisms nitrosomonas nitrospira and ca accumulibacter did not proliferate in the gsbrs in this study refer to section 3 1 5 for further discussion a reduction in vss tss ratio was observed at the early stages of startup in the three gsbrs fig 2 which was more noticeable in an o sbr however it was followed by an increasing trend later during the acclimatization phases and the volatile contents eventually stabilized during the rest of the operations the volatile contents of the ags in an o ax o sbr and o sbr were identically high and varied in the narrow ranges of 0 86 0 03 and 0 87 0 04 respectively demonstrating an inorganic content of 13 14 fig 2a and c in contrast the volatile content of an o sbr ags was considerably lower 0 62 0 07 leading to a three time higher ash content 38 than those observed in the other gsbrs fig 2b higher ash content of the ags in an o sbr was due to lower biomass to biolith volume ratio of the granules in this system due to significantly smaller size when compared to those of the other gsbrs mineral deposits were observed in the core of sectioned granules developed in the three gsbrs data not shown an o sbr was fed with significantly higher phosphorus concentration cod p of 100 5 as opposed to those in the other gsbrs 100 1 which could increase the possibility of biologically induced calcium phosphate precipitation thermodynamic simulations of song et al 2002 showed that the chance of hydroxyapatite deposition increases with increase in phosphate concentration at given ca p ratio close to that maintained in this study 2 46 0 79 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr hydroxyapatite is the kinetically stable end product of calcium phosphate precipitation which has been found as the major mineral in the core of aerobic granules mañas et al 2012 2011 3 1 3 morphology of aerobic granular sludge the ags characteristics and granule morphology were widely different in the gsbrs as demonstrated by digital imaging fig 3 comparative study of an o ax o sbr fig 3a f and o sbr fig 3m r exhibiting the effect of sbr operation mode showed that the granulation occurred with a slower pace in the former amorphous microbial aggregates that formed immediately before aerobic granule formation were noticeably smaller in an o ax o sbr at day 23 fig 3a and m whereas aerobic granules could be frequently observed in o sbr ags at the same time fig 3m distinguishable aggregates with clear boundaries did not appear in an o ax o sbr until day 39 fig 3c while the presence of nebulous biomass patches substantially declined in o sbr at day 39 fig 3o these components constituted a high portion of the ags in an o ax o sbr even during maturation phase fig 3f granules formed in an o ax o sbr were light brown large around 0 5 cm and slimy with irregular shape fig 3f however aerobic granules cultivated in o sbr were yellow large 0 5 1 cm and dense with round clear cut shape fig 3r the effect of wastewater strength on ags development could be understood from the differences between morphological characteristics of the ags in an o ax o sbr fig 3a f and an o sbr fig 3g l in an o sbr aerobic granules were randomly observed at day 26 fig 3g which coincided with acclimatization phase fig 1b however their number was not significant enough to start the granulation process significant number of aerobic granules were observed at day 45 fig 3i when granulation had been commenced for 4 days amorphous microbial aggregates the precursors of aerobic granules emerged in micro scale in an o sbr as opposed to their milli scale in an o ax o sbr while flocs were present in substantial proportion at day 60 end of granulation fig 3j unlike an o ax o sbr fig 3f they completely disappeared from ags upon maturation fig 3l aerobic granules developed in an o sbr were yellowish brown small 0 5 4 mm and compact with irregular shape but smooth surfaces fig 3l 3 1 4 microstructure of aerobic granules sem imaging revealed differences in the microbial selection of aerobic granules formed under distinct operational conditions fig 4 to have the full view of granules developed in the gsbrs images fig 4a d and g were captured with the same magnification 40x these images could qualitatively reveal the compactness and surface structure of the granules developed under different conditions in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr and would allow solid comparisons to be drawn second images fig 4b e and h were taken to have a closer look at the interesting surface parts of the granules thus appropriate magnifications were chosen depending on the surface property of each granule to compare the morphology of dominant bacterial species covering the granule surfaces similar magnifications were chosen for the third images fig 4c f and i feathery growth of filamentous bacteria was frequently observed on the surface of aerobic granules formed in an o ax o sbr fig 4a which could justify the weak slimy structure of granules as seen in fig 3f widespread stems of fungi rooting in granule core alongside entrapped large nematodes were seen in the filament networks fig 4b this observation was in line with the findings of cetin et al 2018 who detected nematodes in the ags formed with high strength municipal wastewater the relation of nematodes and filamentous bacteria one of the most important biotic relationships in biofilm structure is thought to be due to environmental factors rather than the trophic preferences salvadó et al 2004 the conditions which were likely prevailing in the alternating operating mode of an o ax o sbr mechanical effect of nematodes i e facilitating substrate oxygen diffusion by burrowing and grazing and thus keeping the biofilm porous plays a key role in biofilm formation under high substrate load calaway 1963 salvadó et al 2004 therefore the presence of these organisms in large number could be another reason for the flexible structure of granules in an o ax o sbr the magnified image of the crack on the granule surface confirmed the intertwined net of fungi and filamentous bacteria fig 4c the detected fungi cells resembled aspergillus spp with identifier foot chambers and septa which could form hypha and spores cetin et al 2018 nevertheless the surface of granule was mainly dominated by tiny rod shape bacterial organisms length of 1 μm fig 4c the surface of aerobic granule formed in an o sbr had a compact structure fig 4d no fluffy matrix of filaments was observed supporting the dense structure of granules formed in this gsbrs see fig 3l however a closer look at the surface fig 4e demonstrated that filamentous bacteria were present albeit in lower abundance than that in an o ax o sbr granules fig 4b unlike an o ax o sbr granules nematodes were not detected on an o sbr granule surface negligible number of aspergillus like fungi were seen which were almost completely encapsulated in the zoogloeal network an increased magnification fig 4f showed that small rod shape bacteria about 1 μm were the prevailing organisms on the surface of an o sbr granules and that the matrix developed from the tangled filaments potentially played as the backbone in forming the compact structure of an o sbr granules sezgin et al 1978 the whole image of granule taken from o sbr demonstrated a completely smooth surface fig 4g the deformed shape of the granule was due to the adverse impact of large granule size on sample preparation procedure for sem imaging coccoid bacteria were mainly found on the granule surface fig 4h the stretched net visible in fig 4i possibly represented exopolymers which expanded during the critical point drying step of sem analysis such highly concentrated matrix of exopolymers substantially contributed to the smooth and compact structure of granules formed in o sbr 3 1 5 characterization of granulation rate size morphology and stability at pilot scale granulation time and granule size were independent of sbr operation mode and were in fact regulated by wastewater strength and the resulting organic loading condition this implication which was in line with the results of lab scale investigations de kreuk 2006 li et al 2008a moy et al 2002 tay et al 2003 was speculated from the similar granulation intervals and analogous granule sizes observed in an o ax o sbr and o sbr figs 1 and 3 where identical organic loading fig 5 a and c but different sbr modes table 1 were sustained it was further supported by achieving aerobic granules with divergent size range within a prolonged granulation time figs 1 and 3 in an o sbr operated with similar sbr mode but one fourth cod load compared to those in an o ax o sbr fig 5a and b numerous researchers attempted to accelerate granulation time in pilot scale reactors from 300 to 400 days liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 to few weeks cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2011 long et al 2014 although short settling time was widespread included in the rapid granulation strategy as one of the crucial selection pressure parameters it did not enhance the startup of pilot scale granular reactors unless it was accompanied with high substrate loading for example cetin et al 2018 could cultivate aerobic granules in 29 l pilot reactors in 25 44 days using a combination of short settle phase and high organic loading strategies ni et al 2009 identified settling time and ver as key parameters for aerobic granulation with low strength wastewater in pilot sbr nevertheless it should be noted that changes in ver indeed manipulates the organic load such that increase in ver rises the organic loading schwarzenbeck et al 2005 wei et al 2012 could achieve aerobic granulation from activated sludge within 40 days in a 1 5 m3 reactor simply because high strength was the main characteristics of the used industrial wastewater mixture of soy protein wastewater and effluent of internal circulation reactor although reduction in settling time was considered as the critical factor in provoking the granulation from swine slurry in a 100 l reactor this strategy was implemented alongside maintaining a stable and high cod load 2 kg cod m 3 d 1 morales et al 2013 therefore it could be construed that organic loading condition played a crucial but hidden and thus neglected role in granulation in larger modules as well the effect of substrate loading can be translated into the influence of sludge loading rate or food to microorganism f m ratio as the name suggests f m is the function of wastewater strength in terms of organic loading condition and biomass concentration retained in the reactor during granulation in the sbrs in the lack of deliberative sludge withdrawal approach such that deployed by li et al 2008b biomass concentration in the reactor is dictated by the growth rate of retained microbial species and washout dynamics during discharge phase either from the sludge bed situated above the decant level or as pin point flocs in this study no sludge removal mechanism was devised the f m ratio in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr were 1 9 0 3 0 4 0 1 and 1 4 0 3 during granulation which progressively reduced to respective ranges of 1 1 0 1 0 43 0 03 and 0 68 0 1 g cod g 1 vss d 1 at the end of maturation phase fig 5 mostly due to increase in mixed liquor density in the gsbrs fig 2 li et al 2011 ascertained that high f m about 1 1 g cod g 1 ss d 1 could encourage fast formation of large granules and low f m 0 3 g cod g 1 ss d 1 could result in slow formation of small granules an implication which was demonstrated about the impact of organic load on granulation rate as well li et al 2008a illustrating a close tie between f m and substrate loading during granulation process the same effects were indeed observed on aerobic granulation rate and size in the pilot scale gsbrs in this work similarly liu et al 2011 could speed up the granulation progress in pilot module 32 l and cultivated aerobic granules in 17 days by increasing substrate loading with the adjustment of cycle and settle times in fact a tight relation exists between f m ratio and settle time as well short settle period 10 min does not only select for dense flocs over small slow settling biomass which in turn induces granule formation it can also maintain the biomass concentration at a certain level by washing out a significant fraction of sludge at each cycle to ensure a high f m at the early stages of granulation li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 in this study f m was not controlled by reduction in settle time but via the strength of wastewater it is obvious that in case of treating real wastewater with a given strength settle time or ver should be altered to sustain f m within the desirable range for aerobic granulation as adopted by liu et al 2011 and ni et al 2009 nonetheless the granule formation intervals and the granule size in this study did not completely match those reported in lab scale studies under the same circumstances in terms of sludge loading rate complete granulation was achieved in shorter periods in lab scale modules at identical f m ratios li et al 2011 granule sizes were only comparable to those in this study when significantly higher f m ratios were reached due to drastic biomass washout at the early stages of startup in lab scale reactors li et al 2008a such differences can be attributed to the effect of reactor dimension on granulation severe wall effect in smaller scale modules internal diameter id 10 cm could result in biomass stratification along the column axis during aeration liu and tay 2007 whereas in larger modules id 20 cm biomass homogenization during aeration determined that the wall effect could be diminished with increase in reactor scale liu et al 2010 in fact reactor scale can act as a selectin pressure because increase in shear forces and facilitation in separating dispersed biomass from fast settling flocs occurs upon reduction in reactor scale which are crucial for granule formation and stability liu et al 2010 relatively smaller granule size achieved in lab scale reactors under similar f m condition compared to those in this study li et al 2011 could be explained by the amplified shear stresses induced by more frequent abrasion against the wall morphology and structure of aerobic granules as well as floccular proportion of ags could be attributed to sbr operation mode formation of jelly like weak granules in an o ax o sbr was most likely due to adopting a more sophisticated sbr cycle mode than those in an o sbr and o sbr fig 3f round and smooth granules were only cultivated in o sbr run by the simplest operation mode fig 3r amorphous flocs constituted a large portion of ags in an o ax o sbr fig 3f compared to those in an o sbr and o sbr fig 3l and r therefore it could be concluded that the more complex the operation the lower the degree of granule compactness the more anomalies in granule shape the higher the flocculent fraction of the ags and the more instability in maturation phase as realized from the profiles of d 0 1 and svi30 svi5 fig 1 simulation performed by picioreanu et al 2000 determined that biofilm geometrical heterogeneity was regulated by three factors among which two were applicable to granular systems 1 the ratio between biomass growth rate and substrate internal diffusion rate g and 2 external mass transport resistance induced by variant liquid flow rates although the effect of flow driving mechanisms external mass transfer limitation on biofilm structure was not prominent picioreanu et al 2000 it can become decisive in granular systems where internal mass diffusion rates are the direct resultants of liquid movements brought about by gas upflow velocity accordingly disruption in granulation process in this study could be explained by i operation perturbations due to equipment failure and or maladjustment ii frequent recurrence of reaction phases with substantially low shear stresses e g anoxic and anaerobic phases under such circumstances the weakness and irregularity in granule morphology was due to frequent disintegration aggregation cycles of granules which would not allow the effective shear forces to burnish the granule surfaces consequently amorphous biomass patches emerged in the ags because of biofilm detachment from granule surface caused by mechanical factors e g sloughing erosion microbial factors e g grazing predation and or granule breakage mass transfer limitation substrate oxygen deficiency in the interior of granules and thus autolysis cetin et al 2018 development of irregular granules was observed in other pilot studies as well where anaerobic phase with no means of stirring or fluidization was included in the sbr cycle isanta et al 2012 long et al 2014 overall operational strategy which encompasses cycle time cycle mode settle time and ver cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2011 ni et al 2009 seems to be a very comprehensive yet critical factor for successful granulation in large modules liu et al 2011 after adjusting the aeration pattern without which the granulation would not even initiate isanta et al 2012 pishgar et al 2018 f m strategy can be adopted for fast formation of compact smooth granules in a controlled size range the f m can be adjusted with settle time and ver for given wastewater strength liu et al 2011 ni et al 2009 the granulation can be started with f m ratio of 1 1 1 5 g cod g 1 ss d 1 and upon granulation the ratio should be reduced to 0 4 0 5 g cod g 1 ss d 1 to maintain the granule size at the desirable range 3 4 mm li et al 2011 to elucidate the correct applicability of our findings in order to prevent erroneous extrapolation it should be noted that the results of this study might not be applicable to pilot cases where the microbial selection and functional population distribution of the ags deviate from those observed here see fig 8 section 3 2 2 2 according to lab scale studies the presence of slow growing nutrient removing organisms e g autotrophic nitrifiers paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which enriched in neither of the gsbrs in this study could greatly contribute to granule stability and compactness liu et al 2004 and would affect the ags characteristics differently in anaerobic oxic systems paos and gaos if present can majorly i e by 60 convert readily biodegradable cod e g acetate to polymeric storage products i e polyhydroxyalkanoates phas anaerobically providing a subsequent famine aerobic phase where the heterotrophic community should mostly feed off and grow on their storage product with slower growth rate resulting in gentle oxygen gradients in the granules such growth pattern can prevent finger like filamentous outgrowth as observed in an o ax o sbr in this study and hence ensures granule density and stability de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 this speculation has been supported by piciorenau et al 1998 where hybrid differential discrete modelling mathematically correlated biofilm structure with biomass growth rate rather than substrate transfer rate there are numerous reports in the literature where the researchers long term operated ags reactors with excellent treatment performance and robust granular characteristics using complex anaerobic oxic cycles with the aim of removing nutrients de kreuk et al 2005 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015 yilmaz et al 2008 although compact granule structure with inconsiderable flocculent fraction has been reported in most bench scale cases bao et al 2009 schwarzenbeck et al 2005 a fraction of ags is conversely reported to remain in flocculent form in the larger scale modules of full scale installments de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015 even those with excellent nutrient removal performance pronk et al 2015 potentially due to detached pieces of granules growth on polymeric substrates and influent particulates de kreuk et al 2010 once more bringing in the effect of reactor scale thus further investigation is required to illuminate the effect of sbr operation mode on the same outcomes as those selected in this study for robust nutrient removing pilot ags reactors to confirm whether or not the results of this study can be generalized to all cases under diverse circumstances on the same note the findings of this study should therefore be used as practical criteria to predict the behavior of ags that has not been enriched with nutrient removing organisms yet e g granulation phase or has lost the appropriate microbial selection temporarily due to disturbance of any source i e long term operation in actual applications deterioration of microbial composition can potentially happen frequently for various reasons such as fluctuations in wastewater composition in terms of type complexity and concentration of pollutants ph equipment issues seasonal variations in weather and thus temperature etc metcalf eddy 2014 3 2 treatment performance and effluent quality 3 2 1 effluent suspended solids a general trend was observed in the effluent suspended solid ess concentrations of the three gsbrs fig 6 the ess acquired increasing trend during acclimatization phase due to washout imposed by the short settling time which continued with the initiation of granulation reaching a peak in the middle of granulation phase increase in biomass concentration during maturation resulted in a secondary rise in ess concentrations it corresponded to day 46 in an o ax o sbr and o sbr operations when a surge in the flocculent portion of ags was observed and the aerobic granules seemed weak and slimy in both gsbrs fig 3d and p with decrease in the floccular fraction of ags in o sbr ess declined substantially at day 57 105 mg l 1 tss whereas ess of an o ax o sbr maintained its fluctuations toward the end of maturation phase due to consistent presence of noteworthy amount of nebulous microbial aggregates in the ags fig 3 which in turn confirmed the less effective operation mode of an o ax o sbr compared to o sbr for steady aerobic granulation and achieving high quality effluent overall ess concentrations averaged 120 103 39 26 110 107 mg tss l 1 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively indicating the effect of wastewater strength and the resulting f m on effluent clarity of granular reactors it agreed with the results of the study of morales et al 2013 and rocktäschel et al 2015 who observed an increase in the ess of pilot scale granular reactors with increase in organic loading the vss tss ratios attained analogous values to those observed for biomass concentration in the reactors fig 2 thus the ess volatile contents of an o ax o sbr and o sbr were identically high 0 82 0 91 in contrast the ess volatile content of an o sbr reduced from 0 76 during acclimatization day 11 to 0 63 on average during granulation and maturation 3 2 2 effluent microbiology 3 2 2 1 microbial composition of effluent biomass microbial species that emerged in the ess of the gsbrs toward the end of granulation were from a handful of phyla among which proteobacteria 51 68 and bacteroidetes 24 40 were the most dominant ones fig 7 a the distinctions between the microbial selection of the washed out biomass could best be understood from the differences at family level fig 7b the families which were washed out of an o ax o sbr with the highest abundances were rhodocyclaceae 39 flavobacteriaceae 17 moraxellaceae 14 bacteriovoracaceae 5 and burkholderiaceae 5 the most abundant families emerged in the effluent of an o sbr included rhodocyclaceae 27 spirosomaceae 16 rhodobacteraceae 12 corynebacteriaceae 12 sphingobacteriaceae 4 and erysipelotrichaceae 4 the families with the greatest population in the effluent of o sbr were rhodocyclaceae 31 flavobacteriaceae 30 sphingobacteriaceae 8 rhodobacteraceae 6 bacteriovoracaceae 6 and burkholderiaceae 6 although the family xanthomonadaceae was not seen among the dominating taxa it emerged in the effluent of gsbrs albeit with relatively low relative abundances 0 2 0 6 the reported functions for the isolated phylogenetic groups are presented in table s3 accordingly some detected families play important roles in degradation of refractory organic wastes and can concomitantly contribute to nutrient removal such as rhodocyclaceae rhodobacteraceae burkholderiaceae and sphingobacteriaceae in addition most identified families e g flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae rhodobacteraceae microbacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae moraxellaceae rhodobacteraceae rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae are proved to significantly contribute to deterministic formation of the concentric spherical structure of aerobic granules indeed certain genera belonging to some of these families including thauera rhodocyclaceae family acinetobacter moraxellaceae paracoccus rhodobacteraceae and flavobacterium flavobacteriaceae promote production of key chemical factors c di gmp epistatic to quorum sensing which is a substantial requirement for granule maturation and long term granule stability for the associated citations see table s3 in supplementary materials considering the dynamic aggregation and detachment of bioflocs from granule biomass acknowledged by verawaty et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 it was safe to speculate that the key players in microbial aggregation and substrate conversions enriched in the ags indeed appeared in the effluent of the gsbrs in this study the discussion in section 3 2 2 2 could further support this argument 3 2 2 2 washout patterns of functional groups the core bacterial community discharged from the gsbrs included the genera thauera 20 36 azoarcus 7 23 and flavobacterium 4 23 fig 8 the highest abundance of the former was observed in an o ax o sbr and the largest populations of the latter two were detected in o sbr other important genera in terms of their populations which were uniquely discharged from each gsbr were acinetobacter 13 bacteriovorax 4 erysipelothrix 3 and corynebacterium 2 hydrogenophaga 2 gemmobacter 2 from an o ax o sbr leadbetterella 16 corynebacterium 10 paracoccus 9 erysipelothrix 4 pedobacter 3 prosthecobacter 3 bdellovibrio 2 and chryseobacterium 2 from an o sbr pedobacter 5 paracoccus 3 bacteriovorax 2 acinetobacter 2 bdellovibrio 2 and comamonas 2 from o sbr the microbial selection of the effluent biomass did not only differ from one system to another but significant population shifts were also observed for common species it should be noted that the conventional nutrient removing organisms autotrophic nitrosomonas and nitrospira and heterotrophic phosphate accumulating accumulibacter were not washed out of the systems principally because they did not enrich in the gsbrs most organisms emerged in the effluent of the gsbrs have been characterized as heterotrophic nitrifiers and or aerobic anoxic denitrifiers such as thauera azoarcus acinetobacter chryseobacterium corynebacterium and flavobacterium table s3 based on population distributions thauera and azoarcus were the most important ones likewise in the study of zhao et al 2013 thauera enriched under high organic and nitrogen loads in the ags and showed great simultaneous organic and ammonium nitrogen removal capabilities without any no x accumulation similar to the observations in this study see section 3 2 3 denitrifying thauera sp has mostly clustered with azoarcus in both granular and floccular systems adav et al 2010 wagner and loy 2002 such that betaproteobacteria related to the azoarcus thauera complexes are considered as abundant denitrifiers in industrial treatment facilities wagner and loy 2002 the study of liu et al 2006 confirmed this implication where significant enrichment of these two species was observed during the steady performance of denitrifying bioreactor in terms of high quinoline and cod removal efficiencies in general washing out all the aforementioned species considering the reported functions for them in the literature see table s3 could potentially compromise nutrient removal capacity of the gsbrs resulting in low ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies as discussed in section 3 2 3 diversity indices table 4 demonstrated that the biodiversity species richness and evenness of effluent biomass was strongly correlated with that of the ags in the gsbrs regression analysis α 0 05 r2 0 90 this could also be understood from fig 8 where noteworthy similarity was observed between the relative abundances of genera enriched in i e the ags sample and discharged from i e the effluent sample each gsbr moreover richness rr and evenness h ei and t of the ags indicated that distinctive microbial selection strategies might occur in the gsbrs which supported the differences observed in the sem images section 3 1 5 although rr values of effluent biomass discharged from the three gsbrs were almost identical they showed notable divergences from the rr values of the developed ags in the corresponding reactors increased rr value of the effluent of an o ax o sbr compared to that of its ags implied that this system could not retain a portion of the enriched microbial species inside the reactor which also emerged as higher ess concentration in this gsbr see section 3 2 1 in contrast decrease in the rr value of an o sbr effluent biomass demonstrated that this system was selectively washing out some proliferated taxa equal rr values and similar evenness of the ags and effluent biomass of o sbr indicated that the operation in this system was maintaining a balance between the retained and discharged otus these observations demonstrated that subtle microbial selection strategies could be in effect during granulation in the gsbrs these microbial selection strategies could be imposed by wastewater strength rather than the sbr operation mode according to variance partitioning analyses performed on microbial diversity of 14 wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2012 demonstrated that wastewater characteristics had more significant influence 25 7 on the bacterial community variance rather than operational parameters 23 9 it was in line with the findings of this study more similarities were observed between the microbial selection and population distribution of the ags of gsbrs fed with similar wastewater composition but operated with different sbr operation mode i e an o ax o sbr and o sbr rather than those gsbrs operated with similar sbr operation modes but fed with wastewaters of different strength an o ax o sbr and an o sbr see fig 8 given the considerable correlation between the biodiversity of effluent biomass and ags these similarities and differences were reflected in the microbial composition of effluent biomass as well highlighting the effect of wastewater strength on washout patterns however again it should be emphasized that generalization of these findings to the other cases should be accomplished with great caution to preclude irrelevant extrapolation as comprehensively discussed in section 3 1 5 if the extremal cod was consumed anaerobically anoxically the operation of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr could promote the growth of paos and denitrifying bacteria rather the common heterotrophs which would intrinsically affect the microbial selection strategies distinctly 3 2 3 effluent soluble pollutants an o ax o sbr and o sbr could identically remove 1865 159 593 58 74 18 71 14 and 8 6 4 7 mg l 1 of influent cod toc tn nh4 n and po4 p concentrations on average for 98 1 98 1 75 17 74 12 and 59 11 removal efficiencies respectively fig 9 the removal efficiencies in an o sbr were 91 2 98 0 19 4 21 3 and 65 8 resulting from 452 16 154 5 18 5 21 3 and 16 3 mg l 1 decrease in the initial concentrations of those parameters respectively accumulation of no x no3 no2 was observed in neither of the gsbrs changes in the soluble component concentrations demonstrated that the developed ags had the capacity to simultaneously remove organics and nutrients from municipal wastewater medium to high strength municipal waste streams generally constitute in mg l 1 500 1000 cod 160 330 toc 20 40 nh4 n and 2 4 4 7 po4 p metcalf eddy 2014 a comparison between these values and the removed concentrations fig s1 demonstrated that an o ax o sbr and o sbr had the potential to treat an effluent twice as strong as high strength municipal wastewater the an o sbr effectively treated medium strength municipal wastewater while it could exceptionally reduce 17 mg po4 p l 1 a concentration 1 5 to 3 times greater than that carried by municipal wastewater nevertheless as demonstrated by the removal efficiencies stated earlier satisfactory nutrient removal performance was not obtained in either of the reactors despite of using typical configurations suitable for treating nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient removal capacity of the systems seemed to be limited to organic matter availability thus discharging considerable ammonium and phosphate residual concentrations likewise incomplete nutrient removal has been occasionally reported in large scale ags reactors cetin et al 2018 morales et al 2013 wei et al 2012 even in the cases where synthetic feed was used and it contained easily biodegradable naac as sole carbon source long et al 2014 similar to the feed characteristics in this study such that the residual nutrient concentrations might not allow direct release of gsbr effluents to receiving water bodies as executed by pronk et al 2015 sometimes incomplete ammonium removal 55 60 was accompanied with no no x production cetin et al 2018 similar to the observations in this study in other occasions when ammonium concentration was completely removed via partial or incomplete nitrification accumulation of no x deteriorated tn removal efficiency due to the absence of denitrification liu et al 2011 long et al 2014 morales et al 2013 in general tn removal efficiencies ranged between 50 and 80 chen et al 2011 derlon et al 2016 liu et al 2011 2010 morales et al 2013 many researchers attempted to figure out the cause for inadequate tn removal in aerobic granular reactors mosquera corral et al 2005 and de kreuk et al 2005 realized that decrease in do saturation level from 100 to 40 could increase tn removal efficiency three to six fold from 8 to 45 such effect is in fact due to diffusion gradients of electron donor i e organic matter and electron acceptor i e oxygen inside the granules defining internal aerobic and anoxic volumes where nitrification and denitrification can simultaneously happen snd derlon et al 2016 mosquera corral et al 2005 this implication has brought the factor of granule size into attention which indeed determines the fraction of anoxic to aerobic zone chen et al 2011 derlon et al 2016 liu et al 2005 however as duly noted by chen et al 2011 since no practical strategy exists to control granule size in the permissible range for effective tn removal 1 3 1 75 mm de kreuk et al 2005 simply relying on granule size may result in unstable tn removal chen et al 2011 besides it is not guaranteed to achieve high tn removal efficiency with stable granule size liu et al 2011 thus the effect of size does not seem to be substantially critical for substrate conversion this implication was confirmed by the findings of liu et al 2010 2011 who observed that identical acclimatization periods were required to attain high cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies 85 in sbrs with the same configurations and influent qualities regardless of the sludge state i e granule vs floc thus the large size of granules developed in the gsbrs in this study could not be the main factor in preventing the quasi absence of snd inferred from partial removal of ammonium and no no x production since the do concentration in the bulk liquid can be adjusted easily and precisely chen et al 2011 process control in terms of do concentration has been suggested instead de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015 to induce ammonium oxidation many researchers adopted controlled do strategy with a concertation fixed at about 2 2 5 mg o2 l 1 chen et al 2011 derlon et al 2016 ni et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 not implementing this approach might preclude the occurrence of snd in the gsbrs as it potentially did in the study of cetin et al 2018 5 mg o2 l 1 and in the current work 8 mg o2 l 1 other factors have been identified to encourage sndpr from common pathways autotrophic nitrification anoxic denitrification and enhance biological phosphate removal ebpr metabolism in ags reactors which was suspected to be absent in this study guimarães et al 2018 observed sndpr failure in the ags systems operated with pulse feeding such that in o sbr and slow upflow filling regimes similar to those in an o ax o sbr and an o sbr treating domestic wastewater in a temperate region the authors translated the microbial ecology into operational strategies for optimization of process performance in terms of sndpr despite being a case study at high mesophilic temperature the results were fairly comprehensive and in agreement with the rest of literature guimarães et al 2018 and thus can be generalized to other studies those improvements included 1 enhancing anaerobic contact time by controlling the feeding velocity to facilitate utilizing a major fraction of external cod anaerobically in other words ensuring the occurrence of anaerobic aerobic redox condition in the system 2 adjusting aeration phase duration and controlling do at moderate concentrations to prevent competitive advantage of endogenous respiration over denitrification on space i e reduction in anoxic biovolume caused by over oxygenation 4 controlling temperature and ph for lowering the inhibition of free ammonia fa on nitrification and for enhancing paos gaos population ratio 3 maintaining suitable reactor substrate loading by adjusting sbr phase length as a function of fluctuations in influent concentrations which would account for local wastewater and climate conditions derlon et al 2016 guimarães et al 2018 weissbrodt et al 2013 nitrogen removal efficiency in a biological system depends on manifestation and efficacy of i nitrogen incorporation into cellular tissues for new cell synthesis and ii nitrification and denitrification competency of the retained microbial consortium pronk et al 2015 while the former is always present and can generally remove a considerable concentration of influent ammonium nitrogen due to greater biomass retention potential of ags 4 5 times than that of cas it can limit ammonium removal to the influent organic matter content and hence may cause nitrogen residues in the effluent as it was observed in this study the latter pathway can significantly enhance overall nitrogen removal efficiency of the system by separating it from organic matter degradation for this purpose autotrophic nitrification and anoxic denitrification have been considered as the main possible pathways in the ags systems with the process control strategies set based on this assumption discussed above nonetheless unorthodox nutrient removal pathways might be involved which should be further explored to understand the substrate conversion mechanisms under unexpected operating and environmental conditions 4 conclusion granulation was successfully achieved in 22 27 days in an o ax o sbr and o sbr and in 67 days in an o sbr with dissimilar granule size and structure granulation time and granule size were independent of sbr operation mode and could be explained by wastewater strength and the resulting organic and sludge loading conditions whereas ags morphology and granule structure as well as floccular proportion of ags could be attributed to sbr operation mode the more complex the operation the lower the degree of granule compactness the more anomalies in granule shape the higher the flocculent fraction of ags and the more instability in maturation

analysis demonstrated that the species richness and evenness of effluent biomass were strongly correlated with those of the ags in the gsbrs regression analysis α 0 05 r2 0 90 it could relate the similarities and differences in the microbial composition of effluent biomass to that of the ags in the gsbrs highlighting the effect of wastewater strength on washout patterns a comparison between the removed concentrations and the typical constituent concentrations of medium to high strength municipal waste streams demonstrated that the gsbrs had the potential to treat municipal wastewater

18726,this study attempted to investigate the influence of operation mode and wastewater strength on startup period aerobic granular sludge ags characteristics and system effluent quality at pilot scale granulation was monitored in three pilot scale granular sequencing batch reactors gsbrs comparative evaluation of an o ax o sbr and o sbr fed with wastewater of the same composition but run with completely different sbr reaction phase arrangements alternating vs purely aerobic revealed the effect of sbr operation mode comparative study of the gsbrs operated with alternating sbr reaction phases an o ax o sbr and an o sbr and fed with wastewater of different strength high vs medium strength determined the effect of wastewater composition granulation time and granule size were regulated by wastewater strength and the resulting organic and sludge loading conditions whereas ags morphology granule structure and floccular proportion of ags were attributed to sbr operation mode effluent clarity in terms of suspended solid concentration depended on wastewater strength subtle but distinct microbial selection strategies were in effect during granulation which were also imposed by wastewater strength due to strong correlation between the effluent and ags microbial structures demonstrated by biodiversity analysis differences in the microbial composition of effluent biomass and washout patterns of the gsbrs could be explained by wastewater strength as well limited nutrient removal efficiencies restricted by organic matter concentration could be due to involvement of unorthodox nutrient removal pathways which warrants further investigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge ags characteristics effluent quality pilot scale startup wastewater strength sequencing batch reactor sbr operation mode 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has become the focus of extensive research in the last two decades due to great advantages over conventional activated sludge cas process although the effectiveness of aerobic granulation in terms of treatment performance and granule stability has been widespread demonstrated in controlled laboratory scale reactors de kreuk et al 2005 ji et al 2009 yilmaz et al 2008 its full scale application is still limited mostly due to knowledge deficit about the process scale up indeed this gap of knowledge is resulted from distinct effects of influential factors on aerobic granulation in different reactor scales which necessitates further justification of the findings derived from lab scale studies in large scale modules testing optimization step for instance pishgar et al 2018 ascertained that the hydrodynamic pattern prevailing in pilot scale reactor could severely deviate from that in the successful lab scale counterpart if the aeration pattern and gas distribution were not optimized which could eventually inhibit granulation by situating the fledging technology at the time in luyben scale up matrix de kreuk 2006 identified pilot study as the crucial testing optimization step for the scale up of ags reactors indeed the advent of nereda the first mature full scale ags technology giesen et al 2013 became feasible by design and operation of the first pilot scale granular reactor de kreuk 2006 nevertheless despite its proven importance only a handful of studies have been dedicated to aerobic granulation at pilot scale so far cetin et al 2018 isanta et al 2012 liu et al 2011 2010 long et al 2014 ni et al 2009 pishgar et al 2018 rocktäschel et al 2015 current literature regarding pilot and full scale ags investigations mainly encompass usage of actual municipal cetin et al 2018 derlon et al 2016 giesen et al 2013 isanta et al 2012 liu et al 2011 2010 ni et al 2009 and industrial morales et al 2013 wei et al 2012 wastewaters an overview of these studies demonstrates several adverse implications for granulation in larger scale modules such as i long startup periods months to about a year giesen et al 2013 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 ii development of small granules 0 2 2 mm cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 wagner and da costa 2013 iii structural and functional instability of ags which can adversely affect the treatment performance cetin et al 2018 although these studies provide good insight into ags formation and performance in real time situations they are not conducted systematically in order to lay a solid ground for different aspects of aerobic granulation in larger scale modules and thus cannot unravel the encountered scale up knots appropriately wide fluctuations in wastewater characteristics and diverse operating conditions adopted in these studies make it difficult to draw a comprehensive conclusion from their results appropriate consideration of number of factors enhances substrate conversion and effluent quality of ags systems among them alternating reaction phases anaerobic anoxic aerobic in the sequencing batch operation mode under which aerobic granules are mainly cultivated has received a great attention chen et al 2013 qin et al 2005 qin and liu 2006 wan et al 2009 in fact the benefit of such operation is linked to metabolic needs of diverse microorganisms that should proliferate in a single granule for the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal sndpr which is the key advantage of ags technology however the impact of alternating operation mode on granulation period granule size and ags morphology in pilot scale reactors has not been investigated so far most conducted large scale ags studies have focused on low strength municipal wastewater which sounds reasonable considering the adverse effect of low organic loads on granule formation derlon et al 2016 isanta et al 2012 ni et al 2009 with the global approach toward sustainable development municipalities tend to receive industrial effluents mixed with domestic wastewater to unify their treatment processes hammouda et al 2015 ileri et al 2003 resulting in variable organic substrate concentrations for municipal wastewater up to 1800 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l 1 cetin et al 2018 giesen et al 2013 liu et al 2011 2010 using medium to high strength wastewater limited substrate conversion especially in terms of nutrients has been observed during granulation liu et al 2011 pijuan et al 2011 and long term operation cetin et al 2018 guimarães et al 2018 therefore alongside addressing the issues associated with granule formation treating low strength wastewater granulation and ags structure as well as substrate conversion deficiencies should be further addressed and discussed treating higher strength wastewater being recognized as the future of wastewater treatment van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 such research seems necessary to broaden the practice scope of the technology for actual applications this paper presents the results of the startup of three pilot scale ags reactors operated with distinct sequencing batch operation modes treating wastewater with diverse strength the objectives of the study were to i determine the impact of sequencing batch reactor sbr operation mode as well as sludge loading condition translated into food to microorganisms f m ratio and imposed by wastewater strength on the startup time ags morphology and microbial selection of aerobic granules ii evaluate the treatment performance and effluent quality of ags reactors in terms of effluent suspended solid concentration microbial washout pattern and efficacy in removing soluble components 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale reactors three geometrically identical pilot scale granular sequencing batch reactors gsbrs with individual working volume of 18 l and height to diameter h d ratio of 10 were used pishgar et al 2018 the gsbrs were operated at variable volume because the effluent was discharged from a middle port in each reactor resulting in identical volumetric exchange ratios vers of 60 the gsbrs were fed from the bottom through conical sections to ensure homogenous distribution of feed during aerobic phases air was introduced to the reactors from the bottom which would ensure proper mixing along with aeration at dissolved oxygen do saturation level 8 10 mg o2 l 1 air flowrate was monitored using gas flowmeter cole parmer gr10850avb cp and the aeration pattern was controlled using custom designed air distributor pishgar et al 2018 the sbr sequencing operation was automated using electric valves and synchronized timers 2 2 operational conditions identical aeration rates and superficial upflow air velocities suav hydraulic retention times hrts and cycle times were maintained in the gsbrs table 1 only the duration and type of reaction phases were different reactor an o ax o sbr was operated with alternating anaerobic aerobic anoxic aerobic condition the short intermediate fill phase was to supplement excess organic carbon for denitrification anaerobic and anoxic phases were performed using internal recirculation of supernatant from the top to the bottom of the reactor to provide mixing and sufficient contact in the absence of aeration reactor an o sbr was operated using an anaerobic static filling followed by aeration reactor o sbr was run under purely aerobic condition in all the cases duration of the aeration phase was the remainder of cycle time after adjusting the other phases the do was not controlled but monitored and the ph in the reactors varied in the ranges as shown in table 1 the gsbrs were operated at room temperature 19 5 3 5 c 2 3 synthetic wastewater and seed sludge the principal components of the synthetic wastewaters are shown in table 2 the cod and total organic carbon toc concentrations were adjusted by sodium acetate naac 25 and sodium propionate napr 75 essential macro elements were added as described in table s1 and the composition of microelement stock solution has been described elsewhere pishgar et al 2018 influent ph was maintained at 7 7 0 3 the sbrs were individually inoculated with 6 5 l of return activated sludge ras of biological

experimental approach and data analyzing strategies to fulfill the objectives of the study two by two comparative analyses between the operated gsbrs were opted table 3 drawing a comparison between an o ax o sbr and o sbr fed with wastewater of the same composition but run with completely different sbr reaction phase arrangements alternating vs purely aerobic could reveal the effect of sbr operation mode on the startup ags characteristics and effluent quality on the other hand comparative analysis of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr fed with wastewater of different strength and nutrient supply but operated with similar sbr modes could determine the effect of wastewater composition and the resulting substrate and sludge loading conditions despite slight differences the operation modes of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr were considered similar alongside receiving favorable carbon sources naac 25 napr 75 these sbr operation modes were expected to encourage the growth of specific nutrient removing organisms i e polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos de kreuk et al 2005 lu et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2008 intermediate anoxic phase in an o ax o sbr was supposed to further proliferate anoxic denitrifying community chen et al 2011 to ultimately achieve an enhanced overall nitrogen removal efficiency however neither phosphate removing nor anoxic denitrifying functional groups were abundantly detected in the gsbrs refer to fig 8 it therefore suggested that the alternating sbr phases of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr were performing similar in terms of phylogenetic assemblage rendering the differences in the sbr reaction phase arrangements in these reactors negligible hence the discrepancies between the startup time ags characteristics and effluent quality in these gsbrs could be attributed to wastewater strength and substrate loading rather than sbr operation mode 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 influent and effluent characterization influent and effluent samples were

characterization 3 1 1 granulation progress and startup period the progress of granulation was monitored using i 50th percentile d 0 5 and ii 10t h percentile d 0 1 of particle size distribution iii svi5 and iv svi30 svi5 ratio fig 1 aerobic granules are defined as microbial aggregates with the minimum size of 200 μm de kreuk et al 2007 consequently liu et al 2010 proposed a standard sludge volume percentage with size below 200 μm svp sb200 to differentiate granular and floccular biomass accordingly the biomass becomes dominated with granules if the svp sb200 achieves a value below 50 or inversely interpreted when d 0 5 of biomass particle size distribution is above 200 μm the granulation is complete when d 0 1 attains the value of 200 μm indicating that only a negligible portion of biomass is still present in floccular form coma et al 2012 in addition settling property of the sludge tends to enhance over the course of granulation aerobic granules reach their terminal settling velocity significantly faster than floc particles thus the svi recorded at a short time e g 5 min denoted by svi5 can be a reliable indicator of granulation schwarzenbeck et al 2004 suggested by erşan and erguder 2014 the ratio svi30 svi5 can be used to interpret the extent of granulation and sludge thickening indeed the granulation is completed when svi30 svi5 ratio maintains a value over 80 the effect of sbr operation mode on granulation could be understood from comparative study of an o ax o sbr and o sbr granulation occurred within similar time intervals in these two gsbrs fig 1a and c it respectively initiated at days 16 and 12 in these gsbrs when d 0 5 reached 200 μm and completed at day 23 and 21 after which d 0 1 varied predominantly above 200 μm the granulation time demonstrated by svi profiles agreed with those suggested by psd trends fig 1d and f the svi5 generally showed drastic drops at the initial days of operation in the three gsbrs however it was a false positive indication of granulation because it in fact resulted from biomass washout during acclimatization as discussed in section 3 1 2 thereafter svi5 demonstrated increasing trends until the granulation was commenced it significantly declined from 194 to 85 ml g 1 at days 15 and 27 in an o ax o sbr and from 73 to 54 ml g 1 at days 13 and 22 in o sbr granulation phases respectively the value of svi5 remained stable afterward 88 16 and 44 9 ml g 1 in an o ax o sbr and o sbr respectively implying the occurrence of maturation phases the svi30 svi5 ratio attained the values of 0 78 and 0 87 at days 27 and 22 in these gsbrs respectively suggesting the completion of granulation the effect of wastewater complexity on granulation could be comprehended from the differences in an o ax o sbr and an o sbr performances operated with similar sbr modes but different substrate loadings granulation delayed in an o sbr compared to that in an o ax o sbr the commencement and completion of granulation demonstrated by d 50 and d 0 1 trends fig 1b happened at days 40 and 67 in an o sbr leading to 2 5 3 time longer acclimatization and granulation periods than those observed in an o ax o sbr fig 1a decrease in svi5 signaling the outset of granulation started at day 39 resulting in svi5 decline from 70 ml g 1 at this day of operation to 41 ml g 1 at day 67 fig 1e the svi30 svi5 ratio reached 0 90 at day 90 signifying the achievement of complete granulation fluctuations in d 0 1 and svi30 svi5 ratio during maturation phase could be attributed to disintegration aggregation cycles of the granular fraction of ags reflecting perturbations in the system performance the least deviations in d 0 1 and svi30 svi5 profiles were observed in o sbr indicating the occurrence of the steadiest maturation phase in this gsbr accordingly the operation stability could be categorized as o sbr an o sbr an o ax o sbr it could therefore be speculated that the floccular portion of ags in an o ax o sbr during maturation phase was more significant than those in an o sbr and o sbr as confirmed by the morphology of ags discussed in section 3 1 3 3 1 2 biomass concentration dynamics during granulation phase biomass concentration in all the three reactors considerably increased and eventually attained the values of 7 0 5 8 8 0 7 11 6 1 2 mg mlss l 1 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively fig 2 however prior to attaining an increasing trend biomass concentration in all the studied gsbrs showed a dramatic decline it was due to biomass loss resulted from a short settling time 10 min which selected for floc particles with minimum settling velocity of 4 23 m h 1 despite this preliminary washout shown on fig 2 with blue arrows which was inherent to granulation coma et al 2012 li et al 2008a several incidents of biomass washouts were encountered due to equipment maladjustment or failure at events a b c and e fig 2 biomass loss was rectified by adding fresh ras whilst at event d an o sbr biomass concentration autonomously recovered within 20 days it is worth mentioning that the washout incidents at events a and b in an o ax o sbr were not as intense as those in the other gsbrs events c and e and thus did not resulted in drastic biomass loss in the former therefore the addition of ras at the corresponding days significantly increased biomass concentration to 7 2 7 6 mg mlvss l 1 in an o ax o sbr as opposed to those in an o sbr day 17 and o sbr day 8 in response to the same remediation strategy 4 0 4 9 mg mlvss l 1 in addition more frequent recurrence of anaerobic and anoxic phases with low shearing activity in an o ax o sbr could further encourage the growth of common fast growing heterotrophs especially during acclimatization when microbial agglomeration was minimal and the shearing activity in the reactor mainly originated from hydrodynamic conditions rather than particle to particle abrasions according to the results of this study it was tempting to speculate that the simpler the operation mode of the gsbr the less disturbance in the granulation process with a simpler operation it was not only likely to achieve higher biomass concentration upon maturation as that observed in o sbr but there was also less possibility of biomass washout episodes which could otherwise disrupt the granulation process however generalization of these findings may not be applicable to systems with different microbial community features such as robust nutrient removing ags reactors whose key organisms nitrosomonas nitrospira and ca accumulibacter did not proliferate in the gsbrs in this study refer to section 3 1 5 for further discussion a reduction in vss tss ratio was observed at the early stages of startup in the three gsbrs fig 2 which was more noticeable in an o sbr however it was followed by an increasing trend later during the acclimatization phases and the volatile contents eventually stabilized during the rest of the operations the volatile contents of the ags in an o ax o sbr and o sbr were identically high and varied in the narrow ranges of 0 86 0 03 and 0 87 0 04 respectively demonstrating an inorganic content of 13 14 fig 2a and c in contrast the volatile content of an o sbr ags was considerably lower 0 62 0 07 leading to a three time higher ash content 38 than those observed in the other gsbrs fig 2b higher ash content of the ags in an o sbr was due to lower biomass to biolith volume ratio of the granules in this system due to significantly smaller size when compared to those of the other gsbrs mineral deposits were observed in the core of sectioned granules developed in the three gsbrs data not shown an o sbr was fed with significantly higher phosphorus concentration cod p of 100 5 as opposed to those in the other gsbrs 100 1 which could increase the possibility of biologically induced calcium phosphate precipitation thermodynamic simulations of song et al 2002 showed that the chance of hydroxyapatite deposition increases with increase in phosphate concentration at given ca p ratio close to that maintained in this study 2 46 0 79 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr hydroxyapatite is the kinetically stable end product of calcium phosphate precipitation which has been found as the major mineral in the core of aerobic granules mañas et al 2012 2011 3 1 3 morphology of aerobic granular sludge the ags characteristics and granule morphology were widely different in the gsbrs as demonstrated by digital imaging fig 3 comparative study of an o ax o sbr fig 3a f and o sbr fig 3m r exhibiting the effect of sbr operation mode showed that the granulation occurred with a slower pace in the former amorphous microbial aggregates that formed immediately before aerobic granule formation were noticeably smaller in an o ax o sbr at day 23 fig 3a and m whereas aerobic granules could be frequently observed in o sbr ags at the same time fig 3m distinguishable aggregates with clear boundaries did not appear in an o ax o sbr until day 39 fig 3c while the presence of nebulous biomass patches substantially declined in o sbr at day 39 fig 3o these components constituted a high portion of the ags in an o ax o sbr even during maturation phase fig 3f granules formed in an o ax o sbr were light brown large around 0 5 cm and slimy with irregular shape fig 3f however aerobic granules cultivated in o sbr were yellow large 0 5 1 cm and dense with round clear cut shape fig 3r the effect of wastewater strength on ags development could be understood from the differences between morphological characteristics of the ags in an o ax o sbr fig 3a f and an o sbr fig 3g l in an o sbr aerobic granules were randomly observed at day 26 fig 3g which coincided with acclimatization phase fig 1b however their number was not significant enough to start the granulation process significant number of aerobic granules were observed at day 45 fig 3i when granulation had been commenced for 4 days amorphous microbial aggregates the precursors of aerobic granules emerged in micro scale in an o sbr as opposed to their milli scale in an o ax o sbr while flocs were present in substantial proportion at day 60 end of granulation fig 3j unlike an o ax o sbr fig 3f they completely disappeared from ags upon maturation fig 3l aerobic granules developed in an o sbr were yellowish brown small 0 5 4 mm and compact with irregular shape but smooth surfaces fig 3l 3 1 4 microstructure of aerobic granules sem imaging revealed differences in the microbial selection of aerobic granules formed under distinct operational conditions fig 4 to have the full view of granules developed in the gsbrs images fig 4a d and g were captured with the same magnification 40x these images could qualitatively reveal the compactness and surface structure of the granules developed under different conditions in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr and would allow solid comparisons to be drawn second images fig 4b e and h were taken to have a closer look at the interesting surface parts of the granules thus appropriate magnifications were chosen depending on the surface property of each granule to compare the morphology of dominant bacterial species covering the granule surfaces similar magnifications were chosen for the third images fig 4c f and i feathery growth of filamentous bacteria was frequently observed on the surface of aerobic granules formed in an o ax o sbr fig 4a which could justify the weak slimy structure of granules as seen in fig 3f widespread stems of fungi rooting in granule core alongside entrapped large nematodes were seen in the filament networks fig 4b this observation was in line with the findings of cetin et al 2018 who detected nematodes in the ags formed with high strength municipal wastewater the relation of nematodes and filamentous bacteria one of the most important biotic relationships in biofilm structure is thought to be due to environmental factors rather than the trophic preferences salvadó et al 2004 the conditions which were likely prevailing in the alternating operating mode of an o ax o sbr mechanical effect of nematodes i e facilitating substrate oxygen diffusion by burrowing and grazing and thus keeping the biofilm porous plays a key role in biofilm formation under high substrate load calaway 1963 salvadó et al 2004 therefore the presence of these organisms in large number could be another reason for the flexible structure of granules in an o ax o sbr the magnified image of the crack on the granule surface confirmed the intertwined net of fungi and filamentous bacteria fig 4c the detected fungi cells resembled aspergillus spp with identifier foot chambers and septa which could form hypha and spores cetin et al 2018 nevertheless the surface of granule was mainly dominated by tiny rod shape bacterial organisms length of 1 μm fig 4c the surface of aerobic granule formed in an o sbr had a compact structure fig 4d no fluffy matrix of filaments was observed supporting the dense structure of granules formed in this gsbrs see fig 3l however a closer look at the surface fig 4e demonstrated that filamentous bacteria were present albeit in lower abundance than that in an o ax o sbr granules fig 4b unlike an o ax o sbr granules nematodes were not detected on an o sbr granule surface negligible number of aspergillus like fungi were seen which were almost completely encapsulated in the zoogloeal network an increased magnification fig 4f showed that small rod shape bacteria about 1 μm were the prevailing organisms on the surface of an o sbr granules and that the matrix developed from the tangled filaments potentially played as the backbone in forming the compact structure of an o sbr granules sezgin et al 1978 the whole image of granule taken from o sbr demonstrated a completely smooth surface fig 4g the deformed shape of the granule was due to the adverse impact of large granule size on sample preparation procedure for sem imaging coccoid bacteria were mainly found on the granule surface fig 4h the stretched net visible in fig 4i possibly represented exopolymers which expanded during the critical point drying step of sem analysis such highly concentrated matrix of exopolymers substantially contributed to the smooth and compact structure of granules formed in o sbr 3 1 5 characterization of granulation rate size morphology and stability at pilot scale granulation time and granule size were independent of sbr operation mode and were in fact regulated by wastewater strength and the resulting organic loading condition this implication which was in line with the results of lab scale investigations de kreuk 2006 li et al 2008a moy et al 2002 tay et al 2003 was speculated from the similar granulation intervals and analogous granule sizes observed in an o ax o sbr and o sbr figs 1 and 3 where identical organic loading fig 5 a and c but different sbr modes table 1 were sustained it was further supported by achieving aerobic granules with divergent size range within a prolonged granulation time figs 1 and 3 in an o sbr operated with similar sbr mode but one fourth cod load compared to those in an o ax o sbr fig 5a and b numerous researchers attempted to accelerate granulation time in pilot scale reactors from 300 to 400 days liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 to few weeks cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2011 long et al 2014 although short settling time was widespread included in the rapid granulation strategy as one of the crucial selection pressure parameters it did not enhance the startup of pilot scale granular reactors unless it was accompanied with high substrate loading for example cetin et al 2018 could cultivate aerobic granules in 29 l pilot reactors in 25 44 days using a combination of short settle phase and high organic loading strategies ni et al 2009 identified settling time and ver as key parameters for aerobic granulation with low strength wastewater in pilot sbr nevertheless it should be noted that changes in ver indeed manipulates the organic load such that increase in ver rises the organic loading schwarzenbeck et al 2005 wei et al 2012 could achieve aerobic granulation from activated sludge within 40 days in a 1 5 m3 reactor simply because high strength was the main characteristics of the used industrial wastewater mixture of soy protein wastewater and effluent of internal circulation reactor although reduction in settling time was considered as the critical factor in provoking the granulation from swine slurry in a 100 l reactor this strategy was implemented alongside maintaining a stable and high cod load 2 kg cod m 3 d 1 morales et al 2013 therefore it could be construed that organic loading condition played a crucial but hidden and thus neglected role in granulation in larger modules as well the effect of substrate loading can be translated into the influence of sludge loading rate or food to microorganism f m ratio as the name suggests f m is the function of wastewater strength in terms of organic loading condition and biomass concentration retained in the reactor during granulation in the sbrs in the lack of deliberative sludge withdrawal approach such that deployed by li et al 2008b biomass concentration in the reactor is dictated by the growth rate of retained microbial species and washout dynamics during discharge phase either from the sludge bed situated above the decant level or as pin point flocs in this study no sludge removal mechanism was devised the f m ratio in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr were 1 9 0 3 0 4 0 1 and 1 4 0 3 during granulation which progressively reduced to respective ranges of 1 1 0 1 0 43 0 03 and 0 68 0 1 g cod g 1 vss d 1 at the end of maturation phase fig 5 mostly due to increase in mixed liquor density in the gsbrs fig 2 li et al 2011 ascertained that high f m about 1 1 g cod g 1 ss d 1 could encourage fast formation of large granules and low f m 0 3 g cod g 1 ss d 1 could result in slow formation of small granules an implication which was demonstrated about the impact of organic load on granulation rate as well li et al 2008a illustrating a close tie between f m and substrate loading during granulation process the same effects were indeed observed on aerobic granulation rate and size in the pilot scale gsbrs in this work similarly liu et al 2011 could speed up the granulation progress in pilot module 32 l and cultivated aerobic granules in 17 days by increasing substrate loading with the adjustment of cycle and settle times in fact a tight relation exists between f m ratio and settle time as well short settle period 10 min does not only select for dense flocs over small slow settling biomass which in turn induces granule formation it can also maintain the biomass concentration at a certain level by washing out a significant fraction of sludge at each cycle to ensure a high f m at the early stages of granulation li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 in this study f m was not controlled by reduction in settle time but via the strength of wastewater it is obvious that in case of treating real wastewater with a given strength settle time or ver should be altered to sustain f m within the desirable range for aerobic granulation as adopted by liu et al 2011 and ni et al 2009 nonetheless the granule formation intervals and the granule size in this study did not completely match those reported in lab scale studies under the same circumstances in terms of sludge loading rate complete granulation was achieved in shorter periods in lab scale modules at identical f m ratios li et al 2011 granule sizes were only comparable to those in this study when significantly higher f m ratios were reached due to drastic biomass washout at the early stages of startup in lab scale reactors li et al 2008a such differences can be attributed to the effect of reactor dimension on granulation severe wall effect in smaller scale modules internal diameter id 10 cm could result in biomass stratification along the column axis during aeration liu and tay 2007 whereas in larger modules id 20 cm biomass homogenization during aeration determined that the wall effect could be diminished with increase in reactor scale liu et al 2010 in fact reactor scale can act as a selectin pressure because increase in shear forces and facilitation in separating dispersed biomass from fast settling flocs occurs upon reduction in reactor scale which are crucial for granule formation and stability liu et al 2010 relatively smaller granule size achieved in lab scale reactors under similar f m condition compared to those in this study li et al 2011 could be explained by the amplified shear stresses induced by more frequent abrasion against the wall morphology and structure of aerobic granules as well as floccular proportion of ags could be attributed to sbr operation mode formation of jelly like weak granules in an o ax o sbr was most likely due to adopting a more sophisticated sbr cycle mode than those in an o sbr and o sbr fig 3f round and smooth granules were only cultivated in o sbr run by the simplest operation mode fig 3r amorphous flocs constituted a large portion of ags in an o ax o sbr fig 3f compared to those in an o sbr and o sbr fig 3l and r therefore it could be concluded that the more complex the operation the lower the degree of granule compactness the more anomalies in granule shape the higher the flocculent fraction of the ags and the more instability in maturation phase as realized from the profiles of d 0 1 and svi30 svi5 fig 1 simulation performed by picioreanu et al 2000 determined that biofilm geometrical heterogeneity was regulated by three factors among which two were applicable to granular systems 1 the ratio between biomass growth rate and substrate internal diffusion rate g and 2 external mass transport resistance induced by variant liquid flow rates although the effect of flow driving mechanisms external mass transfer limitation on biofilm structure was not prominent picioreanu et al 2000 it can become decisive in granular systems where internal mass diffusion rates are the direct resultants of liquid movements brought about by gas upflow velocity accordingly disruption in granulation process in this study could be explained by i operation perturbations due to equipment failure and or maladjustment ii frequent recurrence of reaction phases with substantially low shear stresses e g anoxic and anaerobic phases under such circumstances the weakness and irregularity in granule morphology was due to frequent disintegration aggregation cycles of granules which would not allow the effective shear forces to burnish the granule surfaces consequently amorphous biomass patches emerged in the ags because of biofilm detachment from granule surface caused by mechanical factors e g sloughing erosion microbial factors e g grazing predation and or granule breakage mass transfer limitation substrate oxygen deficiency in the interior of granules and thus autolysis cetin et al 2018 development of irregular granules was observed in other pilot studies as well where anaerobic phase with no means of stirring or fluidization was included in the sbr cycle isanta et al 2012 long et al 2014 overall operational strategy which encompasses cycle time cycle mode settle time and ver cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2011 ni et al 2009 seems to be a very comprehensive yet critical factor for successful granulation in large modules liu et al 2011 after adjusting the aeration pattern without which the granulation would not even initiate isanta et al 2012 pishgar et al 2018 f m strategy can be adopted for fast formation of compact smooth granules in a controlled size range the f m can be adjusted with settle time and ver for given wastewater strength liu et al 2011 ni et al 2009 the granulation can be started with f m ratio of 1 1 1 5 g cod g 1 ss d 1 and upon granulation the ratio should be reduced to 0 4 0 5 g cod g 1 ss d 1 to maintain the granule size at the desirable range 3 4 mm li et al 2011 to elucidate the correct applicability of our findings in order to prevent erroneous extrapolation it should be noted that the results of this study might not be applicable to pilot cases where the microbial selection and functional population distribution of the ags deviate from those observed here see fig 8 section 3 2 2 2 according to lab scale studies the presence of slow growing nutrient removing organisms e g autotrophic nitrifiers paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which enriched in neither of the gsbrs in this study could greatly contribute to granule stability and compactness liu et al 2004 and would affect the ags characteristics differently in anaerobic oxic systems paos and gaos if present can majorly i e by 60 convert readily biodegradable cod e g acetate to polymeric storage products i e polyhydroxyalkanoates phas anaerobically providing a subsequent famine aerobic phase where the heterotrophic community should mostly feed off and grow on their storage product with slower growth rate resulting in gentle oxygen gradients in the granules such growth pattern can prevent finger like filamentous outgrowth as observed in an o ax o sbr in this study and hence ensures granule density and stability de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 this speculation has been supported by piciorenau et al 1998 where hybrid differential discrete modelling mathematically correlated biofilm structure with biomass growth rate rather than substrate transfer rate there are numerous reports in the literature where the researchers long term operated ags reactors with excellent treatment performance and robust granular characteristics using complex anaerobic oxic cycles with the aim of removing nutrients de kreuk et al 2005 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015 yilmaz et al 2008 although compact granule structure with inconsiderable flocculent fraction has been reported in most bench scale cases bao et al 2009 schwarzenbeck et al 2005 a fraction of ags is conversely reported to remain in flocculent form in the larger scale modules of full scale installments de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015 even those with excellent nutrient removal performance pronk et al 2015 potentially due to detached pieces of granules growth on polymeric substrates and influent particulates de kreuk et al 2010 once more bringing in the effect of reactor scale thus further investigation is required to illuminate the effect of sbr operation mode on the same outcomes as those selected in this study for robust nutrient removing pilot ags reactors to confirm whether or not the results of this study can be generalized to all cases under diverse circumstances on the same note the findings of this study should therefore be used as practical criteria to predict the behavior of ags that has not been enriched with nutrient removing organisms yet e g granulation phase or has lost the appropriate microbial selection temporarily due to disturbance of any source i e long term operation in actual applications deterioration of microbial composition can potentially happen frequently for various reasons such as fluctuations in wastewater composition in terms of type complexity and concentration of pollutants ph equipment issues seasonal variations in weather and thus temperature etc metcalf eddy 2014 3 2 treatment performance and effluent quality 3 2 1 effluent suspended solids a general trend was observed in the effluent suspended solid ess concentrations of the three gsbrs fig 6 the ess acquired increasing trend during acclimatization phase due to washout imposed by the short settling time which continued with the initiation of granulation reaching a peak in the middle of granulation phase increase in biomass concentration during maturation resulted in a secondary rise in ess concentrations it corresponded to day 46 in an o ax o sbr and o sbr operations when a surge in the flocculent portion of ags was observed and the aerobic granules seemed weak and slimy in both gsbrs fig 3d and p with decrease in the floccular fraction of ags in o sbr ess declined substantially at day 57 105 mg l 1 tss whereas ess of an o ax o sbr maintained its fluctuations toward the end of maturation phase due to consistent presence of noteworthy amount of nebulous microbial aggregates in the ags fig 3 which in turn confirmed the less effective operation mode of an o ax o sbr compared to o sbr for steady aerobic granulation and achieving high quality effluent overall ess concentrations averaged 120 103 39 26 110 107 mg tss l 1 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively indicating the effect of wastewater strength and the resulting f m on effluent clarity of granular reactors it agreed with the results of the study of morales et al 2013 and rocktäschel et al 2015 who observed an increase in the ess of pilot scale granular reactors with increase in organic loading the vss tss ratios attained analogous values to those observed for biomass concentration in the reactors fig 2 thus the ess volatile contents of an o ax o sbr and o sbr were identically high 0 82 0 91 in contrast the ess volatile content of an o sbr reduced from 0 76 during acclimatization day 11 to 0 63 on average during granulation and maturation 3 2 2 effluent microbiology 3 2 2 1 microbial composition of effluent biomass microbial species that emerged in the ess of the gsbrs toward the end of granulation were from a handful of phyla among which proteobacteria 51 68 and bacteroidetes 24 40 were the most dominant ones fig 7 a the distinctions between the microbial selection of the washed out biomass could best be understood from the differences at family level fig 7b the families which were washed out of an o ax o sbr with the highest abundances were rhodocyclaceae 39 flavobacteriaceae 17 moraxellaceae 14 bacteriovoracaceae 5 and burkholderiaceae 5 the most abundant families emerged in the effluent of an o sbr included rhodocyclaceae 27 spirosomaceae 16 rhodobacteraceae 12 corynebacteriaceae 12 sphingobacteriaceae 4 and erysipelotrichaceae 4 the families with the greatest population in the effluent of o sbr were rhodocyclaceae 31 flavobacteriaceae 30 sphingobacteriaceae 8 rhodobacteraceae 6 bacteriovoracaceae 6 and burkholderiaceae 6 although the family xanthomonadaceae was not seen among the dominating taxa it emerged in the effluent of gsbrs albeit with relatively low relative abundances 0 2 0 6 the reported functions for the isolated phylogenetic groups are presented in table s3 accordingly some detected families play important roles in degradation of refractory organic wastes and can concomitantly contribute to nutrient removal such as rhodocyclaceae rhodobacteraceae burkholderiaceae and sphingobacteriaceae in addition most identified families e g flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae rhodobacteraceae microbacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae moraxellaceae rhodobacteraceae rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae are proved to significantly contribute to deterministic formation of the concentric spherical structure of aerobic granules indeed certain genera belonging to some of these families including thauera rhodocyclaceae family acinetobacter moraxellaceae paracoccus rhodobacteraceae and flavobacterium flavobacteriaceae promote production of key chemical factors c di gmp epistatic to quorum sensing which is a substantial requirement for granule maturation and long term granule stability for the associated citations see table s3 in supplementary materials considering the dynamic aggregation and detachment of bioflocs from granule biomass acknowledged by verawaty et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 it was safe to speculate that the key players in microbial aggregation and substrate conversions enriched in the ags indeed appeared in the effluent of the gsbrs in this study the discussion in section 3 2 2 2 could further support this argument 3 2 2 2 washout patterns of functional groups the core bacterial community discharged from the gsbrs included the genera thauera 20 36 azoarcus 7 23 and flavobacterium 4 23 fig 8 the highest abundance of the former was observed in an o ax o sbr and the largest populations of the latter two were detected in o sbr other important genera in terms of their populations which were uniquely discharged from each gsbr were acinetobacter 13 bacteriovorax 4 erysipelothrix 3 and corynebacterium 2 hydrogenophaga 2 gemmobacter 2 from an o ax o sbr leadbetterella 16 corynebacterium 10 paracoccus 9 erysipelothrix 4 pedobacter 3 prosthecobacter 3 bdellovibrio 2 and chryseobacterium 2 from an o sbr pedobacter 5 paracoccus 3 bacteriovorax 2 acinetobacter 2 bdellovibrio 2 and comamonas 2 from o sbr the microbial selection of the effluent biomass did not only differ from one system to another but significant population shifts were also observed for common species it should be noted that the conventional nutrient removing organisms autotrophic nitrosomonas and nitrospira and heterotrophic phosphate accumulating accumulibacter were not washed out of the systems principally because they did not enrich in the gsbrs most organisms emerged in the effluent of the gsbrs have been characterized as heterotrophic nitrifiers and or aerobic anoxic denitrifiers such as thauera azoarcus acinetobacter chryseobacterium corynebacterium and flavobacterium table s3 based on population distributions thauera and azoarcus were the most important ones likewise in the study of zhao et al 2013 thauera enriched under high organic and nitrogen loads in the ags and showed great simultaneous organic and ammonium nitrogen removal capabilities without any no x accumulation similar to the observations in this study see section 3 2 3 denitrifying thauera sp has mostly clustered with azoarcus in both granular and floccular systems adav et al 2010 wagner and loy 2002 such that betaproteobacteria related to the azoarcus thauera complexes are considered as abundant denitrifiers in industrial treatment facilities wagner and loy 2002 the study of liu et al 2006 confirmed this implication where significant enrichment of these two species was observed during the steady performance of denitrifying bioreactor in terms of high quinoline and cod removal efficiencies in general washing out all the aforementioned species considering the reported functions for them in the literature see table s3 could potentially compromise nutrient removal capacity of the gsbrs resulting in low ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies as discussed in section 3 2 3 diversity indices table 4 demonstrated that the biodiversity species richness and evenness of effluent biomass was strongly correlated with that of the ags in the gsbrs regression analysis α 0 05 r2 0 90 this could also be understood from fig 8 where noteworthy similarity was observed between the relative abundances of genera enriched in i e the ags sample and discharged from i e the effluent sample each gsbr moreover richness rr and evenness h ei and t of the ags indicated that distinctive microbial selection strategies might occur in the gsbrs which supported the differences observed in the sem images section 3 1 5 although rr values of effluent biomass discharged from the three gsbrs were almost identical they showed notable divergences from the rr values of the developed ags in the corresponding reactors increased rr value of the effluent of an o ax o sbr compared to that of its ags implied that this system could not retain a portion of the enriched microbial species inside the reactor which also emerged as higher ess concentration in this gsbr see section 3 2 1 in contrast decrease in the rr value of an o sbr effluent biomass demonstrated that this system was selectively washing out some proliferated taxa equal rr values and similar evenness of the ags and effluent biomass of o sbr indicated that the operation in this system was maintaining a balance between the retained and discharged otus these observations demonstrated that subtle microbial selection strategies could be in effect during granulation in the gsbrs these microbial selection strategies could be imposed by wastewater strength rather than the sbr operation mode according to variance partitioning analyses performed on microbial diversity of 14 wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2012 demonstrated that wastewater characteristics had more significant influence 25 7 on the bacterial community variance rather than operational parameters 23 9 it was in line with the findings of this study more similarities were observed between the microbial selection and population distribution of the ags of gsbrs fed with similar wastewater composition but operated with different sbr operation mode i e an o ax o sbr and o sbr rather than those gsbrs operated with similar sbr operation modes but fed with wastewaters of different strength an o ax o sbr and an o sbr see fig 8 given the considerable correlation between the biodiversity of effluent biomass and ags these similarities and differences were reflected in the microbial composition of effluent biomass as well highlighting the effect of wastewater strength on washout patterns however again it should be emphasized that generalization of these findings to the other cases should be accomplished with great caution to preclude irrelevant extrapolation as comprehensively discussed in section 3 1 5 if the extremal cod was consumed anaerobically anoxically the operation of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr could promote the growth of paos and denitrifying bacteria rather the common heterotrophs which would intrinsically affect the microbial selection strategies distinctly 3 2 3 effluent soluble pollutants an o ax o sbr and o sbr could identically remove 1865 159 593 58 74 18 71 14 and 8 6 4 7 mg l 1 of influent cod toc tn nh4 n and po4 p concentrations on average for 98 1 98 1 75 17 74 12 and 59 11 removal efficiencies respectively fig 9 the removal efficiencies in an o sbr were 91 2 98 0 19 4 21 3 and 65 8 resulting from 452 16 154 5 18 5 21 3 and 16 3 mg l 1 decrease in the initial concentrations of those parameters respectively accumulation of no x no3 no2 was observed in neither of the gsbrs changes in the soluble component concentrations demonstrated that the developed ags had the capacity to simultaneously remove organics and nutrients from municipal wastewater medium to high strength municipal waste streams generally constitute in mg l 1 500 1000 cod 160 330 toc 20 40 nh4 n and 2 4 4 7 po4 p metcalf eddy 2014 a comparison between these values and the removed concentrations fig s1 demonstrated that an o ax o sbr and o sbr had the potential to treat an effluent twice as strong as high strength municipal wastewater the an o sbr effectively treated medium strength municipal wastewater while it could exceptionally reduce 17 mg po4 p l 1 a concentration 1 5 to 3 times greater than that carried by municipal wastewater nevertheless as demonstrated by the removal efficiencies stated earlier satisfactory nutrient removal performance was not obtained in either of the reactors despite of using typical configurations suitable for treating nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient removal capacity of the systems seemed to be limited to organic matter availability thus discharging considerable ammonium and phosphate residual concentrations likewise incomplete nutrient removal has been occasionally reported in large scale ags reactors cetin et al 2018 morales et al 2013 wei et al 2012 even in the cases where synthetic feed was used and it contained easily biodegradable naac as sole carbon source long et al 2014 similar to the feed characteristics in this study such that the residual nutrient concentrations might not allow direct release of gsbr effluents to receiving water bodies as executed by pronk et al 2015 sometimes incomplete ammonium removal 55 60 was accompanied with no no x production cetin et al 2018 similar to the observations in this study in other occasions when ammonium concentration was completely removed via partial or incomplete nitrification accumulation of no x deteriorated tn removal efficiency due to the absence of denitrification liu et al 2011 long et al 2014 morales et al 2013 in general tn removal efficiencies ranged between 50 and 80 chen et al 2011 derlon et al 2016 liu et al 2011 2010 morales et al 2013 many researchers attempted to figure out the cause for inadequate tn removal in aerobic granular reactors mosquera corral et al 2005 and de kreuk et al 2005 realized that decrease in do saturation level from 100 to 40 could increase tn removal efficiency three to six fold from 8 to 45 such effect is in fact due to diffusion gradients of electron donor i e organic matter and electron acceptor i e oxygen inside the granules defining internal aerobic and anoxic volumes where nitrification and denitrification can simultaneously happen snd derlon et al 2016 mosquera corral et al 2005 this implication has brought the factor of granule size into attention which indeed determines the fraction of anoxic to aerobic zone chen et al 2011 derlon et al 2016 liu et al 2005 however as duly noted by chen et al 2011 since no practical strategy exists to control granule size in the permissible range for effective tn removal 1 3 1 75 mm de kreuk et al 2005 simply relying on granule size may result in unstable tn removal chen et al 2011 besides it is not guaranteed to achieve high tn removal efficiency with stable granule size liu et al 2011 thus the effect of size does not seem to be substantially critical for substrate conversion this implication was confirmed by the findings of liu et al 2010 2011 who observed that identical acclimatization periods were required to attain high cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies 85 in sbrs with the same configurations and influent qualities regardless of the sludge state i e granule vs floc thus the large size of granules developed in the gsbrs in this study could not be the main factor in preventing the quasi absence of snd inferred from partial removal of ammonium and no no x production since the do concentration in the bulk liquid can be adjusted easily and precisely chen et al 2011 process control in terms of do concentration has been suggested instead de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015 to induce ammonium oxidation many researchers adopted controlled do strategy with a concertation fixed at about 2 2 5 mg o2 l 1 chen et al 2011 derlon et al 2016 ni et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 not implementing this approach might preclude the occurrence of snd in the gsbrs as it potentially did in the study of cetin et al 2018 5 mg o2 l 1 and in the current work 8 mg o2 l 1 other factors have been identified to encourage sndpr from common pathways autotrophic nitrification anoxic denitrification and enhance biological phosphate removal ebpr metabolism in ags reactors which was suspected to be absent in this study guimarães et al 2018 observed sndpr failure in the ags systems operated with pulse feeding such that in o sbr and slow upflow filling regimes similar to those in an o ax o sbr and an o sbr treating domestic wastewater in a temperate region the authors translated the microbial ecology into operational strategies for optimization of process performance in terms of sndpr despite being a case study at high mesophilic temperature the results were fairly comprehensive and in agreement with the rest of literature guimarães et al 2018 and thus can be generalized to other studies those improvements included 1 enhancing anaerobic contact time by controlling the feeding velocity to facilitate utilizing a major fraction of external cod anaerobically in other words ensuring the occurrence of anaerobic aerobic redox condition in the system 2 adjusting aeration phase duration and controlling do at moderate concentrations to prevent competitive advantage of endogenous respiration over denitrification on space i e reduction in anoxic biovolume caused by over oxygenation 4 controlling temperature and ph for lowering the inhibition of free ammonia fa on nitrification and for enhancing paos gaos population ratio 3 maintaining suitable reactor substrate loading by adjusting sbr phase length as a function of fluctuations in influent concentrations which would account for local wastewater and climate conditions derlon et al 2016 guimarães et al 2018 weissbrodt et al 2013 nitrogen removal efficiency in a biological system depends on manifestation and efficacy of i nitrogen incorporation into cellular tissues for new cell synthesis and ii nitrification and denitrification competency of the retained microbial consortium pronk et al 2015 while the former is always present and can generally remove a considerable concentration of influent ammonium nitrogen due to greater biomass retention potential of ags 4 5 times than that of cas it can limit ammonium removal to the influent organic matter content and hence may cause nitrogen residues in the effluent as it was observed in this study the latter pathway can significantly enhance overall nitrogen removal efficiency of the system by separating it from organic matter degradation for this purpose autotrophic nitrification and anoxic denitrification have been considered as the main possible pathways in the ags systems with the process control strategies set based on this assumption discussed above nonetheless unorthodox nutrient removal pathways might be involved which should be further explored to understand the substrate conversion mechanisms under unexpected operating and environmental conditions 4 conclusion granulation was successfully achieved in 22 27 days in an o ax o sbr and o sbr and in 67 days in an o sbr with dissimilar granule size and structure granulation time and granule size were independent of sbr operation mode and could be explained by wastewater strength and the resulting organic and sludge loading conditions whereas ags morphology and granule structure as well as floccular proportion of ags could be attributed to sbr operation mode the more complex the operation the lower the degree of granule compactness the more anomalies in granule shape the higher the flocculent fraction of ags and the more instability in maturation phase similar ess concentrations discharged from an o ax o sbr 120 103 mg tss l 1 and o sbr 110 107 mg tss l 1 which were significantly higher than that emerged in the effluent of an o sbr 39 26 mg tss l 1 indicated that the effluent clarity in terms of suspended solid concentration depended on wastewater strength and the resulting f m ratio sem imaging 16r rna phylogenetic gene sequencing and biodiversity analysis diversity indices indicated that subtle but distinct microbial selection strategies were in effect during granulation which were imposed by wastewater strength biodiversity analysis demonstrated that the species richness and evenness of effluent biomass were strongly correlated with those of the ags in the gsbrs regression analysis α 0 05 r2 0 90 it could relate the similarities and differences in the microbial composition of effluent biomass to that of the ags in the gsbrs highlighting the effect of wastewater strength on washout patterns a comparison between the removed concentrations and the typical constituent concentrations of medium to high strength municipal waste streams demonstrated that the gsbrs had the potential to treat municipal wastewater with diverse complexity however limited nutrient removal which was restricted by organic matter content could be due to involvement of unorthodox nutrient removal pathways which warrant in depth

permafrost leachate other soil leachates local primary productivity dry and wet atmospheric deposition and groundwater discharge however dom characteristics and dynamics in the mobile rivers and alpine lakes cannot be fully understood via potential endmembers because the material in rivers and lakes are expected to undergo intense in stream diagenetic processes unlike the dom stored in glaciers or permafrost with an average elevation 4000 m above sea level sunlight is very strong on the htp so photo degradation may play a significant role in the degradation of dom meanwhile glacier and permafrost sourced dom exhibit high bioavailability on the htp and elsewhere in the world making in stream even more relevant hood et al 2009 spencer et al 2014 vonk et al 2013 yan et al 2016 therefore in the mobile alpine rivers relic dom after extensive photo and bio degradation may be exported downstream without significant inputs from autochthonous production in winter increased anthropogenic activities e g cropland and urban expansion biomass and fossil fuel combustion have been linked to the high riverine n export and black carbon in tibetan glaciers aerosols and precipitation li et al 2016b 2018 qu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the correlation between black and organic carbon with decadal trends in anthropogenic combustion emissions further evidences the profound effects of human activities on this presumed pristine ecosystem xu et al 2009 in this study we provide the first integrated characterization of dom and its dynamics for the rivers and lakes

anthropogenic activities on the characteristics of dom in the alpine rivers and lakes of htp 2 methods 2 1 site description sampling sites were located on the north slope of the himalayas including

3 1 water chemistry of tibetan rivers and lakes the temperature of samples was generally low with average values of 2 3 c during the study period table 1 most ph values averaged between 7 9 and 8 6 with a maximum of 9 2 for the lhanag tso lake l2 the average do concentration ranged from 7 4 to 8 7 mg l 1 corresponding to 87 99 saturation suggesting microbial respiration at some sites it is noteworthy that the concentration of do at 100 saturation at these altitudes 4000 m above sea level is lower than that in waters at low altitude with the same temperature and salinity the mean ec values were lower in alpine rivers compared to the lakes 275 469 μs cm 1 vs 668 2470 μs cm 1 the lower ec values found here are similar to those found in headwater streams of the alps fasching et al 2016 the average tds concentration ranged from 176 to 230 mg l 1 in the rivers and was 527 mg l 1 in the brackish l2 3 2 doc uv vis eem parafac and associated indicators the doc concentrations were very low in rivers ranging from 0 1 to 2 1 mg l 1 with average concentrations of 0 25 0 87 mg l 1 tables 1 2 these values are comparable to those reported in tibetan rivers but lower than those of headwater streams in the alps 1 1 5 4 mg l 1 fasching et al 2016 qu et al 2017 zhao and song 2018 in the lakes however the doc concentrations were relatively high 4 8 4 4 and 37 4 mg l 1 in l1 l2 and l3 respectively the doc concentrations in l1 and l2 were comparable to reported values 3 1 4 6 mg l 1 spencer et al 2014 the absorption coefficient at 254 nm i e a254 averaged between 0 5 and 6 6 m 1 for rivers and 5 7 14 9 m 1 for lakes the a254 values in lakes pq and yz were significantly higher than those in mz and jz asymp sig 0 01 fig s2 the a350 value ranged from 0 05 to 3 5 m 1 with kx at lower end and pq at the higher end and significantly highly levels in pq and yz asymp sig 0 01 unlike a254 the lakes did not have higher values of a350 a proxy for lignin phenols benner and kaiser 2011 suggesting that in situ production dominates the sources of dom in the lakes rather than terrestrial higher plants and or soil inputs the specific absorption coefficient a 254 was significantly higher at pq and yz asymp sig 0 05 with averages of 9 5 and 5 1 m2 g 1 compared to 0 2 0 6 m2 g 1 for the lakes again suggesting microbial and algal sources of dom in the lakes overall lang tso lake l3 had the highest values for doc concentration a254 14 9 m 1 and slope ratio sr 30 6 but the lowest a 254 of 0 2 m2 g 1 among the rivers and lakes suggesting that microbial sourced low molecular weight cdom dominated in l3 the sr is inversely related to the molecular weight of cdom helms et al 2008 the sr averaged 3 5 4 8 for tibetan rivers much higher than those observed in headwater streams of the alps 1 fasching et al 2016 the sr levels in the lakes ranged from 14 5 to 30 6 suggesting cdom with even lower molecular weight in tibetan rivers and especially lakes helms et al 2008 three fluorescent components were identified using parafac modeling including two protein like components c300 344 and c 260 315 and one humic like component c265 440 fig 2 a the protein like component c300 305 340 344 has been linked with glacier fed ecosystems such as the arctic ocean antarctic sea and alpine watersheds fig 2b c stedmon et al 2007 2011 retelletti brogi et al 2018 chen et al 2018 2019 concentrations of this component were higher in sea ice compared to underlying seawaters in both the antarctic and arctic seas stedmon et al 2011 retelletti brogi et al 2018 however it is not observed in subtropical or temperate watersheds without glaciers chen et al 2010 2017 like doc concentrations of fdom were also extremely low with averages of 0 02 0 05 ru for the rivers and 0 01 0 07 ru for the lakes table 1 these concentrations are one to three orders of magnitude lower than those observed in rivers at low latitude chen et al 2017 the relative abundance of c300 344 ranged from 34 to 41 of total fluorescence in the rivers with mz jz and kx at the higher end and yz and pq at the lower end a similar trend was seen for protein like c 260 315 which had fluorescence proportions ranging from 24 to 45 for the rivers total protein like fluorescence c300 344 and c 260 315 generally dominated in the rivers while c 260 315 alone dominated in the lakes 42 51 in contrast humic like components c265 440 was lower in mz jz kx and the lakes but were significantly higher in yz and pq asymp sig 0 05 3 3 molecular signature via ft icr ms analysis ft icr ms identified 1328 1909 formulas for five selected riverine sites of the yz mz jz and pq table 3 the weight averaged m z m z wa ranged from 429 to 463 higher than those in tibetan glaciers and lakes 390 413 spencer et al 2014 the weight averaged aimod was also rather high 0 5 0 6 except for 0 3 at pq5 which is close to or higher than values observed for permafrost leachates active layer 0 5 and permafrost layer 0 3 wang et al 2018b the dbe was similarly high with values of 12 16 the weight averaged h c and o c ratios were relatively low compared to rivers at low latitude i e 0 96 1 16 and 0 17 0 38 vs 1 22 and 0 51 chen et al 2016b in contrast n cwa and s cwa were as high as 0 15 and 0 05 in htp rivers respectively heteroatomic formulas were also highly abundant with 58 72 s containing and 61 86 n containing formulas the compound categories of molecular formulas were dominated by condensed aromatics 31 39 out of which 81 99 was dissolved black nitrogen i e dbn followed by polyphenols 15 33 and highly unsaturated compounds with low o c 0 5 18 27 the remaining portions of compound categories were low 2 13 highly unsaturated with o c 0 5 1 12 aliphatics and 3 9 peptides based on van krevelen diagrams fig 3 molecular formulas heavily fall into categories of condensed aromatics polyphenols and highly unsaturated moieties with low o c the dom composition at yz3 was made up of very few aliphatics peptides and highly unsaturated formulas with high o c this suggests that the dom at yz3 was highly degraded given the labile nature of these compounds singer et al 2012 ward and cory 2016 chen et al 2016b the yz3 site is located in the mid stream of the yz river resulting in a longer period of strong solar irradiation at high elevation and also bio degradation is also expected along the way compared to the van krevelen diagram of yz5 most molecular formulas with o c 0 5 and m z 300 were absent downstream at yz3 suggesting high lability of these molecules these observations are consistent with previous findings that molecular formulas with high o c are more bioavailable in dom from the alps glaciers singer et al 2012 meanwhile dom draining permafrost soils with higher o c can also be photo oxidized completely or partially ward and cory 2016 since the permafrost is discontinuous and only occupies a small fraction of the land in the study region 9 permafrost inputs are expected to be limited especially in winter the formulas with one sulfur atom on the right hand side of the van krevelen diagram were also absent for the yz3 dom implying high lability fig s4 these formulas largely fall into the categories of peptides aliphatics and highly unsaturated compounds interestingly s and n containing formulas distribution showed rather clear patterns with condensed aromatics generally contained 1 2 sulfur and 2 or 4 nitrogen atoms the n containing formulas generally contained multiple nitrogen atoms except for mz2 dom which was comprised of substantial formulas containing a single nitrogen 4 discussion 4 1 sources of dom in the rivers and lakes of the himalayan tibetan plateau potential sources of dom in the htp encompass 1 glacier meltwater runoff 2 permafrost and soil leachates 3 vegetation leachate 4 atmospheric deposition 5 groundwater discharge and 6 in situ primary production 1 the inputs from glacier meltwater runoff are obvious considering that the study area is glacier studded there are 10 816 glaciers with a total area of 14 103 km2 in the yz basin alone huang et al 2011 the glaciers serve as a water storage tower for east and south asia providing up to 2 3 of the summer flow in the ganges and 1 2 flow in other major rivers for alpine reaches on the htp qiu 2008 the strong influence of glaciers was suggested by the prominence of the glacier associated protein like component c300 344 fig 2 2 permafrost coverage is 9 3 near sites yz1 and yz2 qu et al 2017 the 14c dated age of doc was positively correlated with the proportion of permafrost soil area suggesting the input of ancient doc into htp rivers at least in summer qu et al 2017 in addition δ13c doc at a site between yz1 and yz2 was 25 3 similar to soil 25 4 qu et al 2017 table 2 3 the vegetation in the study area was dominated by alpine meadow and grassland grassy biomass can generate charcoal with multiple n atoms while woody biomass tends to produce n depleted black carbon upon incomplete combustion knicker 2007 2010 which may explain the findings of four or two n containing molecular formulas for condensed aromatics in this study fig s4 4 wet and dry atmospheric deposition can reach the htp watersheds directly or indirectly for example deposition on the glaciers and lands can also enter the rivers and lakes via glacier melt and precipitation runoff anthropogenic aerosols and precipitation in remote locations on the tibetan plateau contain pre aged dom with doc concentrations up to 1 mg l 1 li et al 2016b 2017 2018 atmospheric mineral dust may also be an important source of dom on htp li et al 2016a yan et al 2016 we observed a positive correlation between doc versus ec and tds r 0 82 p 0 0001 fig s3 although doc concentration usually decreases with ec it is likely that mineral dust inputs simultaneously contributes to dom and ec in addition heavy fog and haze which usually occur in north china especially in winter may also contribute to the dry and wet deposition of dom 5 groundwater in the htp is recharged at a rate of 100 200 mm yr 1 at high elevations and is discharged at a rate of 10 9 10 7 m s 1 in the valleys and fault zones supplying base flow to rivers and springs wu et al 2005 ge et al 2008 since the htp is well known for containing an active tectonic region and the yz river is located in the suture zone of the eurasian and indian plates the discharge of groundwater to the surface waters is expected especially in the dry season which can interrupt permafrost continuity ge et al 2008 6 autochthonous primarily production should be important for lakes and may also be a non negligible input to flowing rivers but very little quantitative information is available it has been reported that firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria bacterioplankton species prevail in the upstream midstream and downstream of the yz river respectively changing with environmental factors such as nutrients elevation velocity and turbidity wang et al 2017 himalayan river waters are very clear and the topography is steep so high in situ primary productivity is not expected however significant autochthonous production may occur in the deeper and stagnant lacustrine waters which is suggested by their much higher doc concentrations and lower aromaticity despite diverse dom sources their relative contributions may vary spatiotemporally for example storm runoff carrying terrestrial and soil dom can be of more importance during the warm monsoon season whereas groundwater discharge should be more influential during the dry season when the water head is relatively low total runoff peaks in august 70 80 mm and is only several mm per month from november to march at yz su et al 2018 since the samples were collected in late november to early december it is expected that the river waters were dominantly fed by melting glaciers and groundwater however quantitative contribution from each source is unclear at this point spatially speaking the specific absorption coefficient a 254 value was generally lower in the smaller mz jz and kx rivers and the three lakes which were also dominated by protein like components c300 344 and c 260 315 the sr and biological index bix were also correlated with these parameters in the score and loading plots of principal component analysis pca fig 4 and fig s2 implying that protein like dom from microbial algal and glacier derived sources dominated these waters by contrast the larger rivers yz and pq were associated with humic like component c265 440 humification index hix absorption coefficients and aromaticity proxy a 254 these correlations suggest primary inputs from plants and permafrost from river basins and groundwater discharges since the latter often contains more humic like fdom than do overlying surface waters chen et al 2010 it seems that the smaller watershed dom is more of glacial endmembers while larger river dom is more influenced by terrestrial humic endmembers and potential groundwater inputs 4 2 extremely low relic doc in tibetan rivers draining the himalayas concentrations of doc ranged from 0 1 to 2 1 mg l 1 with averages of 0 25 0 87 mg l 1 which are much lower than levels in world major rivers at lower latitudes 5 3 2 0 mg l 1 thurman 1985 fig 5 a the lowest concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 were observed in two tributaries yz6 and pq9 while the highest concentration of 2 1 mg l 1 was found at site pq3 the riverine doc concentration is comparable to those observed in glaciers and precipitation but obviously lower than the concentrations observed in the other potential sources this finding may be explained by several scenarios firstly during the sampling time of late november to early december river baseflow is mainly sustained by melt water from large glaciers and presumably from low doc groundwaters the concentrations of doc are also low in proglacial streams 0 3 mg l 1 spencer et al 2014 dilution by groundwater discharge is also possible especially in winter secondly intense in stream processing is expected for tibetan riverine dom which is suggested by the rapid decrease of doc concentrations in streams fed by permafrost leachates i e from 12 mg l 1 to 3 mg l 1 from the upper to the midstream in the htp wang et al 2018a photodegradation is also likely since the sunlight is very strong and days are long at the high altitude of the htp with 3000 h of sunlight per year peng et al 2015 fresh soil and plants derived dom is highly photolabile photochemical oxidation controls carbon processing in arctic rivers and lakes especially for headwaters where there is little prior light exposure 70 95 loss lanzalunga and bietti 2000 cory et al 2014 at site yz3 molecular formulas with high o c 0 6 were absent and formulas had lower o c compared to the upstream site yz5 suggesting strong photo degradation ward and cory 2016 the o cwa was generally low in the rivers from 0 17 to 0 23 but 0 38 at pq5 implying highly degraded dom signature additional evidence of photo degradation is provided by the relatively large proportion of parafac component of c265 440 which has been associated with photo degraded dom chen et al 2010 in addition surface waters are generally unshaded in the study area due to the lack of trees besides the photo degradation of dom significant in stream bio degradation is also expected given inputs of dom from glacier melt especially in the dry winter season when precipitation runoff is low high bioavailability has been observed for tibetan glacier dom with approximately half of the doc respired within one month spencer et al 2014 yan et al 2016 moreover the heteroatom enriched molecular formulas lend support to high bioavailability i e cho formulas only accounted for 8 17 of all formulas the s and n containing formulas tend to be more labile in fluvial networks compared to cho only formulas chen et al 2016b wang et al 2018a the chos and chon formulas respectively account for 5 2 13 6 and 28 0 39 8 of all formulas in major world rivers much lower than the 58 72 and 61 86 of these formulas found in this study wagner et al 2015 despite the bias of ppl resin against proteinaceous materials the proportion of bio labile peptides was 8 9 except for mid stream site yz3 3 the results of fluorescence also suggested abundant protein like dom 58 80 one thing we need to be aware of is the different analytical windows of eems and ft icr ms when we compare the results obtained from different methods fluorescent eems can only capture the signals of fluorescent moieties such as humic acids fulvic acids and aromatic amino acids and peptides the ft icr ms can demonstrate the molecules which are extractable by ppl resin and ionizable during measurement this study strongly suggested that riverine dom is rapidly processed in the htp leading to an extremely low concentration of relic doc that is delivered to the lower river reaches this implies the similarly rapid release of co2 through dom remineralization in headwater rivers which has been observed worldwide butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 4 3 evidences of anthropogenic effects enriched condensed aromatics and high abundance of heteroatomic formulas in the himalayan rivers surprisingly condensed aromatics i e black carbon accounted for approximately 1 3 of the total identified molecular formulas in all samples at four rivers which is much higher than average values in major world rivers 11 jaffé et al 2013 wagner et al 2015 fig 5b and c it is also much higher than the proportion measured in potential sources to these rivers as reported in other work including glaciers snow glacier cryoconite permafrost leachate stream and precipitation see references in fig 5 caption the percentage of condensed aromatics in htp rivers was 2 times higher than reported for permafrost leachate 3 times higher than reported for streams and about one order of magnitude higher than reported for glaciers and precipitation in addition the rather high value of dom aromaticity in the htp rivers that was suggested by high specific absorption coefficient values was in line with the high percentage of condensed aromatics especially in yz and pq 5 1 and 9 5 m2g 1 respectively the massive wet and dry deposition of black soot onto the htp from various origins via both long distance transport from south and east asia and local biomass and yak dung combustion have been a serious threat to the third pole qiu 2008 xu et al 2009 li et al 2016b it is estimated that about half of the black carbon in the aerosols deposited on himalayan glaciers is from biomass combustion li et al 2016b in the internal of the htp the estimated proportion of black carbon from biomass burning further increases to 70 potentially related to the slash and burn agriculture on the expanding cropland and yak dung burning as a main fuel source by local residents wang et al 2018a li et al 2016b the study area is the economical and agricultural center of tibet furthermore in natural environments the black carbon can be functionalized with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on the periphery of the condensed aromatic rings over time leading to the increased solubility of condensed aromatics in aquatic ecosystems with aging hockaday et al 2007 in addition the more labile peptides aliphatics and highly unsaturated formulas with high o c are readily degraded during passage along the rivers however condensed aromatics are relatively biorefractory resulting in the enrichment of dissolved black carbon one noteworthy point is that although black carbon is generally thought to be produced from incomplete combustion of organic matter such as biomass and fossil fuel black carbon like organic matter can also be produced via photochemical processing of dom in the presence of sunlight and iron chen et al 2014 it is unclear at this point if photoproduction has contributed to the pool of black carbon under strong sunlight and oxygen limited conditions in the htp however the characteristics of condensed aromatics i e 81 99 dissolved black nitrogen with multiple nitrogen hinted the domination by grassy biomass combustion as stated above taken together the findings of this work suggest the combined effects of the above mentioned factors greatly enrich the proportion of relic dissolved condensed aromatics in rivers of the htp high abundance of chos and chon formulas 58 72 and 61 86 vs 5 2 13 6 and 28 0 39 8 in major world rivers further suggested effects of human activities enhanced heteroatomic formulas have been linked to anthropogenic activities in world rivers wagner et al 2015 this is also in consistent with high riverine n export in tibetan rivers caused by discharge from agricultural activities and urban areas qu et al 2018 5 conclusion as glaciers retreat and the active layer of the permafrost thickens the release of co2 from the degradation of more and more glacier derived dom and permafrost dom are expected to produce a positive feedback to the climate warming further it is suspected that the organics deposited on tibetan glaciers are mainly anthropogenic in origin the percentage and characteristics of condensed aromatics suggested effects of grassy biomass combustion the greater abundance of heteroatomic molecular formulas has also been linked to anthropogenic inputs in the world s major rivers measures should therefore be taken to mitigate emissions from biomass and fossil fuel combustion in this region and in proximal areas the combination of climate change rapid processing and human disturbance create dom with unique characteristics and dynamics in himalayan rivers with unknown ramifications in downstream environments

ecological responses have attracted extensive attention in the scientific community the temperature has risen at a rate of 0 3 c per 10 year over recent decades in the htp about twice the average global warming rate thompson et al 2000 the active layer of the permafrost has also been increasing at a rate of 1 33 cm yr 1 and the glaciers have been retreating at an alarming rate zhao et al 2004 kehrwald et al 2008 ancient doc that is up to thousands of years old has been reported in the glaciers permafrost leachate rivers lakes precipitation and even zooplankton on the htp spencer et al 2014 qu et al 2017 li et al 2018 su et al 2018 this suggest ancient organic carbon release presumably from local permafrost and fossil fuel aerosols transported from distant locations besides warming driven by increasing greenhouse gases black carbon laden aerosols and precipitation originating from south and east asia have been proposed as additional mechanisms that may speed up glacier retreat in the htp qiu 2008 xu et al 2009 li et al 2016b 2018 the htp plays pivotal roles in regional biogeochemical cycling freshwater resources and quality and global climate change for example fast rock uplift 10 mm yr 1 heavy summer indian monsoons and land expansion for cropland means that the rivers draining the himalayas play significant roles in global chemical and sediment budgets milliman and meade 1983 burg et al 1998 hren et al 2007 liu et al 2012 however little is known about the characteristics and dynamics of dom in this critical and rapidly changing region especially in alpine rivers several previous reports have focused on the bulk parameter of doc or the molecular signatures of dom sources in glaciers glacier fed streams and lakes permafrost leachate and permafrost connected streams spencer et al 2014 feng et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 indeed there are many potential sources of dom in rivers and lakes in the htp including glacier runoff permafrost leachate other soil leachates local primary productivity dry and wet atmospheric deposition and groundwater discharge however dom characteristics and dynamics in the mobile rivers and alpine lakes cannot be fully understood via potential endmembers because the material in rivers and lakes are expected to undergo intense in stream diagenetic processes unlike the dom stored in glaciers or permafrost with an average elevation 4000 m above sea level sunlight is very strong on the htp so photo degradation may play a significant role in the degradation of dom meanwhile glacier and permafrost sourced dom exhibit high bioavailability on the htp and elsewhere in the world making in stream even more relevant hood et al 2009 spencer et al 2014 vonk et al 2013 yan et al 2016 therefore in the mobile alpine rivers relic dom after extensive photo and bio degradation may be exported downstream without significant inputs from autochthonous production in winter increased anthropogenic activities e g cropland and urban expansion biomass and fossil fuel combustion have been linked to the high riverine n export and black carbon in tibetan glaciers aerosols and precipitation li et al 2016b 2018 qu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the correlation between black and organic carbon with decadal trends in anthropogenic combustion emissions further evidences the profound effects of human activities on this presumed pristine ecosystem xu et al 2009 in this study we provide the first integrated characterization of dom and its dynamics for the rivers and lakes of the htp by measuring doc concentration ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac and high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms eem parafac can trace the sources and dynamics of dom in various ecosystems sensitively and rapidly while ft icr ms provides a high resolution molecular scale assessment of thousands of molecular formulas stedmon et al 2007 2011 spencer et al 2014 chen et al 2018 furthermore we aim to investigate effects of anthropogenic activities on the characteristics of dom in the alpine rivers and lakes of htp 2 methods 2 1 site description sampling sites were located on the north slope of the himalayas including twenty five sites along five rivers and their tributaries as well as three lacustrine sites fig 1 this region is glacier studded with a small coverage of discontinuous permafrost 9 but inputs from

3 1 water chemistry of tibetan rivers and lakes the temperature of samples was generally low with average values of 2 3 c during the study period table 1 most ph values averaged between 7 9 and 8 6 with a maximum of 9 2 for the lhanag tso lake l2 the average do concentration ranged from 7 4 to 8 7 mg l 1 corresponding to 87 99 saturation suggesting microbial respiration at some sites it is noteworthy that the concentration of do at 100 saturation at these altitudes 4000 m above sea level is lower than that in waters at low altitude with the same temperature and salinity the mean ec values were lower in alpine rivers compared to the lakes 275 469 μs cm 1 vs 668 2470 μs cm 1 the lower ec values found here are similar to those found in headwater streams of the alps fasching et al 2016 the average tds concentration ranged from 176 to 230 mg l 1 in the rivers and was 527 mg l 1 in the brackish l2 3 2 doc uv vis eem parafac and associated indicators the doc concentrations were very low in rivers ranging from 0 1 to 2 1 mg l 1 with average concentrations of 0 25 0 87 mg l 1 tables 1 2 these values are comparable to those reported in tibetan rivers but lower than those of headwater streams in the alps 1 1 5 4 mg l 1 fasching et al 2016 qu et al 2017 zhao and song 2018 in the lakes however the doc concentrations were relatively high 4 8 4 4 and 37 4 mg l 1 in l1 l2 and l3 respectively the doc concentrations in l1 and l2 were comparable to reported values 3 1 4 6 mg l 1 spencer et al 2014 the absorption coefficient at 254 nm i e a254 averaged between 0 5 and 6 6 m 1 for rivers and 5 7 14 9 m 1 for lakes the a254 values in lakes pq and yz were significantly higher than those in mz and jz asymp sig 0 01 fig s2 the a350 value ranged from 0 05 to 3 5 m 1 with kx at lower end and pq at the higher end and significantly highly levels in pq and yz asymp sig 0 01 unlike a254 the lakes did not have higher values of a350 a proxy for lignin phenols benner and kaiser 2011 suggesting that in situ production dominates the sources of dom in the lakes rather than terrestrial higher plants and or soil inputs the specific absorption coefficient a 254 was significantly higher at pq and yz asymp sig 0 05 with averages of 9 5 and 5 1 m2 g 1 compared to 0 2 0 6 m2 g 1 for the lakes again suggesting microbial and algal sources of dom in the lakes overall lang tso lake l3 had the highest values for doc concentration a254 14 9 m 1 and slope ratio sr 30 6 but the lowest a 254 of 0 2 m2 g 1 among the rivers and lakes suggesting that microbial sourced low molecular weight cdom dominated in l3 the sr is inversely related to the molecular weight of cdom helms et al 2008 the sr averaged 3 5 4 8 for tibetan rivers much higher than those observed in headwater streams of the alps 1 fasching et al 2016 the sr levels in the lakes ranged from 14 5 to 30 6 suggesting cdom with even lower molecular weight in tibetan rivers and especially lakes helms et al 2008 three fluorescent components were identified using parafac modeling including two protein like components c300 344 and c 260 315 and one humic like component c265 440 fig 2 a the protein like component c300 305 340 344 has been linked with glacier fed ecosystems such as the arctic ocean antarctic sea and alpine watersheds fig 2b c stedmon et al 2007 2011 retelletti brogi et al 2018 chen et al 2018 2019 concentrations of this component were higher in sea ice compared to underlying seawaters in both the antarctic and arctic seas stedmon et al 2011 retelletti brogi et al 2018 however it is not observed in subtropical or temperate watersheds without glaciers chen et al 2010 2017 like doc concentrations of fdom were also extremely low with averages of 0 02 0 05 ru for the rivers and 0 01 0 07 ru for the lakes table 1 these concentrations are one to three orders of magnitude lower than those observed in rivers at low latitude chen et al 2017 the relative abundance of c300 344 ranged from 34 to 41 of total fluorescence in the rivers with mz jz and kx at the higher end and yz and pq at the lower end a similar trend was seen for protein like c 260 315 which had fluorescence proportions ranging from 24 to 45 for the rivers total protein like fluorescence c300 344 and c 260 315 generally dominated in the rivers while c 260 315 alone dominated in the lakes 42 51 in contrast humic like components c265 440 was lower in mz jz kx and the lakes but were significantly higher in yz and pq asymp sig 0 05 3 3 molecular signature via ft icr ms analysis ft icr ms identified 1328 1909 formulas for five selected riverine sites of the yz mz jz and pq table 3 the weight averaged m z m z wa ranged from 429 to 463 higher than those in tibetan glaciers and lakes 390 413 spencer et al 2014 the weight averaged aimod was also rather high 0 5 0 6 except for 0 3 at pq5 which is close to or higher than values observed for permafrost leachates active layer 0 5 and permafrost layer 0 3 wang et al 2018b the dbe was similarly high with values of 12 16 the weight averaged h c and o c ratios were relatively low compared to rivers at low latitude i e 0 96 1 16 and 0 17 0 38 vs 1 22 and 0 51 chen et al 2016b in contrast n cwa and s cwa were as high as 0 15 and 0 05 in htp rivers respectively heteroatomic formulas were also highly abundant with 58 72 s containing and 61 86 n containing formulas the compound categories of molecular formulas were dominated by condensed aromatics 31 39 out of which 81 99 was dissolved black nitrogen i e dbn followed by polyphenols 15 33 and highly unsaturated compounds with low o c 0 5 18 27 the remaining portions of compound categories were low 2 13 highly unsaturated with o c 0 5 1 12 aliphatics and 3 9 peptides based on van krevelen diagrams fig 3 molecular formulas heavily fall into categories of condensed aromatics polyphenols and highly unsaturated moieties with low o c the dom composition at yz3 was made up of very few aliphatics peptides and highly unsaturated formulas with high o c this suggests that the dom at yz3 was highly degraded given the labile nature of these compounds singer et al 2012 ward and cory 2016 chen et al 2016b the yz3 site is located in the mid stream of the yz river resulting in a longer period of strong solar irradiation at high elevation and also bio degradation is also expected along the way compared to the van krevelen diagram of yz5 most molecular formulas with o c 0 5 and m z 300 were absent downstream at yz3 suggesting high lability of these molecules these observations are consistent with previous findings that molecular formulas with high o c are more bioavailable in dom from the alps glaciers singer et al 2012 meanwhile dom draining permafrost soils with higher o c can also be photo oxidized completely or partially ward and cory 2016 since the permafrost is discontinuous and only occupies a small fraction of the land in the study region 9 permafrost inputs are expected to be limited especially in winter the formulas with one sulfur atom on the right hand side of the van krevelen diagram were also absent for the yz3 dom implying high lability fig s4 these formulas largely fall into the categories of peptides aliphatics and highly unsaturated compounds interestingly s and n containing formulas distribution showed rather clear patterns with condensed aromatics generally contained 1 2 sulfur and 2 or 4 nitrogen atoms the n containing formulas generally contained multiple nitrogen atoms except for mz2 dom which was comprised of substantial formulas containing a single nitrogen 4 discussion 4 1 sources of dom in the rivers and lakes of the himalayan tibetan plateau potential sources of dom in the htp encompass 1 glacier meltwater runoff 2 permafrost and soil leachates 3 vegetation leachate 4 atmospheric deposition 5 groundwater discharge and 6 in situ primary production 1 the inputs from glacier meltwater runoff are obvious considering that the study area is glacier studded there are 10 816 glaciers with a total area of 14 103 km2 in the yz basin alone huang et al 2011 the glaciers serve as a water storage tower for east and south asia providing up to 2 3 of the summer flow in the ganges and 1 2 flow in other major rivers for alpine reaches on the htp qiu 2008 the strong influence of glaciers was suggested by the prominence of the glacier associated protein like component c300 344 fig 2 2 permafrost coverage is 9 3 near sites yz1 and yz2 qu et al 2017 the 14c dated age of doc was positively correlated with the proportion of permafrost soil area suggesting the input of ancient doc into htp rivers at least in summer qu et al 2017 in addition δ13c doc at a site between yz1 and yz2 was 25 3 similar to soil 25 4 qu et al 2017 table 2 3 the vegetation in the study area was dominated by alpine meadow and grassland grassy biomass can generate charcoal with multiple n atoms while woody biomass tends to produce n depleted black carbon upon incomplete combustion knicker 2007 2010 which may explain the findings of four or two n containing molecular formulas for condensed aromatics in this study fig s4 4 wet and dry atmospheric deposition can reach the htp watersheds directly or indirectly for example deposition on the glaciers and lands can also enter the rivers and lakes via glacier melt and precipitation runoff anthropogenic aerosols and precipitation in remote locations on the tibetan plateau contain pre aged dom with doc concentrations up to 1 mg l 1 li et al 2016b 2017 2018 atmospheric mineral dust may also be an important source of dom on htp li et al 2016a yan et al 2016 we observed a positive correlation between doc versus ec and tds r 0 82 p 0 0001 fig s3 although doc concentration usually decreases with ec it is likely that mineral dust inputs simultaneously contributes to dom and ec in addition heavy fog and haze which usually occur in north china especially in winter may also contribute to the dry and wet deposition of dom 5 groundwater in the htp is recharged at a rate of 100 200 mm yr 1 at high elevations and is discharged at a rate of 10 9 10 7 m s 1 in the valleys and fault zones supplying base flow to rivers and springs wu et al 2005 ge et al 2008 since the htp is well known for containing an active tectonic region and the yz river is located in the suture zone of the eurasian and indian plates the discharge of groundwater to the surface waters is expected especially in the dry season which can interrupt permafrost continuity ge et al 2008 6 autochthonous primarily production should be important for lakes and may also be a non negligible input to flowing rivers but very little quantitative information is available it has been reported that firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria bacterioplankton species prevail in the upstream midstream and downstream of the yz river respectively changing with environmental factors such as nutrients elevation velocity and turbidity wang et al 2017 himalayan river waters are very clear and the topography is steep so high in situ primary productivity is not expected however significant autochthonous production may occur in the deeper and stagnant lacustrine waters which is suggested by their much higher doc concentrations and lower aromaticity despite diverse dom sources their relative contributions may vary spatiotemporally for example storm runoff carrying terrestrial and soil dom can be of more importance during the warm monsoon season whereas groundwater discharge should be more influential during the dry season when the water head is relatively low total runoff peaks in august 70 80 mm and is only several mm per month from november to march at yz su et al 2018 since the samples were collected in late november to early december it is expected that the river waters were dominantly fed by melting glaciers and groundwater however quantitative contribution from each source is unclear at this point spatially speaking the specific absorption coefficient a 254 value was generally lower in the smaller mz jz and kx rivers and the three lakes which were also dominated by protein like components c300 344 and c 260 315 the sr and biological index bix were also correlated with these parameters in the score and loading plots of principal component analysis pca fig 4 and fig s2 implying that protein like dom from microbial algal and glacier derived sources dominated these waters by contrast the larger rivers yz and pq were associated with humic like component c265 440 humification index hix absorption coefficients and aromaticity proxy a 254 these correlations suggest primary inputs from plants and permafrost from river basins and groundwater discharges since the latter often contains more humic like fdom than do overlying surface waters chen et al 2010 it seems that the smaller watershed dom is more of glacial endmembers while larger river dom is more influenced by terrestrial humic endmembers and potential groundwater inputs 4 2 extremely low relic doc in tibetan rivers draining the himalayas concentrations of doc ranged from 0 1 to 2 1 mg l 1 with averages of 0 25 0 87 mg l 1 which are much lower than levels in world major rivers at lower latitudes 5 3 2 0 mg l 1 thurman 1985 fig 5 a the lowest concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 were observed in two tributaries yz6 and pq9 while the highest concentration of 2 1 mg l 1 was found at site pq3 the riverine doc concentration is comparable to those observed in glaciers and precipitation but obviously lower than the concentrations observed in the other potential sources this finding may be explained by several scenarios firstly during the sampling time of late november to early december river baseflow is mainly sustained by melt water from large glaciers and presumably from low doc groundwaters the concentrations of doc are also low in proglacial streams 0 3 mg l 1 spencer et al 2014 dilution by groundwater discharge is also possible especially in winter secondly intense in stream processing is expected for tibetan riverine dom which is suggested by the rapid decrease of doc concentrations in streams fed by permafrost leachates i e from 12 mg l 1 to 3 mg l 1 from the upper to the midstream in the htp wang et al 2018a photodegradation is also likely since the sunlight is very strong and days are long at the high altitude of the htp with 3000 h of sunlight per year peng et al 2015 fresh soil and plants derived dom is highly photolabile photochemical oxidation controls carbon processing in arctic rivers and lakes especially for headwaters where there is little prior light exposure 70 95 loss lanzalunga and bietti 2000 cory et al 2014 at site yz3 molecular formulas with high o c 0 6 were absent and formulas had lower o c compared to the upstream site yz5 suggesting strong photo degradation ward and cory 2016 the o cwa was generally low in the rivers from 0 17 to 0 23 but 0 38 at pq5 implying highly degraded dom signature additional evidence of photo degradation is provided by the relatively large proportion of parafac component of c265 440 which has been associated with photo degraded dom chen et al 2010 in addition surface waters are generally unshaded in the study area due to the lack of trees besides the photo degradation of dom significant in stream bio degradation is also expected given inputs of dom from glacier melt especially in the dry winter season when precipitation runoff is low high bioavailability has been observed for tibetan glacier dom with approximately half of the doc respired within one month spencer et al 2014 yan et al 2016 moreover the heteroatom enriched molecular formulas lend support to high bioavailability i e cho formulas only accounted for 8 17 of all formulas the s and n containing formulas tend to be more labile in fluvial networks compared to cho only formulas chen et al 2016b wang et al 2018a the chos and chon formulas respectively account for 5 2 13 6 and 28 0 39 8 of all formulas in major world rivers much lower than the 58 72 and 61 86 of these formulas found in this study wagner et al 2015 despite the bias of ppl resin against proteinaceous materials the proportion of bio labile peptides was 8 9 except for mid stream site yz3 3 the results of fluorescence also suggested abundant protein like dom 58 80 one thing we need to be aware of is the different analytical windows of eems and ft icr ms when we compare the results obtained from different methods fluorescent eems can only capture the signals of fluorescent moieties such as humic acids fulvic acids and aromatic amino acids and peptides the ft icr ms can demonstrate the molecules which are extractable by ppl resin and ionizable during measurement this study strongly suggested that riverine dom is rapidly processed in the htp leading to an extremely low concentration of relic doc that is delivered to the lower river reaches this implies the similarly rapid release of co2 through dom remineralization in headwater rivers which has been observed worldwide butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 4 3 evidences of anthropogenic effects enriched condensed aromatics and high abundance of heteroatomic formulas in the himalayan rivers surprisingly condensed aromatics i e black carbon accounted for approximately 1 3 of the total identified molecular formulas in all samples at four rivers which is much higher than average values in major world rivers 11 jaffé et al 2013 wagner et al 2015 fig 5b and c it is also much higher than the proportion measured in potential sources to these rivers as reported in other work including glaciers snow glacier cryoconite permafrost leachate stream and precipitation see references in fig 5 caption the percentage of condensed aromatics in htp rivers was 2 times higher than reported for permafrost leachate 3 times higher than reported for streams and about one order of magnitude higher than reported for glaciers and precipitation in addition the rather high value of dom aromaticity in the htp rivers that was suggested by high specific absorption coefficient values was in line with the high percentage of condensed aromatics especially in yz and pq 5 1 and 9 5 m2g 1 respectively the massive wet and dry deposition of black soot onto the htp from various origins via both long distance transport from south and east asia and local biomass and yak dung combustion have been a serious threat to the third pole qiu 2008 xu et al 2009 li et al 2016b it is estimated that about half of the black carbon in the aerosols deposited on himalayan glaciers is from biomass combustion li et al 2016b in the internal of the htp the estimated proportion of black carbon from biomass burning further increases to 70 potentially related to the slash and burn agriculture on the expanding cropland and yak dung burning as a main fuel source by local residents wang et al 2018a li et al 2016b the study area is the economical and agricultural center of tibet furthermore in natural environments the black carbon can be functionalized with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on the periphery of the condensed aromatic rings over time leading to the increased solubility of condensed aromatics in aquatic ecosystems with aging hockaday et al 2007 in addition the more labile peptides aliphatics and highly unsaturated formulas with high o c are readily degraded during passage along the rivers however condensed aromatics are relatively biorefractory resulting in the enrichment of dissolved black carbon one noteworthy point is that although black carbon is generally thought to be produced from incomplete combustion of organic matter such as biomass and fossil fuel black carbon like organic matter can also be produced via photochemical processing of dom in the presence of sunlight and iron chen et al 2014 it is unclear at this point if photoproduction has contributed to the pool of black carbon under strong sunlight and oxygen limited conditions in the htp however the characteristics of condensed aromatics i e 81 99 dissolved black nitrogen with multiple nitrogen hinted the domination by grassy biomass combustion as stated above taken together the findings of this work suggest the combined effects of the above mentioned factors greatly enrich the proportion of relic dissolved condensed aromatics in rivers of the htp high abundance of chos and chon formulas 58 72 and 61 86 vs 5 2 13 6 and 28 0 39 8 in major world rivers further suggested effects of human activities enhanced heteroatomic formulas have been linked to anthropogenic activities in world rivers wagner et al 2015 this is also in consistent with high riverine n export in tibetan rivers caused by discharge from agricultural activities and urban areas qu et al 2018 5 conclusion as glaciers retreat and the active layer of the permafrost thickens the release of co2 from the degradation of more and more glacier derived dom and permafrost dom are expected to produce a positive feedback to the climate warming further it is suspected that the organics deposited on tibetan glaciers are mainly anthropogenic in origin the percentage and characteristics of condensed aromatics suggested effects of grassy biomass combustion the greater abundance of heteroatomic molecular formulas has also been linked to anthropogenic inputs in the world s major rivers measures should therefore be taken to mitigate emissions from biomass and fossil fuel combustion in this region and in proximal areas the combination of climate change rapid processing and human disturbance create dom with unique characteristics and dynamics in himalayan rivers with unknown ramifications in downstream environments

nhcl2 hocl ncl3 h2o indeed chloramines are increasingly used as an alternative to conventional chlorination because of their moderate oxidizing power with a standard reduction potential of 1 45 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she rajasekharan et al 2007 these species present lower reactivity with dissolved organic matter hua and reckhow 2007 bougeard et al 2010 which reduces significantly the formation of organochlorinated by products besides chloramines remain active for a considerable length of time within distribution systems lee and westerhoff 2009 with half lives of 2 9 days for drinking water vikesland et al 2001 and 0 4 17 5 for freshwater yamamoto et al 1988 this prolonged disinfection remanence is associated to the slowly spread of hypochlorite from the slow decomposition

nh3 hocl electrochemical generation of chloramines has been barely addressed in literature however their formation as by products during electrochemical oxidation treatment in presence of chloride has been suggested by several authors garcia segura et al 2015 cano et al 2016 de vidales et al 2016 this work aims to describe the release of these disinfectant species during electrochemical processes using bdd anodes since those are considered the most promising materials for water treatment applications thereby several parameters of influence on the generation of chloramines such as ammonia to chloride ratio and ph have been studied furthermore for the first time the generation of each inorganic chloramine has been on line quantified by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy dems in different water matrices 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals urea nh4cl and the components of the urine synthetic matrix of analytical grade were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium perchlorate monohydrate 99 purity and nacl 99 purity were used as supporting electrolytes and were purchased from fluka analytical sodium hydroxide hydrochloric and perchloric acids of analytical grade supplied by sigma aldrich were used to adjust the solution ph all solutions were prepared with millipore milliq high purity water of resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c schwalbach germany solutions were degassed with highly pure argon 99 999 2 2 synthetic urine matrix synthetic urine solution was prepared with 6 8 mm cacl2 2h2o 51 3 mm nacl 14 2 mm na2so4 7 3 mm kh2po4 26 8 mm kcl 18 7 mm nh4cl and 0 42 m urea as representative concentrations of natural urine this solution contained a highly dissolved organic carbon of about 5000 mg l 1 and an overall content of chloride ion of 0 091 m ca 0 1 m at ph 4 9 which was adjusted with naoh to natural conditions of 7 0 as representative ph of real urine antonin et al 2015 dbira et al 2015 a second experiment was conducted with the same composition described above but increasing concentration of chloride up to 0 5 m by addition of nacl 2 3 electrolytic system electrolysis was conducted in a dual thin layer flow cell as described elsewhere abd el latif et al 2015 garcia segura et al 2017 briefly the solution flows through six small capillaries channels to the thin layer compartment containing the bdd working electrode the ag agcl reference electrode was placed at the thin layer flow cell inlet whereas pt wires were used as counter electrodes in order to diminish the ir drop resistance and to optimize the current distribution in the dual thin layer cell two pt wire electrodes were placed at the inlet and outlet of the cell and connected via a resistance of 1100 ω and 100 ω respectively baltruschat 2004 kapalka et al 2008 kisacik et al 2013 the geometric surface area of the bdd electrode was defined by a thin teflon spacer gore tex with an inner diameter of 6 mm and thus it is ca 0 28 cm2 on the other hand the volume in the cell was defined by the thickness of 200 μm of this teflon spacer voltammetric analyses were conducted at 25 c with a home built potentiostat and function generator and the data were collected using a labview software national instruments gmbh at scan rate of 10 mv s 1 from 0 up to 3 0 v vs ag agcl the solutions were purged with high purity argon gas for 30 min and the argon saturation is maintained during the experimental runs thus the volatile species electrogenerated during the voltammetric studies diffused from the aqueous solution through a porous teflon membrane to the vacuum inlet of the mass spectrometer balzers quadrupole qmg 422 baltruschat 2004 stefanova et al 2013 even though several analytical methodologies such as colorimetry or high performance liquid chromatography have been applied to quantify combined chlorine mass spectroscopy presents a higher sensitivity and allows discerning between the different chloramines kinani et al 2012 thereby dems allowed the on line quantification of the release of chloramines during electrochemical oxidation of different solutions the flow rate of the solutions was adjusted to 5 μl s 1 using a peristaltic pump perimax spectec and the ph was adjusted and measured by using a knick 766 calimatic ph meter carbon dioxide calibration was conducted as follows after adsorbing co at a constant potential of 0 06 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she at polycrystalline pt electrode by replacing the supporting electrolyte 0 5 m h2so4 with co saturated electrolyte ca 10 3 m the solution was exchanged with pure electrolyte under potential control to remove excess of co afterwards the faradaic current was simultaneously recorded with the ion current of m z 44 co2 during the positive stripping experiment both faradaic charge q f t o t a l and the ionic charge for the formation of co2 q i c o 2 were used to calculate the calibration constant k c o 2 as follows 9 k c o 2 z q i c o 2 0 8 q f t o t a l where z is the number of electron transferred during the oxidation of co molecule to co2 2 mol e mol co the total faradaic charge was corrected by a factor of 0 8 due to double layer charging corresponding to 20 of non faradaic remaining charges assigned to the adsorption of anions such as sulfate bisulfate hydroxide etc at the pt electrode clavilier et al 1992 baltruschat and schmiemann 1993 this calculation is conducted assuming that the charge integration of the ionic current m z 44 corresponds to the charge of the faradaic current of m z 44 since the electrochemical oxidation of adsorbed co is the only reaction at this applied potential on pt oxygen calibration was done at bdd electrode using 0 5 m naclo4 solution which was adjusted to the same ph and flow rate of the test experiments in order to achieve the same experimental conditions mostafa et al 2018 stefanova et al 2013 in this experiment no other reactions than o2 evolution from water by oh is expected with a current efficiency of 100 reaction 1 the calculated oxygen calibration constants were similar at different ph the calibration constant k o2 gives the ratio between the mass spectrometric detected signal for m z 32 ion current for o2 and the corresponding faradaic current for produced o2 molecules according to equation 10 10 k o 2 z q 32 q f where q 32 is the ionic charge for m z 32 q f is the corresponding faradaic charge during oxygen evolution in cyclic voltammetry experiment and z is the number of electrons transferred in this case z 4 the calibration constants for different chloramines and chlorine volatile species cannot be determined experimentally however by considering the corresponding fragmentation patterns the relative ionization probabilities ip as well as the relative intensities of the main peaks r these constants can be roughly estimated from the calibration constant of o2 baltruschat 2004 mostafa et al 2018 molecules with similar molar volumes should have in principle equivalent mass spectrometric ionization probabilities for example cl2 and so2 molecules have ca 204 and 203 å3 molar volumes respectively lide 1999 and therefore relative to n2 the cl2 molecule should have a very similar ip to that of so2 the tabulated relative ip value for so2 is ca 2 1 whereas that for o2 is ca 1 0 for 100 ev electrode energy balzers instruments 1998 however a large contribution of a signal on mass 36 and 38 h35cl and h37cl with ionization probability of 1 6 is found due to the surface catalyzed dissociation of cl2 at the walls of the vacuum system that leads to an effective decrease in cl2 calibration constant and increase of the current efficiency for cl2 of a factor of 3 as previously reported herein mostafa et al 2018 11 k c l 2 k o 2 i p c l 2 i p o 2 r c l 2 r o 2 similar to cl2 the calibration constants for each chloramine species can be estimated from that of o2 assuming a very close molecular volume of nh2cl ca 73 å3 and ch3oh 72 å3 ip 1 8 nhcl2 ca 100 å3 and ch2cl2 ca 113 å3 ip 3 7 and ncl3 ca 116 å3 and chcl3 ca 130 å3 ip 4 8 balzers instruments 1998 thus 12 k x k o 2 i p x i p o 2 r x r o 2 the current efficiency ce was calculated according to equation 13 abd el latif et al 2015 13 c e q f q f where q f is the total faradaic charge and q f is the partial faradaic charge corresponding to the formation of the i volatile species considered which can be determined from equation 14 14 q f z q i k i where z is the number of electrons involved in the generation of each i volatile species q i is the ionic charge of the i volatile species and k i is the calibration constant for each species 3 results and discussion 3 1 release of chloramines during electrochlorination of ammonia containing solutions the conventional cyclic voltammogram cv at 10 mv s 1 from 0 up to 3 0 v and the mass spectrometric cyclic voltammograms mscv for the volatile species of interest o2 m z 32 cl2 m z 70 nh2cl m z 51 nhcl2 m z 85 and ncl3 m z 119 were simultaneously recorded during the electrochemical analysis by means of dems two blank assays were carried out to ascertain the correlation between chlorine and the release of chloramines it can be observed from fig 1 that when a solution containing 0 1 m of nh3 nh4 at ph 8 0 is electrolyzed in 0 5 m naclo4 neither chloramines nor active chlorine species are generated only o2 evolution is observed c e o 2 100 the electrolysis of 0 5 m cl solution yields cl2 hclo clo cl2o and clo2 as chlorine active species as reported by mostafa et al 2018 and murata et al 2008 respectively the suppression of oxygen evolution signal c e o 2 30 0 observed in fig 1 demonstrates the competitive generation of chlorine species note that bdd could oxidize chloride yielding chlorine radical cl at high potentials e 2 43 v vs she by reaction 15 armstrong et al 2013 abdirisak et al 2011 then the formed cl can dimerize yielding cl2 by reaction 16 bader and ogryzlo 1964 the electrochemical generation of cl not only competes with oxygen evolution but also can react with o2 yielding clo2 according to reaction 17 as experimentally demonstrated atkinson et al 1992 mostafa et al 2018 formation of chloramine species is not observed under these experimental conditions due to the absence of any nitrogen source such as nh4 15 cl cl e 16 cl cl cl2 17 cl o2 clo2 when a solution containing 0 1 m of nh4 and 0 5 m of cl is analyzed the formation of chloramines is obvious noteworthy are the complete suppression of oxygen signal and the lower ionic current density of chlorine evolution c e o 2 4 0 the mitigation of the signal of cl2 is related to the consumption of this electrogenerated species by means of reactions 5 7 yielding chloramines by an electrochemical chemical mechanism formed cl may also react with nh3 in solution yielding chloramines 18 18 2 cl nh3 nh2cl h cl several variables could affect the overall release of chloramines and their distribution the ratio between cl2 and nh4 nh3 species is one of the most relevant parameters on the generation of chloramines by chlorination by increasing the concentration of cl2 the combined chlorine concentration increases however the addition of cl2 beyond a molar ratio of 1 0 induces the decrease of chloramines up to a minimum point so called break point minimum residual of chloramines as depicted in fig 2 crittenden et al 2012 garcia segura et al 2018b this decrease is associated to the overall oxidation of the chloramine species to nitrogen gas or nitrate by means of reactions 19 and 20 respectively it should be highlighted that since n2 is the main product chlorination process has been used in water treatment to minimize ammonia contents in water saunier and selleck 1979 zhang et al 2015 garcia segura et al 2018b 19 3 hocl 2 nh3 n2 3 h2o 3 hcl 20 4 hocl nh3 h no3 h2o 4 hcl experimental results demonstrate a similar behavior during electrochlorination although the formation of chloramines was observed to be dependent on the chloride concentration in solution and the applied potential this dependence can be explained by the relationship of these variables with the efficient electrogeneration of active chlorine species as discussed above murata et al 2008 mostafa et al 2018 fig 3 depicts the cv and mscv conducting during the dems analysis in solutions of different concentration of cl ion ranging from 0 1 m up to 0 5 m as can be seen an increase in the chloride concentration induces an increase in the ionic current densities of chloramines which demonstrates a major formation of combined chlorine the predominant species observed in all case scenarios are monochloramines which are also the predominant species identified during conventional chlorination process due to its major stability lee and westerhoff 2009 whereas dichloramine and trichloramine are also released maybe due to the high concentration of chlorine active species near to the electrode surface noteworthy is the major increase of trichloramine signal at 0 5 m cl which becomes superior in a 2 5 fold in comparison to the precursor species dichloramine as stated formerly the ph affects the overall distribution of combined chlorine species according to their thermodynamic stabilities from fig 4 it can be deduced that monochloramine is the predominant species within the ph range 7 5 9 0 and thus the predominant disinfection species in water streams and water distribution systems an acidic ph in contrast stabilizes dichloramine species between ph 4 0 up to 6 0 and trichloramine below ph 4 0 crittenden et al 2012 kinani et al 2012 in fig 5 the influence of the ph on the ionic current densities of mono di and trichloramine during electrochlorination of 0 1 m nh4 solutions containing 0 5 m of cl anion is depicted the ph range between 6 and 10 has been considered in this study because of two major reasons i the water ph in distribution systems is usually between ph values of 6 5 and 8 ii monochloramine is the combined chlorine species that presents major disinfection activity and according to fig 4 this is the most suitable range for its generation it should be highlighted that both dichloramine and trichloramine are detected even at such high solution ph these experimental results suggest that both species can be formed close to the electrode surface where they are stabilized by the highly acidic ph due to the competitive reaction of hydroxyl radical electrogeneration 1 and the oxygen evolution reaction 21 this trend has not been observed for conventional chemical chlorination reactions and seems to be unique for the electrochemically driven process 21 2 h2o o2 4 h 4 e on the other hand it is important to remark the noticeable attenuation of the ionic currents at high alkaline ph mostafa et al 2018 demonstrated that chlorine volatile species evolution is attenuated and even completely avoided at highly alkaline ph this trend can be also observed in fig 5 where the onset potentials recorded by the cv denote much lower onset potential of o2 evolution ca 1 v vs ag agcl during electrolysis of alkaline electrolytes at bdd the onset potential of o2 evolution precedes the thermodynamic standard reduction potential of the oh g oh aq of ca 1 98 v vs she koppenol et al 2010 thus oh radicals are rather not to be electrogenerated in such conditions according to several authors martínez huitle et al 2008 enache et al 2009 mostafa et al 2018 in agreement with the results of fig 5 chloramines are hardly formed at high alkaline ph due to the absence of chlorine which is neither electrogenerated directly by charge transfer nor indirectly by oh radepont et al 2015 mostafa et al 2018 an important remark is that o2 evolution measured in these experiments becomes more relevant at alkaline ph with increasing c e o 2 of 2 0 4 0 16 0 and 50 0 at ph 6 8 9 and 10 respectively as shown in table 1 this competing reaction has a dramatic effect on the ce of cl2 and consequently affects chloramines generation and accumulation cf table 1 it can be concluded that electrogeneration of chloramines is highly sensitive to ph conditions becoming inhibited at high alkaline conditions due to the oxygen evolution potential shift 3 2 electrogeneration of chloramines from urea urea is one of the main components in urine even though the chlorination of organic amino compounds can lead to the formation of organic chloramines lee and westerhoff 2009 zhang et al 2016 heeb et al 2017 the release of inorganic chloramines is the focus of this study to assess the formation of disinfectant inorganic chloramines from the treatment of urine and manures as alternative low cost resource even though urea chloramines cannot be identified by dems analysis since these species are not volatile the quantification of inorganic chloramines contributes to better understand the fundamental electrochemical chlorination processes the electrochemical incineration of urea could lead to the release of nitrate according to overall reaction 22 which allows the release of inorganic chloramines according to reactions 5 7 even though the formation of organic chloramines from urea reaction with active chlorine species is also feasible following general expressions 23 26 wojtowicz 2001 22 h2nconh2 4 h2o co2 2 no3 12 h 10 e 23 h2nconh2 hocl h2nconhcl h2o 24 h2nconhcl hocl clhnconhcl h2o 25 clhnconhcl hocl clhnconcl2 h2o 26 clhnconcl2 hocl cl2nconcl2 h2o de laat et al 2011 reported the release of nitrate from the reaction of urea in swimming pool with chlorine according to general expression 27 27 h2nconh2 8 hocl co2 2 hno3 8 hcl h2o the release of chloramine species was not ascertained by de laat et al 2011 but it was not excluded the authors pointed out that more studies to identify chloro ureas and inorganic chloramines were required to better understand the complex reaction pathways in order to elucidate the contribution of urea to the formation of disinfectant chloramines during the treatment of swimming pool water in this context the dems analysis during electrochlorination of urea solutions can contribute to the clarification of the role of urea in disinfection processes fig 6 depicts the mscv corresponding to the electrochemical incineration of urea in 0 5 m sodium perchlorate where the ionic current of m z 44 evidences the contribution of oh radical in the mineralization of urea at high potentials with a higher current density observed in comparison to other conditions due to the inert character of perchlorate as supporting electrolyte the electrogeneration of active chlorine species is avoided as discussed above when chloride is used as supporting electrolyte several differences are noticeable as can be seen in fig 6 the ionic current of m z 44 co2 is lower than that found for naclo4 an important feature is the drastic diminution of cl2 signal in presence of urea which indicates that cl2 is preferentially consumed for urea oxidation these results suggest that in presence of nacl as supporting electrolyte electrochlorination of urea is the preferred mechanism over electrochemical incineration mediated by oh radical 22 noteworthy is the identification of mono di and trichloramines from this result it can be deduced that the overall reaction 27 proposed by de laat et al 2011 is preceded by the formation of inorganic chloramines according reactions 28 30 where the release of di and trichloramine is favored subsequently the decomposition of these species may yield nitrogen and nitrate according to reactions 19 and 20 saunier and selleck 1979 crittenden et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 in agreement with the results reported by de laat et al 2011 28 h2nconh2 2 cl h2o co2 2 nh2cl 2 h 4 e 29 h2nconh2 4 cl h2o co2 2 nhcl2 4 h 8 e 30 h2nconh2 6 cl h2o co2 2 ncl3 6 h 12 e formation of inorganic chloramines from urea electrochlorination is for the very first time demonstrated by in situ dems measurements the identification of these species provides a key piece of understanding on mechanisms of urea oxidation by chlorine in order to better understand the electrogeneration of inorganic chloramines from urea the influence of different variables was systematically studied fig 7 depicts the mscv recorded during the electrolysis of 0 1 m urea at ph 7 0 in presence of different concentrations of nacl as supporting electrolyte as can be seen the increase in nacl concentration enhances considerably the release of chloramines as observed for nh4 nh3 solutions the results of fig 8 depict a depletion of the current density attained by the ionic current of m z 70 cl2 for increasing concentrations of urea in solution along with lower currents associated to chloramine species this trend suggests that the increased concentration of organic matter leads principally to intermediate states of chloro urea species from chlorination according reactions 23 26 before reaching the breakage of the c n bond yielding chloramines by means of reactions 28 30 furthermore these results demonstrate that the increase of urea concentration mitigates electrogeneration of inorganic chloramines being the ratio urea cl of great relevance on the overall efficiency of the process on the other hand the study of the influence of the ph denotes a completely different response than during the electrochlorination of ammonium chloride described in the previous section the ph during electrochlorination is of high relevance since conditions of the speciation of the chloramines see fig 4 and their formation are conditioned by the equilibria of nh3 nh4 pka 9 25 and hclo clo pka 7 55 however almost no effect of the ph is observed on the release of inorganic chloramines from urea as shown in fig 9 this different behavior can be explained by the different pathway involved on the formation of such species as discussed formerly the inorganic chloramines are formed from the cleavage of the c n bond of the urea after several chlorination steps 23 30 which only depend on the generation of active chlorine species it may be inferred from mscv analyses that previous electrochemical oxidation of urea by hydroxyl radical to release of ammonium followed by its electrochlorination cannot be considering the predominant pathway according to experimental evidence chloramine formation from yielded ammonium should be excluded the small effect of ph suggests that the oxidation of the urea is produced mainly by the electrogenerated cl2 which is independent of the ph the slight effect of ph can be attributed to hclo and clo when the electrolysis was conducted at ph 7 0 a slightly superior ion current density of m z 44 co2 is observed it should be remarked that at ph 7 0 hclo is the predominant species pka 7 55 whereas under other ph conditions clo is considered hence at ph 7 0 the urea can be easily oxidized by hclo due to the superior redox potential of this species eº 1 49 v vs she in comparison to the lesser oxidant character of clo eº 0 89 v vs she the lower response at ph 10 0 was explained by the easier oxidation of hydroxyl anions on the bdd surface oxygen evolution which occurs at lower potential competing with the oxidation of chloride anions martínez huitle et al 2008 koppenol et al 2010 mostafa et al 2018 3 3 matrix effects during the treatment of urine matrix and influence on the current efficiency thereafter the feasible demonstration of the electrochemical formation of inorganic chloramines from urea and the release of chloramines were studied during the electrolysis of a synthetic urine matrix antonin et al 2015 dbira et al 2015 it can be seen in fig 10 that the release of inorganic chloramines cannot be attained by the direct electrolysis of urine matrix the high content of urea consumes the electrogenerated chlorine releasing probably chloro urea species according to reactions 23 26 mscv depicts similar trends as those observed during the treatment of urea solution in 0 1 m of chloride see figs 7 and 8 in order to promote the cleavage of the n c bond the concentration of chloride was increased up to 0 5 m by the addition of nacl the increase of chloride anion in the urine matrix enhanced urea incineration cf fig 10 nevertheless lower amount of chloramines were yielded in comparison to urea solutions note that the mscv signal corresponded ca to half concentration which can be attributed to the competing consumption of electrons and hydroxyl radical by the other ionic species present in solution therefore the oxidation of sulfate to peroxodisulfate 31 or the oxidation of phosphate to peroxodiphosphate 32 can be considered panizza and cerisola 2009 sánchez et al 2013 as competing reactions 31 2 so4 2 s2o8 2 2 e 32 2 po4 3 p2o8 4 2 e the mscv results evidence the formation and release of chloramines during electrochemical oxidation on bdd anodes for the first time the electrogeneration of each individual chloramine species has been identified in situ the overall current efficiencies on their release were quantified from the experimental data and summarized in table 2 for the optimum conditions observed the efficiency of chloramines formation decreases as a function of the matrix as follows nh4cl urea synthetic urine matrix with ce values of 4 0 0 9 and 0 5 respectively for monochloramine the minor ce determined for cl2 in presence of urea reflects the major consumption of cl2 required to mineralize urea in solution therefore lower amounts of cl2 are quantified in the system another interesting feature is the considerable diminution in 2 fold of ce on co2 evolution from urea oxidation when the electrolysis is conducted in the simulated urine matrix from 19 0 down to 9 0 the scavenging effects of competing ionic species in the matrices play a fundamental role on the electrogeneration of these species therefore the generation of these disinfectant species in urine manures and brine was demonstrated to be of low relevance in this context the electrogeneration and contribution of chloramines in electrochemical oxidation should be considered of minor relevance in presence of organics that consume preferentially the chlorine active species undermining the yield of disinfectants 4 conclusions the formation of inorganic chloramines during electrochemical oxidation with bdd anodes has been assessed by on line dems analysis the efficient release of these highly disinfectant species is directly related to the initial nitrogen source being the yield of inorganic chloramines favored from the chlorination of ammonia the lower release of chloramines from urea is explained by the requirement of the previous chlorination of the molecule to propitiate the c n bond breakage since it has been demonstrated that chlorination mechanism is preferred to the oxidation mediated by oh radical the initial concentration of chloride and the solution ph were evaluated as key role parameters of influence on the release of chloramines in both cases electrochlorination of ammonia and urea solutions a marked increase on the indirect electrogeneration of chloramines associated to the major release of chlorine has been observed on the other hand the solution ph influenced the formation of chloramines from ammonia which indicates that the presence of nh3 in solution is required moreover an excessive alkaline ph demonstrated to be counterproductive due to the shift on oxygen evolution potential that inhibits the electrogeneration of the required active chlorine species on the other hand while urea is oxidized in a synthetic urine matrix it has been demonstrated that under natural conditions chloramines are not formed during the electrochemical oxidation processes because i the low concentrations of chloride and ii the competitive reactions of other ionic species in solution however a considerable increase on chloride concentration up to 0 5 m allows the release of inorganic chloramines due to the incineration of urea by electrogenerated active chlorine species these results contribute to the better understanding on the contribution of urea on the generation of inorganic chloramine as disinfectant species in waters and swimming pools it is important to remark that from the results observed the electrogeneration of chloramines in actual matrices with competitive species in solution could be of low relevance with current efficiencies below 0 5 conflicts of interest authors declare no conflict of interest declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

standard hydrogen electrode she rajasekharan et al 2007 these species present lower reactivity with dissolved organic matter hua and reckhow 2007 bougeard et al 2010 which reduces significantly the formation of organochlorinated by products besides chloramines remain active for a considerable length of time within distribution systems lee and westerhoff 2009 with half lives of 2 9 days for drinking water vikesland et al 2001 and 0 4 17 5 for freshwater yamamoto et al 1988 this prolonged disinfection remanence is associated to the slowly spread of hypochlorite from the slow decomposition of chloramines in water 8 isaac and morris 1983 which is of high interest as secondary disinfection for waters intended for human consumption neden et al 1992 sedlak and von gunten 2011 8 nh2cl h2o nh3 hocl electrochemical generation of chloramines has been barely addressed in literature however their formation as by products during electrochemical oxidation treatment in presence of chloride has been suggested by several authors garcia segura et al 2015 cano et al 2016 de vidales et al 2016 this work aims to describe the release of these disinfectant species during electrochemical processes using bdd anodes since those are considered the most promising materials for water treatment applications thereby several parameters of influence on the generation of chloramines such as ammonia to chloride ratio and ph have been studied furthermore for the first time the generation of each inorganic chloramine has been on line quantified by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy dems in different water matrices 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals urea nh4cl and the components of the urine synthetic matrix of analytical grade were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium perchlorate monohydrate

aldrich were used to adjust the solution ph all solutions were prepared with millipore milliq high purity water of resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c schwalbach germany solutions were degassed with highly pure argon 99 999 2 2 synthetic urine matrix synthetic urine solution was prepared with 6 8 mm cacl2 2h2o 51 3 mm nacl 14 2 mm na2so4 7 3 mm kh2po4 26 8 mm kcl 18 7 mm nh4cl and 0 42 m urea as representative concentrations of natural urine this solution contained a highly dissolved organic carbon of about 5000 mg l 1 and an overall content of chloride ion of 0 091 m ca 0 1 m at ph 4 9 which was adjusted with naoh to natural conditions of 7 0 as representative ph of real urine antonin et al 2015 dbira et al 2015 a second experiment was conducted with the same composition described above but increasing concentration of chloride up to 0 5 m by addition of nacl 2 3 electrolytic system electrolysis was conducted in a dual thin layer flow cell as described elsewhere abd el latif et al 2015 garcia segura et al 2017 briefly the solution flows through six small capillaries channels to the thin layer compartment containing the bdd working electrode the ag agcl reference electrode was placed at the thin layer flow cell inlet whereas pt wires were used as counter electrodes in order to diminish the ir drop resistance and to optimize the current distribution in the dual thin layer cell two pt wire electrodes were placed at the inlet and outlet of the cell and connected via a resistance of 1100 ω and 100 ω respectively baltruschat 2004 kapalka et al 2008 kisacik et al 2013 the geometric surface area of the bdd electrode was defined by a thin teflon spacer gore tex with an inner diameter of 6 mm and thus it is ca 0 28 cm2 on the other hand the volume in the cell was defined by the thickness of 200 μm of this teflon spacer voltammetric analyses were conducted at 25 c with a home built potentiostat and function generator and the data were collected using a labview software national instruments gmbh at scan rate of 10 mv s 1 from 0 up to 3 0 v vs ag agcl the solutions were purged with high purity argon gas for 30 min and the argon saturation is maintained during the experimental runs thus the volatile species electrogenerated during the voltammetric studies diffused from the aqueous solution through a porous teflon membrane to the vacuum inlet of the mass spectrometer balzers quadrupole qmg 422 baltruschat 2004 stefanova et al 2013 even though several analytical methodologies such as colorimetry or high performance liquid chromatography have been applied to quantify combined chlorine mass spectroscopy presents a higher sensitivity and allows discerning between the different chloramines kinani et al 2012 thereby dems allowed the on line quantification of the release of chloramines during electrochemical oxidation of different solutions the flow rate of the solutions was adjusted to 5 μl s 1 using a peristaltic pump perimax spectec and the ph was adjusted and measured by using a knick 766 calimatic ph meter carbon dioxide calibration was conducted as follows after adsorbing co at a constant potential of 0 06 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she at polycrystalline pt electrode by replacing the supporting electrolyte 0 5 m h2so4 with co saturated electrolyte ca 10 3 m the solution was exchanged with pure electrolyte under potential control to remove excess of co afterwards the faradaic current was simultaneously recorded with the ion current of m z 44 co2 during the positive stripping experiment both faradaic charge q f t o t a l and the ionic charge for the formation of co2 q i c o 2 were used to calculate the calibration constant k c o 2 as follows 9 k c o 2 z q i c o 2 0 8 q f t o t a l where z is the number of electron transferred during the oxidation of co molecule to co2 2 mol e mol co the total faradaic charge was corrected by a factor of 0 8 due to double layer charging corresponding to 20 of non faradaic remaining charges assigned to the adsorption of anions such as sulfate bisulfate hydroxide etc at the pt electrode clavilier et al 1992 baltruschat and schmiemann 1993 this calculation is conducted assuming that the charge integration of the ionic current m z 44 corresponds to the charge of the faradaic current of m z 44 since the electrochemical oxidation of adsorbed co is the only reaction at this applied potential on pt oxygen calibration was done at bdd electrode using 0 5 m naclo4 solution which was adjusted to the same ph and flow rate of the test experiments in order to achieve the same experimental conditions mostafa et al 2018 stefanova et al 2013 in this experiment no other reactions than o2 evolution from water by oh is expected with a current efficiency of 100 reaction 1 the calculated oxygen calibration constants were similar at different ph the calibration constant k o2 gives the ratio between the mass spectrometric detected signal for m z 32 ion current for o2 and the corresponding faradaic current for produced o2 molecules according to equation 10 10 k o 2 z q 32 q f where q 32 is the ionic charge for m z 32 q f is the corresponding faradaic charge during oxygen evolution in cyclic voltammetry experiment and z is the number of electrons transferred in this case z 4 the calibration constants for different chloramines and chlorine volatile species cannot be determined experimentally however by considering the corresponding fragmentation patterns the relative ionization probabilities ip as well as the relative intensities of the main peaks r these constants can be roughly estimated from the calibration constant of o2 baltruschat 2004 mostafa et al 2018 molecules with similar molar volumes should have in principle equivalent mass spectrometric ionization probabilities for example cl2 and so2 molecules have ca 204 and 203 å3 molar volumes respectively lide 1999 and therefore relative to n2 the cl2 molecule should have a very similar ip to that of so2 the tabulated relative ip value for so2 is ca 2 1 whereas that for o2 is ca 1 0 for 100 ev electrode energy balzers instruments 1998 however a large contribution of a signal on mass 36 and 38 h35cl and h37cl with ionization probability of 1 6 is found due to the surface catalyzed dissociation of cl2 at the walls of the vacuum system that leads to an effective decrease in cl2 calibration constant and increase of the current efficiency for cl2 of a factor of 3 as previously reported herein mostafa et al 2018 11 k c l 2 k o 2 i p c l 2 i p o 2 r c l 2 r o 2 similar to cl2 the calibration constants for each chloramine species can be estimated from that of o2 assuming a very close molecular volume of nh2cl ca 73 å3 and ch3oh 72 å3 ip 1 8 nhcl2 ca 100 å3 and ch2cl2 ca

determined from equation 14 14 q f z q i k i where z is the number of electrons involved in the generation of each i volatile species q i is the ionic charge of the i volatile species and k i is the calibration constant for each species 3 results and discussion 3 1 release of chloramines during electrochlorination of ammonia containing solutions the conventional cyclic voltammogram cv at 10 mv s 1 from 0 up to 3 0 v and the mass spectrometric cyclic voltammograms mscv for the volatile species of interest o2 m z 32 cl2 m z 70 nh2cl m z 51 nhcl2 m z 85 and ncl3 m z 119 were simultaneously recorded during the electrochemical analysis by means of dems two blank assays were carried out to ascertain the correlation between chlorine and the release of chloramines it can be observed from fig 1 that when a solution containing 0 1 m of nh3 nh4 at ph 8 0 is electrolyzed in 0 5 m naclo4 neither chloramines nor active chlorine species are generated only o2 evolution is observed c e o 2 100 the electrolysis of 0 5 m cl solution yields cl2 hclo clo cl2o and clo2 as chlorine active species as reported by mostafa et al 2018 and murata et al 2008 respectively the suppression of oxygen evolution signal c e o 2 30 0 observed in fig 1 demonstrates the competitive generation of chlorine species note that bdd could oxidize chloride yielding chlorine radical cl at high potentials e 2 43 v vs she by reaction 15 armstrong et al 2013 abdirisak et al 2011 then the formed cl can dimerize yielding cl2 by reaction 16 bader and ogryzlo 1964 the electrochemical generation of cl not only competes with oxygen evolution but also can react with o2 yielding clo2 according to reaction 17 as experimentally demonstrated atkinson et al 1992 mostafa et al 2018 formation of chloramine species is not observed under these experimental conditions due to the absence of any nitrogen source such as nh4 15 cl cl e 16 cl cl cl2 17 cl o2 clo2 when a solution containing 0 1 m of nh4 and 0 5 m of cl is analyzed the formation of chloramines is obvious noteworthy are the complete suppression of oxygen signal and the lower ionic current density of chlorine evolution c e o 2 4 0 the mitigation of the signal of cl2 is related to the consumption of this electrogenerated species by means of reactions 5 7 yielding chloramines by an electrochemical chemical mechanism formed cl may also react with nh3 in solution yielding chloramines 18 18 2 cl nh3 nh2cl h cl several variables could affect the overall release of chloramines and their distribution the ratio between cl2 and nh4 nh3 species is one of the most relevant parameters on the generation of chloramines by chlorination by increasing the concentration of cl2 the combined chlorine concentration increases however the addition of cl2 beyond a molar ratio of 1 0 induces the decrease of chloramines up to a minimum point so called break point minimum residual of chloramines as depicted in fig 2 crittenden et al 2012 garcia segura et al 2018b this decrease is associated to the overall oxidation of the chloramine species to nitrogen gas or nitrate by means of reactions 19 and 20 respectively it should be highlighted that since n2 is the main product chlorination process has been used in water treatment to minimize ammonia contents in water saunier and selleck 1979 zhang et al 2015 garcia segura et al 2018b 19 3 hocl 2 nh3 n2 3 h2o 3 hcl 20 4 hocl nh3 h no3 h2o 4 hcl experimental results demonstrate a similar behavior during electrochlorination although the formation of chloramines was observed to be dependent on the chloride concentration in solution and the applied potential this dependence can be explained by the relationship of these variables with the efficient electrogeneration of active chlorine species as discussed above murata et al 2008 mostafa et al 2018 fig 3 depicts the cv and mscv conducting during the dems analysis in solutions of different concentration of cl ion ranging from 0 1 m up to 0 5 m as can be seen an increase in the chloride concentration induces an increase in the ionic current densities of chloramines which demonstrates a major formation of combined chlorine the predominant species observed in all case scenarios are monochloramines which are also the predominant species identified during conventional chlorination process due to its major stability lee and westerhoff 2009 whereas dichloramine and trichloramine are also released maybe due to the high concentration of chlorine active species near to the electrode surface noteworthy is the major increase of trichloramine signal at 0 5 m cl which becomes superior in a 2 5 fold in comparison to the precursor species dichloramine as stated formerly the ph affects the overall distribution of combined chlorine species according to their thermodynamic stabilities from fig 4 it can be deduced that monochloramine is the predominant species within the ph range 7 5 9 0 and thus the predominant disinfection species in water streams and water distribution systems an acidic ph in contrast stabilizes dichloramine species between ph 4 0 up to 6 0 and trichloramine below ph 4 0 crittenden et al 2012 kinani et al 2012 in fig 5 the influence of the ph on the ionic current densities of mono di and trichloramine during electrochlorination of 0 1 m nh4 solutions containing 0 5 m of cl anion is depicted the ph range between 6 and 10 has been considered in this study because of two major reasons i the water ph in distribution systems is usually between ph values of 6 5 and 8 ii monochloramine is the combined chlorine species that presents major disinfection activity and according to fig 4 this is the most suitable range for its generation it should be highlighted that both dichloramine and trichloramine are detected even at such high solution ph these experimental results suggest that both species can be formed close to the electrode surface where they are stabilized by the highly acidic ph due to the competitive reaction of hydroxyl radical electrogeneration 1 and the oxygen evolution reaction 21 this trend has not been observed for conventional chemical chlorination reactions and seems to be unique for the electrochemically driven process 21 2 h2o o2 4 h 4 e on the other hand it is important to remark the noticeable attenuation of the ionic currents at high alkaline ph mostafa et al 2018 demonstrated that chlorine volatile species evolution is attenuated and even completely avoided at highly alkaline ph this trend can be also observed in fig 5 where the onset potentials recorded by the cv denote much lower onset potential of o2 evolution ca 1 v vs ag agcl during electrolysis of alkaline electrolytes at bdd the onset potential of o2 evolution precedes the thermodynamic standard reduction potential of the oh g oh aq of ca 1 98 v vs she koppenol et al 2010 thus oh radicals are rather not to be electrogenerated in such conditions according to several authors martínez huitle et al 2008 enache et al 2009 mostafa et al 2018 in agreement with the results of fig 5 chloramines are hardly formed at high alkaline ph due to the absence of chlorine which is neither electrogenerated directly by charge transfer nor indirectly by oh radepont et al 2015 mostafa et al 2018 an important remark is that o2 evolution measured in these experiments becomes more relevant at alkaline ph with increasing c e o 2 of 2 0 4 0 16 0 and 50 0 at ph 6 8 9 and 10 respectively as shown in table 1 this competing reaction has a dramatic effect on the ce of cl2 and consequently affects chloramines generation and accumulation cf table 1 it can be concluded that electrogeneration of chloramines is highly sensitive to ph conditions becoming inhibited at high alkaline conditions due to the oxygen evolution potential shift 3 2 electrogeneration of chloramines from urea urea is one of the main components in urine even though the chlorination of organic amino compounds can lead to the formation of organic chloramines lee and westerhoff 2009 zhang et al 2016 heeb et al 2017 the release of inorganic chloramines is the focus of this study to assess the formation of disinfectant inorganic chloramines from the treatment of urine and manures as alternative low cost resource even though urea chloramines cannot be identified by dems analysis since these species are not volatile the quantification of inorganic chloramines contributes to better understand the fundamental electrochemical chlorination processes the electrochemical incineration of urea could lead to the release of nitrate according to overall reaction 22 which allows the release of inorganic chloramines according to reactions 5 7 even though the formation of organic chloramines from urea reaction with active chlorine species is also feasible following general expressions 23 26 wojtowicz 2001 22 h2nconh2 4 h2o co2 2 no3 12 h 10 e 23 h2nconh2 hocl h2nconhcl h2o 24 h2nconhcl hocl clhnconhcl h2o 25 clhnconhcl hocl clhnconcl2 h2o 26 clhnconcl2 hocl cl2nconcl2 h2o de laat et al 2011 reported the release of nitrate from the reaction of urea in swimming pool with chlorine according to general expression 27 27 h2nconh2 8 hocl co2 2 hno3 8 hcl h2o the release of chloramine species was not ascertained by de laat et al 2011 but it was not excluded the authors pointed out that more studies to identify chloro ureas and inorganic chloramines were required to better understand the complex reaction pathways in order to elucidate the contribution of urea to the formation of disinfectant chloramines during the treatment of swimming pool water in this context the dems analysis during electrochlorination of urea solutions can contribute to the clarification of the role of urea in disinfection processes fig 6 depicts the mscv corresponding to the electrochemical incineration of urea in 0 5 m sodium perchlorate where the ionic current of m z 44 evidences the contribution of oh radical in the mineralization of urea at high potentials with a higher current density observed in comparison to other conditions due to the inert character of perchlorate as supporting electrolyte the electrogeneration of active chlorine species is avoided as discussed above when chloride is used as supporting electrolyte several differences are noticeable as can be seen in fig 6 the ionic current of m z 44 co2 is lower than that found for naclo4 an important feature is the drastic diminution of cl2 signal in presence of urea which indicates that cl2 is preferentially consumed for urea oxidation these results suggest that in presence of nacl as supporting electrolyte electrochlorination of urea is the preferred mechanism over electrochemical incineration mediated by oh radical 22 noteworthy is the identification of mono di and trichloramines from this result it can be deduced that the overall reaction 27 proposed by de laat et al 2011 is preceded by the formation of inorganic chloramines according reactions 28 30 where the release of di and trichloramine is favored subsequently the decomposition of these species may yield nitrogen and nitrate according to reactions 19 and 20 saunier and selleck 1979 crittenden et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 in agreement with the results reported by de laat et al 2011 28 h2nconh2 2 cl h2o co2 2 nh2cl 2 h 4 e 29 h2nconh2 4 cl h2o co2 2 nhcl2 4 h 8 e 30 h2nconh2 6 cl h2o co2 2 ncl3 6 h 12 e formation of inorganic chloramines from urea electrochlorination is for the very first time demonstrated by in situ dems measurements the identification of these species provides a key piece of understanding on mechanisms of urea oxidation by chlorine in order to better understand the electrogeneration of inorganic chloramines from urea the influence of different variables was systematically studied fig 7 depicts the mscv recorded during the electrolysis of 0 1 m urea at ph 7 0 in presence of different concentrations of nacl as supporting electrolyte as can be seen the increase in nacl concentration enhances considerably the release of chloramines as observed for nh4 nh3 solutions the results of fig 8 depict a depletion of the current density attained by the ionic current of m z 70 cl2 for increasing concentrations of urea in solution along with lower currents associated to chloramine species this trend suggests that the increased concentration of organic matter leads principally to intermediate states of chloro urea species from chlorination according reactions 23 26 before reaching the breakage of the c n bond yielding chloramines by means of reactions 28 30 furthermore these results demonstrate that the increase of urea concentration mitigates electrogeneration of inorganic chloramines being the ratio urea cl of great relevance on the overall efficiency of the process on the other hand the study of the influence of the ph denotes a completely different response than during the electrochlorination of ammonium chloride described in the previous section the ph during electrochlorination is of high relevance since conditions of the speciation of the chloramines see fig 4 and their formation are conditioned by the equilibria of nh3 nh4 pka 9 25 and hclo clo pka 7 55 however almost no effect of the ph is observed on the release of inorganic chloramines from urea as shown in fig 9 this different behavior can be explained by the different pathway involved on the formation of such species as discussed formerly the inorganic chloramines are formed from the cleavage of the c n bond of the urea after several chlorination steps 23 30 which only depend on the generation of active chlorine species it may be inferred from mscv analyses that previous electrochemical oxidation of urea by hydroxyl radical to release of ammonium followed by its electrochlorination cannot be considering the predominant pathway according to experimental evidence chloramine formation from yielded ammonium should be excluded the small effect of ph suggests that the oxidation of the urea is produced mainly by the electrogenerated cl2 which is independent of the ph the slight effect of ph can be attributed to hclo and clo when the electrolysis was conducted at ph 7 0 a slightly superior ion current density of m z 44 co2 is observed it should be remarked that at ph 7 0 hclo is the predominant species pka 7 55 whereas under other ph conditions clo is considered hence at ph 7 0 the urea can be easily oxidized by hclo due to the superior redox potential of this species eº 1 49 v vs she in comparison to the lesser oxidant character of clo eº 0 89 v vs she the lower response at ph 10 0 was explained by the easier oxidation of hydroxyl anions on the bdd surface oxygen evolution which occurs at lower potential competing with the oxidation of chloride anions martínez huitle et al 2008 koppenol et al 2010 mostafa et al 2018 3 3 matrix effects during the treatment of urine matrix and influence on the current efficiency thereafter the feasible demonstration of the electrochemical formation of inorganic chloramines from urea and the release of chloramines were studied during the electrolysis of a synthetic urine matrix antonin et al 2015 dbira et al 2015 it can be seen in fig 10 that the release of inorganic chloramines cannot be attained by the direct electrolysis of urine matrix the high content of urea consumes the electrogenerated chlorine releasing probably chloro urea species according to reactions 23 26 mscv depicts similar trends as those observed during the treatment of urea solution in 0 1 m of chloride see figs 7 and 8 in order to promote the cleavage of the n c bond the concentration of chloride was increased up to 0 5 m by the addition of nacl the increase of chloride anion in the urine matrix enhanced urea incineration cf fig 10 nevertheless lower amount of chloramines were yielded in comparison to urea solutions note that the mscv signal corresponded ca to half concentration which can be attributed to the competing consumption of electrons and hydroxyl radical by the other ionic species present in solution therefore the oxidation of sulfate to peroxodisulfate 31 or the oxidation of phosphate to peroxodiphosphate 32 can be considered panizza and cerisola 2009 sánchez et al 2013 as competing reactions 31 2 so4 2 s2o8 2 2 e 32 2 po4 3 p2o8 4 2 e the mscv results evidence the formation and release of chloramines during electrochemical oxidation on bdd anodes for the first time the electrogeneration of each individual chloramine species has been identified in situ the overall current efficiencies on their release were quantified from the experimental data and summarized in table 2 for the optimum conditions observed the efficiency of chloramines formation decreases as a function of the matrix as follows nh4cl urea synthetic urine matrix with ce values of 4 0 0 9 and 0 5 respectively for monochloramine the minor ce determined for cl2 in presence of urea reflects the major consumption of cl2 required to mineralize urea in solution therefore lower amounts of cl2 are quantified in the system another interesting feature is the considerable diminution in 2 fold of ce on co2 evolution from urea oxidation when the electrolysis is conducted in the simulated urine matrix from 19 0 down to 9 0 the scavenging effects of competing ionic species in the matrices play a fundamental role on the electrogeneration of these species therefore the generation of these disinfectant species in urine manures and brine was demonstrated to be of low relevance in this context the electrogeneration and contribution of chloramines in electrochemical oxidation should be considered of minor relevance in presence of organics that consume preferentially the chlorine active species undermining the yield of disinfectants 4 conclusions the formation of inorganic chloramines during electrochemical oxidation with bdd anodes has been assessed by on line dems analysis the efficient release of these highly disinfectant species is directly related to the initial nitrogen source being the yield of inorganic chloramines favored from the chlorination of ammonia the lower release of chloramines from urea is explained by the requirement of the previous chlorination of the molecule to propitiate the c n bond breakage since it has been demonstrated that chlorination mechanism is preferred to the oxidation mediated by oh radical the initial concentration of chloride and the solution ph were evaluated as key role parameters of influence on the release of chloramines in both cases electrochlorination of ammonia and urea solutions a marked increase on the indirect electrogeneration of chloramines associated to the major release of chlorine has been observed on the other hand the solution ph influenced the formation of chloramines from ammonia which indicates that the presence of nh3 in solution is required moreover an excessive alkaline ph demonstrated to be counterproductive due to the shift on oxygen evolution potential that inhibits the electrogeneration of the required active chlorine species on the other hand while urea is oxidized in a synthetic urine matrix it has been demonstrated that under natural conditions chloramines are not formed during the electrochemical oxidation processes because i the low concentrations of chloride and ii the competitive reactions of other ionic species in solution however a considerable increase on chloride concentration up to 0 5 m allows the release of inorganic chloramines due to the incineration of urea by electrogenerated active chlorine species these results contribute to the better understanding on the contribution of urea on the generation of inorganic chloramine as disinfectant species in waters and swimming pools it is important to remark that from the results observed the electrogeneration of chloramines in actual matrices with competitive species in solution could be of low relevance with current efficiencies below 0 5 conflicts of interest authors declare no conflict of interest declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

2004 yoshida et al 2018 a weaker tidal impact exerted by diurnal tidal fluctuation combined with the influence of diel light dark cycle might cause the contrasting observations in how viral and microbial communities respond to tidal stirring chauhan et al 2009 olapade 2011 yoshida et al 2018 therefore to precisely elucidate the tidal impact on viruses and microbes excluding completely the distraction of diel influences tidal samplings at three stations upper estuary lower estuary and coastal area along the macrotidal jiulong river estuary jre were conducted at fixed time daily during a consecutive half month to follow an entire spring neap tidal cycle the objectives were to i investigate the spring neap tidal patterns in viral and microbial abundances ii evaluate the coupling of viral lytic lysogenic properties and decay associated with bacterial production and community composition in the jre and iii explore the potential influence of viral life strategies induced by tidal mixing on the estuarine microbial food web the findings of this study might provide crucial insights into tidally driven estuarine viral and microbial dynamics and may help to predict the responses of virus microbe interactions to pressures such as increased riverine input projected for global climate change bauer et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling the jre located in

taxonomy was assigned in mothur v 1 36 1 using the silva 119 reference database quast et al 2013 schloss et al 2009 2 8 virus mediated bacterial mortality and carbon releasing the virus mediated bacterial mortality vmm was calculated by dividing lytic vp by burst sizes of 50 estimated from previous coastal measurement winget et al 2011 the carbon content of bacterial standing stock was calculated by heterotrophic bacterial abundance and the average marine bacterial cell content of carbon as a factor of 12 4 fg c cell 1 fukuda et al 1998 the rate of lysed bacterial carbon rlc and the rate of lysed bacterial produced carbon rlp were then estimated from dividing vmm by the bacterial abundance and bp respectively to estimate the carbon released by viral lysis of bacteria the vmm was multiplied by the average bacterial cell carbon content the carbon not released by viral lysogeny was also estimated by a similar method based on lysogenic vp with the assumption that lysogenic vp would be totally transferred into lytic vp and cause the lysis of bacteria 2 9 statistical analysis shapiro wilk w tests for data normality were applied before analysis and the data were logarithmically transformed to meet normality if necessary two way anova was used to determine the significant differences in environmental and biological parameters with respect to stations and spring neap tidal periods if significant differences were observed the post hoc tukey s test was also performed all statistical analyses described above were performed with spss 24 0 software spss inc

sample grouping of physico chemical parameters after normalizing the data redundancy analysis rda was performed to test whether the abundances and activities of viruses and microbes were related to environmental and biological variables using canoco 4 5 software microcomputer power usa the significance of the axes was determined by monte carlo permutation tests 3 results 3 1 tidal variability of the sampling environments three stations along the jre were sampled over a spring neap tidal cycle and the environmental and biological variables are reported in table s1 pca biplot based on physico chemical parameters distinguished the upper estuarine station s03 from the lower estuarine station s05 and coastal station s07 with s03 showed relatively low values for salinity ph and do but high nutrients fig 1c and table s1 salinity ph and do at all stations showed a significant tidal signature that peaked at spring tide but reached minimum at neap tide with a drastic variation at station s03 and moderate variation at stations s05 and s07 anova p 0 05 fig 2 and table s2 an inverse tidal pattern in nutrients was observed at all stations with a stronger change amplitude at station s03 although it is not statistically significant fig 2 and table s2 extremely low values of no 2 0 17 μmol l 1 and po 4 3 0 05 μmol l 1 were found at s03 at april 17 during the spring tide fig 2e and g in addition chl a concentration at s03 displayed a significant tidal variation with a higher value at spring tide anova p 0 001 fig 2i 3 2 viral and microbial abundances revealed tidal variability an apparent and similar tidal pattern among viral and microbial abundances was shared by three stations with a compatible amplitude anova p 0 01 fig 3 and table s2 viral abundance peaked during spring tide 8 48 0 33 106 ml 1 7 68 0 38 106 ml 1 and 8 13 0 10 106 ml 1 at s03 s05 and s07 respectively and then declined with tidal range to reach its minimum value near neap tide fig 3a the maximum of heterotrophic bacterial abundances was also recorded at spring tide fig 3b the virus to bacteria ratio during spring tide approximately doubled than the neap tide at all stations fig s2a the abundances of synechococcus and picoeukaryotes at three stations significantly increased with the tidal range anova p 0 01 fig 3c and d furthermore we observed that tidal variability of heterotrophic bacterial abundance was less pronounced than that of viral synechococcus and picoeukaryotic abundances especially at station s03 rda analysis revealed the concentrations of viruses heterotrophic bacteria synechococcus and picoeukaryotes were positively correlated with do ph and salinity but negatively correlated with nutrient levels pseudo f statistic p 0 05 fig 5 a and table s3 3 3 tidal variability in bacterial production viral infection and decay the rates of bp vd vp fic and flc were measured to investigate the dynamics of virus host interactions the highest bp at station s03 6 86 2 07 μg c l 1 d 1 occurred when spring tide appeared and the lowest value 3 11 0 22 μg c l 1 d 1 was recorded during neap tide showing a more distinct tide associated change than the lower estuarine station s05 and the coastal station s07 fig 3e estuarine stations s03 and s05 shared a similar spring neap tidal pattern for vd with the lowest values occurred during spring tide significantly increasing with the decrease in tidal range figs 3f and 6 a station s03 showed a more intense tidal change in both lytic and lysogenic viral infection rates a fic peak value 22 42 4 77 was recorded at april 17 during spring tide and two flc peak values were observed at april 4 18 82 3 89 and april 17 16 46 2 66 following spring tide fig 3g and h the dynamics of lytic and lysogenic vp at station s03 were similar to the changes in fic and flc resulting in higher total viral production occurred with the higher tidal range fig s2 the lysogeny to lysis ratio at three stations shared a similar tidal pattern that a significant higher value was usually recorded near neap tide anova p 0 05 fig 3i showing a significantly negative correlation with tidal range at s03 and s05 fig 6b rda analysis revealed the salinity ph do no 3 po 4 3 and heterotrophic bacterial abundance were significantly related to the dynamics of bp vd vp fic flc and the lysogeny to lysis ratio during spring neap cycle pseudo f statistic p 0 05 fig 5b and table s3 the tide associated lysogeny to lysis ratio had a strongly negative relationship with bp but was positively coupled to vd 3 4 tidal trends in bacterial community composition bacterial community composition was represented by 13 most abundant populations along with other bacterial members at class level according to their relative sequence abundances fig 4a different bacterial groups displayed distinct distributions and tidal variations across three stations for example betaproteobacteria the typical freshwater population paver et al 2018 riemann et al 2008 was more abundant at the upper estuarine station s03 coupled with the maximum relative abundance occurring during neap tide but bacteroidetes showed the inverse trend fig 4a spearman s rank correlation indicated that variations in certain bacterial populations were tightly associated with tidal range as well as viral heterotrophic bacterial abundances bp lytic and lysogenic viral infections particularly at station s03 fig 4b for instance when the high tidal range turned the hydrologic environment of s03 into a coastal like feature during spring tide the relative abundances of bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria were increased compared to the decreases in betaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia coupled with increases in viral and heterotrophic bacterial abundances but decrease in the lysogeny to lysis ratio 3 5 virus mediated bacterial mortality and carbon releasing showed tidal specialization at station s03 during spring tide vmm was 26 52 17 37 107 cells l 1 d 1 together with approximately 30 d 1 of rlc and 70 d 1 of rlp compared to ca fourfold lower values of vmm rlc and rlp at neap tide table 1 hence more carbon was released by viral lysis during spring tide 3 29 2 15 μg l 1 d 1 relative to the neap tide 0 74 0 002 μg l 1 d 1 at s03 the amount of carbon not released by viral lysogeny referred to the reduction in lysate carbon due to the establishment of lysogeny rather than lysis at s03 the amount of carbon not released by viral lysogeny during spring tide 3 24 1 83 μg l 1 d 1 was comparable with the carbon released by lysis but this amount during neap tide 1 88 0 43 μg l 1 d 1 was ca 2 3 times higher than lysis released carbon in fact the ratio of the amount of carbon released by viral lysis and not released by lysogeny was significantly positively correlated with tidal range at all stations indicating that organic carbon tended to be released into the environment from viral lysis rather than stored as bacterial biomass from neap to spring tide shifting fig 6c 4 discussion spring neap tidal dynamics of physico chemical variables were observed at all stations with the amplitude of the change decreased along the estuary from the upper estuarine station s03 to coastal station s07 and perfectly matched the dilution effect pattern wherein eutrophic fresh water was diluted by oligotrophic offshore seawater fig 2 although the samples among three stations were collected at different diurnal tidal phase e g high tide and low tide fig 1b viral and microbial abundances at all stations shared similar tidal patterns and amplitudes which oscillated synchronously more in relation to the spring neap tide than diurnal tide fig 3 these results suggested the sensitivity of viruses and microbes to spring neap tidal dynamic potentially confirming the primary tidal influence exerted by spring neap cycle over diurnal tide cadier et al 2017 heiss and michael 2014 future field work covers more than one entire spring neap tide along the estuarine habitat coupled with the corresponding diurnal sampling within each day might help to distinguish the impacts of spring neap tide and diurnal tide on microbial ecosystem the tidal trend in synechococcus and picoeukaryotic abundances that increased with tidal range can be predicted to match the previous results that the abundances of estuarine cyanobacteria and picoeukaryote generally increase with salinity jochem 2003 zhang et al 2013 however the observed viral and heterotrophic bacterial abundances fig 3a and b did not follow the dilution theory de brauwere et al 2011 koh et al 1994 that the viral and bacterial abundances may decrease from neap tide to spring tide since the eutrophic riverine water containing more microorganisms would be diluted at spring tide abu bakar et al 2017 almeida et al 2001 this tidal pattern implied that over the spring neap cycle the viral and microbial standing stocks and their controlling processes such as production mortality and decay were not exclusively driven by dilution between riverine water and seawater but rather by the adaption and internal feed back mechanisms among viral and microbial communities induced by niche partitioning from tidal mixing the dynamics of microbial community are regarded to under bottom up control resource availability and top down control viral lysis or protozoan grazing fuhrman et al 2015 menon et al 2003 winter et al 2010 our results showed that both the concentrations and productions of viruses and heterotrophic bacteria were not positively coupled with nutrients and chl a during tidal cycle fig 5 in fact their highest values at s03 occurred during spring tide with the relatively low nutrients figs 2 and 3 and fig s2 these results validated that in eutrophic estuarine coastal environments where are rich in terrigenous input the nutrients and primary production play a relatively weaker regulatory role in bacterial activities and the subsequent viral dynamics findlay et al 1991 iriarte et al 2003 mojica and brussaard 2014 weinbauer 2004 our results revealed that lysogenic viral infection and the lysogeny to lysis ratio were negatively related to bacterial abundance and production fig 5b this is consistent with previous finding that lytic viral infection prefers the metabolically active bacteria to produce more viral progeny whereas lysogeny favors lower bacterial abundance or activity maurice et al 2013 payet and suttle 2013 despite the presence of more riverine runoff derived nutrients during neap tide at s03 lower bp significantly contributed to lower bacterial abundance r2 0 695 p 0 005 linear regression suggesting the potential inhibition effect of bacterial metabolism at neap tide shen et al 2018 these results can be explained by that bacteria are sensitive to changes in ionic strength and the drastic variation in salinity during tidal cycle can trigger the shift in physiological stress on bacterial metabolic processes bettarel et al 2011b kukkaro and bamford 2009 wei et al 2019 freshwater bacteria were previously revealed to be greatly inhibited by seawater troussellier et al 2002 whereas marine bacteria showed relatively high adaptability to variation in salinity forsyth et al 1971 the freshwater bacteria dominated microbial community at neap tide suffered from high osmotic pressure which restricted their metabolic activity to use energy consuming mechanisms to maintain the osmotic balance in their cells instead of using this energy for cell division bettarel et al 2011b during spring tide metabolism in the marine bacteria dominated microbial community was stimulated by efficient substrate utilization increasing the bacterial abundance and subsequent lytic viral production and viral abundance fig 3 viral production and the counterbalancing loss from viral decay jointly determine the net balance of viral abundance over tidal cycle similar to their host the realized niche of viruses would be constrained by salinity since salt stress may directly affect their survival and successful infection wei et al 2019 potentially through decrease in capsid pressure and consequent reduction in dna injection efficiency cordova et al 2003 evilevitch et al 2008 viruses have been found to require adequate ionic strength e g na and mg2 to maintain structural stability and remain successful infectivity to host keynan et al 1974 mojica and brussaard 2014 demonstrating that a higher salt concentration usually promotes viral adsorption and subsequent infection bettarel et al 2011a mei et al 2015 these can explain the significantly negative relationship between viral decay rate and tidal range at estuarine stations s03 and s05 fig 6a which reflected higher viral losses induced by the infective inefficiency and high particle decomposition resulting from low salinity at neap tide mojica and brussaard 2014 wei et al 2019 in turn lower viral decay coupled with higher lytic viral activity led to higher net production of viral particles at spring tide fig 3 and fig s2 determining the budget for viral abundance over tidal cycle with higher values recorded at spring tide but lower during neap tide there was a strong negative association between the lysogeny to lysis ratio and tidal range at s03 and s05 with a significant higher lysogeny to lysis ratio in response to lower levels of bacterial productivity and abundance but higher viral decay at neap tide figs 5 and 6 previous studies have indicated that viruses prefer to integrate within bacteria favouring a lysogenic life cycle to avoid further destruction when facing high viral decay mojica and brussaard 2014 weinbauer 2004 additionally viral lytic lysogenic switch was generally constrained by bacterial metabolism that greatly impacted by surrounding environmental conditions maurice et al 2010b owing to viruses rely heavily on the hosts being healthy enough to complete their lytic cycle e g the synthesis of offspring particle constituents mei et al 2015 for example the marine temperate phage ϕhsic was found to enter the lysogenic life cycle due to a reduction in its host s growth rate at low salinity williamson and paul 2006 indeed host hsic 1a cells growing at low salinity were found to produced ca two orders of magnitude fewer phages than those growing at high salinity long et al 2007 the low metabolic activities of microbes under high osmotic stress from spring to neap tide shifting may limit their susceptibility to lytic viral infection causing the viral infection switching from lytic to lysogenic cycle and thus the higher values of the lysogeny to lysis ratio at neap tide lysogeny is generally considered as the favorable viral survival strategy during episodes of low energy resources paul 2008 weinbauer 2004 indeed the lysogeny to lysis ratio was significantly negative with heterotrophic bacterial abundance over spring neap tidal cycle in the jre r2 0 308 p 0 01 linear regression suggesting that the high density of microbes at spring tide did not drive viral lytic to lysogenic switching knowles et al 2016 ultimately the harsh environmental conditions facing drastic tidal forcing resulted in lower bacterial activities and tended to drive the viral infection switching towards lysogeny unlike seasonal patterns in viral lysis and lysogeny were usually driven by the trophic status brum et al 2016 payet and suttle 2013 tidal stirring generating fast changing in surrounding habitat would trigger a highly variable amplitude in the host bacteria s eco physiological parameters which might greatly influence the patterns in lysis lysogeny switch over tidal cycle maurice et al 2013 2010a the tidal shift in viral life strategies in conjunction with change in high viral decay led to the lower viral lytic activities and bacterial mortality which would help both virus and host survive at neap tide paul 2008 the tidal transition in bacterial community composition may also affect the viral infection pattern since host phylogeny has been found to be tightly related to the viral life strategies keshri et al 2017 kim and bae 2018 maurice et al 2010b tidal disturbances might act as a filter for bacterial community adaptions resulting in the loss of some species but the activation of others among freshwater and seawater bacterial populations chauhan et al 2009 spearman rank correlation revealed that lysogenic viral infection and the lysogeny to lysis ratio at station s03 generally increased along with the increases in certain bacterial populations such as betaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia that were previously confirmed as the typical freshwater species paver et al 2018 riemann et al 2008 but showed negative correlations with bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria fig 4b these results suggested that viral lytic and lysogenic properties may be contributed partially by the change in viral infection ability induced by tidal shift in freshwater and marine microbial communities the co existence of freshwater and marine viruses has been found in the jre cai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 previous studies have also revealed that the freshwater viral community might be able to efficiently infect marine hosts whereas the freshwater microbes did not act as good hosts for the marine viruses bonilla findji et al 2009 xu et al 2014 consequently the reduced infection efficiency due to the marine viruses to freshwater bacterial members would also be a potential factor causing the higher level of lysogeny during neap tide than during spring tide 4 1 implicates to estuarine carbon cycle tidal dynamics of viral lysis and lysogeny were highly variable at the upper estuarine station s03 resulting in higher carbon released by lysis during spring tide than neap tide table 1 this high viral lysis at spring tide enhanced the transfer of microbial biomass into the pool of dissolved organic matter and diverted organic matter flow away from higher trophic levels thus accelerating the transformation of carbon from particulate e g living organisms to dissolved states fuhrman 1999 jiao et al 2010 the ratio of carbon released by viral lysis and not released by lysogeny significantly increased with tidal range at all stations fig 6c indicating lysogeny would lower the efficiency of viral shunt and keep more carbon flux within microbial biomass at neap tide channeling most of the carbon to higher trophic levels in the food web wommack and colwell 2000 totally we found lysogeny reduce 1 64 1 21 μg l 1 d 1 carbon into environmental carbon pool in jre table 1 which was higher than the amount released by lysis 1 36 1 22 μg l 1 d 1 overall our findings indicated that the differential virus mediated carbon flux induced by lysis lysogeny switch and by tidal shifting over spring neap cycle neglected so far must be accounted in the modelling of the microbial food web and biogeochemical processes in estuarine coastal systems sheyn et al 2018 5 conclusions taken together this study presented a comprehensive assessment of estuarine viral and microbial dynamics over an entire spring neap tidal cycle as summarized in fig 7 we demonstrated that an apparent spring neap tidal pattern in viral and microbial abundances was recorded with relatively higher abundances observed at spring tide compared to neap tide tidal dynamics in viral and microbial communities were shaped by viral lysis lysogeny switch induced by tidal mixing with higher level of lysogeny at neap tide compared to the higher level of lysis at spring tide the switched viral life strategies during spring neap tidal cycle would cause an intense influence on microbial food web and carbon cycle in the estuarine ecosystems author contributions rz and ww initiated and

18729,microbes drive ecosystems and their viruses manipulate these processes yet the importance of tidal functioning on the estuarine viruses and microbes remains poorly elucidated here an integrative investigation on tidal patterns in viral and microbial communities and their inherent interactions over an entire spring neap tidal cycle was conducted along a macrotidal subtropical estuary the viral and microbial abundances oscillated significantly over the tidal cycle with relatively higher abundances observed at spring tide compared to neap tide the distinct tidal dynamic patterns in bacterial production and community composition were tightly associated with the variations in viral infection production and decay revealing the tide driven interactions between viruses and microbes concurrent with the higher viral decay but lower bacterial abundance and inhibited bacterial metabolism during the neap tide lower gross viral production was coupled with a synchronous switching from viral lytic to lysogenic infection induced by the loss of viral infection efficiency and the transition from marine to freshwater bacterial populations triggered by tidal mixing our results highlighted the major

genetic and ecological adaptations for both viruses and microbes maurice et al 2010b patterns in viral life strategies were previously revealed to be driven by the metabolic activities of their hosts that impacted by trophic level in which lytic production tends to prevailed during the high productivity season while lysogeny usually occurred with a limited resource availability brum et al 2016

inherent virus host interactions e g lysis lysogeny switch jasna et al 2017 maurice et al 2013 mojica and brussaard 2014 wei et al 2019 however information about the tidal impact on estuarine viral and microbial dynamics is scarce anderson et al 2018 celussi et al 2008 hyun et al 1999 most studies were conducted in microtidal estuaries harboring a relatively lower tidal amplitude and often over a single day santos et al 2009 yoshida et al 2018 previous studies have found that it is the spring neap tidal cycle rather than the diurnal tidal stirring that primarily influences the estuarine physical and chemical properties primary production and other biological processes through vertical stratification and water movement induced by tidal mixing cadier et al 2017 heiss and michael 2014 additionally diel cycle studies showed a dramatic change in viral and microbial activities over the course of a single day aylward et al 2017 bettarel et al 2002 winget and wommack 2009 winter et al 2004 yoshida et al 2018 a weaker tidal impact exerted by diurnal tidal fluctuation combined with the influence of diel light dark cycle might cause the contrasting observations in how viral and microbial communities respond to tidal stirring chauhan et al 2009 olapade 2011 yoshida et al 2018 therefore to precisely elucidate the tidal impact on viruses and microbes excluding completely the distraction of diel influences tidal samplings at three stations upper estuary lower estuary and coastal area along the macrotidal jiulong river estuary jre were conducted at fixed time daily during a consecutive half month to follow an entire spring neap tidal cycle the objectives were to i investigate the spring neap tidal patterns in viral and microbial abundances ii evaluate the coupling of viral lytic lysogenic properties and decay associated with bacterial production and community composition in the jre and iii explore the potential influence of viral life strategies induced by tidal mixing on the estuarine microbial food web the findings of this study might provide crucial insights into tidally driven estuarine viral and microbial dynamics and may help to predict the responses of virus microbe interactions to pressures such as increased riverine input projected for global climate change bauer et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling the jre located in the northern south china sea is a subtropical macrotidal estuary tides in the jre are predominately semi diurnal with a mean tidal range of 4 08 m varying from 1 0 m to 6 42 m huang and hong 1999 zuo

taxonomy was assigned in mothur v 1 36 1 using the silva 119 reference database quast et al 2013 schloss et al 2009 2 8 virus mediated bacterial mortality and carbon releasing the virus mediated bacterial mortality vmm was calculated by dividing lytic vp by burst sizes of 50 estimated from previous coastal measurement winget et al 2011 the carbon content of bacterial standing stock was calculated by heterotrophic bacterial abundance and the average marine bacterial cell content of carbon as a factor of 12 4 fg c cell 1 fukuda et al 1998 the rate of lysed bacterial carbon rlc and the rate of lysed bacterial produced carbon rlp were then estimated from dividing vmm by the bacterial abundance and bp respectively to estimate the carbon released by viral lysis of bacteria the vmm was multiplied by the average bacterial cell carbon content the carbon not released by viral lysogeny was also estimated by a similar method based on lysogenic vp with the assumption that lysogenic vp would be totally transferred into lytic vp and cause the lysis of bacteria 2 9 statistical analysis shapiro wilk w tests for data normality were applied before analysis and the data were logarithmically transformed to meet normality if necessary two way anova was used to determine the significant differences in environmental and biological parameters with respect to stations and spring neap tidal periods if significant differences were observed the post hoc tukey s test was also performed all statistical analyses described above were performed with spss 24 0 software spss inc

sample grouping of physico chemical parameters after normalizing the data redundancy analysis rda was performed to test whether the abundances and activities of viruses and microbes were related to environmental and biological variables using canoco 4 5 software microcomputer power usa the significance of the axes was determined by monte carlo permutation tests 3 results 3 1 tidal variability of the sampling environments three stations along the jre were sampled over a spring neap tidal cycle and the environmental and biological variables are reported in table s1 pca biplot based on physico chemical parameters distinguished the upper estuarine station s03 from the lower estuarine station s05 and coastal station s07 with s03 showed relatively low values for salinity ph and do but high nutrients fig 1c and table s1 salinity ph and do at all stations showed a significant tidal signature that peaked at spring tide but reached minimum at neap tide with a drastic variation at station s03 and moderate variation at stations s05 and s07 anova p 0 05 fig 2 and table s2 an inverse tidal pattern in nutrients was observed at all stations with a stronger change amplitude at station s03 although it is not statistically significant fig 2 and table s2 extremely low values of no 2 0 17 μmol l 1 and po 4 3 0 05 μmol l 1 were found at s03 at april 17 during the spring tide fig 2e and g in addition chl a concentration at s03 displayed a significant tidal variation with a higher value at spring tide anova p 0 001 fig 2i 3 2 viral and microbial abundances revealed tidal variability an apparent and similar tidal pattern among viral and microbial abundances was shared by three stations with a compatible amplitude anova p 0 01 fig 3 and table s2 viral abundance peaked during spring tide 8 48 0 33 106 ml 1 7 68 0 38 106 ml 1 and 8 13 0 10 106 ml 1 at s03 s05 and s07 respectively and then declined with tidal range to reach its minimum value near neap tide fig 3a the maximum of heterotrophic bacterial abundances was also recorded at spring tide fig 3b the virus to bacteria ratio during spring tide approximately doubled than the neap tide at all stations fig s2a the abundances of synechococcus and picoeukaryotes at three stations significantly increased with the tidal range anova p 0 01 fig 3c and d furthermore we observed that tidal variability of heterotrophic bacterial abundance was less pronounced than that of viral synechococcus and picoeukaryotic abundances especially at station s03 rda analysis revealed the concentrations of viruses heterotrophic bacteria synechococcus and picoeukaryotes were positively correlated with do ph and salinity but negatively correlated with nutrient levels pseudo f statistic p 0 05 fig 5 a and table s3 3 3 tidal variability in bacterial production viral infection and decay the rates of bp vd vp fic and flc were measured to investigate the dynamics of virus host interactions the highest bp at station s03 6 86 2 07 μg c l 1 d 1 occurred when spring tide appeared and the lowest value 3 11 0 22 μg c l 1 d 1 was recorded during neap tide showing a more distinct tide associated change than the lower estuarine station s05 and the coastal station s07 fig 3e estuarine stations s03 and s05 shared a similar spring neap tidal pattern for vd with the lowest values occurred during spring tide significantly increasing with the decrease in tidal range figs 3f and 6 a station s03 showed a more intense tidal change in both lytic and lysogenic viral infection rates a fic peak value 22 42 4 77 was recorded at april 17 during spring tide and two flc peak values were observed at april 4 18 82 3 89 and april 17 16 46 2 66 following spring tide fig 3g and h the dynamics of lytic and lysogenic vp at station s03 were similar to the changes in fic and flc resulting in higher total viral production occurred with the higher tidal range fig s2 the lysogeny to lysis ratio at three stations shared a similar tidal pattern that a significant higher value was usually recorded near neap tide anova p 0 05 fig 3i showing a significantly negative correlation with tidal range at s03 and s05 fig 6b rda analysis revealed the salinity ph do no 3 po 4 3 and heterotrophic bacterial abundance were significantly related to the dynamics of bp vd vp fic flc and the lysogeny to lysis ratio during spring neap cycle pseudo f statistic p 0 05 fig 5b and table s3 the tide associated lysogeny to lysis ratio had a strongly negative relationship with bp but was positively coupled to vd 3 4 tidal trends in bacterial community composition bacterial community composition was represented by 13 most abundant populations along with other bacterial members at class level according to their relative sequence abundances fig 4a different bacterial groups displayed distinct distributions and tidal variations across three stations for example betaproteobacteria the typical freshwater population paver et al 2018 riemann et al 2008 was more abundant at the upper estuarine station s03 coupled with the maximum relative abundance occurring during neap tide but bacteroidetes showed the inverse trend fig 4a spearman s rank correlation indicated that variations in certain bacterial populations were tightly associated with tidal range as well as viral heterotrophic bacterial abundances bp lytic and lysogenic viral infections particularly at station s03 fig 4b for instance when the high tidal range turned the hydrologic environment of s03 into a coastal like feature during spring tide the relative abundances of bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria were increased compared to the decreases in betaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia coupled with increases in viral and heterotrophic bacterial abundances but decrease in the lysogeny to lysis ratio 3 5 virus mediated bacterial mortality and carbon releasing showed tidal specialization at station s03 during spring tide vmm was 26 52 17 37 107 cells l 1 d 1 together with approximately 30 d 1 of rlc and 70 d 1 of rlp compared to ca fourfold lower values of vmm rlc and rlp at neap tide table 1 hence more carbon was released by viral lysis during spring tide 3 29 2 15 μg l 1 d 1 relative to the neap tide 0 74 0 002 μg l 1 d 1 at s03 the amount of carbon not released by viral lysogeny referred to the reduction in lysate carbon due to the establishment of lysogeny rather than lysis at s03 the amount of carbon not released by viral lysogeny during spring tide 3 24 1 83 μg l 1 d 1 was comparable with the carbon released by lysis but this amount during neap tide 1 88 0 43 μg l 1 d 1 was ca 2 3 times higher than lysis released carbon in fact the ratio of the amount of carbon released by viral lysis and not released by lysogeny was significantly positively correlated with tidal range at all stations indicating that organic carbon tended to be released into the environment from viral lysis rather than stored as bacterial biomass from neap to spring tide shifting fig 6c 4 discussion spring neap tidal dynamics of physico chemical variables were observed at all stations with the amplitude of the change decreased along the estuary from the upper estuarine station s03 to coastal station s07 and perfectly matched the dilution effect pattern wherein eutrophic fresh water was diluted by oligotrophic offshore seawater fig 2 although the samples among three stations were collected at different diurnal tidal phase e g high tide and low tide fig 1b viral and microbial abundances at all stations shared similar tidal patterns and amplitudes which oscillated synchronously more in relation to the spring neap tide than diurnal tide fig 3 these results suggested the sensitivity of viruses and microbes to spring neap tidal dynamic potentially confirming the primary tidal influence exerted by spring neap cycle over diurnal tide cadier et al 2017 heiss and michael 2014 future field work covers more than one entire spring neap tide along the estuarine habitat coupled with the corresponding diurnal sampling within each day might help to distinguish the impacts of spring neap tide and diurnal tide on microbial ecosystem the tidal trend in synechococcus and picoeukaryotic abundances that increased with tidal range can be predicted to match the previous results that the abundances of estuarine cyanobacteria and picoeukaryote generally increase with salinity jochem 2003 zhang et al 2013 however the observed viral and heterotrophic bacterial abundances fig 3a and b did not follow the dilution theory de brauwere et al 2011 koh et al 1994 that the viral and bacterial abundances may decrease from neap tide to spring tide since the eutrophic riverine water containing more microorganisms would be diluted at spring tide abu bakar et al 2017 almeida et al 2001 this tidal pattern implied that over the spring neap cycle the viral and microbial standing stocks and their controlling processes such as production mortality and decay were not exclusively driven by dilution between riverine water and seawater but rather by the adaption and internal feed back mechanisms among viral and microbial communities induced by niche partitioning from tidal mixing the dynamics of microbial community are regarded to under bottom up control resource availability and top down control viral lysis or protozoan grazing fuhrman et al 2015 menon et al 2003 winter et al 2010 our results showed that both the concentrations and productions of viruses and heterotrophic bacteria were not positively coupled with nutrients and chl a during tidal cycle fig 5 in fact their highest values at s03 occurred during spring tide with the relatively low nutrients figs 2 and 3 and fig s2 these results validated that in eutrophic estuarine coastal environments where are rich in terrigenous input the nutrients and primary production play a relatively weaker regulatory role in bacterial activities and the subsequent viral dynamics findlay et al 1991 iriarte et al 2003 mojica and brussaard 2014 weinbauer 2004 our results revealed that lysogenic viral infection and the lysogeny to lysis ratio were negatively related to bacterial abundance and production fig 5b this is consistent with previous finding that lytic viral infection prefers the metabolically active bacteria to produce more viral progeny whereas lysogeny favors lower bacterial abundance or activity maurice et al 2013 payet and suttle 2013 despite the presence of more riverine runoff derived nutrients during neap tide at s03 lower bp significantly contributed to lower bacterial abundance r2 0 695 p 0 005 linear regression suggesting the potential inhibition effect of bacterial metabolism at neap tide shen et al 2018 these results can be explained by that bacteria are sensitive to changes in ionic strength and the drastic variation in salinity during tidal cycle can trigger the shift in physiological stress on bacterial metabolic processes bettarel et al 2011b kukkaro and bamford 2009 wei et al 2019 freshwater bacteria were previously revealed to be greatly inhibited by seawater troussellier et al 2002 whereas marine bacteria showed relatively high adaptability to variation in salinity forsyth et al 1971 the freshwater bacteria dominated microbial community at neap tide suffered from high osmotic pressure which restricted their metabolic activity to use energy consuming mechanisms to maintain the osmotic balance in their cells instead of using this energy for cell division bettarel et al 2011b during spring tide metabolism in the marine bacteria dominated microbial community was stimulated by efficient substrate utilization increasing the bacterial abundance and subsequent lytic viral production and viral abundance fig 3 viral production and the counterbalancing loss from viral decay jointly determine the net balance of viral abundance over tidal cycle similar to their host the realized niche of viruses would be constrained by salinity since salt stress may directly affect their survival and successful infection wei et al 2019 potentially through decrease in capsid pressure and consequent reduction in dna injection efficiency cordova et al 2003 evilevitch et al 2008 viruses have been found to require adequate ionic strength e g na and mg2 to maintain structural stability and remain successful infectivity to host keynan et al 1974 mojica and brussaard 2014 demonstrating that a higher salt concentration usually promotes viral adsorption and subsequent infection bettarel et al 2011a mei et al 2015 these can explain the significantly negative relationship between viral decay rate and tidal range at estuarine stations s03 and s05 fig 6a which reflected higher viral losses induced by the infective inefficiency and high particle decomposition resulting from low salinity at neap tide mojica and brussaard 2014 wei et al 2019 in turn lower viral decay coupled with higher lytic viral activity led to higher net production of viral particles at spring tide fig 3 and fig s2 determining the budget for viral abundance over tidal cycle with higher values recorded at spring tide but lower during neap tide there was a strong negative association between the lysogeny to lysis ratio and tidal range at s03 and s05 with a significant higher lysogeny to lysis ratio in response to lower levels of bacterial productivity and abundance but higher viral decay at neap tide figs 5 and 6 previous studies have indicated that viruses prefer to integrate within bacteria favouring a lysogenic life cycle to avoid further destruction when facing high viral decay mojica and brussaard 2014 weinbauer 2004 additionally viral lytic lysogenic switch was generally constrained by bacterial metabolism that greatly impacted by surrounding environmental conditions maurice et al 2010b owing to viruses rely heavily on the hosts being healthy enough to complete their lytic cycle e g the synthesis of offspring particle constituents mei et al 2015 for example the marine temperate phage ϕhsic was found to enter the lysogenic life cycle due to a reduction in its host s growth rate at low salinity williamson and paul 2006 indeed host hsic 1a cells growing at low salinity were found to produced ca two orders of magnitude fewer phages than those growing at high salinity long et al 2007 the low metabolic activities of microbes under high osmotic stress from spring to neap tide shifting may limit their susceptibility to lytic viral infection causing the viral infection switching from lytic to lysogenic cycle and thus the higher values of the lysogeny to lysis ratio at neap tide lysogeny is generally considered as the favorable viral survival strategy during episodes of low energy resources paul 2008 weinbauer 2004 indeed the lysogeny to lysis ratio was significantly negative with heterotrophic bacterial abundance over spring neap tidal cycle in the jre r2 0 308 p 0 01 linear regression suggesting that the high density of microbes at spring tide did not drive viral lytic to lysogenic switching knowles et al 2016 ultimately the harsh environmental conditions facing drastic tidal forcing resulted in lower bacterial activities and tended to drive the viral infection switching towards lysogeny unlike seasonal patterns in viral lysis and lysogeny were usually driven by the trophic status brum et al 2016 payet and suttle 2013 tidal stirring generating fast changing in surrounding habitat would trigger a highly variable amplitude in the host bacteria s eco physiological parameters which might greatly influence the patterns in lysis lysogeny switch over tidal cycle maurice et al 2013 2010a the tidal shift in viral life strategies in conjunction with change in high viral decay led to the lower viral lytic activities and bacterial mortality which would help both virus and host survive at neap tide paul 2008 the tidal transition in bacterial community composition may also affect the viral infection pattern since host phylogeny has been found to be tightly related to the viral life strategies keshri et al 2017 kim and bae 2018 maurice et al 2010b tidal disturbances might act as a filter for bacterial community adaptions resulting in the loss of some species but the activation of others among freshwater and seawater bacterial populations chauhan et al 2009 spearman rank correlation revealed that lysogenic viral infection and the lysogeny to lysis ratio at station s03 generally increased along with the increases in certain bacterial populations such as betaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia that were previously confirmed as the typical freshwater species paver et al 2018 riemann et al 2008 but showed negative correlations with bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria fig 4b these results suggested that viral lytic and lysogenic properties may be contributed partially by the change in viral infection ability induced by tidal shift in freshwater and marine microbial communities the co existence of freshwater and marine viruses has been found in the jre cai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 previous studies have also revealed that the freshwater viral community might be able to efficiently infect marine hosts whereas the freshwater microbes did not act as good hosts for the marine viruses bonilla findji et al 2009 xu et al 2014 consequently the reduced infection efficiency due to the marine viruses to freshwater bacterial members would also be a potential factor causing the higher level of lysogeny during neap tide than during spring tide 4 1 implicates to estuarine carbon cycle tidal dynamics of viral lysis and lysogeny were highly variable at the upper estuarine station s03 resulting in higher carbon released by lysis during spring tide than neap tide table 1 this high viral lysis at spring tide enhanced the transfer of microbial biomass into the pool of dissolved organic matter and diverted organic matter flow away from higher trophic levels thus accelerating the transformation of carbon from particulate e g living organisms to dissolved states fuhrman 1999 jiao et al 2010 the ratio of carbon released by viral lysis and not released by lysogeny significantly increased with tidal range at all stations fig 6c indicating lysogeny would lower the efficiency of viral shunt and keep more carbon flux within microbial biomass at neap tide channeling most of the carbon to higher trophic levels in the food web wommack and colwell 2000 totally we found lysogeny reduce 1 64 1 21 μg l 1 d 1 carbon into environmental carbon pool in jre table 1 which was higher than the amount released by lysis 1 36 1 22 μg l 1 d 1 overall our findings indicated that the differential virus mediated carbon flux induced by lysis lysogeny switch and by tidal shifting over spring neap cycle neglected so far must be accounted in the modelling of the microbial food web and biogeochemical processes in estuarine coastal systems sheyn et al 2018 5 conclusions taken together this study presented a comprehensive assessment of estuarine viral and microbial dynamics over an entire spring neap tidal cycle as summarized in fig 7 we demonstrated that an apparent spring neap tidal pattern in viral and microbial abundances was recorded with relatively higher abundances observed at spring tide compared to neap tide tidal dynamics in viral and microbial communities were shaped by viral lysis lysogeny switch induced by tidal mixing with higher level of lysogeny at neap tide compared to the higher level of lysis at spring tide the switched viral life strategies during spring neap tidal cycle would cause an intense influence on microbial food web and carbon cycle in the estuarine ecosystems author contributions rz and ww initiated and
